### [1] [Enhancing Maritime Object Detection in Real-Time with RT-DETR and Data Augmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07346)
*Nader Nemati*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A real-time maritime object detector based on RT-DETR enhanced with augmented synthetic data and a domain-aware weighting strategy, achieving robust small-target detection with adjustable speed-accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Maritime scenes have small objects and limited labeled real RGB data; bridging domain gap with synthetic augmentation while maintaining real-time performance is essential.

Method: Extend RT-DETR with a multi-scale feature fusion module, uncertainty-minimizing query selection, and a synthetic-real sample weighting scheme; apply data augmentation for class balance; deliver a full Python pipeline; conduct component ablation to quantify contributions; preserve end-to-end DETR set prediction and allow speed-accuracy trade-offs.

Result: Improved detection of small, low-contrast vessels; robustness under extreme lighting/sea conditions; real-time performance preserved; inference speed/accuracy adjustable; ablation demonstrates the contribution of each module.

Conclusion: The integration of synthetic augmentation with DETR-based architecture is effective for maritime detection, providing modular components with measurable impact and a practical, real-time pipeline, along with guidance on module interactions and failure handling.

Abstract: Maritime object detection faces essential challenges due to the small target
size and limitations of labeled real RGB data. This paper will present a
real-time object detection system based on RT-DETR, enhanced by employing
augmented synthetic images while strictly evaluating on real data. This study
employs RT-DETR for the maritime environment by combining multi-scale feature
fusion, uncertainty-minimizing query selection, and smart weight between
synthetic and real training samples. The fusion module in DETR enhances the
detection of small, low-contrast vessels, query selection focuses on the most
reliable proposals, and the weighting strategy helps reduce the visual gap
between synthetic and real domains. This design preserves DETR's refined
end-to-end set prediction while allowing users to adjust between speed and
accuracy at inference time. Data augmentation techniques were also used to
balance the different classes of the dataset to improve the robustness and
accuracy of the model. Regarding this study, a full Python robust maritime
detection pipeline is delivered that maintains real-time performance even under
practical limits. It also verifies how each module contributes, and how the
system handles failures in extreme lighting or sea conditions. This study also
includes a component analysis to quantify the contribution of each
architectural module and explore its interactions.

### [2] [DynamicEval: Rethinking Evaluation for Dynamic Text-to-Video Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07441)
*Nithin C. Babu,Aniruddha Mahapatra,Harsh Rangwani,Rajiv Soundararajan,Kuldeep Kulkarni*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DynamicEval is a dynamic-motion T2V benchmark with new background and foreground consistency metrics, showing stronger human-aligned evaluation than existing benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing text-to-video benchmarks focus on static or subject-centric prompts and aggregate video-level judgments into a single model score, ignoring the importance of video-level quality and dynamic camera motion.

Method: Introduce DynamicEval with prompts emphasizing dynamic camera motion, 45k human annotations on 3k videos from 10 T2V models. Develop background consistency metric based on corrected VBench motion smoothness using object error maps, and a foreground consistency metric that tracks points and neighbors within object instances. Evaluate correlations with human preferences at video and model levels.

Result: Proposed metrics show stronger correlation with human judgments than VBench-based motion smoothness alone, improving alignment by over 2 percentage points at both video and model levels, demonstrating DynamicEval as a more comprehensive benchmark for dynamic T2V evaluation.

Conclusion: DynamicEval addresses dynamic-cam motion gaps in T2V evaluation by introducing video-level, dynamic-motion-focused metrics, enabling more reliable model ranking and better guidance for developing cinematic T2V systems.

Abstract: Existing text-to-video (T2V) evaluation benchmarks, such as VBench and
EvalCrafter, suffer from two limitations. (i) While the emphasis is on
subject-centric prompts or static camera scenes, camera motion essential for
producing cinematic shots and existing metrics under dynamic motion are largely
unexplored. (ii) These benchmarks typically aggregate video-level scores into a
single model-level score for ranking generative models. Such aggregation,
however, overlook video-level evaluation, which is vital to selecting the
better video among the candidate videos generated for a given prompt. To
address these gaps, we introduce DynamicEval, a benchmark consisting of
systematically curated prompts emphasizing dynamic camera motion, paired with
45k human annotations on video pairs from 3k videos generated by ten T2V
models. DynamicEval evaluates two key dimensions of video quality: background
scene consistency and foreground object consistency. For background scene
consistency, we obtain the interpretable error maps based on the Vbench motion
smoothness metric. We observe that while the Vbench motion smoothness metric
shows promising alignment with human judgments, it fails in two cases:
occlusions/disocclusions arising from camera and foreground object movements.
Building on this, we propose a new background consistency metric that leverages
object error maps to correct two failure cases in a principled manner. Our
second innovation is the introduction of a foreground consistency metric that
tracks points and their neighbors within each object instance to assess object
fidelity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed metrics achieve
stronger correlations with human preferences at both the video level and the
model level (an improvement of more than 2% points), establishing DynamicEval
as a more comprehensive benchmark for evaluating T2V models under dynamic
camera motion.

### [3] [Provably Accelerated Imaging with Restarted Inertia and Score-based Image Priors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07470)
*Marien Renaud,Julien Hermant,Deliang Wei,Yu Sun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RISP extends RED with restarted inertia and score-based priors to achieve faster convergence and high-quality image recovery in ill-posed inverse problems; it proves faster stationary-point convergence than RED without convexity, links to the heavy-ball ODE, and shows strong empirical performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ill-posed imaging inverse problems require reconstructions that are both high-quality and obtained quickly. While RED provides powerful priors through denoising, it often relies on heuristics for acceleration. There is a need for a principled method that accelerates convergence while leveraging powerful priors.

Method: Introduce Restarted Inertia with Score-based Priors (RISP), a principled extension of RED. RISP adds a restarting inertia mechanism to accelerate convergence and employs score-based image priors to preserve reconstruction quality. The paper analyzes convergence, showing a faster stationary-point rate than RED without requiring convexity, and derives a continuous-time dynamical system linked to the heavy-ball ODE.

Result: Theoretical analysis demonstrates that RISP achieves a faster stationary-point convergence rate than RED even when the image prior is non-convex. A continuous-time dynamical system is derived, illuminating connections between RISP and the heavy-ball ODE. Empirical experiments across various imaging inverse problems show that RISP delivers rapid convergence while maintaining high-quality reconstructions.

Conclusion: RISP offers a principled framework that marries fast convergence with high-quality image recovery by extending RED with restart-inertia and score-based priors. It provides theoretical guarantees (accelerated stationary-point convergence) and a continuous-time interpretation (relation to heavy-ball dynamics), supported by empirical results across inverse problems. This approach broadens the applicability of priors in ill-posed imaging while avoiding convexity requirements and suggests avenues for parameter tuning and broader priors.

Abstract: Fast convergence and high-quality image recovery are two essential features
of algorithms for solving ill-posed imaging inverse problems. Existing methods,
such as regularization by denoising (RED), often focus on designing
sophisticated image priors to improve reconstruction quality, while leaving
convergence acceleration to heuristics. To bridge the gap, we propose Restarted
Inertia with Score-based Priors (RISP) as a principled extension of RED. RISP
incorporates a restarting inertia for fast convergence, while still allowing
score-based image priors for high-quality reconstruction. We prove that RISP
attains a faster stationary-point convergence rate than RED, without requiring
the convexity of the image prior. We further derive and analyze the associated
continuous-time dynamical system, offering insight into the connection between
RISP and the heavy-ball ordinary differential equation (ODE). Experiments
across a range of imaging inverse problems demonstrate that RISP enables fast
convergence while achieving high-quality reconstructions.

### [4] [A Denoising Framework for Real-World Ultra-Low Dose Lung CT Images Based on an Image Purification Strategy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07492)
*Guoliang Gong,Man Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: An Image Purification framework plus a Frequency-domain Flow Matching model for real-uLDCT denoising, addressing misalignment and preserving anatomical structures, with SOTA results on real data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ultra-low dose CT (uLDCT) reduces radiation but introduces severe noise and, crucially, misalignment with normal-dose CT (NDCT). This data mismatch hinders applying standard denoisers trained on synthetic noise or aligned data. There is a need for methods that purify and align real uLDCT data to improve denoising while preserving anatomy.

Method: 1) Build a real clinical uLDCT lung dataset. 2) Propose an Image Purification (IP) strategy to generate structurally aligned uLDCT-NDCT pairs for high-quality training data. 3) Introduce a Frequency-domain Flow Matching (FFM) model that complements IP to preserve anatomical structure integrity during denoising. 4) Demonstrate improved performance of mainstream denoisers with IP, and state-of-the-art anatomical preservation with FFM+IP; release code and dataset.

Result: IP strategy significantly enhances the performance of multiple mainstream denoising models on uLDCT tasks. The combination of FFM with IP achieves state-of-the-art results in anatomical structure preservation on real clinical data.

Conclusion: An IP strategy together with the FFM model provides an effective solution to the data mismatch problem in real-world uLDCT denoising, enabling better denoising while preserving anatomical structures; code and dataset are publicly available.

Abstract: Ultra-low dose CT (uLDCT) significantly reduces radiation exposure but
introduces severe noise and artifacts. It also leads to substantial spatial
misalignment between uLDCT and normal dose CT (NDCT) image pairs. This poses
challenges for directly applying existing denoising networks trained on
synthetic noise or aligned data. To address this core challenge in uLDCT
denoising, this paper proposes an innovative denoising framework based on an
Image Purification (IP) strategy. First, we construct a real clinical uLDCT
lung dataset. Then, we propose an Image Purification strategy that generates
structurally aligned uLDCT-NDCT image pairs, providing a high-quality data
foundation for network training. Building upon this, we propose a
Frequency-domain Flow Matching (FFM) model, which works synergistically with
the IP strategy to excellently preserve the anatomical structure integrity of
denoised images. Experiments on the real clinical dataset demonstrate that our
IP strategy significantly enhances the performance of multiple mainstream
denoising models on the uLDCT task. Notably, our proposed FFM model combined
with the IP strategy achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) results in anatomical
structure preservation. This study provides an effective solution to the data
mismatch problem in real-world uLDCT denoising. Code and dataset are available
at https://github.com/MonkeyDadLufy/flow-matching.

### [5] [D2RA: Dual Domain Regeneration Attack](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07538)
*Pragati Shuddhodhan Meshram,Varun Chandrasekaran*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: D2RA is a training-free, single-image attack that removes/weakens watermarks in generative-model outputs without model access by projecting onto natural priors across multiple representations, reducing watermark detectability while preserving image quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As generative models proliferate, watermarking for attribution and provenance is essential, but current semantic watermarking schemes remain vulnerable under resource-constrained adversaries; there is a need to assess and reinforce watermark robustness.

Method: D2RA is a training-free, single-image attack that does not require access to the underlying model. It projects watermarked images onto natural priors across complementary representations to suppress watermark signals while preserving visual fidelity.

Result: Empirical evaluation across diverse watermarking schemes shows consistent reduction in watermark detectability, exposing fundamental weaknesses in current designs; code is released for reproducibility.

Conclusion: Semantic watermarking schemes based on latent or frequency signals are vulnerable to simple, training-free projection attacks. The work introduces a practical attack (D2RA) and motivates the development of more robust watermarking strategies.

Abstract: The growing use of generative models has intensified the need for
watermarking methods that ensure content attribution and provenance. While
recent semantic watermarking schemes improve robustness by embedding signals in
latent or frequency representations, we show they remain vulnerable even under
resource-constrained adversarial settings. We present D2RA, a training-free,
single-image attack that removes or weakens watermarks without access to the
underlying model. By projecting watermarked images onto natural priors across
complementary representations, D2RA suppresses watermark signals while
preserving visual fidelity. Experiments across diverse watermarking schemes
demonstrate that our approach consistently reduces watermark detectability,
revealing fundamental weaknesses in current designs. Our code is available at
https://github.com/Pragati-Meshram/DAWN.

### [6] [PickStyle: Video-to-Video Style Transfer with Context-Style Adapters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07546)
*Soroush Mehraban,Vida Adeli,Jacob Rommann,Babak Taati,Kyryl Truskovskyi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PickStyle is a diffusion-based video style transfer method that uses low-rank adapters and image-based supervision, plus CS-CFG guidance, to achieve temporally coherent, content-preserving, style-faithful video translations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcomes lack of paired video data for supervising video style transfer; leverages image-styled pairs and temporal priors to train video models.

Method: Insert low-rank adapters into self-attention in conditioning modules; synthetic training clips from paired images using shared augmentations to simulate camera motion; Context-Style Classifier-Free Guidance (CS-CFG) factorizes guidance into independent style (text) and context (video) directions.

Result: Achieves temporally coherent, style-faithful, content-preserving translations; outperforms existing baselines on benchmarks both qualitatively and quantitatively.

Conclusion: Demonstrates effective bridging of static image supervision to video style transfer via diffusion with adapters and CS-CFG; maintains content while applying target style; scalable and efficient.

Abstract: We address the task of video style transfer with diffusion models, where the
goal is to preserve the context of an input video while rendering it in a
target style specified by a text prompt. A major challenge is the lack of
paired video data for supervision. We propose PickStyle, a video-to-video style
transfer framework that augments pretrained video diffusion backbones with
style adapters and benefits from paired still image data with source-style
correspondences for training. PickStyle inserts low-rank adapters into the
self-attention layers of conditioning modules, enabling efficient
specialization for motion-style transfer while maintaining strong alignment
between video content and style. To bridge the gap between static image
supervision and dynamic video, we construct synthetic training clips from
paired images by applying shared augmentations that simulate camera motion,
ensuring temporal priors are preserved. In addition, we introduce Context-Style
Classifier-Free Guidance (CS-CFG), a novel factorization of classifier-free
guidance into independent text (style) and video (context) directions. CS-CFG
ensures that context is preserved in generated video while the style is
effectively transferred. Experiments across benchmarks show that our approach
achieves temporally coherent, style-faithful, and content-preserving video
translations, outperforming existing baselines both qualitatively and
quantitatively.

### [7] [TRAVL: A Recipe for Making Video-Language Models Better Judges of Physics Implausibility](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07550)
*Saman Motamed,Minghao Chen,Luc Van Gool,Iro Laina*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Presents TRAVL to enhance physical plausibility judgment in video-language models and ImplausiBench to rigorously benchmark temporal physics understanding; finds current VLMs struggle with physics violations and offers a fine-tuning recipe plus a curated dataset for evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video generative models often violate basic physical principles, and current VLMs lack reliable temporal/causal understanding. There is a need for quantitative, bias-controlled benchmarks and effective training strategies to assess and improve physical realism in video understanding.

Method: Introduce TRAVL, a fine-tuning recipe that uses a balanced training dataset and a trajectory-aware attention module to improve motion encoding in VLMs. Propose ImplausiBench, a 300-video benchmark (150 real, 150 generated) designed to isolate visual-temporal reasoning with minimized linguistic biases. Evaluation employs gold-standard human judgments and stricter LLM-as-judge metrics.

Result: The authors report that existing VLMs struggle to detect physics violations. TRAVL improves discrimination of implausible trajectories, and ImplausiBench provides a rigorous, bias-controlled evaluation framework. The combination offers a unified approach to probing and improving physical plausibility in multimodal models.

Conclusion: TRAVL and ImplausiBench together form a practical framework to study and enhance physical plausibility in video-language understanding, highlighting an important but underexplored aspect of visual-temporal reasoning.

Abstract: Despite impressive visual fidelity, modern video generative models frequently
produce sequences that violate intuitive physical laws, such as objects
floating, teleporting, or morphing in ways that defy causality. While humans
can easily detect such implausibilities, there remains no robust method for
quantitatively assessing physical realism in video. In this work, we explore
whether Video-Language Models (VLMs) can be trained to serve as reliable judges
of physical plausibility. We find that existing VLMs struggle to identify
physics violations, exposing fundamental limitations in their temporal and
causal reasoning. To address this, we introduce TRAVL, a fine-tuning recipe
that combines a balanced training dataset with a trajectory-aware attention
module to improve motion encoding and discrimination in VLMs. To evaluate
physical reasoning more rigorously, we propose ImplausiBench, a benchmark of
300 videos (150 real, 150 generated) that removes linguistic biases and
isolates visual-temporal understanding. Performance is reported both with
gold-standard human judgments and stricter LLM-as-judge metrics. Together,
TRAVL and ImplausiBench offer a unified framework for probing and improving
physical plausibility in multimodal models, shedding light on a challenging and
underexplored aspect of visual-temporal understanding.

### [8] [Label Semantics for Robust Hyperspectral Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07556)
*Rafin Hassan,Zarin Tasnim Roshni,Rafiqul Bari,Alimul Islam,Nabeel Mohammed,Moshiur Farazi,Shafin Rahman*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: S3FN: a semantic augmentation for HSI classification that fuses spectral–spatial features with LLM-generated, class-specific textual descriptions to improve label semantics and accuracy on three benchmarks; code available.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HSI suffers from limited labeled samples and high feature dimensionality, leading to overfitting in monomodal spectral–spatial models. Injecting semantic, human-like class descriptions can improve feature-label alignment and generalization.

Method: Generate per-class textual descriptions via large language models for each label. Embed these descriptions with a pre-trained text encoder (e.g., BERT/RoBERTa) to obtain semantic embeddings. Fuse semantic embeddings with spectral–spatial features in a Semantic Spectral-Spatial Fusion Network (S3FN) to train the classifier. Evaluate on three HSI datasets (Hyperspectral Wood, HyperspectralBlueberries, DeepHS-Fruit).

Result: Reported significant performance improvements over baselines across all three datasets, demonstrating the value of incorporating textual semantics with spectral–spatial data. Code is available at the provided GitHub repository.

Conclusion: Incorporating human-like semantic information via textual descriptions can complement spectral-spatial cues, improving HSI classification by enhancing feature-label alignment and reducing overfitting; S3FN shows the viability of semantically augmented HSI models.

Abstract: Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) classification is a critical tool with widespread
applications across diverse fields such as agriculture, environmental
monitoring, medicine, and materials science. Due to the limited availability of
high-quality training samples and the high dimensionality of spectral data, HSI
classification models are prone to overfitting and often face challenges in
balancing accuracy and computational complexity. Furthermore, most of HSI
classification models are monomodal, where it solely relies on spectral-spatial
data to learn decision boundaries in the high dimensional embedding space. To
address this, we propose a general-purpose Semantic Spectral-Spatial Fusion
Network (S3FN) that uses contextual, class specific textual descriptions to
complement the training of an HSI classification model. Specifically, S3FN
leverages LLMs to generate comprehensive textual descriptions for each class
label that captures their unique characteristics and spectral behaviors. These
descriptions are then embedded into a vector space using a pre-trained text
encoder such as BERT or RoBERTa to extract meaningful label semantics which in
turn leads to a better feature-label alignment for improved classification
performance. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we evaluate our
model on three diverse HSI benchmark datasets - Hyperspectral Wood,
HyperspectralBlueberries, and DeepHS-Fruit and report significant performance
boost. Our results highlight the synergy between textual semantics and
spectral-spatial data, paving the way for further advancements in semantically
augmented HSI classification models. Codes are be available in:

### [9] [Cross-Modal Attention Guided Unlearning in Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07567)
*Karuna Bhaila,Aneesh Komanduri,Minh-Hao Van,Xintao Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduces Cross-Modal Attention Guided Unlearning (CAGUL), a lightweight VLM unlearning framework for VQA that modulates visual tokens via external modules guided by cross-modal attention to erase sensitive information without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses privacy leakage in vision-language models due to memorization during training. Traditional finetuning-based unlearning is costly and may disrupt model behavior; need a method that handles visual+textual contexts without retraining.

Method: Uses cross-modal attention to identify visually-relevant tokens for output. Employs external modules to encode unlearning into low-importance visual tokens, transforming them to prevent leakage while preserving the base model's behavior. Does not update pre-trained model parameters or require retraining.

Result: Experimental results show CAGUL performs better or on par with finetuning-based baselines, while avoiding parameter updates and retraining costs, and preserving reference model behavior.

Conclusion: CAGUL provides a practical and effective unlearning approach for vision-language models, particularly VQA, balancing privacy protection with model utility and reduced training expense.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated immense capabilities in
multi-modal understanding and inference tasks such as Visual Question Answering
(VQA), which requires models to infer outputs based on visual and textual
context simultaneously. Such inference abilities of large-scale pretrained
models are often attributed to the massive scale of pre-training data collected
across several domains. However, the models may memorize private and/or
sensitive information during training and regurgitate it in inference.
Recently, machine unlearning has been leveraged to address the leakage of
private data in LLMs. VLMs add a layer of complexity to this process, as the
visual context in the query may also contain sensitive information in addition
to the text. To address this issue, we explore unlearning for vision-language
models, specifically for the VQA task. We explore the role of visual tokens for
output generation in VLMs using cross-modal attention and utilize it to
formulate Cross-Modal Attention Guided Unlearning (CAGUL), a lightweight and
efficient VLM unlearning framework. In contrast to computationally expensive
model finetuning methods, CAGUL utilizes external modules to encode unlearning
information in visual tokens of low importance for relevant queries. We find
that the transformed visual tokens not only prevent leakage but also retain
reference model behavior. Experimental results show that our method performs
better or on par with finetuning-based baselines without altering the
pre-trained model parameters or incurring retraining costs, making it a
practical and effective unlearning solution for VLMs.

### [10] [MaizeStandCounting (MaSC): Automated and Accurate Maize Stand Counting from UAV Imagery Using Image Processing and Deep Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07580)
*Dewi Endah Kharismawati,Toni Kazic*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MaSC is a low-cost UAV-based maize seedling counting system using a lightweight YOLOv9 detector with two processing modes (patch mosaics and raw frames via homography) to produce row-wise stand counts; it shows strong ground-truth alignment and near real-time performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate stand counts are essential for yield prediction, planting density optimization, and early germination issue detection, but manual counting is labor-intensive and error-prone, especially over large or variable fields.

Method: Two operational modes: mosaic images partitioned into patches, and raw video frames aligned with homography; applies a lightweight YOLOv9 model trained to detect maize seedlings from growth stages V2–V10; discriminates maize from weeds; performs row and range segmentation based on spatial distribution of detections to output row-wise counts; designed for low-cost UAV imagery and affordable hardware.

Result: Compared to manual ground truth, R^2 = 0.616 for mosaic mode and R^2 = 0.906 for raw-frame mode; processed 83 full-resolution frames in 60.63 s (inference plus post-processing), indicating potential for real-time operation.

Conclusion: MaSC is a scalable, low-cost, accurate tool for automated maize stand counting suitable for research and production, with demonstrated real-time potential.

Abstract: Accurate maize stand counts are essential for crop management and research,
informing yield prediction, planting density optimization, and early detection
of germination issues. Manual counting is labor-intensive, slow, and
error-prone, especially across large or variable fields. We present
MaizeStandCounting (MaSC), a robust algorithm for automated maize seedling
stand counting from RGB imagery captured by low-cost UAVs and processed on
affordable hardware. MaSC operates in two modes: (1) mosaic images divided into
patches, and (2) raw video frames aligned using homography matrices. Both modes
use a lightweight YOLOv9 model trained to detect maize seedlings from V2-V10
growth stages. MaSC distinguishes maize from weeds and other vegetation, then
performs row and range segmentation based on the spatial distribution of
detections to produce precise row-wise stand counts. Evaluation against
in-field manual counts from our 2024 summer nursery showed strong agreement
with ground truth (R^2= 0.616 for mosaics, R^2 = 0.906 for raw frames). MaSC
processed 83 full-resolution frames in 60.63 s, including inference and
post-processing, highlighting its potential for real-time operation. These
results demonstrate MaSC's effectiveness as a scalable, low-cost, and accurate
tool for automated maize stand counting in both research and production
environments.

### [11] [Quick-CapsNet (QCN): A fast alternative to Capsule Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07600)
*Pouya Shiri,Ramin Sharifi,Amirali Baniasadi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: QCN is a fastCapsNet variant with fewer capsules that delivers about 5x faster inference on MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, SVHN, and CIFAR-10 with only marginal accuracy loss; a more powerful decoder further improves performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CapsNet achieves strong accuracy and affine robustness but suffers from slow training/inference, hindering real-time applications. A faster alternative that preserves CapsNet benefits is desirable.

Method: Reduce the number of capsules to create Quick-CapsNet (QCN), making the network faster. Train/test on MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, SVHN, and CIFAR-10. Optionally replace the default decoder with a more powerful decoder to improve performance.

Result: Inference speed is improved by about 5x across the tested datasets; accuracy loss is marginal. Replacing the default decoder yields further improvements in QCN performance.

Conclusion: QCN offers a viable, faster alternative to CapsNet suitable for real-time tasks, with a controllable trade-off between speed and accuracy that can be enhanced further by a stronger decoder.

Abstract: The basic computational unit in Capsule Network (CapsNet) is a capsule (vs.
neurons in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)). A capsule is a set of
neurons, which form a vector. CapsNet is used for supervised classification of
data and has achieved state-of-the-art accuracy on MNIST digit recognition
dataset, outperforming conventional CNNs in detecting overlapping digits.
Moreover, CapsNet shows higher robustness towards affine transformation when
compared to CNNs for MNIST datasets. One of the drawbacks of CapsNet, however,
is slow training and testing. This can be a bottleneck for applications that
require a fast network, especially during inference. In this work, we introduce
Quick-CapsNet (QCN) as a fast alternative to CapsNet, which can be a starting
point to develop CapsNet for fast real-time applications. QCN builds on
producing a fewer number of capsules, which results in a faster network. QCN
achieves this at the cost of marginal loss in accuracy. Inference is 5x faster
on MNIST, F-MNIST, SVHN and Cifar-10 datasets. We also further enhanced QCN by
employing a more powerful decoder instead of the default decoder to further
improve QCN.

### [12] [Rectified-CFG++ for Flow Based Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07631)
*Shreshth Saini,Shashank Gupta,Alan C. Bovik*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Rectified-CFG++ introduces an adaptive predictor-corrector guidance for rectified flow (RF) diffusion models to curb off-manifold drift during text-conditioned generation. It anchors samples to the learned transport path with RF updates and applies a geometry-aware, weighted correction between conditional and unconditional velocities, yielding trajectories that stay near the data manifold and are stable across guidance strengths. Empirically, it outperforms standard CFG on major text-to-image models and benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CFG struggles when applied to rectified-flow based models, causing severe off-manifold drift, artifacts, misalignment, and brittle behavior. A geometry-aware, stable guidance mechanism is needed to align text-conditioned outputs with the data manifold and maintain robustness across guidance strengths.

Method: At each inference step: (1) perform a conditional RF update to anchor the sample near the learned transport path; (2) apply a weighted conditional correction that interpolates between the conditional and unconditional velocity fields using a geometry-aware rule. The resulting velocity field is shown to be marginally consistent, and sample trajectories stay within a bounded tubular neighbourhood of the data manifold. This yields a predictor-corrector framework (adaptive) for rectified-flow models.

Result: Extensive experiments on Flux, Stable Diffusion 3/3.5, and Lumina demonstrate that Rectified-CFG++ consistently outperforms standard CFG on benchmark datasets such as MS-COCO, LAION-Aesthetic, and T2I-CompBench.

Conclusion: Rectified-CFG++ provides a stable, geometry-aware guidance mechanism for RF-based diffusion models, achieving better text-aligned outputs and robustness across guidance strengths. It combines the efficiency of rectified flows with an adaptive predictor-corrector step to limit off-manifold drift; a project page is provided for implementation details and results.

Abstract: Classifier-free guidance (CFG) is the workhorse for steering large diffusion
models toward text-conditioned targets, yet its native application to rectified
flow (RF) based models provokes severe off-manifold drift, yielding visual
artifacts, text misalignment, and brittle behaviour. We present
Rectified-CFG++, an adaptive predictor-corrector guidance that couples the
deterministic efficiency of rectified flows with a geometry-aware conditioning
rule. Each inference step first executes a conditional RF update that anchors
the sample near the learned transport path, then applies a weighted conditional
correction that interpolates between conditional and unconditional velocity
fields. We prove that the resulting velocity field is marginally consistent and
that its trajectories remain within a bounded tubular neighbourhood of the data
manifold, ensuring stability across a wide range of guidance strengths.
Extensive experiments on large-scale text-to-image models (Flux, Stable
Diffusion 3/3.5, Lumina) show that Rectified-CFG++ consistently outperforms
standard CFG on benchmark datasets such as MS-COCO, LAION-Aesthetic, and

### [13] [PIT-QMM: A Large Multimodal Model For No-Reference Point Cloud Quality Assessment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07636)
*Shashank Gupta,Gregoire Phillips,Alan C. Bovik*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel large multimodal model (PIT-QMM) for no-reference point cloud quality assessment that fuses text, 2D views, and 3D point clouds to predict perceptual quality, achieving strong gains and enabling distortion localization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: NR-PCQA for 3D assets is underexplored; multimodal signals (text descriptions, projections, and 3D views) provide complementary cues; leveraging large multimodal models can improve accuracy, efficiency, and explainability in quality assessment.

Method: Introduce PIT-QMM, a no-reference quality assessment model that ingests text, images, and point clouds end-to-end. The model leverages cross-modal fusion within a single LMM to predict perceptual quality scores and enables distortion localization.

Result: The approach outperforms state-of-the-art NR-PCQA methods by significant margins on popular benchmarks with fewer training iterations and demonstrates distortion localization/identification.

Conclusion: PIT-QMM demonstrates the viability of large multimodal models for NR-PCQA of 3D assets, offering explainability and interactivity. The authors release code and datasets for replication.

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have recently enabled considerable advances in
the realm of image and video quality assessment, but this progress has yet to
be fully explored in the domain of 3D assets. We are interested in using these
models to conduct No-Reference Point Cloud Quality Assessment (NR-PCQA), where
the aim is to automatically evaluate the perceptual quality of a point cloud in
absence of a reference. We begin with the observation that different modalities
of data - text descriptions, 2D projections, and 3D point cloud views - provide
complementary information about point cloud quality. We then construct PIT-QMM,
a novel LMM for NR-PCQA that is capable of consuming text, images and point
clouds end-to-end to predict quality scores. Extensive experimentation shows
that our proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art by significant
margins on popular benchmarks with fewer training iterations. We also
demonstrate that our framework enables distortion localization and
identification, which paves a new way forward for model explainability and
interactivity. Code and datasets are available at

### [14] [Dual-Stream Alignment for Action Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07652)
*Harshala Gammulle,Clinton Fookes,Sridha Sridharan,Simon Denman*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes DSA Net, a dual-stream (frame-wise and action-wise) network for action segmentation using a Temporal Context block and Quantum-based Action-Guided Modulation, trained with a three-part alignment loss, achieving state-of-the-art on multiple benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve action segmentation by leveraging a second stream of learned action features to capture action and transition cues, enabling richer cross-stream guidance beyond single-stream models.

Method: Dual-Stream Alignment Network with a frame-wise and an action-wise stream; a Temporal Context block that fuses information via cross-attention and Quantum-based Action-Guided Modulation (Q-ActGM); training with a Dual-Stream Alignment Loss comprising relational consistency, cross-level contrastive, and cycle-consistency reconstruction losses; evaluation and ablations on GTEA, Breakfast, 50Salads, and EgoProcel.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks with significant improvements; ablation studies demonstrate the contribution of each component.

Conclusion: Introduces the first hybrid quantum-classical framework for action segmentation; shows that aligning two streams and incorporating quantum-inspired modulation enhances segmentation capability and performance.

Abstract: Action segmentation is a challenging yet active research area that involves
identifying when and where specific actions occur in continuous video streams.
Most existing work has focused on single-stream approaches that model the
spatio-temporal aspects of frame sequences. However, recent research has
shifted toward two-stream methods that learn action-wise features to enhance
action segmentation performance. In this work, we propose the Dual-Stream
Alignment Network (DSA Net) and investigate the impact of incorporating a
second stream of learned action features to guide segmentation by capturing
both action and action-transition cues. Communication between the two streams
is facilitated by a Temporal Context (TC) block, which fuses complementary
information using cross-attention and Quantum-based Action-Guided Modulation
(Q-ActGM), enhancing the expressive power of the fused features. To the best of
our knowledge, this is the first study to introduce a hybrid quantum-classical
machine learning framework for action segmentation. Our primary objective is
for the two streams (frame-wise and action-wise) to learn a shared feature
space through feature alignment. This is encouraged by the proposed Dual-Stream
Alignment Loss, which comprises three components: relational consistency,
cross-level contrastive, and cycle-consistency reconstruction losses. Following
prior work, we evaluate DSA Net on several diverse benchmark datasets: GTEA,
Breakfast, 50Salads, and EgoProcel. We further demonstrate the effectiveness of
each component through extensive ablation studies. Notably, DSA Net achieves
state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming existing

### [15] [Once Is Enough: Lightweight DiT-Based Video Virtual Try-On via One-Time Garment Appearance Injection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07654)
*Yanjie Pan,Qingdong He,Lidong Wang,Bo Peng,Mingmin Chi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes OIE, a first-frame clothing replacement strategy for video virtual try-on using a garment transfer on the initial frame and temporal priors from pose/mask to generate remaining frames, achieving parameter and compute efficiency with competitive performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dual-branch diffusion-model video try-on approaches face parameter bloat and lack temporal garment characteristics; integrating garment latent features in diffusion-transformer backbones is inefficient; need a lightweight, temporally coherent solution.

Method: Replace clothes in the first frame with an image-based clothing transfer model. Edited first frame provides content control; use pose and mask cues to guide the temporal prior of the video generation model to synthesize subsequent frames sequentially.

Result: Experiments show superior parameter efficiency and computational efficiency while maintaining leading performance under resource constraints.

Conclusion: OIE offers an efficient, temporally coherent video try-on pipeline by decoupling first-frame garment replacement from later frame synthesis guided by pose/mask, reducing model complexity without sacrificing accuracy.

Abstract: Video virtual try-on aims to replace the clothing of a person in a video with
a target garment. Current dual-branch architectures have achieved significant
success in diffusion models based on the U-Net; however, adapting them to
diffusion models built upon the Diffusion Transformer remains challenging.
Initially, introducing latent space features from the garment reference branch
requires adding or modifying the backbone network, leading to a large number of
trainable parameters. Subsequently, the latent space features of garments lack
inherent temporal characteristics and thus require additional learning. To
address these challenges, we propose a novel approach, OIE (Once is Enough), a
virtual try-on strategy based on first-frame clothing replacement:
specifically, we employ an image-based clothing transfer model to replace the
clothing in the initial frame, and then, under the content control of the
edited first frame, utilize pose and mask information to guide the temporal
prior of the video generation model in synthesizing the remaining frames
sequentially. Experiments show that our method achieves superior parameter
efficiency and computational efficiency while still maintaining leading
performance under these constraints.

### [16] [MONKEY: Masking ON KEY-Value Activation Adapter for Personalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07656)
*James Baker*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A two-pass diffusion personalization method using IP-Adapter generated subject masks to constrain image tokens to the subject on a second pass, improving alignment with both the source image and the text prompt, especially for location-based prompts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Personalization methods risk simply reconstructing the subject; need to decouple subject fidelity from prompt-driven background content and improve alignment.

Method: During inference, use IP-Adapter's automatic subject mask to perform a second pass that masks image tokens to the subject region, restricting subject representation and letting the text prompt influence the rest of the image.

Result: Compared to other test-time personalization approaches, the method achieves high prompt and source image alignment, producing images that accurately depict the subject while following the prompt.

Conclusion: Mask-based token restriction guided by automatically generated subject masks improves personalization reliability for both subject fidelity and prompt adherence, especially for location-based prompts; effectiveness depends on mask quality and segmentation accuracy.

Abstract: Personalizing diffusion models allows users to generate new images that
incorporate a given subject, allowing more control than a text prompt. These
models often suffer somewhat when they end up just recreating the subject
image, and ignoring the text prompt. We observe that one popular method for
personalization, the IP-Adapter automatically generates masks that we
definitively segment the subject from the background during inference. We
propose to use this automatically generated mask on a second pass to mask the
image tokens, thus restricting them to the subject, not the background,
allowing the text prompt to attend to the rest of the image. For text prompts
describing locations and places, this produces images that accurately depict
the subject while definitively matching the prompt. We compare our method to a
few other test time personalization methods, and find our method displays high
prompt and source image alignment.

*Jun Muraoka,Daichi Haraguchi,Naoto Inoue,Wataru Shimoda,Kota Yamaguchi,Seiichi Uchida*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Transformer-based models outperform large VLMs for automated text box placement in incomplete layouts on Crello; incorporating richer appearance information helps, but very small text and dense layouts remain challenging; task-specific architectures are beneficial.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To balance visual appeal and communication efficiency in automated layout design by evaluating different architectural approaches for text box placement in incomplete layouts.

Method: Compare four architectures—standard Transformer-based model, Phi3.5-vision (small VLM), Gemini (large pretrained VLM), and an extended multi-image Transformer; evaluate on the Crello dataset to assess appearance-information usage and placement quality.

Result: Transformer-based models generally outperform VLM-based methods, particularly when richer appearance information is included; all methods struggle with very small text or densely populated layouts.

Conclusion: Task-specific architectures offer benefits for automated layout design; further improvements are needed to better handle small text and dense layouts and to optimize the use of appearance cues.

Abstract: In layout design for advertisements and web pages, balancing visual appeal
and communication efficiency is crucial. This study examines automated text box
placement in incomplete layouts, comparing a standard Transformer-based method,
a small Vision and Language Model (Phi3.5-vision), a large pretrained VLM
(Gemini), and an extended Transformer that processes multiple images.
Evaluations on the Crello dataset show the standard Transformer-based models
generally outperform VLM-based approaches, particularly when incorporating
richer appearance information. However, all methods face challenges with very
small text or densely populated layouts. These findings highlight the benefits
of task-specific architectures and suggest avenues for further improvement in
automated layout design.

### [18] [TCIP: Threshold-Controlled Iterative Pyramid Network for Deformable Medical Image Registration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07666)
*Heming Wu,Di Wang,Tai Ma,Peng Zhao,Yubin Xiao,Zhongke Wu,Xing-Ce Wang,Chuang Li,Xuan Wu,You Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes FERM and TCI to form TCIP for adaptive, accurate deformable registration in pyramid networks, reducing misalignment accumulation and adjusting iterations; demonstrates improved accuracy on 4 datasets with similar speed and smaller models; ablation confirms contributions; generalizes to other networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To mitigate (1) accumulation of anatomical misalignments in decoder pathways of pyramid-based deformable registration networks and (2) the need to adapt the number of optimization iterations to varying deformation requirements across images, avoiding premature termination or excessive iterations.

Method: Introduce Feature-Enhanced Residual Module (FERM) as the core of each decoding layer, comprising three blocks: (i) extract anatomical semantic features, (ii) suppress irrelevant features, (iii) estimate the final deformation field. Propose dual-stage Threshold-Controlled Iterative (TCI) strategy: stage 1 assesses registration stability, stage 2 assesses convergence; integrate into Threshold-Controlled Iterative Pyramid (TCIP). Validate by integrating FERM and TCI with existing networks and performing ablations.

Result: TCIP outperforms state-of-the-art registration networks in accuracy on three public brain MRI datasets and one abdomen CT dataset, with comparable inference speed and a compact model size. FERM and TCI demonstrate generalizability by improving other registration networks, as shown in ablation studies.

Conclusion: FERM and TCI effectively mitigate misalignment accumulation and provide adaptive iteration control in pyramid-based deformable registration. The TCIP framework delivers higher accuracy with similar speed and model size, and its components generalize across networks.

Abstract: Although pyramid networks have demonstrated superior performance in
deformable medical image registration, their decoder architectures are
inherently prone to propagating and accumulating anatomical structure
misalignments. Moreover, most existing models do not adaptively determine the
number of iterations for optimization under varying deformation requirements
across images, resulting in either premature termination or excessive
iterations that degrades registration accuracy. To effectively mitigate the
accumulation of anatomical misalignments, we propose the Feature-Enhanced
Residual Module (FERM) as the core component of each decoding layer in the
pyramid network. FERM comprises three sequential blocks that extract anatomical
semantic features, learn to suppress irrelevant features, and estimate the
final deformation field, respectively. To adaptively determine the number of
iterations for varying images, we propose the dual-stage Threshold-Controlled
Iterative (TCI) strategy. In the first stage, TCI assesses registration
stability and with asserted stability, it continues with the second stage to
evaluate convergence. We coin the model that integrates FERM and TCI as
Threshold-Controlled Iterative Pyramid (TCIP). Extensive experiments on three
public brain MRI datasets and one abdomen CT dataset demonstrate that TCIP
outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) registration networks in terms of
accuracy, while maintaining comparable inference speed and a compact model
parameter size. Finally, we assess the generalizability of FERM and TCI by
integrating them with existing registration networks and further conduct
ablation studies to validate the effectiveness of these two proposed methods.

### [19] [Controllable Video Synthesis via Variational Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07670)
*Haoyi Duan,Yunzhi Zhang,Yilun Du,Jiajun Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A variational-inference-based, multi-backbone video synthesis method that achieves controllability and diversity across mixed-granularity inputs via annealed KL minimization and context-conditioned factorization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Video workflows require a mix of user controls at different granularities, from precise 4D trajectories to coarse prompts; existing video generators are typically trained for fixed input formats, hindering flexible, controllable synthesis and 3D coherence.

Method: Cast the task as variational inference to approximate a composed distribution over outputs using multiple video generation backbones to satisfy all constraints; optimize via step-wise KL divergence minimization over an annealed sequence of distributions; introduce a context-conditioned factorization to reduce modes in the solution space and avoid local optima.

Result: Experiments indicate improved controllability, diversity, and 3D consistency compared with prior methods.

Conclusion: The proposed framework enables flexible, controllable video synthesis under mixed constraints by combining variational inference with backbones and annealing, offering improved performance and potential for broader applicability.

Abstract: Many video workflows benefit from a mixture of user controls with varying
granularity, from exact 4D object trajectories and camera paths to coarse text
prompts, while existing video generative models are typically trained for fixed
input formats. We develop a video synthesis method that addresses this need and
generates samples with high controllability for specified elements while
maintaining diversity for under-specified ones. We cast the task as variational
inference to approximate a composed distribution, leveraging multiple video
generation backbones to account for all task constraints collectively. To
address the optimization challenge, we break down the problem into step-wise KL
divergence minimization over an annealed sequence of distributions, and further
propose a context-conditioned factorization technique that reduces modes in the
solution space to circumvent local optima. Experiments suggest that our method
produces samples with improved controllability, diversity, and 3D consistency
compared to prior works.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Hybrid BYOL-CNN approach for fault detection in induction motors using thermal images; introduces BYOL-IMNet; achieves 99.89% accuracy with 5.7 ms per image, outperforming SOTA.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early fault detection in induction motors is critical to prevent overheating, energy waste, and service failures. The abstract notes a need for accurate and fast fault classification on thermal images, and proposes a CNN-BYOL hybrid to improve online monitoring.

Method: The method leverages BYOL self-supervised learning with multiple CNN backbones (ResNet-50, DenseNet-121/169, EfficientNetB0, VGG16, MobileNetV2) and introduces a lightweight BYOL-IMNet with four custom-designed blocks for fault classification. The dataset includes normal operation, overload, and fault states of induction motors.

Result: The proposed BYOL-IMNet achieves 99.89% test accuracy with an inference time of 5.7 ms per image, outperforming state-of-the-art models.

Conclusion: The CNN-BYOL hybrid approach is a promising solution for accurate and fast fault detection in industrial motor monitoring, enabling robust online monitoring in industrial settings.

Abstract: Induction motors (IMs) are indispensable in industrial and daily life, but
they are susceptible to various faults that can lead to overheating, wasted
energy consumption, and service failure. Early detection of faults is essential
to protect the motor and prolong its lifespan. This paper presents a hybrid
method that integrates BYOL with CNNs for classifying thermal images of
induction motors for fault detection. The thermal dataset used in this work
includes different operating states of the motor, such as normal operation,
overload, and faults. We employed multiple deep learning (DL) models for the
BYOL technique, ranging from popular architectures such as ResNet-50,
DenseNet-121, DenseNet-169, EfficientNetB0, VGG16, and MobileNetV2.
Additionally, we introduced a new high-performance yet lightweight CNN model
named BYOL-IMNet, which comprises four custom-designed blocks tailored for
fault classification in thermal images. Our experimental results demonstrate
that the proposed BYOL-IMNet achieves 99.89\% test accuracy and an inference
time of 5.7 ms per image, outperforming state-of-the-art models. This study
highlights the promising performance of the CNN-BYOL hybrid method in enhancing
accuracy for detecting faults in induction motors, offering a robust
methodology for online monitoring in industrial settings.

### [21] [Mutual Learning for Hashing: Unlocking Strong Hash Functions from Weak Supervision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07703)
*Xiaoxu Ma,Runhao Li,Zhenyu Weng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MLH is a two-branch mutual-learning framework for hashing, where a strong center-based branch learns global structure aided by a weaker pairwise-based branch that captures local similarities, coupled with a mixture-of-hash-experts module for cross-branch interaction, yielding state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Center-based hashing captures global data distributions but may overlook local similarities; pairwise-based hashing captures local relations but may underperform globally. The work aims to integrate both cues to improve large-scale image retrieval.

Method: Two-branch architecture: a strong center-based hashing branch and a weaker pairwise-based branch. Iterative mutual learning transfers knowledge from the pairwise branch to enhance the center branch (and presumably vice versa). A mixture-of-hash-experts module enables effective cross-branch interaction to further boost performance.

Result: Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets show MLH consistently outperforms state-of-the-art hashing methods.

Conclusion: A weak-to-strong mutual learning framework with a mixture-of-hash-experts effectively combines local and global data cues in hashing, improving retrieval performance across datasets.

Abstract: Deep hashing has been widely adopted for large-scale image retrieval, with
numerous strategies proposed to optimize hash function learning. Pairwise-based
methods are effective in learning hash functions that preserve local similarity
relationships, whereas center-based methods typically achieve superior
performance by more effectively capturing global data distributions. However,
the strength of center-based methods in modeling global structures often comes
at the expense of underutilizing important local similarity information. To
address this limitation, we propose Mutual Learning for Hashing (MLH), a novel
weak-to-strong framework that enhances a center-based hashing branch by
transferring knowledge from a weaker pairwise-based branch. MLH consists of two
branches: a strong center-based branch and a weaker pairwise-based branch.
Through an iterative mutual learning process, the center-based branch leverages
local similarity cues learned by the pairwise-based branch. Furthermore,
inspired by the mixture-of-experts paradigm, we introduce a novel
mixture-of-hash-experts module that enables effective cross-branch interaction,
further enhancing the performance of both branches. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that MLH consistently outperforms state-of-the-art hashing methods
across multiple benchmark datasets.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Repainter is a reinforcement learning inpainting framework that combines spatial-matting trajectory refinement with Group Relative Policy Optimization to remove watermarks and promotional text from e-commerce product images, aided by a new EcomPaint-100K dataset and EcomPaint-Bench benchmark, achieving state-of-the-art results and promising code release.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In commercial web imagery, watermarks and promotional text hinder clear product visuals. Diffusion-based inpainting struggles with reliable object removal and domain adaptation in e-commerce settings, motivating a more robust, domain-aware solution.

Method: Repainter uses reinforcement learning with spatial-matting trajectory refinement and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). It modulates attention to emphasize background context, leverages a composite reward balancing global, local, and semantic constraints to reduce artifacts and reward hacking, and aims to generate higher-reward samples with fewer unwanted insertions.

Result: Extensive experiments show Repainter significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, especially in challenging scenes with intricate compositions.

Conclusion: Repainter is effective for e-commerce image inpainting; the paper introduces EcomPaint-100K and EcomPaint-Bench for standardized evaluation, and plans to release code and weights upon acceptance.

Abstract: In web data, product images are central to boosting user engagement and
advertising efficacy on e-commerce platforms, yet the intrusive elements such
as watermarks and promotional text remain major obstacles to delivering clear
and appealing product visuals. Although diffusion-based inpainting methods have
advanced, they still face challenges in commercial settings due to unreliable
object removal and limited domain-specific adaptation. To tackle these
challenges, we propose Repainter, a reinforcement learning framework that
integrates spatial-matting trajectory refinement with Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO). Our approach modulates attention mechanisms to emphasize
background context, generating higher-reward samples and reducing unwanted
object insertion. We also introduce a composite reward mechanism that balances
global, local, and semantic constraints, effectively reducing visual artifacts
and reward hacking. Additionally, we contribute EcomPaint-100K, a high-quality,
large-scale e-commerce inpainting dataset, and a standardized benchmark
EcomPaint-Bench for fair evaluation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
Repainter significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, especially in
challenging scenes with intricate compositions. We will release our code and
weights upon acceptance.

*Wenyue Chen,Peng Li,Wangguandong Zheng,Chengfeng Zhao,Mengfei Li,Yaolong Zhu,Zhiyang Dou,Ronggang Wang,Yuan Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SyncHuman fuses 2D multiview and 3D native generative models with pixel-aligned synchronization and feature injection to reconstruct high-fidelity clothed 3D humans from a single image, addressing pose challenges and fine-detail recovery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Single-view 3D human reconstruction is ill-posed due to ambiguities and severe self-occlusions. Existing SMPL-based priors can be inaccurate and struggle to recover fine details, motivating a framework that leverages both 2D and 3D generative strengths.

Method: Jointly fine-tune a 2D multiview generative model and a 3D native generative model using a pixel-aligned 2D-3D synchronization attention to produce geometrically aligned shapes and views, followed by a feature injection mechanism that transfers fine 2D details onto the aligned 3D shapes to enhance fidelity.

Result: Extensive experiments show robust, photo-realistic 3D human reconstruction from single images, with higher geometric accuracy and visual fidelity than strong baselines, including challenging poses.

Conclusion: Integrating complementary 2D and 3D generative models with synchronization attention and detail transfer provides an effective solution for single-view clothed human reconstruction and points toward a promising direction for future 3D generation models.

Abstract: Photorealistic 3D full-body human reconstruction from a single image is a
critical yet challenging task for applications in films and video games due to
inherent ambiguities and severe self-occlusions. While recent approaches
leverage SMPL estimation and SMPL-conditioned image generative models to
hallucinate novel views, they suffer from inaccurate 3D priors estimated from
SMPL meshes and have difficulty in handling difficult human poses and
reconstructing fine details. In this paper, we propose SyncHuman, a novel
framework that combines 2D multiview generative model and 3D native generative
model for the first time, enabling high-quality clothed human mesh
reconstruction from single-view images even under challenging human poses.
Multiview generative model excels at capturing fine 2D details but struggles
with structural consistency, whereas 3D native generative model generates
coarse yet structurally consistent 3D shapes. By integrating the complementary
strengths of these two approaches, we develop a more effective generation
framework. Specifically, we first jointly fine-tune the multiview generative
model and the 3D native generative model with proposed pixel-aligned 2D-3D
synchronization attention to produce geometrically aligned 3D shapes and 2D
multiview images. To further improve details, we introduce a feature injection
mechanism that lifts fine details from 2D multiview images onto the aligned 3D
shapes, enabling accurate and high-fidelity reconstruction. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that SyncHuman achieves robust and photo-realistic 3D
human reconstruction, even for images with challenging poses. Our method
outperforms baseline methods in geometric accuracy and visual fidelity,
demonstrating a promising direction for future 3D generation models.

### [24] [ComGS: Efficient 3D Object-Scene Composition via Surface Octahedral Probes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07729)
*Jian Gao,Mengqi Yuan,Yifei Zeng,Chang Zeng,Zhihao Li,Zhenyu Chen,Weichao Qiu,Xiao-Xiao Long,Hao Zhu,Xun Cao,Yao Yao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: We present ComGS, a framework that enables fast, relightable Gaussian Splatting for 3D object–scene composition by (1) Surface Octahedral Probes (SOPs) for ray-tracing-free lighting and occlusion querying, providing at least 2× speedups, and (2) an environment-lighting pipeline that captures a 360° radiance field at the object’s placement and uses a fine-tuned diffusion model to complete lighting, yielding high-quality shadows. The system achieves real-time rendering (~28 FPS) and editing in ~36 seconds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Gaussian Splatting suffers from baked appearance and shadow information that harms object–scene composition, requiring relightable object reconstruction and scene lighting estimation. Traditional inverse rendering with ray tracing is inefficient for dynamic, interactive workflows. The goal is to enable efficient, high-quality relighting and shadowing to support seamless 3D composition.

Method: Introduce Surface Octahedral Probes (SOPs) that store lighting and occlusion data and support efficient 3D querying via interpolation, avoiding costly ray tracing and delivering at least 2× speedups in reconstruction and real-time shadow computation in Gaussian scenes. For lighting estimation, focus on the environment lighting at the object’s placement: capture a 360° reconstructed radiance field of the scene at the placement location and fine-tune a diffusion model to complete the lighting. Integrate these components into ComGS, a 3D object–scene composition framework that delivers high-quality rendering at ~28 FPS and supports editing in ~36 seconds.

Result: SOPs provide at least a 2× speedup for relighting reconstruction and enable real-time shadow computation in Gaussian scenes. The environment-lighting pipeline, based on a captured 360° radiance field and diffusion-based completion, enables plausible lighting for the object placement. ComGS achieves real-time rendering at around 28 FPS with vivid shadows and harmonious appearance, and requires about 36 seconds for editing.

Conclusion: The proposed SOPs and the diffusion-based environment-lighting approach significantly improve the efficiency and quality of 3D object–scene composition in Gaussian Splatting. The ComGS framework demonstrates practical, real-time performance and high-quality visual results, addressing both relightable reconstruction and lighting estimation challenges. Code and dataset are publicly available to facilitate replication and broader adoption.

Abstract: Gaussian Splatting (GS) enables immersive rendering, but realistic 3D
object-scene composition remains challenging. Baked appearance and shadow
information in GS radiance fields cause inconsistencies when combining objects
and scenes. Addressing this requires relightable object reconstruction and
scene lighting estimation. For relightable object reconstruction, existing
Gaussian-based inverse rendering methods often rely on ray tracing, leading to
low efficiency. We introduce Surface Octahedral Probes (SOPs), which store
lighting and occlusion information and allow efficient 3D querying via
interpolation, avoiding expensive ray tracing. SOPs provide at least a 2x
speedup in reconstruction and enable real-time shadow computation in Gaussian
scenes. For lighting estimation, existing Gaussian-based inverse rendering
methods struggle to model intricate light transport and often fail in complex
scenes, while learning-based methods predict lighting from a single image and
are viewpoint-sensitive. We observe that 3D object-scene composition primarily
concerns the object's appearance and nearby shadows. Thus, we simplify the
challenging task of full scene lighting estimation by focusing on the
environment lighting at the object's placement. Specifically, we capture a 360
degrees reconstructed radiance field of the scene at the location and fine-tune
a diffusion model to complete the lighting. Building on these advances, we
propose ComGS, a novel 3D object-scene composition framework. Our method
achieves high-quality, real-time rendering at around 28 FPS, produces visually
harmonious results with vivid shadows, and requires only 36 seconds for
editing. Code and dataset are available at

### [25] [UltraLED: Learning to See Everything in Ultra-High Dynamic Range Scenes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07741)
*Yuang Meng,Xin Jin,Lina Lei,Chun-Le Guo,Chongyi Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Single short-exposure RAW image suffices for high dynamic range reconstruction via UltraLED's two-stage pipeline, outperforming prior single-frame methods; includes a 9-stop synthetic bracketing dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: UHDR scenes have large exposure disparities between bright and dark regions, especially at night. RGB bracketing suffers from misalignment/ghosting; RAW's higher bit depth and predictable noise offer better potential for recovery with a single frame.

Method: Two-stage approach: (1) exposure correction via a ratio map to balance dynamic range; (2) a brightness-aware RAW denoiser to recover detail in dark regions. Additionally, a 9-stop bracketing pipeline synthesizes realistic UHDR images using only the shortest exposure, creating a training dataset.

Result: Extensive experiments show that UltraLED significantly outperforms existing single-frame approaches.

Conclusion: Demonstrates that single short-exposure RAW frames can achieve robust UHDR reconstruction in dynamic scenes; provides publicly available code and dataset to support further research.

Abstract: Ultra-high dynamic range (UHDR) scenes exhibit significant exposure
disparities between bright and dark regions. Such conditions are commonly
encountered in nighttime scenes with light sources. Even with standard exposure
settings, a bimodal intensity distribution with boundary peaks often emerges,
making it difficult to preserve both highlight and shadow details
simultaneously. RGB-based bracketing methods can capture details at both ends
using short-long exposure pairs, but are susceptible to misalignment and
ghosting artifacts. We found that a short-exposure image already retains
sufficient highlight detail. The main challenge of UHDR reconstruction lies in
denoising and recovering information in dark regions. In comparison to the RGB
images, RAW images, thanks to their higher bit depth and more predictable noise
characteristics, offer greater potential for addressing this challenge. This
raises a key question: can we learn to see everything in UHDR scenes using only
a single short-exposure RAW image? In this study, we rely solely on a single
short-exposure frame, which inherently avoids ghosting and motion blur, making
it particularly robust in dynamic scenes. To achieve that, we introduce
UltraLED, a two-stage framework that performs exposure correction via a ratio
map to balance dynamic range, followed by a brightness-aware RAW denoiser to
enhance detail recovery in dark regions. To support this setting, we design a
9-stop bracketing pipeline to synthesize realistic UHDR images and contribute a
corresponding dataset based on diverse scenes, using only the shortest exposure
as input for reconstruction. Extensive experiments show that UltraLED
significantly outperforms existing single-frame approaches. Our code and
dataset are made publicly available at

*Junhao He,Jiaxu Wang,Jia Li,Mingyuan Sun,Qiang Zhang,Jiahang Cao,Ziyi Zhang,Yi Gu,Jingkai Sun,Renjing Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A framework to jointly reconstruct dynamic 3D Gaussian Splatting from low-framerate RGB by leveraging high-temporal-resolution event data, using LoCM-adapted event flow priors and geometry-aware event-Gaussian motion correspondence to handle large inter-frame motions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reconstructing dynamic 3D scenes from low-temporal-resolution RGB is challenging when large inter-frame motions increase uncertainty. Event cameras capture fast changes and have high temporal resolution but lack color, so combining RGB with events can provide deterministic constraints for large motions. The key challenge is how to jointly optimize a dynamic 3D representation from two different modalities with significant discrepancy.

Method: Propose a framework that jointly optimizes dynamic 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) from RGB and event streams. Introduce LoCM unsupervised fine-tuning to adapt an event flow estimator to an unseen scene to extract motion priors from events. Develop a geometry-aware data association to form event-Gaussian motion correspondences, and employ motion decomposition and inter-frame pseudo-labels to aid optimization.

Result: Extensive experiments show that the proposed method outperforms existing image- and event-based approaches on both synthetic and real scenes, demonstrating effective optimization of dynamic 3DGS with the help of event data.

Conclusion: Integrating event-based motion priors with geometry-aware data association enables robust joint optimization of dynamic 3D Gaussian Splatting from RGB and event streams. The LoCM-adapted event flow priors, event-Gaussian motion correspondence, and auxiliary strategies (motion decomposition, inter-frame pseudo-labels) are key to handling large inter-frame motion and leveraging high-temporal-resolution events.

Abstract: Reconstructing Dynamic 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) from low-framerate RGB
videos is challenging. This is because large inter-frame motions will increase
the uncertainty of the solution space. For example, one pixel in the first
frame might have more choices to reach the corresponding pixel in the second
frame. Event cameras can asynchronously capture rapid visual changes and are
robust to motion blur, but they do not provide color information. Intuitively,
the event stream can provide deterministic constraints for the inter-frame
large motion by the event trajectories. Hence, combining
low-temporal-resolution images with high-framerate event streams can address
this challenge. However, it is challenging to jointly optimize Dynamic 3DGS
using both RGB and event modalities due to the significant discrepancy between
these two data modalities. This paper introduces a novel framework that jointly
optimizes dynamic 3DGS from the two modalities. The key idea is to adopt event
motion priors to guide the optimization of the deformation fields. First, we
extract the motion priors encoded in event streams by using the proposed LoCM
unsupervised fine-tuning framework to adapt an event flow estimator to a
certain unseen scene. Then, we present the geometry-aware data association
method to build the event-Gaussian motion correspondence, which is the primary
foundation of the pipeline, accompanied by two useful strategies, namely motion
decomposition and inter-frame pseudo-label. Extensive experiments show that our
method outperforms existing image and event-based approaches across synthetic
and real scenes and prove that our method can effectively optimize dynamic 3DGS
with the help of event data.

TL;DR: ResUNet outperforms UNet and AttUNet for brain tumor segmentation on BraTS2020; Grad-CAM and attention visualizations improve interpretability; code and checkpoints available.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve segmentation accuracy and clinician trust in AI-assisted brain tumor segmentation by applying XAI methods to UNet-based models and comparing architectures on a public dataset.

Method: Train and evaluate three models (UNet, ResUNet, AttUNet) on BraTS2020 using the Adam optimizer on modern hardware; assess training/validation/inference times; compute segmentation similarity metrics (Dice, Jaccard) and other metrics (accuracy, recall, F1); apply Grad-CAM and attention-based visualizations to interpret decisions; compare architectures.

Result: ResUNet achieved the best Dice, Jaccard, accuracy, recall, and F1 scores; Grad-CAM revealed the subregions each model focused on; attention maps provided insights into AttUNet's attention modules; source code and checkpoints are available at the cited GitHub repository.

Conclusion: Recommend ResUNet for automated brain tumor segmentation in clinical assessments; the use of XAI techniques enhances interpretability and potentially physician trust; resources are publicly available for replication.

Abstract: The current study investigated the use of Explainable Artificial Intelligence
(XAI) to improve the accuracy of brain tumor segmentation in MRI images, with
the goal of assisting physicians in clinical decision-making. The study focused
on applying UNet models for brain tumor segmentation and using the XAI
techniques of Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) and
attention-based visualization to enhance the understanding of these models.
Three deep learning models - UNet, Residual UNet (ResUNet), and Attention UNet
(AttUNet) - were evaluated to identify the best-performing model. XAI was
employed with the aims of clarifying model decisions and increasing physicians'
trust in these models. We compared the performance of two UNet variants
(ResUNet and AttUNet) with the conventional UNet in segmenting brain tumors
from the BraTS2020 public dataset and analyzed model predictions with Grad-CAM
and attention-based visualization. Using the latest computer hardware, we
trained and validated each model using the Adam optimizer and assessed their
performance with respect to: (i) training, validation, and inference times,
(ii) segmentation similarity coefficients and loss functions, and (iii)
classification performance. Notably, during the final testing phase, ResUNet
outperformed the other models with respect to Dice and Jaccard similarity
scores, as well as accuracy, recall, and F1 scores. Grad-CAM provided
visuospatial insights into the tumor subregions each UNet model focused on
while attention-based visualization provided valuable insights into the working
mechanisms of AttUNet's attention modules. These results demonstrated ResUNet
as the best-performing model and we conclude by recommending its use for
automated brain tumor segmentation in future clinical assessments. Our source

*Qinghongbing Xie,Zhaoyuan Xia,Feng Zhu,Lijun Gong,Ziyue Li,Rui Zhao,Long Zeng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A new Geo-Temporal Reasoning benchmark (GTR-Bench) evaluates geo-spatial-temporal reasoning across maps and videos for moving targets in a large camera network; current VLMs lag behind humans and three major deficiencies are identified; benchmark and code are released.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate the spatial-temporal intelligence of visual-language models across both imagery/video data and geographic map data, addressing gaps in existing benchmarks that focus on either egocentric or map-only reasoning, with important applications in traffic management and emergency response.

Method: Design of GTR-Bench requiring perspective switches between maps and videos, joint reasoning across multiple non-overlapping video views, and inference over spatial-temporal regions unobserved by any single video; evaluation of more than 10 popular VLMs on the benchmark; comprehensive analysis of model behaviors.

Result: The best model (Gemini-2.5-Pro) scores 34.9% on geo-temporal reasoning, far below human performance at 78.61%; analysis reveals three key deficiencies: (1) imbalanced utilization of spatial-temporal context, (2) weak temporal forecasting, (3) poor ability to align/map data with multi-view video inputs.

Conclusion: GTR-Bench provides valuable insights and a new evaluation framework for advancing geo-temporal intelligence in VLMs; it highlights concrete research directions to improve context balancing, temporal forecasting, and map-video alignment; benchmark and code will be released publicly.

Abstract: Recently spatial-temporal intelligence of Visual-Language Models (VLMs) has
attracted much attention due to its importance for Autonomous Driving, Embodied
AI and General Artificial Intelligence. Existing spatial-temporal benchmarks
mainly focus on egocentric perspective reasoning with images/video context, or
geographic perspective reasoning with graphics context (eg. a map), thus fail
to assess VLMs' geographic spatial-temporal intelligence with both images/video
and graphics context, which is important for areas like traffic management and
emergency response. To address the gaps, we introduce Geo-Temporal Reasoning
benchmark (GTR-Bench), a novel challenge for geographic temporal reasoning of
moving targets in a large-scale camera network. GTR-Bench is more challenging
as it requires multiple perspective switches between maps and videos, joint
reasoning across multiple videos with non-overlapping fields of view, and
inference over spatial-temporal regions that are unobserved by any video
context. Evaluations of more than 10 popular VLMs on GTR-Bench demonstrate that
even the best proprietary model, Gemini-2.5-Pro (34.9%), significantly lags
behind human performance (78.61%) on geo-temporal reasoning. Moreover, our
comprehensive analysis on GTR-Bench reveals three primary deficiencies of
current models for geo-temporal reasoning. (1) VLMs' reasoning is impaired by
an imbalanced utilization of spatial-temporal context. (2) VLMs are weak in
temporal forecasting, which leads to worse performance on temporal-emphasized
tasks than on spatial-emphasized tasks. (3) VLMs lack the proficiency to
comprehend or align the map data with multi-view video inputs. We believe
GTR-Bench offers valuable insights and opens up new opportunities for research
and applications in spatial-temporal intelligence. Benchmark and code will be
released at https://github.com/X-Luffy/GTR-Bench.

### [29] [FMANet: A Novel Dual-Phase Optical Flow Approach with Fusion Motion Attention Network for Robust Micro-expression Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07810)
*Luu Tu Nguyen,Vu Tram Anh Khuong,Thi Bich Phuong Man,Thi Duyen Ngo,Thanh Ha Le*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes MM-COF, a dual-phase optical flow descriptor, and FMANet, an end-to-end network for micro-expression recognition, achieving state-of-the-art results on major benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Micro-expressions are brief and subtle; existing optical-flow-based methods often ignore apex-to-offset motion, limiting performance; a learnable dual-phase representation could improve recognition.

Method: Introduce MM-COF combining onset-apex and apex-offset motion with magnitude modulation; build FMANet to learn dual-phase fusion and focus on salient regions.

Result: Outperforms existing methods on MMEW, SMIC, CASME-II, and SAMM datasets.

Conclusion: A learnable, dual-phase framework with magnitude-modulated optical flow is effective for micro-expression recognition, suggesting future dual-phase motion representations.

Abstract: Facial micro-expressions, characterized by their subtle and brief nature, are
valuable indicators of genuine emotions. Despite their significance in
psychology, security, and behavioral analysis, micro-expression recognition
remains challenging due to the difficulty of capturing subtle facial movements.
Optical flow has been widely employed as an input modality for this task due to
its effectiveness. However, most existing methods compute optical flow only
between the onset and apex frames, thereby overlooking essential motion
information in the apex-to-offset phase. To address this limitation, we first
introduce a comprehensive motion representation, termed Magnitude-Modulated
Combined Optical Flow (MM-COF), which integrates motion dynamics from both
micro-expression phases into a unified descriptor suitable for direct use in
recognition networks. Building upon this principle, we then propose FMANet, a
novel end-to-end neural network architecture that internalizes the dual-phase
analysis and magnitude modulation into learnable modules. This allows the
network to adaptively fuse motion cues and focus on salient facial regions for
classification. Experimental evaluations on the MMEW, SMIC, CASME-II, and SAMM
datasets, widely recognized as standard benchmarks, demonstrate that our
proposed MM-COF representation and FMANet outperforms existing methods,
underscoring the potential of a learnable, dual-phase framework in advancing
micro-expression recognition.

*Kanglin Ning,Ruzhao Chen,Penghong Wang,Xingtao Wang,Ruiqin Xiong,Xiaopeng Fan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Geometry-guided depth estimation for 360° indoor panoramas that uses room layout and background segmentation to resolve background depth and fuse it with coarse depth, achieving superior results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing monocular 360° depth methods focus on pixel-level accuracy, leading to oversmoothed room corners and sensitivity to noise. Incorporating room geometry can improve depth estimation in panoramic indoor scenes.

Method: A shared feature encoder feeds task-specific decoders for layout estimation, depth estimation, and background segmentation. The model adds (1) a room-geometry-based background depth resolving strategy that uses the layout and depth output to build a background depth map, and (2) a background-segmentation-guided fusion strategy that derives fusion weights from segmentation predictions to combine background and coarse depth maps.

Result: The approach achieves significantly superior performance over current open-source methods on Stanford2D3D, Matterport3D, and Structured3D datasets.

Conclusion: Integrating room geometry constraints via layout prediction and background segmentation in a multi-task framework improves depth estimation for 360° indoor panoramas and generalizes across major datasets.

Abstract: Predicting spherical pixel depth from monocular $360^{\circ}$ indoor
panoramas is critical for many vision applications. However, existing methods
focus on pixel-level accuracy, causing oversmoothed room corners and noise
sensitivity. In this paper, we propose a depth estimation framework based on
room geometry constraints, which extracts room geometry information through
layout prediction and integrates those information into the depth estimation
process through background segmentation mechanism. At the model level, our
framework comprises a shared feature encoder followed by task-specific decoders
for layout estimation, depth estimation, and background segmentation. The
shared encoder extracts multi-scale features, which are subsequently processed
by individual decoders to generate initial predictions: a depth map, a room
layout map, and a background segmentation map. Furthermore, our framework
incorporates two strategies: a room geometry-based background depth resolving
strategy and a background-segmentation-guided fusion mechanism. The proposed
room-geometry-based background depth resolving strategy leverages the room
layout and the depth decoder's output to generate the corresponding background
depth map. Then, a background-segmentation-guided fusion strategy derives
fusion weights for the background and coarse depth maps from the segmentation
decoder's predictions. Extensive experimental results on the Stanford2D3D,
Matterport3D and Structured3D datasets show that our proposed methods can
achieve significantly superior performance than current open-source methods.

### [31] [Enhancing Visual Prompting through Expanded Transformation Space and Overfitting Mitigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07823)
*Shohei Enomoto*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ACAVP enhances visual prompting with affine and color transforms plus additive prompts, and uses TrivialAugment to combat overfitting. This yields state-of-the-art VP accuracy across 12 datasets and two architectures with minimal inference overhead, and improves robustness to distribution shifts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Visual prompting (VP) is parameter-efficient but often lacks expressivity and is susceptible to overfitting as the number of prompt parameters grows. There is a need for richer transformations and effective data augmentation to close the performance gap with other adaptation methods.

Method: ACAVP introduces three complementary operations: (1) affine transformation to create task-specific prompt regions while preserving original image information, (2) color transformation to emphasize task-relevant features, and (3) additive prompts. To mitigate overfitting, the training employs TrivialAugment as a data augmentation strategy. The approach is evaluated on twelve diverse image classification datasets with two model architectures.

Result: ACAVP achieves state-of-the-art accuracy among VP methods, surpasses linear probing on average, and demonstrates superior robustness to distribution shifts, all with minimal inference overhead. In some datasets, gains of up to 12 percentage points are observed.

Conclusion: Appropriate data augmentation is universally beneficial for VP training. ACAVP provides enhanced expressivity for VP through affine and color transformations while maintaining efficiency, and TrivialAugment further boosts performance across VP methods.

Abstract: Visual prompting (VP) has emerged as a promising parameter-efficient
fine-tuning approach for adapting pre-trained vision models to downstream tasks
without modifying model parameters. Despite offering advantages like negligible
computational overhead and compatibility with black-box models, conventional VP
methods typically achieve lower accuracy than other adaptation approaches. Our
analysis reveals two critical limitations: the restricted expressivity of
simple additive transformation and a tendency toward overfitting when the
parameter count increases. To address these challenges, we propose ACAVP
(Affine, Color, and Additive Visual Prompting), which enhances VP's expressive
power by introducing complementary transformation operations: affine
transformation for creating task-specific prompt regions while preserving
original image information, and color transformation for emphasizing
task-relevant visual features. Additionally, we identify that overfitting is a
critical issue in VP training and introduce TrivialAugment as an effective data
augmentation, which not only benefits our approach but also significantly
improves existing VP methods, with performance gains of up to 12 percentage
points on certain datasets. This demonstrates that appropriate data
augmentation is universally beneficial for VP training. Extensive experiments
across twelve diverse image classification datasets with two different model
architectures demonstrate that ACAVP achieves state-of-the-art accuracy among
VP methods, surpasses linear probing in average accuracy, and exhibits superior
robustness to distribution shifts, all while maintaining minimal computational
overhead during inference.

TL;DR: MMHOI introduces a large-scale multi-human multi-object 3D HOI dataset with full 3D pose/shape for humans and objects, covering 12 everyday scenarios, 78 actions, and 14 interaction-specific body parts, and MMHOI-Net—a transformer-based model that jointly estimates 3D geometries and interactions using a dual-patch representation, achieving state-of-the-art results on MMHOI and CORE4D.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world HOI is highly complex, involving multiple humans and objects with causal, goal-directed, or cooperative interactions. Existing 3D HOI benchmarks cover only a fraction of these interactions, lacking complete 3D annotations and scalable models.

Method: Construct MMHOI with 12 everyday scenarios and provide complete 3D shape/pose annotations for every person and object, 78 action categories, and 14 interaction-specific body parts. Propose MMHOI-Net, an end-to-end transformer that jointly estimates human–object 3D geometries, their interactions, and actions. Introduce a structured dual-patch representation for modeling objects and their interactions, combined with action recognition to boost interaction prediction.

Result: MMHOI achieves comprehensive 3D HOI coverage and provides a robust testbed. MMHOI-Net delivers state-of-the-art performance in multi-HOI modeling, excelling in both recognition accuracy and reconstruction quality on MMHOI and the CORE4D datasets.

Conclusion: The dataset and model set a new benchmark for 3D HOI research, enabling richer evaluation and more accurate, reconstruction-friendly interactions; the dual-patch representation and joint action recognition contribute to superior interaction prediction.

Abstract: Real-world scenes often feature multiple humans interacting with multiple
objects in ways that are causal, goal-oriented, or cooperative. Yet existing 3D
human-object interaction (HOI) benchmarks consider only a fraction of these
complex interactions. To close this gap, we present MMHOI -- a large-scale,
Multi-human Multi-object Interaction dataset consisting of images from 12
everyday scenarios. MMHOI offers complete 3D shape and pose annotations for
every person and object, along with labels for 78 action categories and 14
interaction-specific body parts, providing a comprehensive testbed for
next-generation HOI research. Building on MMHOI, we present MMHOI-Net, an
end-to-end transformer-based neural network for jointly estimating human-object
3D geometries, their interactions, and associated actions. A key innovation in
our framework is a structured dual-patch representation for modeling objects
and their interactions, combined with action recognition to enhance the
interaction prediction. Experiments on MMHOI and the recently proposed CORE4D

*Houqiang Zhong,Zhenglong Wu,Sihua Fu,Zihan Zheng,Xin Jin,Xiaoyun Zhang,Li Song,Qiang Hu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PrismGS introduces two regularizers for 3D Gaussian Splatting to fix aliasing and instability in large-scale urban scenes: pyramidal multi-scale supervision enforcing anti-aliased, scale-consistent rendering, and an explicit size regularization ensuring a physically-grounded lower bound on Gaussian sizes. Plug-and-play with existing pipelines; achieves state-of-the-art results (~1.5 dB PSNR gain over CityGaussian) on MatrixCity, Mill-19, UrbanScene3D, especially under 4K rendering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D Gaussian Splatting struggles to scale to large urban environments due to fidelity gaps causing aliasing, flicker, and jagged edges. Existing divide-and-conquer approaches address scalability but not the underlying rendering fidelity. There is a need for regularization that aligns the intrinsic rendering behavior of Gaussians with multi-scale geometry.

Method: Introduce two regularizers: (1) pyramidal multi-scale supervision that compares rendered output to a pre-filtered image pyramid to induce anti-aliased, scale-consistent rendering; (2) explicit size regularization imposing a physically-grounded lower bound on 3D Gaussian dimensions to avoid degenerate, view-dependent primitives. The framework is plug-and-play with existing pipelines and evaluated on MatrixCity, Mill-19, UrbanScene3D.

Result: Significant PSNR gains (~1.5 dB) against CityGaussian while preserving quality and robustness under demanding 4K rendering. Demonstrates state-of-the-art performance and improved stability and anti-aliasing in large-scale, high-resolution scenes.

Conclusion: A physically-grounded regularization framework (PrismGS) improves the intrinsic rendering behavior of 3D Gaussian primitives by enforcing scale-consistent, anti-aliased rendering and preventing degenerate primitives, enabling stable, photorealistic 4K rendering in large urban scenes and offering a plug-and-play improvement over existing pipelines.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently enabled real-time photorealistic
rendering in compact scenes, but scaling to large urban environments introduces
severe aliasing artifacts and optimization instability, especially under
high-resolution (e.g., 4K) rendering. These artifacts, manifesting as
flickering textures and jagged edges, arise from the mismatch between Gaussian
primitives and the multi-scale nature of urban geometry. While existing
``divide-and-conquer'' pipelines address scalability, they fail to resolve this
fidelity gap. In this paper, we propose PrismGS, a physically-grounded
regularization framework that improves the intrinsic rendering behavior of 3D
Gaussians. PrismGS integrates two synergistic regularizers. The first is
pyramidal multi-scale supervision, which enforces consistency by supervising
the rendering against a pre-filtered image pyramid. This compels the model to
learn an inherently anti-aliased representation that remains coherent across
different viewing scales, directly mitigating flickering textures. This is
complemented by an explicit size regularization that imposes a
physically-grounded lower bound on the dimensions of the 3D Gaussians. This
prevents the formation of degenerate, view-dependent primitives, leading to
more stable and plausible geometric surfaces and reducing jagged edges. Our
method is plug-and-play and compatible with existing pipelines. Extensive
experiments on MatrixCity, Mill-19, and UrbanScene3D demonstrate that PrismGS
achieves state-of-the-art performance, yielding significant PSNR gains around
1.5 dB against CityGaussian, while maintaining its superior quality and
robustness under demanding 4K rendering.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bridge communication between hearing and speech-impaired individuals and others; enable educational tools and sign-prompt interfaces; reduce latency and error propagation by avoiding text intermediates in multi-stage pipelines.

Method: IsoSignVid2Aud framework: I3D-based feature extraction, a feature transformation network, and an audio generation pipeline, with a novel Non-Maximal Suppression (NMS) algorithm for temporal detection of signs in non-grammatic continuous sequences; end-to-end architecture not requiring intermediate textual representations.

Result: Top-1 accuracies: 72.01% on ASL-Citizen-1500 and 78.67% on WLASL-100; audio quality metrics PESQ 2.67 and STOI 0.73, indicating intelligible speech output; code available at the provided GitHub link.

Conclusion: Demonstrates feasibility of end-to-end sign-language-to-audio translation without intermediate text, offering reduced latency and fewer cascading errors; suitable for education and sign-prompt interfaces; future work could address broader vocabularies, continuous grammatical signing, and real-time performance.

Abstract: Sign language to spoken language audio translation is important to connect
the hearing- and speech-challenged humans with others. We consider sign
language videos with isolated sign sequences rather than continuous grammatical
signing. Such videos are useful in educational applications and sign prompt
interfaces. Towards this, we propose IsoSignVid2Aud, a novel end-to-end
framework that translates sign language videos with a sequence of possibly
non-grammatic continuous signs to speech without requiring intermediate text
representation, providing immediate communication benefits while avoiding the
latency and cascading errors inherent in multi-stage translation systems. Our
approach combines an I3D-based feature extraction module with a specialized
feature transformation network and an audio generation pipeline, utilizing a
novel Non-Maximal Suppression (NMS) algorithm for the temporal detection of
signs in non-grammatic continuous sequences. Experimental results demonstrate
competitive performance on ASL-Citizen-1500 and WLASL-100 datasets with Top-1
accuracies of 72.01\% and 78.67\%, respectively, and audio quality metrics
(PESQ: 2.67, STOI: 0.73) indicating intelligible speech output. Code is

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AlignGS proposes end-to-end geometry-semantics optimization for sparse-view indoor scene reconstruction, using semantic priors from 2D foundation models to regularize 3D geometry via depth consistency and normal regularization, achieving state-of-the-art novel view synthesis and improved geometric accuracy; code released.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Semantic understanding should actively guide 3D reconstruction from sparse views to resolve geometric ambiguities, leveraging rich priors from 2D foundation models to regularize 3D representations.

Method: End-to-end optimization jointly optimizes geometry and semantics. Introduces semantic-to-geometry guidance mechanisms such as depth consistency constraints and multi-faceted normal regularization, distilling priors from 2D foundation models to regularize the 3D representation.

Result: State-of-the-art performance on novel view synthesis benchmarks and superior geometric accuracy; reconstructions are more coherent and complete from limited input views.

Conclusion: Leveraging semantic priors as geometric regularizers improves 3D reconstruction quality from sparse views; AlignGS demonstrates effective synergy between 2D semantic priors and 3D geometry in indoor scenes; code available for reproduction.

Abstract: The demand for semantically rich 3D models of indoor scenes is rapidly
growing, driven by applications in augmented reality, virtual reality, and
robotics. However, creating them from sparse views remains a challenge due to
geometric ambiguity. Existing methods often treat semantics as a passive
feature painted on an already-formed, and potentially flawed, geometry. We
posit that for robust sparse-view reconstruction, semantic understanding
instead be an active, guiding force. This paper introduces AlignGS, a novel
framework that actualizes this vision by pioneering a synergistic, end-to-end
optimization of geometry and semantics. Our method distills rich priors from 2D
foundation models and uses them to directly regularize the 3D representation
through a set of novel semantic-to-geometry guidance mechanisms, including
depth consistency and multi-faceted normal regularization. Extensive
evaluations on standard benchmarks demonstrate that our approach achieves
state-of-the-art results in novel view synthesis and produces reconstructions
with superior geometric accuracy. The results validate that leveraging semantic
priors as a geometric regularizer leads to more coherent and complete 3D models
from limited input views. Our code is avaliable at

Motivation: To enable fast, cost-effective, automated toxicity screening by learning robust phenotypic representations that can separate different toxicant modes-of-action, addressing limitations of labeled data and manual scoring.

Method: Apply self-supervised learning on the EmbryoNet dataset (ten zebrafish embryo phenotypes elicited by various chemicals) to learn representations; assess their ability to distinguish MOAs of compounds; discuss integration with a physical toxicity testing device in the TOXBOX project.

Result: Self-supervised representations effectively distinguish between modes-of-action of different compounds, demonstrated in a proof-of-concept using EmbryoNet data; supports the feasibility of ML-based phenotype analysis for high-throughput toxicity screening.

Conclusion: SSL-derived representations are suitable for capturing toxicant-induced phenotypic changes and can be integrated with ML-enabled toxicity devices (TOXBOX), paving the way for scalable, automated toxicity testing; future work may focus on deployment and broader MOA coverage.

Abstract: High-throughput toxicity testing offers a fast and cost-effective way to test
large amounts of compounds. A key component for such systems is the automated
evaluation via machine learning models. In this paper, we address critical
challenges in this domain and demonstrate how representations learned via
self-supervised learning can effectively identify toxicant-induced changes. We
provide a proof-of-concept that utilizes the publicly available EmbryoNet
dataset, which contains ten zebrafish embryo phenotypes elicited by various
chemical compounds targeting different processes in early embryonic
development. Our analysis shows that the learned representations using
self-supervised learning are suitable for effectively distinguishing between
the modes-of-action of different compounds. Finally, we discuss the integration
of machine learning models in a physical toxicity testing device in the context
of the TOXBOX project.

*Fevziye Irem Eyiokur,Dogucan Yaman,Hazım Kemal Ekenel,Alexander Waibel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A depth-aware ERU framework that fuses language cues, embodied pointing, and depth maps via LLM-based data augmentation to disambiguate referents in cluttered scenes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ambiguity in scenes with multiple candidate objects and limitations of open-vocabulary detectors in such settings motivate a deeper integration of linguistic and embodied cues, including depth information.

Method: Proposes an ERU architecture that (1) augments data with LLM-based generation, (2) incorporates depth-map modality, (3) uses a depth-aware decision module to combine language and pointing cues for referent selection.

Result: On two datasets, the approach significantly outperforms baselines, delivering more accurate and reliable referent detection in complex environments.

Conclusion: Depth-aware fusion with LLM-driven augmentation improves embodied reference understanding and robust disambiguation in cluttered scenes, suggesting promising directions for integrating multimodal cues in ERU.

Abstract: Embodied Reference Understanding requires identifying a target object in a
visual scene based on both language instructions and pointing cues. While prior
works have shown progress in open-vocabulary object detection, they often fail
in ambiguous scenarios where multiple candidate objects exist in the scene. To
address these challenges, we propose a novel ERU framework that jointly
leverages LLM-based data augmentation, depth-map modality, and a depth-aware
decision module. This design enables robust integration of linguistic and
embodied cues, improving disambiguation in complex or cluttered environments.
Experimental results on two datasets demonstrate that our approach
significantly outperforms existing baselines, achieving more accurate and
reliable referent detection.

### [38] [XYZCylinder: Feedforward Reconstruction for Driving Scenes Based on A Unified Cylinder Lifting Method](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07856)
*Haochen Yu,Qiankun Liu,Hongyuan Liu,Jianfei Jiang,Juntao Lyu,Jiansheng Chen,Huimin Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: XYZCylinder introduces a unified cylinder-based feedforward framework (UCCM + CPFG) to improve generalization across camera configurations and reconstruction accuracy for 360° driving scenes, achieving state-of-the-art results and zero-shot transfer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current feedforward reconstruction methods struggle to generalize across different camera configurations and face limited reconstruction accuracy due to small overlaps in 360° panoramic views and the cluttered nature of driving scenes.

Method: Proposes Unified Cylinder Camera Modeling (UCCM) to unify diverse camera rigs with adjustable parameters and avoids learning viewpoint-dependent correspondences. Introduces Cylinder Plane Feature Group (CPFG) to lift 2D image features into 3D space, forming a hybrid representation with dedicated modules for improved reconstruction under a cylinder lifting framework.

Result: Experimental results show state-of-the-art performance under various evaluation settings and zero-shot generalization to other driving scenes.

Conclusion: XYZCylinder demonstrates improved generalization and reconstruction accuracy in driving-scene reconstructions by leveraging a cylinder-based feedforward paradigm with UCCM and CPFG, achieving strong zero-shot transfer and pointing to robustness across camera configurations.

Abstract: Recently, more attention has been paid to feedforward reconstruction
paradigms, which mainly learn a fixed view transformation implicitly and
reconstruct the scene with a single representation. However, their
generalization capability and reconstruction accuracy are still limited while
reconstructing driving scenes, which results from two aspects: (1) The fixed
view transformation fails when the camera configuration changes, limiting the
generalization capability across different driving scenes equipped with
different camera configurations. (2) The small overlapping regions between
sparse views of the $360^\circ$ panorama and the complexity of driving scenes
increase the learning difficulty, reducing the reconstruction accuracy. To
handle these difficulties, we propose \textbf{XYZCylinder}, a feedforward model
based on a unified cylinder lifting method which involves camera modeling and
feature lifting. Specifically, to improve the generalization capability, we
design a Unified Cylinder Camera Modeling (UCCM) strategy, which avoids the
learning of viewpoint-dependent spatial correspondence and unifies different
camera configurations with adjustable parameters. To improve the reconstruction
accuracy, we propose a hybrid representation with several dedicated modules
based on newly designed Cylinder Plane Feature Group (CPFG) to lift 2D image
features to 3D space. Experimental results show that XYZCylinder achieves
state-of-the-art performance under different evaluation settings, and can be
generalized to other driving scenes in a zero-shot manner. Project page:

### [39] [Gaze on the Prize: Shaping Visual Attention with Return-Guided Contrastive Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08442)
*Andrew Lee,Ian Chuang,Dechen Gao,Kai Fukazawa,Iman Soltani*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Gaze on the Prize adds a learnable foveal attention mechanism guided by return-driven self-supervised contrastive learning, improving sample efficiency and enabling solving ManiSkill3 tasks without changing base RL algorithms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Visual RL on high-dimensional images wastes resources on task-irrelevant pixels. A human-like foveation mechanism guided by what matters for returns can improve data efficiency and stability.

Method: Introduce Gaze, a learnable attention module that uses return-guided contrastive learning. Group representations into positives/negatives based on return differences, form contrastive triplets, and train the attention to produce distinct representations for states linked to different outcomes. The signal is self-supervised from the agent's experience and does not alter the base algorithm or hyperparameters.

Result: Achieves up to 2.4x improvement in sample efficiency and solves tasks the baseline fails to learn, demonstrated across ManiSkill3 manipulation tasks without modifying the underlying algorithm or hyperparameters.

Conclusion: Return-guided foveation enables focusing on task-relevant visual features through self-supervised contrastive signals, improving data efficiency and stability in visual RL and showing strong empirical gains on ManiSkill3.

Abstract: Visual Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents must learn to act based on
high-dimensional image data where only a small fraction of the pixels is
task-relevant. This forces agents to waste exploration and computational
resources on irrelevant features, leading to sample-inefficient and unstable
learning. To address this, inspired by human visual foveation, we introduce
Gaze on the Prize. This framework augments visual RL with a learnable foveal
attention mechanism (Gaze), guided by a self-supervised signal derived from the
agent's experience pursuing higher returns (the Prize). Our key insight is that
return differences reveal what matters most: If two similar representations
produce different outcomes, their distinguishing features are likely
task-relevant, and the gaze should focus on them accordingly. This is realized
through return-guided contrastive learning that trains the attention to
distinguish between the features relevant to success and failure. We group
similar visual representations into positives and negatives based on their
return differences and use the resulting labels to construct contrastive
triplets. These triplets provide the training signal that teaches the attention
mechanism to produce distinguishable representations for states associated with
different outcomes. Our method achieves up to 2.4x improvement in sample
efficiency and can solve tasks that the baseline fails to learn, demonstrated
across a suite of manipulation tasks from the ManiSkill3 benchmark, all without
modifying the underlying algorithm or hyperparameters.

*Peiran Wu,Zhuorui Yu,Yunze Liu,Chi-Hao Wu,Enmin Zhou,Junxiao Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MARC reduces video token usage by memory-augmented RL-based distillation with a retrieve-then-compress strategy, achieving near-baseline accuracy using tokens from a single frame.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Video-language models face high computational costs due to high frame rates and long durations; efficient token compression without significant information loss is needed for real-time understanding in resource-constrained settings.

Method: A retrieve-then-compress pipeline using a Visual Memory Retriever (VMR) to select salient key clips, and a Compression Group Relative Policy Optimization (C-GRPO) framework to distill reasoning from a teacher to a student model via reinforcement learning-based distillation.

Result: Across six video benchmarks, MARC achieves near-baseline accuracy using tokens from only one frame, while reducing visual tokens by 95%, GPU memory by 72%, and latency by 23.9%.

Conclusion: MARC demonstrates the potential for efficient, real-time video understanding in resource-constrained environments such as video QA, surveillance, and autonomous driving; it offers a practical path to deploy VLMs for videos with limited compute.

Abstract: The rapid progress of large language models (LLMs) has laid the foundation
for multimodal models. However, visual language models (VLMs) still face heavy
computational costs when extended from images to videos due to high frame rates
and long durations. Token compression is a promising solution, yet most
existing training-free methods cause information loss and performance
degradation. To overcome this, we propose \textbf{Memory-Augmented
Reinforcement Learning-based Token Compression (MARC)}, which integrates
structured retrieval and RL-based distillation. MARC adopts a
\textit{retrieve-then-compress} strategy using a \textbf{Visual Memory
Retriever (VMR)} to select key clips and a \textbf{Compression Group Relative
Policy Optimization (C-GRPO)} framework to distil reasoning ability from a
teacher to a student model. Experiments on six video benchmarks show that MARC
achieves near-baseline accuracy using only one frame's tokens -- reducing
visual tokens by \textbf{95\%}, GPU memory by \textbf{72\%}, and latency by
\textbf{23.9\%}. This demonstrates its potential for efficient, real-time video
understanding in resource-constrained settings such as video QA, surveillance,
and autonomous driving.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Semantic-scene-graph based deep compression for LiDAR point clouds achieves dramatic data size reductions (up to ~98%), while preserving structure and semantics, enabling effective downstream multi-robot tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address bandwidth constraints and intermittent connectivity in centralized and decentralized multi-agent robotics, especially with edge/cloud processing, where the large size and complexity of point clouds degrades performance.

Method: Decompose point clouds into semantically coherent patches and encode them into compact latent representations using semantic-aware encoders conditioned by FiLM. A folding-based decoder, guided by latent features and graph node attributes, reconstructs structurally accurate point clouds from the latent representations.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art compression rates, reducing data size by up to 98% while preserving both structural and semantic fidelity. Supports downstream tasks such as multi-robot pose graph optimization and map merging, with trajectory accuracy and map alignment comparable to raw LiDAR scans.

Conclusion: The framework enables efficient transmission of 3D point clouds for multi-agent perception pipelines, maintaining performance for downstream tasks and enabling edge/cloud processing.

Abstract: Efficient transmission of 3D point cloud data is critical for advanced
perception in centralized and decentralized multi-agent robotic systems,
especially nowadays with the growing reliance on edge and cloud-based
processing. However, the large and complex nature of point clouds creates
challenges under bandwidth constraints and intermittent connectivity, often
degrading system performance. We propose a deep compression framework based on
semantic scene graphs. The method decomposes point clouds into semantically
coherent patches and encodes them into compact latent representations with
semantic-aware encoders conditioned by Feature-wise Linear Modulation (FiLM). A
folding-based decoder, guided by latent features and graph node attributes,
enables structurally accurate reconstruction. Experiments on the SemanticKITTI
and nuScenes datasets show that the framework achieves state-of-the-art
compression rates, reducing data size by up to 98% while preserving both
structural and semantic fidelity. In addition, it supports downstream
applications such as multi-robot pose graph optimization and map merging,
achieving trajectory accuracy and map alignment comparable to those obtained
with raw LiDAR scans.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ASBench is a comprehensive benchmarking framework for evaluating anomaly-synthesis methods in manufacturing anomaly detection, introducing four evaluation dimensions and revealing current methods’ limitations while suggesting future research directions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Anomaly detection in manufacturing is hampered by few abnormal samples and high annotation costs. Although anomaly synthesis could help, existing work lacks systematic, dataset-diverse evaluation and fails to decouple synthesis impact from detection performance.

Method: Introduce ASBench with four evaluation axes: (i) generalization across datasets/pipelines, (ii) synthetic/real data ratio, (iii) correlation between intrinsic synthesis metrics and detection performance, (iv) strategies for hybrid anomaly synthesis. Conduct extensive experiments to benchmark existing anomaly-synthesis methods and derive actionable insights.

Result: ASBench exposes limitations in current anomaly-synthesis approaches, demonstrates how evaluation across the proposed dimensions yields clearer insights into generalization and metric relationships, and provides practical guidance for future research directions in anomaly synthesis.

Conclusion: ASBench is the first comprehensive benchmark for anomaly-synthesis methods in manufacturing, enabling rigorous, cross-domain evaluation and guiding future improvements in anomaly synthesis techniques.

Abstract: Anomaly detection plays a pivotal role in manufacturing quality control, yet
its application is constrained by limited abnormal samples and high manual
annotation costs. While anomaly synthesis offers a promising solution, existing
studies predominantly treat anomaly synthesis as an auxiliary component within
anomaly detection frameworks, lacking systematic evaluation of anomaly
synthesis algorithms. Current research also overlook crucial factors specific
to anomaly synthesis, such as decoupling its impact from detection,
quantitative analysis of synthetic data and adaptability across different
scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose ASBench, the first
comprehensive benchmarking framework dedicated to evaluating anomaly synthesis
methods. Our framework introduces four critical evaluation dimensions: (i) the
generalization performance across different datasets and pipelines (ii) the
ratio of synthetic to real data (iii) the correlation between intrinsic metrics
of synthesis images and anomaly detection performance metrics , and (iv)
strategies for hybrid anomaly synthesis methods. Through extensive experiments,
ASBench not only reveals limitations in current anomaly synthesis methods but
also provides actionable insights for future research directions in anomaly
synthesis

### [43] [Dream to Recall: Imagination-Guided Experience Retrieval for Memory-Persistent Vision-and-Language Navigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08553)
*Yunzhe Xu,Yiyuan Pan,Zhe Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Memoir uses an imagination-guided memory retrieval framework to augment memory-persistent Vision-and-Language Navigation by retrieving environmental observations and navigation behavioral histories via a language-conditioned world model and a hybrid viewpoint-level memory, enabling an experience-augmented navigator.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current memory-persistent VLN methods struggle with memory access: they often ingest entire memories or use fixed horizons, and largely store only environmental observations while overlooking navigation strategies encoded in behavior.

Method: Memoir consists of: (1) a language-conditioned world model that imagines future states to encode experiences for storage and to generate retrieval queries; (2) Hybrid Viewpoint-Level Memory that anchors both observations and behavioral patterns to viewpoints for hybrid retrieval; (3) an experience-augmented navigation model that integrates retrieved knowledge via specialized encoders.

Result: Evaluated across 10 memory-persistent VLN benchmarks with 10 testing scenarios, Memoir yields consistent improvements, including a 5.4% absolute SPL gain on IR2R over the best memory-persistent baseline, 8.3x training speedup, and 74% inference memory reduction. Analyses indicate the approach has substantial headroom (about 73.3% vs 93.4% upper bound) for this imagination-guided paradigm.

Conclusion: Predictive retrieval of both environmental and behavioral memories via imagination-guided memory retrieval improves navigation effectiveness in memory-persistent VLN, with strong performance gains and efficiency benefits; the authors provide code for replication.

Abstract: Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) requires agents to follow natural
language instructions through environments, with memory-persistent variants
demanding progressive improvement through accumulated experience. Existing
approaches for memory-persistent VLN face critical limitations: they lack
effective memory access mechanisms, instead relying on entire memory
incorporation or fixed-horizon lookup, and predominantly store only
environmental observations while neglecting navigation behavioral patterns that
encode valuable decision-making strategies. We present Memoir, which employs
imagination as a retrieval mechanism grounded by explicit memory: a world model
imagines future navigation states as queries to selectively retrieve relevant
environmental observations and behavioral histories. The approach comprises: 1)
a language-conditioned world model that imagines future states serving dual
purposes: encoding experiences for storage and generating retrieval queries; 2)
Hybrid Viewpoint-Level Memory that anchors both observations and behavioral
patterns to viewpoints, enabling hybrid retrieval; and 3) an
experience-augmented navigation model that integrates retrieved knowledge
through specialized encoders. Extensive evaluation across diverse
memory-persistent VLN benchmarks with 10 distinctive testing scenarios
demonstrates Memoir's effectiveness: significant improvements across all
scenarios, with 5.4% SPL gains on IR2R over the best memory-persistent
baseline, accompanied by 8.3x training speedup and 74% inference memory
reduction. The results validate that predictive retrieval of both environmental
and behavioral memories enables more effective navigation, with analysis
indicating substantial headroom (73.3% vs 93.4% upper bound) for this
imagination-guided paradigm. Code at https://github.com/xyz9911/Memoir.

*Leigang Qu,Ziyang Wang,Na Zheng,Wenjie Wang,Liqiang Nie,Tat-Seng Chua*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TTOM is a training-free framework for video foundation models that performs test-time optimization and uses a parametric memory to align generated videos with spatiotemporal layouts, enabling on-the-fly, cross-modal (text-video) compositional generation without fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address shortcomings of video foundation models in compositional scenarios (motion, numeracy, spatial relations) and the need for training-free adaptation and memory for streaming video generation.

Method: Introduce Test-Time Optimization and Memorization (TTOM). Add new optimization parameters guided by a general layout-attention objective during inference, avoiding per-sample latent/attention edits. Employ a streaming video generation setup with a parametric memory capable of insert/read/update/delete to maintain and utilize historical optimization contexts.

Result: TTOM achieves effective, scalable, and efficient cross-modal alignment for compositional video generation in a training-free, on-the-fly manner, with experiments on T2V-CompBench and Vbench demonstrating improved alignment and generalization.

Conclusion: TTOM disentangles compositional world knowledge, offering strong transferability and generalization across tasks, thanks to its memory-based, training-free optimization framework for video generation.

Abstract: Video Foundation Models (VFMs) exhibit remarkable visual generation
performance, but struggle in compositional scenarios (e.g., motion, numeracy,
and spatial relation). In this work, we introduce Test-Time Optimization and
Memorization (TTOM), a training-free framework that aligns VFM outputs with
spatiotemporal layouts during inference for better text-image alignment. Rather
than direct intervention to latents or attention per-sample in existing work,
we integrate and optimize new parameters guided by a general layout-attention
objective. Furthermore, we formulate video generation within a streaming
setting, and maintain historical optimization contexts with a parametric memory
mechanism that supports flexible operations, such as insert, read, update, and
delete. Notably, we found that TTOM disentangles compositional world knowledge,
showing powerful transferability and generalization. Experimental results on
the T2V-CompBench and Vbench benchmarks establish TTOM as an effective,
practical, scalable, and efficient framework to achieve cross-modal alignment
for compositional video generation on the fly.

### [45] [ResAD: Normalized Residual Trajectory Modeling for End-to-End Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08562)
*Zhiyu Zheng,Shaoyu Chen,Haoran Yin,Xinbang Zhang,Jialv Zou,Xinggang Wang,Qian Zhang,Lefei Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ResAD reframes end-to-end autonomous driving as residual learning from an inertial reference, using point-wise normalization to handle spatio-temporal data imbalance; achieves state-of-the-art PDMS on NAVSIM with a diffusion policy using only 2 denoising steps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: End-to-end driving data suffer from intrinsic spatio-temporal imbalance in trajectories, leading to optimization burden, spurious correlations, and safety risks due to long-horizon uncertainty.

Method: Predict the residual deviation from a deterministic inertial reference (a counterfactual path). This forces the model to capture causal factors behind deviations. Apply point-wise normalization to the predicted residual to reweight the loss and mitigate large-errors from distant, uncertain waypoints. Evaluation used a vanilla diffusion policy with two denoising steps; code will be released.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art PDMS of 88.6 on the NAVSIM benchmark.

Conclusion: ResAD reduces learning difficulty and improves performance by focusing on residuals relative to an inertial baseline, addressing spatio-temporal optimization imbalance and emphasizing causal deviations.

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving (E2EAD) systems, which learn to predict future
trajectories directly from sensor data, are fundamentally challenged by the
inherent spatio-temporal imbalance of trajectory data. This imbalance creates a
significant optimization burden, causing models to learn spurious correlations
instead of causal inference, while also prioritizing uncertain, distant
predictions, thereby compromising immediate safety. To address these issues, we
propose ResAD, a novel Normalized Residual Trajectory Modeling framework.
Instead of predicting the future trajectory directly, our approach reframes the
learning task to predict the residual deviation from a deterministic inertial
reference. The inertial reference serves as a counterfactual, forcing the model
to move beyond simple pattern recognition and instead identify the underlying
causal factors (e.g., traffic rules, obstacles) that necessitate deviations
from a default, inertially-guided path. To deal with the optimization imbalance
caused by uncertain, long-term horizons, ResAD further incorporates Point-wise
Normalization of the predicted residual. It re-weights the optimization
objective, preventing large-magnitude errors associated with distant, uncertain
waypoints from dominating the learning signal. Extensive experiments validate
the effectiveness of our framework. On the NAVSIM benchmark, ResAD achieves a
state-of-the-art PDMS of 88.6 using a vanilla diffusion policy with only two
denoising steps, demonstrating that our approach significantly simplifies the
learning task and improves model performance. The code will be released to
facilitate further research.

TL;DR: CVD-STORM: a cross-view video diffusion model that uses a 4D reconstruction VAE fine-tuned for spatial-temporal encoding, integrated into the diffusion process to produce long-term, multi-view videos with 4D capabilities under control inputs; shows improved FID/FVD and gains geometric cues via a Gaussian Splatting Decoder.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autonomous driving requires high-fidelity controllable video generation plus depth/3D information; existing models struggle with long-term, multi-view consistency and 4D reasoning (space and time).

Method: 1) Fine-tune a spatial-temporal reconstruction VAE with an auxiliary 4D reconstruction task to better encode 3D structure and temporal dynamics. 2) Integrate this VAE into a video diffusion framework to enhance generation quality. 3) Employ a jointly-trained Gaussian Splatting Decoder to reconstruct dynamic scenes and provide geometric information.

Result: Significant improvements in FID and FVD metrics over baselines; the Gaussian Splatting Decoder effectively reconstructs dynamic scenes and yields useful geometric information for scene understanding.

Conclusion: The CVD-STORM framework advances long-term, multi-view video generation with 4D reconstruction under various controls, with improved perceptual quality and explicit geometric cues that facilitate comprehensive scene understanding in autonomous-driving contexts.

Abstract: Generative models have been widely applied to world modeling for environment
simulation and future state prediction. With advancements in autonomous
driving, there is a growing demand not only for high-fidelity video generation
under various controls, but also for producing diverse and meaningful
information such as depth estimation. To address this, we propose CVD-STORM, a
cross-view video diffusion model utilizing a spatial-temporal reconstruction
Variational Autoencoder (VAE) that generates long-term, multi-view videos with
4D reconstruction capabilities under various control inputs. Our approach first
fine-tunes the VAE with an auxiliary 4D reconstruction task, enhancing its
ability to encode 3D structures and temporal dynamics. Subsequently, we
integrate this VAE into the video diffusion process to significantly improve
generation quality. Experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves
substantial improvements in both FID and FVD metrics. Additionally, the
jointly-trained Gaussian Splatting Decoder effectively reconstructs dynamic
scenes, providing valuable geometric information for comprehensive scene
understanding.

TL;DR: AnimeText is a large-scale dataset for anime scene text detection (735K images, 4.2M text blocks) with hierarchical annotations and hard negatives; models trained on it outperform those trained on existing datasets in anime text detection, as shown by cross-dataset benchmarking; available on HuggingFace.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing text-detection datasets target natural/document scenes with regular fonts and layouts; anime text is diverse, irregular, and confusable with complex visuals; a domain-specific dataset is needed to improve robustness and accuracy in anime scenes.

Method: Constructed a large-scale anime text dataset with 735K images and 4.2M annotated text blocks, featuring hierarchical annotations and hard negative samples tailored to anime. Performed cross-dataset benchmarking using state-of-the-art text detection methods to compare performance with models trained on existing datasets.

Result: Models trained on AnimeText achieve superior performance on anime text detection tasks compared to models trained on existing datasets, as shown by cross-dataset evaluations.

Conclusion: AnimeText fills a critical gap for anime scene text detection, enabling more robust and accurate recognition; the dataset is publicly available (HuggingFace) for research and benchmarking.

Abstract: Current text detection datasets primarily target natural or document scenes,
where text typically appear in regular font and shapes, monotonous colors, and
orderly layouts. The text usually arranged along straight or curved lines.
However, these characteristics differ significantly from anime scenes, where
text is often diverse in style, irregularly arranged, and easily confused with
complex visual elements such as symbols and decorative patterns. Text in anime
scene also includes a large number of handwritten and stylized fonts. Motivated
by this gap, we introduce AnimeText, a large-scale dataset containing 735K
images and 4.2M annotated text blocks. It features hierarchical annotations and
hard negative samples tailored for anime scenarios. %Cross-dataset evaluations
using state-of-the-art methods demonstrate that models trained on AnimeText
achieve superior performance in anime text detection tasks compared to existing
datasets. To evaluate the robustness of AnimeText in complex anime scenes, we
conducted cross-dataset benchmarking using state-of-the-art text detection
methods. Experimental results demonstrate that models trained on AnimeText

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduces SimCast training and CasCast diffusion-based framework to improve precipitation nowcasting by prioritizing heavy rainfall and combining short-to-long term knowledge distillation with a diffusion model; achieves state-of-the-art CSI on three benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate nowcasting is critical for societal needs but is hard due to Earth system complexity; aims to understand how prediction horizons affect models and to improve accuracy without extra inference cost.

Method: SimCast uses short-to-long term knowledge distillation and a weighted MSE loss to emphasize heavy rainfall regions; generates deterministic predictions. CasCast extends to a diffusion-based probabilistic framework to reduce blurriness and distribution shift in outputs.

Result: On SEVIR, HKO-7, and MeteoNet, mean CSI scores 0.452, 0.474, and 0.361 respectively; outperforming existing approaches by a significant margin.

Conclusion: The proposed pipeline improves nowcasting performance and provides a practical way to leverage both deterministic and probabilistic modeling for rainfall nowcasting without added inference overhead.

Abstract: Precipitation nowcasting predicts future radar sequences based on current
observations, which is a highly challenging task driven by the inherent
complexity of the Earth system. Accurate nowcasting is of utmost importance for
addressing various societal needs, including disaster management, agriculture,
transportation, and energy optimization. As a complementary to existing
non-autoregressive nowcasting approaches, we investigate the impact of
prediction horizons on nowcasting models and propose SimCast, a novel training
pipeline featuring a short-to-long term knowledge distillation technique
coupled with a weighted MSE loss to prioritize heavy rainfall regions. Improved
nowcasting predictions can be obtained without introducing additional overhead
during inference. As SimCast generates deterministic predictions, we further
integrate it into a diffusion-based framework named CasCast, leveraging the
strengths from probabilistic models to overcome limitations such as blurriness
and distribution shift in deterministic outputs. Extensive experimental results
on three benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed
framework, achieving mean CSI scores of 0.452 on SEVIR, 0.474 on HKO-7, and
0.361 on MeteoNet, which outperforms existing approaches by a significant

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Latent Harmony redefines VAEs for UHD restoration through a two-stage framework that regularizes latent space and enforces high-frequency-aware reconstruction, achieving state-of-the-art results while balancing efficiency and fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: UHD restoration must balance computational efficiency with preserving high-frequency degradation details. Standard VAEs’ Gaussian latent constraint often loses task-specific high-frequency information, hurting reconstruction fidelity.

Method: Stage 1: LH-VAE with visual semantic constraints, progressive degradation perturbations, and latent equivariance to strengthen high-frequency reconstruction. Stage 2: jointly train a refined VAE with a restoration model using High-Frequency Low-Rank Adaptation (HF-LoRA): an encoder LoRA guided by a fidelity-oriented high-frequency alignment loss, and a decoder LoRA guided by a perception-oriented loss. Training uses alternating optimization with selective gradient propagation to preserve pretrained latent structure. Inference uses a tunable alpha to trade fidelity and perceptual quality.

Result: Reported state-of-the-art performance on UHD and standard-resolution restoration tasks, effectively balancing efficiency, perceptual quality, and reconstruction accuracy.

Conclusion: Latent Harmony demonstrates that coupling latent-space regularization with high-frequency-aware reconstruction can reclaim degradation-specific details in UHD restoration while maintaining efficiency; the HF-LoRA and tunable fidelity-perception trade-off enable flexible, high-quality restoration.

Abstract: Ultra-High Definition (UHD) image restoration faces a trade-off between
computational efficiency and high-frequency detail retention. While Variational
Autoencoders (VAEs) improve efficiency via latent-space processing, their
Gaussian constraint often discards degradation-specific high-frequency
information, hurting reconstruction fidelity. To overcome this, we propose
Latent Harmony, a two-stage framework that redefines VAEs for UHD restoration
by jointly regularizing the latent space and enforcing high-frequency-aware
reconstruction.In Stage One, we introduce LH-VAE, which enhances semantic
robustness through visual semantic constraints and progressive degradation
perturbations, while latent equivariance strengthens high-frequency
reconstruction.Stage Two jointly trains this refined VAE with a restoration
model using High-Frequency Low-Rank Adaptation (HF-LoRA): an encoder LoRA
guided by a fidelity-oriented high-frequency alignment loss to recover
authentic details, and a decoder LoRA driven by a perception-oriented loss to
synthesize realistic textures. Both LoRA modules are trained via alternating
optimization with selective gradient propagation to preserve the pretrained
latent structure.At inference, a tunable parameter {\alpha} enables flexible
fidelity-perception trade-offs.Experiments show Latent Harmony achieves
state-of-the-art performance across UHD and standard-resolution tasks,
effectively balancing efficiency, perceptual quality, and reconstruction
accuracy.

### [50] [The impact of abstract and object tags on image privacy classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07976)
*Darya Baranouskaya,Andrea Cavallaro*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Abstract tags outperform object tags for privacy classification when tag budget is limited; with more tags, object tags become as useful.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Investigate which tag type (object vs abstract) is more suitable for context-dependent, subjective image privacy tasks and to improve interpretability.

Method: Systematic comparison of privacy classifiers using object-tag features vs abstract-tag features across varying tag budgets; evaluation of performance and interpretability.

Result: Under constrained tag budgets, abstract tags yield higher privacy accuracy; with larger tag budgets, object-related information becomes comparably useful. Tag-type and quantity influence classifier effectiveness.

Conclusion: Design image privacy classifiers to adapt to tag budget, leveraging abstract tags when resources are limited and considering object tags as budgets grow; enhance interpretability through tag-type awareness.

Abstract: Object tags denote concrete entities and are central to many computer vision
tasks, whereas abstract tags capture higher-level information, which is
relevant for tasks that require a contextual, potentially subjective scene
understanding. Object and abstract tags extracted from images also facilitate
interpretability. In this paper, we explore which type of tags is more suitable
for the context-dependent and inherently subjective task of image privacy.
While object tags are generally used for privacy classification, we show that
abstract tags are more effective when the tag budget is limited. Conversely,
when a larger number of tags per image is available, object-related information
is as useful. We believe that these findings will guide future research in
developing more accurate image privacy classifiers, informed by the role of tag
types and quantity.

### [51] [Is Architectural Complexity Always the Answer? A Case Study on SwinIR vs. an Efficient CNN](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07984)
*Chandresh Sutariya,Nitin Singh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Lightweight CNN nearly matches SwinIR in low-light image restoration: 37.4 dB vs 39.03 dB, converges in 10 vs 132 epochs, and is >55x smaller, highlighting efficiency over peak performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Assess the efficiency-accuracy trade-off between state-of-the-art Transformers (SwinIR) and standard CNNs in challenging low-light restoration.

Method: Empirical comparison on a denoising/restoration task: measure PSNR, convergence epochs, and model size; compare training efficiency and final performance.

Result: SwinIR achieves higher peak PSNR (39.03 dB) than the CNN (37.4 dB). CNN converges in 10 epochs versus 132 for SwinIR and is over 55x smaller.

Conclusion: A standard CNN can deliver near state-of-the-art results with far lower computational overhead, making it attractive for real-world, resource-constrained deployments; however, Transformers offer higher peak performance at greater cost.

Abstract: The simultaneous restoration of high-frequency details and suppression of
severe noise in low-light imagery presents a significant and persistent
challenge in computer vision. While large-scale Transformer models like SwinIR
have set the state of the art in performance, their high computational cost can
be a barrier for practical applications. This paper investigates the critical
trade-off between performance and efficiency by comparing the state-of-the-art
SwinIR model against a standard, lightweight Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
on this challenging task. Our experimental results reveal a nuanced but
important finding. While the Transformer-based SwinIR model achieves a higher
peak performance, with a Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) of 39.03 dB, the
lightweight CNN delivers a surprisingly competitive PSNR of 37.4 dB. Crucially,
the CNN reached this performance after converging in only 10 epochs of
training, whereas the more complex SwinIR model required 132 epochs. This
efficiency is further underscored by the model's size; the CNN is over 55 times
smaller than SwinIR. This work demonstrates that a standard CNN can provide a
near state-of-the-art result with significantly lower computational overhead,
presenting a compelling case for its use in real-world scenarios where resource
constraints are a primary concern.

*Gaurvi Goyal,Pham Cong Thuong,Arren Glover,Masayoshi Mizuno,Chiara Bartolozzi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduces GraphEnet, a Graph Neural Network for 2D human pose estimation from event-camera data using a line-based intermediate representation and an offset-vector learning scheme with confidence-based pooling; claims novelty as the first to apply GNNs to event data for HPE; code is open-source.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Event cameras offer low latency and low energy consumption, making them attractive for pose estimation in resource-constrained settings. Graph-based processing of sparse, asynchronous event data could provide robust, high-frequency 2D Pose of a single person.

Method: Proposes GraphEnet architecture that operates on a graph derived from event data with a line-based intermediate representation. Introduces an offset vector learning paradigm and confidence-based pooling to estimate 2D human pose for a single person at high frequency.

Result: The abstract emphasizes feasibility and high-frequency inference, and positions the work as novel for applying Graph Neural Networks to event data for HPE. No quantitative results are reported in the abstract; code is open-source.

Conclusion: GraphEnet is a novel integration of event-based vision and graph neural networks for 2D pose estimation, promising real-time, low-power performance for single-person scenarios; invites benchmarking and broader adoption through its open-source release.

Abstract: Human Pose Estimation is a crucial module in human-machine interaction
applications and, especially since the rise in deep learning technology, robust
methods are available to consumers using RGB cameras and commercial GPUs. On
the other hand, event-based cameras have gained popularity in the vision
research community for their low latency and low energy advantages that make
them ideal for applications where those resources are constrained like portable
electronics and mobile robots. In this work we propose a Graph Neural Network,
GraphEnet, that leverages the sparse nature of event camera output, with an
intermediate line based event representation, to estimate 2D Human Pose of a
single person at a high frequency. The architecture incorporates a novel offset
vector learning paradigm with confidence based pooling to estimate the human
pose. This is the first work that applies Graph Neural Networks to event data
for Human Pose Estimation. The code is open-source at

### [53] [CIR-CoT: Towards Interpretable Composed Image Retrieval via End-to-End Chain-of-Thought Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08003)
*Weihuang Lin,Yiwei Ma,Jiayi Ji,Xiaoshuai Sun,Rongrong Ji*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CIR-CoT introduces an end-to-end, retrieval-oriented MLLM that generates explicit, structured chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning for Composed Image Retrieval, enabling transparent cross-modal reasoning and improved retrieval performance, with a new three-stage CoT annotation process and strong in-domain and cross-domain results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CIR methods using VLMs/MLLMs mainly operate as opaque “black boxes,” hindering interpretability and the ability to follow complex, fine-grained instructions. There is a need for transparent reasoning and better cross-modal alignment in retrieval tasks.

Method: Fine-tune a multimodal language model to produce structured CoT outputs (caption, reasoning, conclusion) for each query, then encode the final retrieval intent into a dedicated embedding. Also create CoT annotations via a three-stage process (caption → reasoning → conclusion) to train the model, enabling end-to-end retrieval guidance.

Result: CIR-CoT achieves competitive performance on in-domain datasets (FashionIQ, CIRR) and demonstrates strong generalization to the out-of-domain CIRCO dataset, indicating improved reasoning-driven retrieval and transparency.

Conclusion: Structured, interpretable CoT reasoning can boost retrieval accuracy in CIR while offering transparency into the model’s decision process; the approach also highlights the value of dedicated CoT annotation pipelines for multimodal retrieval tasks.

Abstract: Composed Image Retrieval (CIR), which aims to find a target image from a
reference image and a modification text, presents the core challenge of
performing unified reasoning across visual and semantic modalities. While
current approaches based on Vision-Language Models (VLMs, e.g., CLIP) and more
recent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs, e.g., Qwen-VL) have shown
progress, they predominantly function as ``black boxes." This inherent opacity
not only prevents users from understanding the retrieval rationale but also
restricts the models' ability to follow complex, fine-grained instructions. To
overcome these limitations, we introduce CIR-CoT, the first end-to-end
retrieval-oriented MLLM designed to integrate explicit Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
reasoning. By compelling the model to first generate an interpretable reasoning
chain, CIR-CoT enhances its ability to capture crucial cross-modal
interactions, leading to more accurate retrieval while making its decision
process transparent. Since existing datasets like FashionIQ and CIRR lack the
necessary reasoning data, a key contribution of our work is the creation of
structured CoT annotations using a three-stage process involving a caption,
reasoning, and conclusion. Our model is then fine-tuned to produce this
structured output before encoding its final retrieval intent into a dedicated
embedding. Comprehensive experiments show that CIR-CoT achieves highly
competitive performance on in-domain datasets (FashionIQ, CIRR) and
demonstrates remarkable generalization on the out-of-domain CIRCO dataset,
establishing a new path toward more effective and trustworthy retrieval
systems.

*Shaohong Wang,Bin Lu,Xinyu Xiao,Hanzhi Zhong,Bowen Pang,Tong Wang,Zhiyu Xiang,Hangguan Shan,Eryun Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RayFusion is a ray-based fusion method for collaborative visual perception that uses ray occupancy from collaborators to reduce depth ambiguity and false positives along camera rays, improving 3D object detection in camera-only collaborative systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Depth information is often missing in camera-based perception, causing depth ambiguity especially in collaborative setups; explicit depth cues from other agents can alleviate this.

Method: RayFusion leverages ray occupancy information from multiple collaborators to fuse visual features along each camera ray, reducing redundancy and false positives along rays and improving 3D detection.

Result: Comprehensive experiments show RayFusion consistently improves over state-of-the-art models in collaborative visual perception tasks.

Conclusion: RayFusion advances purely camera-based collaborative perception by effectively exploiting ray-level occupancy information to mitigate depth ambiguity and enhance 3D object detection; code is released.

Abstract: Collaborative visual perception methods have gained widespread attention in
the autonomous driving community in recent years due to their ability to
address sensor limitation problems. However, the absence of explicit depth
information often makes it difficult for camera-based perception systems, e.g.,
3D object detection, to generate accurate predictions. To alleviate the
ambiguity in depth estimation, we propose RayFusion, a ray-based fusion method
for collaborative visual perception. Using ray occupancy information from
collaborators, RayFusion reduces redundancy and false positive predictions
along camera rays, enhancing the detection performance of purely camera-based
collaborative perception systems. Comprehensive experiments show that our
method consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art models, substantially
advancing the performance of collaborative visual perception. The code is
available at https://github.com/wangsh0111/RayFusion.

*Bheeshm Sharma,Karthikeyan Jaganathan,Balamurugan Palaniappan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A two-stage weakly supervised anomaly detection framework for brain MRI, RASALoRE, using DDPT-generated pseudo masks and region-aware attention with fixed location-based random embeddings, achieving state-of-the-art results on BraTS and MSD with under 8M parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable accurate brain MRI anomaly detection without pixel-level annotations, using only weak slice-level labels, addressing the practical need for rapid and scalable diagnosis.

Method: Stage 1: Discriminative Dual Prompt Tuning (DDPT) to generate high-quality pseudo weak masks from slice-level labels. Stage 2: A segmentation network with region-aware spatial attention driven by fixed location-based random embeddings to focus on anomalous regions.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art anomaly detection performance, significantly outperforming existing WSAD methods while using fewer than 8 million parameters; validated on BraTS20, BraTS21, BraTS23, and MSD datasets with substantial improvements and reduced computational complexity.

Conclusion: RASALoRE provides an effective solution for weakly supervised brain MRI anomaly detection by combining pseudo-label generation with region-aware attention and fixed embeddings, offering strong performance with low resource requirements; code available at the provided GitHub link.

Abstract: Weakly Supervised Anomaly detection (WSAD) in brain MRI scans is an important
challenge useful to obtain quick and accurate detection of brain anomalies when
precise pixel-level anomaly annotations are unavailable and only weak labels
(e.g., slice-level) are available. In this work, we propose RASALoRE: Region
Aware Spatial Attention with Location-based Random Embeddings, a novel
two-stage WSAD framework. In the first stage, we introduce a Discriminative
Dual Prompt Tuning (DDPT) mechanism that generates high-quality pseudo weak
masks based on slice-level labels, serving as coarse localization cues. In the
second stage, we propose a segmentation network with a region-aware spatial
attention mechanism that relies on fixed location-based random embeddings. This
design enables the model to effectively focus on anomalous regions. Our
approach achieves state-of-the-art anomaly detection performance, significantly
outperforming existing WSAD methods while utilizing less than 8 million
parameters. Extensive evaluations on the BraTS20, BraTS21, BraTS23, and MSD
datasets demonstrate a substantial performance improvement coupled with a
significant reduction in computational complexity. Code is available at:

*Moon Ye-Bin,Roy Miles,Tae-Hyun Oh,Ismail Elezi,Jiankang Deng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Training-free, white-box image retouching system (RetouchLLM) that uses a visual critic and a code generator to perform interpretable, code-based edits on high-resolution images, enabling multi-step adjustment paths and user-controllable edits via natural language, without training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome the reliance on large-scale paired datasets and the opacity of black-box learning-based retouching; provide interpretable, adaptable, user-specific adjustments that can handle diverse images.

Method: A two-module framework: a visual critic that identifies differences between input and reference images, and a code generator that outputs executable editing codes. The system performs progressive, multi-step retouching and supports natural-language interaction for interpretable, user-driven control; all training-free (no data training required).

Result: Empirically demonstrates generalization across diverse retouching styles and enables interpretable, controllable adjustments via natural language; effective on high-resolution images without training data.

Conclusion: RetouchLLM offers a flexible, transparent, data-efficient retouching paradigm that aligns with human editing workflows, enabling multi-step, user-guided, code-based image retouching without requiring training data.

Abstract: Image retouching not only enhances visual quality but also serves as a means
of expressing personal preferences and emotions. However, existing
learning-based approaches require large-scale paired data and operate as black
boxes, making the retouching process opaque and limiting their adaptability to
handle diverse, user- or image-specific adjustments. In this work, we propose
RetouchLLM, a training-free white-box image retouching system, which requires
no training data and performs interpretable, code-based retouching directly on
high-resolution images. Our framework progressively enhances the image in a
manner similar to how humans perform multi-step retouching, allowing
exploration of diverse adjustment paths. It comprises of two main modules: a
visual critic that identifies differences between the input and reference
images, and a code generator that produces executable codes. Experiments
demonstrate that our approach generalizes well across diverse retouching
styles, while natural language-based user interaction enables interpretable and
controllable adjustments tailored to user intent.

### [57] [A class-driven hierarchical ResNet for classification of multispectral remote sensing images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08060)
*Giulio Weikmann,Gianmarco Perantoni,Lorenzo Bruzzone*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A multitemporal, class-hierarchy–aware Residual Network (ResNet) for time-series classification of multispectral imagery, using additional branching and hierarchy-penalty maps to model macro-, meso-, and micro-classes, enabling modular adaptation and improved micro-class discrimination with limited data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To exploit hierarchical semantic labels in time-series multispectral classification and address limited training samples, enabling better discrimination across macro-, meso-, and micro-classes and scalable adaptation of the backbone network.

Method: A modified ResNet with extra branches for different hierarchy levels and hierarchy-penalty maps to enforce coherent hierarchical transitions. The model is trained using class-hierarchy labels so early layers learn general (macro) classes and progressively finer classes. The architecture is modular to allow fine-tuning and addition of new classes with limited data. Experiments on two Amazonian forest tiles with 12 monthly Sentinel-2 composites from 2019.

Result: The approach yields improved classification across the hierarchy levels and better discrimination of minority/micro-classes, with stronger generalization to a new target area and more effective representation of minoritarian classes.

Conclusion: A hierarchical, modular ResNet backbone tailored for multitemporal TS classification with hierarchical labels improves performance across semantic levels and supports scalable adaptation to new classes with limited data.

Abstract: This work presents a multitemporal class-driven hierarchical Residual Neural
Network (ResNet) designed for modelling the classification of Time Series (TS)
of multispectral images at different semantical class levels. The architecture
consists of a modification of the ResNet where we introduce additional branches
to perform the classification at the different hierarchy levels and leverage on
hierarchy-penalty maps to discourage incoherent hierarchical transitions within
the classification. In this way, we improve the discrimination capabilities of
classes at different levels of semantic details and train a modular
architecture that can be used as a backbone network for introducing new
specific classes and additional tasks considering limited training samples
available. We exploit the class-hierarchy labels to train efficiently the
different layers of the architecture, allowing the first layers to train faster
on the first levels of the hierarchy modeling general classes (i.e., the
macro-classes) and the intermediate classes, while using the last ones to
discriminate more specific classes (i.e., the micro-classes). In this way, the
targets are constrained in following the hierarchy defined, improving the
classification of classes at the most detailed level. The proposed modular
network has intrinsic adaptation capability that can be obtained through fine
tuning. The experimental results, obtained on two tiles of the Amazonian Forest
on 12 monthly composites of Sentinel 2 images acquired during 2019, demonstrate
the effectiveness of the hierarchical approach in both generalizing over
different hierarchical levels and learning discriminant features for an
accurate classification at the micro-class level on a new target area, with a
better representation of the minoritarian classes.

*Junyu Shi,Minghui Li,Junguo Zuo,Zhifei Yu,Yipeng Lin,Shengshan Hu,Ziqi Zhou,Yechao Zhang,Wei Wan,Yinzhe Xu,Leo Yu Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RedFace is a real-world-oriented deepfake face dataset with 60k+ forged images and ~1k manipulated videos, generated via 9 commercial platforms to simulate real-world black-box use; experiments show existing detectors struggle on real-world-like data; dataset released for robust evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a pressing real-world threat from deepfake media on social platforms, and existing benchmarks lack realism, diversity, and manipulation techniques representative of real-world use. A dataset that captures in-the-wild generation pipelines and dissemination is needed to evaluate and improve detectors.

Method: Construct RedFace by (1) sourcing authentic facial features, (2) generating deepfakes using 9 commercial online platforms, (3) applying bespoke algorithms to synthesize diverse deepfake techniques, (4) conducting cross-domain, intra-domain, and real-world social-network dissemination simulations, and (5) releasing a dataset of 60k+ forged images and ~1k manipulated videos.

Result: Extensive experiments indicate current deepfake detection methods have limited effectiveness in real-world-like settings; analysis explains the impact of RedFace on detection performance relative to conventional datasets; the dataset is publicly available at GitHub.

Conclusion: RedFace bridges the gap between academic evaluations and real-world needs, enabling more realistic benchmarking and stimulating the development of robust detectors; the dataset provides a practical resource for evaluating detection methods under real-world-like conditions.

Abstract: Deepfakes, leveraging advanced AIGC (Artificial Intelligence-Generated
Content) techniques, create hyper-realistic synthetic images and videos of
human faces, posing a significant threat to the authenticity of social media.
While this real-world threat is increasingly prevalent, existing academic
evaluations and benchmarks for detecting deepfake forgery often fall short to
achieve effective application for their lack of specificity, limited deepfake
diversity, restricted manipulation techniques.To address these limitations, we
introduce RedFace (Real-world-oriented Deepfake Face), a specialized facial
deepfake dataset, comprising over 60,000 forged images and 1,000 manipulated
videos derived from authentic facial features, to bridge the gap between
academic evaluations and real-world necessity. Unlike prior benchmarks, which
typically rely on academic methods to generate deepfakes, RedFace utilizes 9
commercial online platforms to integrate the latest deepfake technologies found
"in the wild", effectively simulating real-world black-box scenarios.Moreover,
RedFace's deepfakes are synthesized using bespoke algorithms, allowing it to
capture diverse and evolving methods used by real-world deepfake creators.
Extensive experimental results on RedFace (including cross-domain,
intra-domain, and real-world social network dissemination simulations) verify
the limited practicality of existing deepfake detection schemes against
real-world applications. We further perform a detailed analysis of the RedFace
dataset, elucidating the reason of its impact on detection performance compared
to conventional datasets. Our dataset is available at:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduces Normalized Spatiotemporal Gradient (NSG) and NSG-VD, a physics-driven detector for AI-generated videos using probability-flow conservation, NSG features, and MMD, with theoretical bounds and empirical gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI-generated videos achieve near-perfect realism, making detection challenging due to high-dimensional spatiotemporal dynamics and subtle violations of physical laws; a physics-informed approach is proposed to robustly distinguish generated from real videos.

Method: Define NSG as the ratio of spatial probability gradients to temporal density changes; estimate NSG using pre-trained diffusion models with spatial gradient approximation and motion-aware temporal modeling, avoiding complex motion decomposition; compute NSG features for test and real videos and apply Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) as the detection metric; derive an upper bound on NSG feature distances to show amplified discrepancies for generated content.

Result: NSG-VD outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving 16.00% higher recall and 10.75% higher F1-Score on evaluation datasets; experiments validate the effectiveness of physics-driven NSG features and the MMD-based detection approach; source code provided at the project repository.

Conclusion: A physics-driven NSG framework efficiently detects AI-generated videos by capturing deviations from natural spatiotemporal dynamics; the combination of NSG estimation, diffusion-model-based features, and MMD offers strong detection performance and theoretical support, with code available for replication.

Abstract: AI-generated videos have achieved near-perfect visual realism (e.g., Sora),
urgently necessitating reliable detection mechanisms. However, detecting such
videos faces significant challenges in modeling high-dimensional spatiotemporal
dynamics and identifying subtle anomalies that violate physical laws. In this
paper, we propose a physics-driven AI-generated video detection paradigm based
on probability flow conservation principles. Specifically, we propose a
statistic called Normalized Spatiotemporal Gradient (NSG), which quantifies the
ratio of spatial probability gradients to temporal density changes, explicitly
capturing deviations from natural video dynamics. Leveraging pre-trained
diffusion models, we develop an NSG estimator through spatial gradients
approximation and motion-aware temporal modeling without complex motion
decomposition while preserving physical constraints. Building on this, we
propose an NSG-based video detection method (NSG-VD) that computes the Maximum
Mean Discrepancy (MMD) between NSG features of the test and real videos as a
detection metric. Last, we derive an upper bound of NSG feature distances
between real and generated videos, proving that generated videos exhibit
amplified discrepancies due to distributional shifts. Extensive experiments
confirm that NSG-VD outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by 16.00% in Recall
and 10.75% in F1-Score, validating the superior performance of NSG-VD. The
source code is available at https://github.com/ZSHsh98/NSG-VD.

### [60] [DarkHash: A Data-Free Backdoor Attack Against Deep Hashing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08094)
*Ziqi Zhou,Menghao Deng,Yufei Song,Hangtao Zhang,Wei Wan,Shengshan Hu,Minghui Li,Leo Yu Zhang,Dezhong Yao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DarkHash: the first data-free backdoor attack against deep hashing. It uses a shadow backdoor framework with dual-semantic guidance to inject backdoors while preserving original retrieval accuracy, achieved by fine-tuning selective layers on a surrogate dataset and a topological alignment loss that leverages sample-neighbor relations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing backdoor attacks on deep hashing assume access to training data, which is often unavailable due to privacy/IP constraints. There is a need for data-free backdoor methods that can degrade or control retrieval without training data while maintaining task performance.

Method: Proposes a shadow backdoor framework with dual-semantic guidance. Finetunes only specific layers of the victim model using a surrogate dataset to embed backdoor functionality and preserve original task performance. Introduces a topological alignment loss that leverages the relationship between individual samples and their neighbors to align poisoned samples toward a target, improving attack efficacy.

Result: Empirical evaluation on four image datasets, five model architectures, and two hashing methods shows DarkHash outperforms existing data-free and data-dependent backdoor attacks. Defense experiments indicate DarkHash is robust against mainstream backdoor defenses.

Conclusion: DarkHash is the first data-free backdoor attack against deep hashing, achieving high effectiveness while preserving original retrieval accuracy and demonstrating robustness to defenses. This highlights the vulnerability of deep hashing in data-restricted scenarios and underscores the need for defense methods that do not rely on access to training data.

Abstract: Benefiting from its superior feature learning capabilities and efficiency,
deep hashing has achieved remarkable success in large-scale image retrieval.
Recent studies have demonstrated the vulnerability of deep hashing models to
backdoor attacks. Although these studies have shown promising attack results,
they rely on access to the training dataset to implant the backdoor. In the
real world, obtaining such data (e.g., identity information) is often
prohibited due to privacy protection and intellectual property concerns.
Embedding backdoors into deep hashing models without access to the training
data, while maintaining retrieval accuracy for the original task, presents a
novel and challenging problem. In this paper, we propose DarkHash, the first
data-free backdoor attack against deep hashing. Specifically, we design a novel
shadow backdoor attack framework with dual-semantic guidance. It embeds
backdoor functionality and maintains original retrieval accuracy by fine-tuning
only specific layers of the victim model using a surrogate dataset. We consider
leveraging the relationship between individual samples and their neighbors to
enhance backdoor attacks during training. By designing a topological alignment
loss, we optimize both individual and neighboring poisoned samples toward the
target sample, further enhancing the attack capability. Experimental results on
four image datasets, five model architectures, and two hashing methods
demonstrate the high effectiveness of DarkHash, outperforming existing
state-of-the-art backdoor attack methods. Defense experiments show that
DarkHash can withstand existing mainstream backdoor defense methods.

### [61] [Efficient Label Refinement for Face Parsing Under Extreme Poses Using 3D Gaussian Splatting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08096)
*Ankit Gahlawat,Anirban Mukherjee,Dinesh Babu Jayagopi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A label-refinement pipeline using 3D Gaussian Splatting to generate accurate masks for face parsing from noisy multiview predictions, enabling pose-diverse training without ground-truth 3D data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extreme-view face parsing is data-limited and annotation-heavy; a scalable method to obtain accurate segmentation across poses is needed.

Method: Jointly fit two 3D Gaussian Splatting models (one to RGB, one to initial segmentation maps) to enforce multiview consistency via shared geometry; synthesize pose-diverse training data; minimal post-processing; fine-tune a face parser on refined data.

Result: Significant accuracy gains on challenging head poses while maintaining standard-view performance; outperforms state-of-the-art; validated by extensive experiments including human evaluations; does not require ground-truth 3D annotations and uses only a small seed of images.

Conclusion: The approach provides a scalable, effective solution to improve face parsing robustness across real-world extreme poses without heavy 3D labeling.

Abstract: Accurate face parsing under extreme viewing angles remains a significant
challenge due to limited labeled data in such poses. Manual annotation is
costly and often impractical at scale. We propose a novel label refinement
pipeline that leverages 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to generate accurate
segmentation masks from noisy multiview predictions. By jointly fitting two
3DGS models, one to RGB images and one to their initial segmentation maps, our
method enforces multiview consistency through shared geometry, enabling the
synthesis of pose-diverse training data with only minimal post-processing.
Fine-tuning a face parsing model on this refined dataset significantly improves
accuracy on challenging head poses, while maintaining strong performance on
standard views. Extensive experiments, including human evaluations, demonstrate
that our approach achieves superior results compared to state-of-the-art
methods, despite requiring no ground-truth 3D annotations and using only a
small set of initial images. Our method offers a scalable and effective

TL;DR: CT-specific random windowing augmentation improves liver tumor segmentation by respecting Hounsfield Units (HU) and avoiding natural-image augmentations, yielding better robustness on low-contrast CT images across multiple datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generalize DL CT segmentation with limited data without corrupting the physical meaning of CT HU values; naive augmentations from natural images can introduce artifacts and hurt performance.

Method: Introduce Random windowing, a CT-aware augmentation that leverages the HU distribution to vary contrast during training; conduct ablations and compare against state-of-the-art augmentations on multiple datasets focused on liver tumors.

Result: Significant performance gains on challenging, low-contrast or timing-affected images; outperforms existing augmentation methods in liver tumor segmentation across several datasets.

Conclusion: CT-aware augmentation (Random windowing) enhances DL segmentation in CT by preserving HU physics and improving robustness, with potential applicability to other CT segmentation tasks.

Abstract: Contrast-enhanced Computed Tomography (CT) is important for diagnosis and
treatment planning for various medical conditions. Deep learning (DL) based
segmentation models may enable automated medical image analysis for detecting
and delineating tumors in CT images, thereby reducing clinicians' workload.
Achieving generalization capabilities in limited data domains, such as
radiology, requires modern DL models to be trained with image augmentation.
However, naively applying augmentation methods developed for natural images to
CT scans often disregards the nature of the CT modality, where the intensities
measure Hounsfield Units (HU) and have important physical meaning. This paper
challenges the use of such intensity augmentations for CT imaging and shows
that they may lead to artifacts and poor generalization. To mitigate this, we
propose a CT-specific augmentation technique, called Random windowing, that
exploits the available HU distribution of intensities in CT images. Random
windowing encourages robustness to contrast-enhancement and significantly
increases model performance on challenging images with poor contrast or timing.
We perform ablations and analysis of our method on multiple datasets, and
compare to, and outperform, state-of-the-art alternatives, while focusing on
the challenge of liver tumor segmentation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AR-Drag is an RL-enhanced few-step autoregressive video diffusion model enabling real-time image-to-video generation with motion control, achieving high fidelity and precise motion while reducing latency, using 1.3B parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-time motion-controllable video generation is hindered by latency in bidirectional diffusion models and the scarcity of effective autoregressive approaches. Existing AR video diffusion models are limited to simple controls or text-to-video and often suffer quality degradation and motion artifacts in few-step generation.

Method: Fine-tune a base image-to-video (I2V) diffusion model to support basic motion control, then further improve it with reinforcement learning using a trajectory-based reward model. Maintain the Markov property via a Self-Rollout mechanism and accelerate training by selectively injecting stochasticity into denoising steps. Operates in a few-step autoregressive regime with RL enhancements, around 1.3B parameters.

Result: AR-Drag demonstrates high visual fidelity and precise motion alignment, significantly reducing latency compared with state-of-the-art motion-controllable VDMs, while using only 1.3B parameters. Extensive experiments and project visuals on the project page corroborate these gains.

Conclusion: AR-Drag is the first RL-enhanced few-step autoregressive video diffusion model for real-time image-to-video generation with diverse motion control, combining RL with Self-Rollout to preserve the Markov property and enable efficient training, delivering strong fidelity and motion control at low latency.

Abstract: Real-time motion-controllable video generation remains challenging due to the
inherent latency of bidirectional diffusion models and the lack of effective
autoregressive (AR) approaches. Existing AR video diffusion models are limited
to simple control signals or text-to-video generation, and often suffer from
quality degradation and motion artifacts in few-step generation. To address
these challenges, we propose AR-Drag, the first RL-enhanced few-step AR video
diffusion model for real-time image-to-video generation with diverse motion
control. We first fine-tune a base I2V model to support basic motion control,
then further improve it via reinforcement learning with a trajectory-based
reward model. Our design preserves the Markov property through a Self-Rollout
mechanism and accelerates training by selectively introducing stochasticity in
denoising steps. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AR-Drag achieves high
visual fidelity and precise motion alignment, significantly reducing latency
compared with state-of-the-art motion-controllable VDMs, while using only 1.3B
parameters. Additional visualizations can be found on our project page:

### [64] [Improving Temporal Understanding Logic Consistency in Video-Language Models via Attention Enhancement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08138)
*Chengzhi Li,Heyan Huang,Ping Jian,Zhen Yang,Yaning Tian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Identifies cross-modal attention confusion across timestamps as a key cause of temporal inconsistencies in Video-LLMs; introduces Temporally Conditioned Attention Sharpening (TCAS) to sharpen temporal discrimination; yields improved temporal logic consistency and video temporal grounding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Video-LLMs struggle with logically consistent responses due to grounding outputs and temporal reasoning; existing analysis on causes is limited; improving temporal attentional discrimination could enhance temporal understanding and reliability.

Method: An interpretability-driven analysis to identify factors behind inconsistency, then proposes TCAS. TCAS constructs an enhancement objective based on attention distinctions to improve the model's temporal resolution and the discriminability of cross-modal attention heads; evaluated on temporal logic consistency and grounding tasks.

Result: Significant improvements in temporal logic consistency of Video-LLMs; interpretable analyses show increased temporal discriminability of attention heads; performance gains on general video temporal grounding tasks.

Conclusion: Temporal logic consistency is a bottleneck in video-temporal understanding. Enhancing temporal discrimination in attention (TCAS) improves Video-LLMs' temporal reasoning and consistency, with broader gains in grounding tasks and support from interpretability analyses.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often generate self-contradictory outputs, which
severely impacts their reliability and hinders their adoption in practical
applications. In video-language models (Video-LLMs), this phenomenon recently
draws the attention of researchers. Specifically, these models fail to provide
logically consistent responses to rephrased questions based on their grounding
outputs. However, the underlying causes of this phenomenon remain
underexplored. In this work, we adopt an interpretability-driven approach to
analyze, statistically summarize, and intervention the potential factors of the
phenomenon. We find that one of the primary reasons for the inconsistency in
responses lies in the inability of cross-modal attention heads to effectively
distinguish video tokens across different timestamps. To address this, we
propose an attention enhancement method called Temporally Conditioned Attention
Sharpening (TCAS), which constructs an enhancement objective based on attention
distinctions to enhance the model's temporal resolution capability, thereby
improving its temporal understanding logic consistency. Experimental results
demonstrate that our method significantly enhances the temporal logic
consistency of Video-LLMs. Further interpretability analyses reveal that our
method indeed improves the temporal discriminability of attention heads,
validating our conclusions. Additionally, our method achieves performance
improvements in general video temporal grounding tasks, highlighting that
temporal logic consistency is a bottleneck in temporal understanding. By
enhancing consistency, our method drives significant progress in video temporal
understanding.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A unified multi-modal video super-resolution framework (UniMMVSR) that integrates text, image, and video conditions into a latent diffusion model for high-fidelity, 4K multimodal VSR.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing cascaded video super-resolution methods are largely text-to-video and ignore additional modalities, limiting fidelity and controllability in multi-modal video generation.

Method: Propose UniMMVSR, a unified generative VSR framework that accepts text, image, and video conditions. Investigate condition injection strategies, training schemes, and data mixture techniques within a latent video diffusion model. Design data construction and condition utilization methods to align each condition with the target video. Demonstrate feasibility of combining with a base model for multi-modal guided 4K video generation.

Result: UniMMVSR significantly outperforms existing methods in detail and conformity to multi-modal conditions. It enables multi-modal guided generation and demonstrates, for the first time, 4K video generation when combined with a base model.

Conclusion: A first unified framework for multi-modal conditioned video super-resolution that enhances fidelity and controllability across text, image, and video modalities, with demonstrated potential for 4K multi-modal video generation.

Abstract: Cascaded video super-resolution has emerged as a promising technique for
decoupling the computational burden associated with generating high-resolution
videos using large foundation models. Existing studies, however, are largely
confined to text-to-video tasks and fail to leverage additional generative
conditions beyond text, which are crucial for ensuring fidelity in multi-modal
video generation. We address this limitation by presenting UniMMVSR, the first
unified generative video super-resolution framework to incorporate hybrid-modal
conditions, including text, images, and videos. We conduct a comprehensive
exploration of condition injection strategies, training schemes, and data
mixture techniques within a latent video diffusion model. A key challenge was
designing distinct data construction and condition utilization methods to
enable the model to precisely utilize all condition types, given their varied
correlations with the target video. Our experiments demonstrate that UniMMVSR
significantly outperforms existing methods, producing videos with superior
detail and a higher degree of conformity to multi-modal conditions. We also
validate the feasibility of combining UniMMVSR with a base model to achieve
multi-modal guided generation of 4K video, a feat previously unattainable with
existing techniques.

*Zhentao Zou,Zhengrong Yue,Kunpeng Du,Binlei Bao,Hanting Li,Haizhen Xie,Guozheng Xu,Yue Zhou,Yali Wang,Jie Hu,Xue Jiang,Xinghao Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MURE enables multimodal interleaved text-image chain-of-thought for image editing, introducing MMDC to prune low-quality visual reasoning paths, and releasing a 14K CoT-Edit dataset, yielding improved fidelity across benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Purely textual chain-of-thought reasoning fails to capture complex visual layouts and fine-grained spatial relations needed for image editing, due to lack of explicit reasoning with visual cues.

Method: Propose Multimodal Reasoning Edit (MURE) that interleaves textual descriptions with visual cues (e.g., positional masks or content representations) to guide editing. Introduce Multimodal Deep Confidence (MMDC) reasoning, a tree-based visual reasoning path exploration at each step with pruning via a reward-model-based confidence score. Decompose tasks into interdependent sub-tasks and define a formal framework for interleaved text-image chains. Release CoT-Edit-14K dataset (14K high-quality editing examples).

Result: The approach yields significant improvements across three image editing benchmarks, delivering higher precision at each stage and high-fidelity edited results.

Conclusion: Interleaved text-image CoT with MMDC effectively guides visual editing, addressing previous CoT limitations; the framework’s task decomposition and dataset enable more reliable, high-fidelity edits.

Abstract: Image editing with natural language has gained significant popularity, yet
existing methods struggle with intricate object intersections and fine-grained
spatial relationships due to the lack of an explicit reasoning process. While
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) has been explored to enhance reasoning, purely textual
CoT or CoT augmented with coordinate information is fundamentally limited in
its ability to represent intricate visual layouts and lacks the necessary
visual cues to guide the generation of fine-grained, pixel-level details. To
address these challenges, we propose Multimodal Reasoning Edit (MURE), a novel
framework that shifts the visual editing process from purely text-based
reasoning to a series of interleaved textual and visual rationales. Our
framework performs image editing using a natively multimodal, interleaved
text-image CoT. This approach generates a step-by-step chain of reasoning where
a textual description is followed by a corresponding visual cue, such as a
positional mask that defined intended edited regions or a representation of new
content. Furthermore, to mitigate the hallucination phenomenon of large
language models, we introduce Multimodal Deep Confidence (MMDC) reasoning
paradigm. This paradigm explores a tree of visual reasoning paths at each step.
By pruning low-quality branches using a deep confidence score from a reward
model, it ensures the model consistently follows a high-quality trajectory
towards the final edited result. The proposed method decomposes complex editing
tasks into interdependent sub-tasks, achieving greater precision at each stage
and yielding high-fidelity edited results. We define the formulation for
interleaved text-image chains and release the first CoT-Edit-14K dataset,
comprising 14K high-quality editing examples. Extensive experiments show that
our method yields significant improvements across three image editing
benchmarks.

### [67] [Robust Canonicalization through Bootstrapped Data Re-Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08178)
*Johann Schmidt,Sebastian Stober*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Bootstrapped canonicalization aligns samples iteratively to handle geometric biases in FGVC, with convergence guarantees and competitive performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fine-grained visual classification requires sensitivity to subtle cues while remaining robust to pose and scale variations. Existing remedies rely on heavy augmentation or on equivariant architectures that constrain expressivity. Canonicalization is brittle in real data due to misalignment; a robust, principled alignment method is needed.

Method: Proposes a bootstrapping algorithm that iteratively re-aligns training samples, progressively reducing alignment variance to recover the alignment assumption. Establishes convergence guarantees under mild conditions for arbitrary compact groups.

Result: On four FGVC benchmarks, the proposed method consistently outperforms equivariant and canonicalization baselines and is on par with augmentation methods.

Conclusion: Bootstrapped re-alignment provides a practical, theoretically grounded approach to mitigating geometric biases in FGVC, combining the benefits of canonicalization without requiring perfectly aligned data and matching augmentation performance when appropriate.

Abstract: Fine-grained visual classification (FGVC) tasks, such as insect and bird
identification, demand sensitivity to subtle visual cues while remaining robust
to spatial transformations. A key challenge is handling geometric biases and
noise, such as different orientations and scales of objects. Existing remedies
rely on heavy data augmentation, which demands powerful models, or on
equivariant architectures, which constrain expressivity and add cost.
Canonicalization offers an alternative by shielding such biases from the
downstream model. In practice, such functions are often obtained using
canonicalization priors, which assume aligned training data. Unfortunately,
real-world datasets never fulfill this assumption, causing the obtained
canonicalizer to be brittle. We propose a bootstrapping algorithm that
iteratively re-aligns training samples by progressively reducing variance and
recovering the alignment assumption. We establish convergence guarantees under
mild conditions for arbitrary compact groups, and show on four FGVC benchmarks
that our method consistently outperforms equivariant, and canonicalization
baselines while performing on par with augmentation.

*Haoran Yu,Yi Shi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: InstructUDrag is a diffusion-based framework that jointly supports text-guided editing and object dragging, enabling simultaneous relocation and semantic edits with high fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing text-based edits struggle with precise object positioning and object-dragging edits are limited to static relocation; a unified approach is needed for precise, semantically controlled image edits.

Method: Two synergistic branches: (1) moving-reconstruction branch using energy-based gradient guidance to relocate objects and refine cross-attention maps; (2) text-driven editing branch sharing gradient signals with reconstruction to ensure consistent transformations; DDPM inversion and noise-map priors preserve moved object structure.

Result: Extensive experiments show flexible, high-fidelity editing with precise object relocation and semantic control.

Conclusion: InstructUDrag provides a unified diffusion-based framework that combines text instructions with object dragging for versatile, accurate image editing.

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have shown great potential for image editing,
with techniques such as text-based and object-dragging methods emerging as key
approaches. However, each of these methods has inherent limitations: text-based
methods struggle with precise object positioning, while object dragging methods
are confined to static relocation. To address these issues, we propose
InstructUDrag, a diffusion-based framework that combines text instructions with
object dragging, enabling simultaneous object dragging and text-based image
editing. Our framework treats object dragging as an image reconstruction
process, divided into two synergistic branches. The moving-reconstruction
branch utilizes energy-based gradient guidance to move objects accurately,
refining cross-attention maps to enhance relocation precision. The text-driven
editing branch shares gradient signals with the reconstruction branch, ensuring
consistent transformations and allowing fine-grained control over object
attributes. We also employ DDPM inversion and inject prior information into
noise maps to preserve the structure of moved objects. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that InstructUDrag facilitates flexible, high-fidelity image
editing, offering both precision in object relocation and semantic control over
image content.

*Mu Li,Yin Wang,Zhiying Leng,Jiapeng Liu,Frederick W. B. Li,Xiaohui Liang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes FineDual: a tri-stage method for dynamic hierarchical dual-human motion generation, improving interaction modeling and motion quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human interaction is dynamic and hierarchical, varying with distance and across individuals. Existing methods largely ignore distance effects and hierarchy, treating interactions as temporally invariant.

Method: A three-stage pipeline: (1) Self-Learning Stage uses a Large Language Model to split the overall text into individual texts and align individual text/motion features; (2) Adaptive Adjustment Stage predicts interaction distance with an interaction distance predictor and models inter-individual dynamics via an interaction-aware graph network; (3) Teacher-Guided Refinement Stage uses overall text features to refine motion features at the overall level, yielding fine-grained dual-human motion.

Result: Extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations on dual-human motion datasets show FineDual outperforms existing approaches in modeling dynamic hierarchical interactions and generating higher-quality motion.

Conclusion: The proposed tri-stage framework effectively captures dynamic hierarchical interactions in dual-human motion generation, enabling fine-grained, high-quality results.

Abstract: Human interaction is inherently dynamic and hierarchical, where the dynamic
refers to the motion changes with distance, and the hierarchy is from
individual to inter-individual and ultimately to overall motion. Exploiting
these properties is vital for dual-human motion generation, while existing
methods almost model human interaction temporally invariantly, ignoring
distance and hierarchy. To address it, we propose a fine-grained dual-human
motion generation method, namely FineDual, a tri-stage method to model the
dynamic hierarchical interaction from individual to inter-individual. The first
stage, Self-Learning Stage, divides the dual-human overall text into individual
texts through a Large Language Model, aligning text features and motion
features at the individual level. The second stage, Adaptive Adjustment Stage,
predicts interaction distance by an interaction distance predictor, modeling
human interactions dynamically at the inter-individual level by an
interaction-aware graph network. The last stage, Teacher-Guided Refinement
Stage, utilizes overall text features as guidance to refine motion features at
the overall level, generating fine-grained and high-quality dual-human motion.
Extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations on dual-human motion
datasets demonstrate that our proposed FineDual outperforms existing
approaches, effectively modeling dynamic hierarchical human interaction.

*Chenying Liu,Gianmarco Perantoni,Lorenzo Bruzzone,Xiao Xiang Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AdaGC is a general SPML framework for remote sensing imagery that uses gradient calibration with Mixup and dual EMA to generate robust pseudo-labels, adaptively triggered after a warm-up stage, achieving state-of-the-art performance and robustness against label noise on RS datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Single-positive multi-label learning (SPML) reduces labeling cost but introduces supervision ambiguity. In remote sensing, obtaining complete multi-label annotations is challenging, and RS SPML research is limited. A scalable, noise-robust method is needed.

Method: Adaptive Gradient Calibration (AdaGC) merges gradient calibration with Mixup augmentation and a dual exponential moving average (EMA) module to produce pseudo-labels. It includes an adaptive trigger, based on training dynamics, to activate GC after an initial warm-up, mitigating overfitting to noisy labels.

Result: Experiments on two RS datasets with two types of label noise demonstrate that AdaGC achieves state-of-the-art performance and exhibits strong robustness across diverse settings.

Conclusion: AdaGC offers a generalizable SPML framework for RS imagery, effectively mitigating label-noise issues and showing promise for broader applicability beyond the RS domain.

Abstract: Multi-label classification (MLC) offers a more comprehensive semantic
understanding of Remote Sensing (RS) imagery compared to traditional
single-label classification (SLC). However, obtaining complete annotations for
MLC is particularly challenging due to the complexity and high cost of the
labeling process. As a practical alternative, single-positive multi-label
learning (SPML) has emerged, where each image is annotated with only one
relevant label, and the model is expected to recover the full set of labels.
While scalable, SPML introduces significant supervision ambiguity, demanding
specialized solutions for model training. Although various SPML methods have
been proposed in the computer vision domain, research in the RS context remains
limited. To bridge this gap, we propose Adaptive Gradient Calibration (AdaGC),
a novel and generalizable SPML framework tailored to RS imagery. AdaGC adopts a
gradient calibration (GC) mechanism combined with Mixup and a dual exponential
moving average (EMA) module for robust pseudo-label generation. To maximize
AdaGC's effectiveness, we introduce a simple yet theoretically grounded
indicator to adaptively trigger GC after an initial warm-up stage based on
training dynamics, thereby guaranteeing the effectiveness of GC in mitigating
overfitting to label noise. Extensive experiments on two benchmark RS datasets
under two distinct label noise types demonstrate that AdaGC achieves
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance while maintaining strong robustness across
diverse settings.

### [71] [One Stone with Two Birds: A Null-Text-Null Frequency-Aware Diffusion Models for Text-Guided Image Inpainting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08273)
*Haipeng Liu,Yang Wang,Meng Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A frequency-aware diffusion inpainting method (NTN-Diff) with null-text guidance that separately handles high/mid/low-frequency semantics to preserve unmasked regions while ensuring semantic alignment with masked areas.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Preserving unmasked regions and achieving semantic consistency between masked and unmasked regions is hard; previous methods entangle frequency bands and struggle to satisfy both goals under text prompts.

Method: Proposes NTN-Diff: decompose semantics by frequency bands and diffusion denoising into early (high-level) and late (low-level) stages; disentangle mid- and low-frequency bands; use stable mid-frequency guidance to drive null-text denoising of low-frequency bands in masked regions, followed by text-guided denoising to align mid- and low-frequency regions across masked/unmasked areas.

Result: Extensive experiments show NTN-Diff outperforms state-of-the-art diffusion models for text-guided inpainting; code released.

Conclusion: Frequency-aware, staged denoising with null-text guidance successfully solves both preservation and semantic-consistency challenges in text-guided image inpainting, offering a new paradigm for diffusion-based inpainting.

Abstract: Text-guided image inpainting aims at reconstructing the masked regions as per
text prompts, where the longstanding challenges lie in the preservation for
unmasked regions, while achieving the semantics consistency between unmasked
and inpainted masked regions. Previous arts failed to address both of them,
always with either of them to be remedied. Such facts, as we observed, stem
from the entanglement of the hybrid (e.g., mid-and-low) frequency bands that
encode varied image properties, which exhibit different robustness to text
prompts during the denoising process. In this paper, we propose a
null-text-null frequency-aware diffusion models, dubbed \textbf{NTN-Diff}, for
text-guided image inpainting, by decomposing the semantics consistency across
masked and unmasked regions into the consistencies as per each frequency band,
while preserving the unmasked regions, to circumvent two challenges in a row.
Based on the diffusion process, we further divide the denoising process into
early (high-level noise) and late (low-level noise) stages, where the
mid-and-low frequency bands are disentangled during the denoising process. As
observed, the stable mid-frequency band is progressively denoised to be
semantically aligned during text-guided denoising process, which, meanwhile,
serves as the guidance to the null-text denoising process to denoise
low-frequency band for the masked regions, followed by a subsequent text-guided
denoising process at late stage, to achieve the semantics consistency for
mid-and-low frequency bands across masked and unmasked regions, while preserve
the unmasked regions. Extensive experiments validate the superiority of
NTN-Diff over the state-of-the-art diffusion models to text-guided diffusion
models. Our code can be accessed from https://github.com/htyjers/NTN-Diff.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Neural Exposure Fields (NExF) jointly predicts 3D-point exposure with the scene, enabling robust HDR-like view synthesis and faster training, achieving state-of-the-art results on real-world data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world captures exhibit strong per-image exposure variations that degrade neural scene representations; existing methods rely on multi-exposure or post-processing and often underperform in indoor/outdoor scenes with lighting changes.

Method: Introduce a neural exposure field that predicts an optimal exposure per 3D point and jointly optimize this exposure with the neural scene representation using a novel neural conditioning mechanism, allowing 3D-aware exposure optimization instead of per-image adjustments.

Result: The approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging real-world benchmarks, with improvements over strong baselines (over 55% on reported metrics) and faster training compared to prior work.

Conclusion: NExF provides robust, 3D-consistent appearance reconstruction across varying exposure without extra captures or post-processing, and does so with faster training and strong performance gains.

Abstract: Recent advances in neural scene representations have led to unprecedented
quality in 3D reconstruction and view synthesis. Despite achieving high-quality
results for common benchmarks with curated data, outputs often degrade for data
that contain per image variations such as strong exposure changes, present,
e.g., in most scenes with indoor and outdoor areas or rooms with windows. In
this paper, we introduce Neural Exposure Fields (NExF), a novel technique for
robustly reconstructing 3D scenes with high quality and 3D-consistent
appearance from challenging real-world captures. In the core, we propose to
learn a neural field predicting an optimal exposure value per 3D point,
enabling us to optimize exposure along with the neural scene representation.
While capture devices such as cameras select optimal exposure per image/pixel,
we generalize this concept and perform optimization in 3D instead. This enables
accurate view synthesis in high dynamic range scenarios, bypassing the need of
post-processing steps or multi-exposure captures. Our contributions include a
novel neural representation for exposure prediction, a system for joint
optimization of the scene representation and the exposure field via a novel
neural conditioning mechanism, and demonstrated superior performance on
challenging real-world data. We find that our approach trains faster than prior
works and produces state-of-the-art results on several benchmarks improving by
over 55% over best-performing baselines.

### [73] [LTCA: Long-range Temporal Context Attention for Referring Video Object Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08305)
*Cilin Yan,Jingyun Wang,Guoliang Kang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes Long-Range Temporal Context Attention (LTCA) for Referring Video Segmentation to balance locality and globality; uses dilated window local attention stacked across frames plus random global-key attention, plus a global query; achieves state-of-the-art on four RVOS benchmarks with notable gains on MeViS val and valu datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RVOS requires long-range temporal context to capture dynamic attributes of objects described by language. Prior approaches either attend over all frames (heavy computation) or stack dense local attention (limited global view). There is a need for a scalable mechanism that balances locality and globality to improve segmentation quality.

Method: LTCA aggregates global context from two angles. (1) Sparse local attentions: a dilated window attention across frames is stacked in multiple layers to build a broad temporal view, with each query attending to a moving window of frames. (2) Global pool attention: each query attends to a small randomly selected group of keys from a global pool to enhance globality. (3) Global query interaction: a dedicated global query interacts with all other queries to directly encode global context information.

Result: Experiments show state-of-the-art performance on four RVOS benchmarks. The method notably improves results on the MeViS val and valu datasets by 11.3% and 8.3%, respectively.

Conclusion: LTCA provides an effective, scalable mechanism to integrate long-range temporal context into RVOS by combining sparse dilated local attention with selective global-key attention and a global query. This balance of locality and globality yields strong performance gains and establishes a new SOTA on multiple benchmarks.

Abstract: Referring Video Segmentation (RVOS) aims to segment objects in videos given
linguistic expressions. The key to solving RVOS is to extract long-range
temporal context information from the interactions of expressions and videos to
depict the dynamic attributes of each object. Previous works either adopt
attention across all the frames or stack dense local attention to achieve a
global view of temporal context. However, they fail to strike a good balance
between locality and globality, and the computation complexity significantly
increases with the increase of video length. In this paper, we propose an
effective long-range temporal context attention (LTCA) mechanism to aggregate
global context information into object features. Specifically, we aggregate the
global context information from two aspects. Firstly, we stack sparse local
attentions to balance the locality and globality. We design a dilated window
attention across frames to aggregate local context information and perform such
attention in a stack of layers to enable a global view. Further, we enable each
query to attend to a small group of keys randomly selected from a global pool
to enhance the globality. Secondly, we design a global query to interact with
all the other queries to directly encode the global context information.
Experiments show our method achieves new state-of-the-art on four referring
video segmentation benchmarks. Notably, our method shows an improvement of
11.3% and 8.3% on the MeViS valu and val datasets respectively.

TL;DR: Introduces CMAT to transfer 2D vision foundation model semantics into 3D, enabling CAST for prompt-aware 3D affordance segmentation, achieving new SOTA.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D affordance segmentation struggles with sparsity, noise, and geometric ambiguity when learning 3D features in isolation; existing pipelines rely on generic encoders and 2D prompts, lacking semantically consistent functional boundaries.

Method: Cross-Modal Affinity Transfer (CMAT) pre-training aligns a 3D encoder with lifted 2D semantics and jointly optimizes reconstruction, affinity, and diversity to produce semantically organized representations. Built on CMAT, Cross-modal Affordance Segmentation Transformer (CAST) uses multi-modal prompts with CMAT features to generate precise, prompt-aware segmentation maps.

Result: Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate that the framework achieves state-of-the-art performance for 3D affordance segmentation.

Conclusion: The proposed semantic-grounded, cross-modal framework effectively transfers rich 2D semantic knowledge to 3D, improving segmentation quality and enabling prompt-aware affordance segmentation; sets a new benchmark and offers a strong direction for 3D understanding in manipulation and AR.

Abstract: Affordance segmentation aims to parse 3D objects into functionally distinct
parts, bridging recognition and interaction for applications in robotic
manipulation, embodied AI, and AR. While recent studies leverage visual or
textual prompts to guide this process, they often rely on point cloud encoders
as generic feature extractors, overlooking the intrinsic challenges of 3D data
such as sparsity, noise, and geometric ambiguity. As a result, 3D features
learned in isolation frequently lack clear and semantically consistent
functional boundaries. To address this bottleneck, we propose a
semantic-grounded learning paradigm that transfers rich semantic knowledge from
large-scale 2D Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) into the 3D domain.
Specifically, We introduce Cross-Modal Affinity Transfer (CMAT), a pre-training
strategy that aligns a 3D encoder with lifted 2D semantics and jointly
optimizes reconstruction, affinity, and diversity to yield semantically
organized representations. Building on this backbone, we further design the
Cross-modal Affordance Segmentation Transformer (CAST), which integrates
multi-modal prompts with CMAT-pretrained features to generate precise,
prompt-aware segmentation maps. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks
demonstrate that our framework establishes new state-of-the-art results for 3D
affordance segmentation.

### [75] [LinVideo: A Post-Training Framework towards O(n) Attention in Efficient Video Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08318)
*Yushi Huang,Xingtong Ge,Ruihao Gong,Chengtao Lv,Jun Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LinVideo introduces a data-free post-training framework that replaces a target number of self-attention modules with linear attention in video diffusion models, using selective transfer and an anytime distribution matching objective to maintain quality while speeding up inference (1.25–2.00x; 15.92x with a 4-step distilled model).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Self-attention in video diffusion models scales quadratically with sequence length, causing high computation costs. Linear attention reduces cost but may hurt expressiveness and requires expensive pretraining. A data-free, post-training method is needed to speed up inference while preserving quality.

Method: Frame layer replaceability as a binary classification problem and apply selective transfer to automatically and progressively convert layers to linear attention. Introduce an anytime distribution matching (ADM) objective to align sample distributions across timesteps along the sampling trajectory, enabling efficient post-training without data and preserving performance.

Result: Demonstrates 1.25–2.00x speedup with preserved generation quality. A 4-step distilled model achieves 15.92x latency reduction with minimal visual quality drop.

Conclusion: Selective transfer combined with the ADM objective enables efficient, data-free post-training replacement of self-attention with linear attention in video diffusion models, yielding substantial speedups with minimal quality loss.

Abstract: Video diffusion models (DMs) have enabled high-quality video synthesis.
However, their computation costs scale quadratically with sequence length
because self-attention has quadratic complexity. While linear attention lowers
the cost, fully replacing quadratic attention requires expensive pretraining
due to the limited expressiveness of linear attention and the complexity of
spatiotemporal modeling in video generation. In this paper, we present
LinVideo, an efficient data-free post-training framework that replaces a target
number of self-attention modules with linear attention while preserving the
original model's performance. First, we observe a significant disparity in the
replaceability of different layers. Instead of manual or heuristic choices, we
frame layer selection as a binary classification problem and propose selective
transfer, which automatically and progressively converts layers to linear
attention with minimal performance impact. Additionally, to overcome the
ineffectiveness and inefficiency of existing objectives for this transfer
process, we introduce an anytime distribution matching (ADM) objective that
aligns the distributions of samples across any timestep along the sampling
trajectory. This objective is efficient and recovers model performance.
Extensive experiments show that our method achieves a 1.25-2.00x speedup while
preserving generation quality, and our 4-step distilled model further delivers
a 15.92x latency reduction with minimal visual quality drop.

### [76] [Evaluating Small Vision-Language Models on Distance-Dependent Traffic Perception](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08352)
*Nikos Theodoridis,Tim Brophy,Reenu Mohandas,Ganesh Sistu,Fiachra Collins,Anthony Scanlan,Ciaran Eising*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introducing DTPQA, the first VQA benchmark focused on distance-aware perception in traffic scenes. It evaluates small vision-language models on perception-only questions with distance annotations and reveals a sizable gap to human performance, especially in tasks like left-right discrimination; limitations include a small human sample size.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autonomous driving requires reliable, long-range perception. While vision-language models offer strong generalization, assessment should isolate perception (not reasoning). The benchmark targets perception at near and far ranges (up to 20m and 30+ m) and emphasizes distance-aware evaluation to ensure safety-critical reliability.

Method: Propose Distance-Annotated Traffic Perception Question Answering (DTPQA), a VQA dataset with distance annotations focused on perception in traffic scenes. Excludes reasoning-based questions. Evaluates several state-of-the-art small VLMs on the benchmark to assess perception capabilities.

Result: Small VLMs achieve ~60% average accuracy, far below human performance (~85%). The human sample is small, introducing statistical limitations. The dataset identifies specific perception tasks that are challenging for models, notably distinguishing left from right.

Conclusion: Current small VLMs underperform in perception-centric traffic tasks. Distance-aware perception benchmarks are essential for safety-critical applications. There is a need for improved perception-focused models or better alignment/training strategies, and larger, more robust human baselines to reduce statistical uncertainty.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are becoming increasingly powerful,
demonstrating strong performance on a variety of tasks that require both visual
and textual understanding. Their strong generalisation abilities make them a
promising component for automated driving systems, which must handle unexpected
corner cases. However, to be trusted in such safety-critical applications, a
model must first possess a reliable perception system. Moreover, since critical
objects and agents in traffic scenes are often at a distance, we require
systems that are not "shortsighted", i.e., systems with strong perception
capabilities at both close (up to 20 meters) and long (30+ meters) range. With
this in mind, we introduce Distance-Annotated Traffic Perception Question
Answering (DTPQA), the first Visual Question Answering (VQA) benchmark focused
solely on perception-based questions in traffic scenes, enriched with distance
annotations. By excluding questions that require reasoning, we ensure that
model performance reflects perception capabilities alone. Since automated
driving hardware has limited processing power and cannot support large VLMs,
our study centers on smaller VLMs. More specifically, we evaluate several
state-of-the-art (SOTA) small VLMs on DTPQA and show that, despite the
simplicity of the questions, these models significantly underperform compared
to humans (~60% average accuracy for the best-performing small VLM versus ~85%
human performance). However, it is important to note that the human sample size
was relatively small, which imposes statistical limitations. We also identify
specific perception tasks, such as distinguishing left from right, that remain
particularly challenging for these models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A lightweight image enhancement framework for low-light and hazy images that simulates degraded conditions with a forward filter and uses approximate reverse filters for restoration; claims competitive/SOTA performance with a MATLAB implementation in a few lines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve visibility in challenging imaging conditions (low light, haze, fog, sand, underwater) using a simple, fast, and easy-to-implement approach.

Method: Design a forward image filter that simulates degraded conditions (low-light/hazy) and derive approximate reverse filters to reconstruct enhanced images while minimizing distortion.

Result: Experimental results show the method is competitive with, and often surpasses, state-of-the-art techniques, especially for extremely dark and hazy images.

Conclusion: The approach emphasizes simplicity and practicality, enabling effective enhancement with only a few lines of MATLAB code.

Abstract: We introduce a simple and efficient method to enhance and clarify images.
More specifically, we deal with low light image enhancement and clarification
of hazy imagery (hazy/foggy images, images containing sand dust, and underwater
images). Our method involves constructing an image filter to simulate low-light
or hazy conditions and deriving approximate reverse filters to minimize
distortions in the enhanced images. Experimental results show that our approach
is highly competitive and often surpasses state-of-the-art techniques in
handling extremely dark images and in enhancing hazy images. A key advantage of
our approach lies in its simplicity: Our method is implementable with just a
few lines of MATLAB code.

*Mattia Ferrari,Lorenzo Bruzzone*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A diffusion-guided data augmentation approach with a lightweight transformer and tailored loss/scheduler improves hyperspectral land-cover classification on small datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overfitting risk on small labeled hyperspectral datasets; need effective augmentation and stable training to exploit high-dimensional data and discriminative classes.

Method: Use a guided diffusion model for data augmentation; train a lightweight transformer to model complex patterns; employ a modified weighted loss and an optimized cosine variance scheduler to enable fast, stable training; evaluate on PRISMA hyperspectral data for forest classification with 10 classes.

Result: Outperforms competing augmentation methods in average and weighted average accuracy; demonstrates stable training and better generalization on small datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed diffusion-guided augmentation framework with a compact transformer and tuned loss/scheduler provides robust, scalable improvements for small-sample hyperspectral land-cover classification.

Abstract: The introduction of new generation hyperspectral satellite sensors, combined
with advancements in deep learning methodologies, has significantly enhanced
the ability to discriminate detailed land-cover classes at medium-large scales.
However, a significant challenge in deep learning methods is the risk of
overfitting when training networks with small labeled datasets. In this work,
we propose a data augmentation technique that leverages a guided diffusion
model. To effectively train the model with a limited number of labeled samples
and to capture complex patterns in the data, we implement a lightweight
transformer network. Additionally, we introduce a modified weighted loss
function and an optimized cosine variance scheduler, which facilitate fast and
effective training on small datasets. We evaluate the effectiveness of the
proposed method on a forest classification task with 10 different forest types
using hyperspectral images acquired by the PRISMA satellite. The results
demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms other data augmentation
techniques in both average and weighted average accuracy. The effectiveness of
the method is further highlighted by the stable training behavior of the model,
which addresses a common limitation in the practical application of deep
generative models for data augmentation.

### [79] [UniVideo: Unified Understanding, Generation, and Editing for Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08377)
*Cong Wei,Quande Liu,Zixuan Ye,Qiulin Wang,Xintao Wang,Pengfei Wan,Kun Gai,Wenhu Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A dual‑stream UniVideo model extends unified multimodal modeling to video by combining a multimodal LLM for instruction understanding with a video‑generation DiT, enabling unified generation/editing and strong generalization via task composition and cross‑domain transfer, and achieving state‑of‑the‑art performance on video tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Unified multimodal models have advanced image tasks but largely ignore video; there is a need for a single framework that can understand multimodal instructions and produce consistent, editable video content.

Method:  UniVideo uses a dual‑stream architecture: an MLLM for interpreting multimodal instructions and an MMDiT for video generation. It is jointly trained across diverse video generation and editing tasks, supports visual prompts, and enables task composition by combining capabilities in one instruction; it also transfers editing capabilities learned from large‑scale image editing data to video.

Result:  UniVideo matches or surpasses state‑of‑the‑art task‑specific baselines for text/image‑to‑video generation, in‑context video generation, and in‑context video editing. It demonstrates two generalization forms: (1) task composition via multi‑capability instructions, and (2) cross‑domain/s free‑form editing transfer from image editing to video without explicit video editing training.

Conclusion:  UniVideo offers a versatile, unified framework for video generation/editing with strong generalization and a unified instruction paradigm; code and model release is planned to foster future research.

Abstract: Unified multimodal models have shown promising results in multimodal content
generation and editing but remain largely limited to the image domain. In this
work, we present UniVideo, a versatile framework that extends unified modeling
to the video domain. UniVideo adopts a dual-stream design, combining a
Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) for instruction understanding with a
Multimodal DiT (MMDiT) for video generation. This design enables accurate
interpretation of complex multimodal instructions while preserving visual
consistency. Built on this architecture, UniVideo unifies diverse video
generation and editing tasks under a single multimodal instruction paradigm and
is jointly trained across them. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UniVideo
matches or surpasses state-of-the-art task-specific baselines in
text/image-to-video generation, in-context video generation and in-context
video editing. Notably, the unified design of UniVideo enables two forms of
generalization. First, UniVideo supports task composition, such as combining
editing with style transfer, by integrating multiple capabilities within a
single instruction. Second, even without explicit training on free-form video
editing, UniVideo transfers its editing capability from large-scale image
editing data to this setting, handling unseen instructions such as
green-screening characters or changing materials within a video. Beyond these
core capabilities, UniVideo also supports visual-prompt-based video generation,
where the MLLM interprets visual prompts and guides the MMDiT during synthesis.
To foster future research, we will release our model and code.

### [80] [Detecting Legend Items on Historical Maps Using GPT-4o with In-Context Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08385)
*Sofia Kirsanova,Yao-Yi Chiang,Weiwei Duan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Combines LayoutLMv3 and GPT-4o with in-context learning to link historical map legend symbols to descriptions, achieving strong accuracy and providing insights into prompt design for scalable, layout-aware legend parsing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Historical map legends are essential yet unstructured; inconsistent layouts hinder automatic extraction and indexing; there is a need to connect symbols to descriptions in a structured, scalable way.

Method: LayoutLMv3 for layout detection to identify legend items; GPT-4o with in-context learning and structured JSON prompts to predict bounding boxes and link each symbol to its description; evaluation shows improved performance over a baseline.

Result: Achieves 88% F1 and 85% IoU; analysis of how prompt design, example counts, and alignment affect performance; demonstrates scalability and layout-aware parsing.

Conclusion: The approach enables scalable parsing of map legends across visual styles and improves the indexing/searchability of historical maps by effectively linking symbols to descriptions using a hybrid layout-aware OCR and LLM framework.

Abstract: Historical map legends are critical for interpreting cartographic symbols.
However, their inconsistent layouts and unstructured formats make automatic
extraction challenging. Prior work focuses primarily on segmentation or general
optical character recognition (OCR), with few methods effectively matching
legend symbols to their corresponding descriptions in a structured manner. We
present a method that combines LayoutLMv3 for layout detection with GPT-4o
using in-context learning to detect and link legend items and their
descriptions via bounding box predictions. Our experiments show that GPT-4 with
structured JSON prompts outperforms the baseline, achieving 88% F-1 and 85%
IoU, and reveal how prompt design, example counts, and layout alignment affect
performance. This approach supports scalable, layout-aware legend parsing and
improves the indexing and searchability of historical maps across various
visual styles.

### [81] [Robust Source-Free Domain Adaptation for Medical Image Segmentation based on Curriculum Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08393)
*Ziqi Zhang,Yuexiang Li,Yawen Huang,Nanjun He,Tao Xu,Liwei Lin,Yefeng Zheng,Shaoxin Li,Feiyue Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduces a curriculum-based framework for source-free domain adaptation (LFC) with easy-to-hard and source-to-target curricula, enabling progressive, privacy-preserving knowledge transfer from source to target; evaluated on fundus and polyp segmentation with state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses data privacy/security concerns in medical imaging by enabling adaptation without access to source data. Builds on the observation that existing SFDA methods focus on pseudo-label refinement but neglect learning dynamics; a progressive, curriculum-driven approach can stabilize and enhance knowledge transfer from source to target.

Method: Proposes learning from curriculum (LFC) for SFDA, consisting of two curricula: (1) easy-to-hard (start with easier samples and gradually increase difficulty to steer optimization) and (2) source-to-target (stabilizes adaptation, ensuring smooth transfer from source to target). The framework refines pseudo labeling during adaptation and guides optimization along progressively challenging samples to improve transfer.

Result: Experimental results on public cross-domain medical imaging datasets (fundus segmentation and polyp segmentation) show that LFC surpasses existing SFDA approaches and achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: A curriculum-based SFDA framework (LFC) effectively facilitates privacy-preserving domain adaptation in medical image segmentation by combining easy-to-hard and source-to-target curricula, yielding stable optimization and superior performance across benchmarks.

Abstract: Recent studies have uncovered a new research line, namely source-free domain
adaptation, which adapts a model to target domains without using the source
data. Such a setting can address the concerns on data privacy and security
issues of medical images. However, current source-free domain adaptation
frameworks mainly focus on the pseudo label refinement for target data without
the consideration of learning procedure. Indeed, a progressive learning process
from source to target domain will benefit the knowledge transfer during model
adaptation. To this end, we propose a curriculum-based framework, namely
learning from curriculum (LFC), for source-free domain adaptation, which
consists of easy-to-hard and source-to-target curricula. Concretely, the former
curriculum enables the framework to start learning with `easy' samples and
gradually tune the optimization direction of model adaption by increasing the
sample difficulty. While, the latter can stablize the adaptation process, which
ensures smooth transfer of the model from the source domain to the target. We
evaluate the proposed source-free domain adaptation approach on the public
cross-domain datasets for fundus segmentation and polyp segmentation. The
extensive experimental results show that our framework surpasses the existing
approaches and achieves a new state-of-the-art.

*Zeqing Wang,Xinyu Wei,Bairui Li,Zhen Guo,Jinrui Zhang,Hongyang Wei,Keze Wang,Lei Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VideoVerse introduces a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating Text-to-Video models on event-level temporal causality and world knowledge. It uses 300 prompts (815 events, 793 binary questions), a human-aligned QA pipeline with vision-language models, and evaluates both open- and closed-source SOTA T2V models to assess how far current generators are from true world models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current T2V benchmarks increasingly fail to differentiate state-of-the-art models and inadequately assess event-level temporal causality and world knowledge, which are crucial for building accurate world models.

Method: Collect diverse videos, extract event-level, causally linked descriptions, and rewrite them into prompts. Design a suite of ten binary evaluation dimensions covering dynamic/static properties. Create 300 prompts, 815 events, and 793 binary questions. Develop a human-preference-aligned QA-based evaluation pipeline using modern vision-language models. Systematically evaluate multiple T2V models.

Result: A systematic evaluation of both open-source and closed-source T2V models on VideoVerse, with in-depth analysis of how far current generators are from achieving world-model level capabilities.

Conclusion: VideoVerse provides a comprehensive, causality-and-world-knowledge-focused benchmark for T2V, highlighting gaps and guiding future work toward true world-model understanding.

Abstract: The recent rapid advancement of Text-to-Video (T2V) generation technologies,
which are critical to build ``world models'', makes the existing benchmarks
increasingly insufficient to evaluate state-of-the-art T2V models. First,
current evaluation dimensions, such as per-frame aesthetic quality and temporal
consistency, are no longer able to differentiate state-of-the-art T2V models.
Second, event-level temporal causality, which not only distinguishes video from
other modalities but also constitutes a crucial component of world models, is
severely underexplored in existing benchmarks. Third, existing benchmarks lack
a systematic assessment of world knowledge, which are essential capabilities
for building world models. To address these issues, we introduce VideoVerse, a
comprehensive benchmark that focuses on evaluating whether a T2V model could
understand complex temporal causality and world knowledge in the real world. We
collect representative videos across diverse domains (e.g., natural landscapes,
sports, indoor scenes, science fiction, chemical and physical experiments) and
extract their event-level descriptions with inherent temporal causality, which
are then rewritten into text-to-video prompts by independent annotators. For
each prompt, we design a suite of binary evaluation questions from the
perspective of dynamic and static properties, with a total of ten carefully
defined evaluation dimensions. In total, our VideoVerse comprises 300 carefully
curated prompts, involving 815 events and 793 binary evaluation questions.
Consequently, a human preference aligned QA-based evaluation pipeline is
developed by using modern vision-language models. Finally, we perform a
systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art open-source and closed-source T2V
models on VideoVerse, providing in-depth analysis on how far the current T2V
generators are from world models.

*Kaiwen Zheng,Yuji Wang,Qianli Ma,Huayu Chen,Jintao Zhang,Yogesh Balaji,Jianfei Chen,Ming-Yu Liu,Jun Zhu,Qinsheng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: rCM scales continuous-time consistency distillation to large image/video diffusion models by introducing score regularization via score distillation, enabling fast sampling (1–4 steps) and competitive quality/diversity without GAN tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extend sCM to scale and real-world data (text-to-image, video) by solving infrastructure (Jacobian-vector product) bottlenecks and addressing quality issues (fine detail, error accumulation, mode-covering).

Method: 1) Develop a parallelized FlashAttention-2 JVP kernel to train models with >10B parameters. 2) Introduce score-regularized continuous-time consistency model (rCM) by adding score distillation as a long-skip regularizer, balancing mode-covering and mode-seeking objectives. 3) Validate on large models (Cosmos-Predict2, Wan2.1) up to 14B parameters and 5-second videos; compare to DMD2; measure quality/diversity and sampling speed.

Result: rCM matches or surpasses DMD2 on quality metrics while offering improved diversity; distilled models generate high-fidelity samples in 1–4 steps, achieving 15×–50× faster sampling, without GAN tuning or extensive hyperparameter search.

Conclusion: rCM provides a practical and theoretically grounded framework for scalable diffusion distillation on large models, combining efficiency, quality, and diversity for image and video generation.

Abstract: This work represents the first effort to scale up continuous-time consistency
distillation to general application-level image and video diffusion models.
Although continuous-time consistency model (sCM) is theoretically principled
and empirically powerful for accelerating academic-scale diffusion, its
applicability to large-scale text-to-image and video tasks remains unclear due
to infrastructure challenges in Jacobian-vector product (JVP) computation and
the limitations of standard evaluation benchmarks. We first develop a
parallelism-compatible FlashAttention-2 JVP kernel, enabling sCM training on
models with over 10 billion parameters and high-dimensional video tasks. Our
investigation reveals fundamental quality limitations of sCM in fine-detail
generation, which we attribute to error accumulation and the "mode-covering"
nature of its forward-divergence objective. To remedy this, we propose the
score-regularized continuous-time consistency model (rCM), which incorporates
score distillation as a long-skip regularizer. This integration complements sCM
with the "mode-seeking" reverse divergence, effectively improving visual
quality while maintaining high generation diversity. Validated on large-scale
models (Cosmos-Predict2, Wan2.1) up to 14B parameters and 5-second videos, rCM
matches or surpasses the state-of-the-art distillation method DMD2 on quality
metrics while offering notable advantages in diversity, all without GAN tuning
or extensive hyperparameter searches. The distilled models generate
high-fidelity samples in only $1\sim4$ steps, accelerating diffusion sampling
by $15\times\sim50\times$. These results position rCM as a practical and
theoretically grounded framework for advancing large-scale diffusion
distillation.

*Noor Islam S. Mohammad*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A modular spatial image-processing framework that combines quantization, color/brightness enhancement, sharpening, bidirectional transformation pipelines, and geometric feature extraction to enable robust, real-time analysis with deterministic performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide an integrated, modular pipeline for comprehensive image analysis that preserves structural details while enhancing visual information, enabling real-time computer-vision tasks across diverse datasets.

Method: 1) Stepwise grayscale quantization into eight levels to produce posterization while preserving structure. 2) Color enhancement via histogram equalization in RGB and YCrCb (YCrCb preferred for contrast with chrominance fidelity). 3) Brightness adjustment by manipulating HSV value channel. 4) Image sharpening using a 3x3 convolution kernel. 5) Bidirectional transformation pipeline integrating unsharp masking, gamma correction, and noise amplification, achieving forward accuracy of 76.10% and reverse 74.80%. 6) Geometric feature extraction using Canny edge detection, Hough-based line estimation (e.g., 51.50 degrees for billiard cue alignment), Harris corner detection, and morphological window localization. 7) Cue isolation yielding 81.87% similarity against ground truth. 8) Experimental evaluation across diverse datasets for real-time, deterministic performance.

Result: The framework demonstrates coherent integration of multiple image-processing stages with measurable performance gains: forward/backward transformation accuracy around 76%/75%, cue isolation similarity ~82%, and a precise Hough-estimated cue orientation (~51.5 degrees). Exhibits robustness across varied datasets and supports real-time image analysis.

Conclusion: This modular approach shows promise for real-time computer vision applications, especially where reliable geometric cue extraction is required (e.g., billiards cue tracking). The combination of posterization, space-color-space adaptations, brightness control, and sharpening within a bidirectional pipeline provides a flexible, deterministic toolset for diverse imaging tasks, though real-time deployment would benefit from further efficiency and edge-case evaluations.

Abstract: This study introduces a modular framework for spatial image processing,
integrating grayscale quantization, color and brightness enhancement, image
sharpening, bidirectional transformation pipelines, and geometric feature
extraction. A stepwise intensity transformation quantizes grayscale images into
eight discrete levels, producing a posterization effect that simplifies
representation while preserving structural detail. Color enhancement is
achieved via histogram equalization in both RGB and YCrCb color spaces, with
the latter improving contrast while maintaining chrominance fidelity.
Brightness adjustment is implemented through HSV value-channel manipulation,
and image sharpening is performed using a 3 * 3 convolution kernel to enhance
high-frequency details. A bidirectional transformation pipeline that integrates
unsharp masking, gamma correction, and noise amplification achieved accuracy
levels of 76.10% and 74.80% for the forward and reverse processes,
respectively. Geometric feature extraction employed Canny edge detection,
Hough-based line estimation (e.g., 51.50{\deg} for billiard cue alignment),
Harris corner detection, and morphological window localization. Cue isolation
further yielded 81.87\% similarity against ground truth images. Experimental
evaluation across diverse datasets demonstrates robust and deterministic
performance, highlighting its potential for real-time image analysis and
computer vision.

TL;DR: Video-STAR decomposes actions into sub-motions and uses tool-augmented reinforcement learning to enable open-vocabulary action recognition, achieving state-of-the-art on standard video datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text-centric priors in multimodal LLMs hinder discrimination of semantically similar actions in open vocabulary; there is a need for fine-grained, visually grounded representations and dynamic tool use to reduce cross-modal hallucinations.

Method: A framework that decomposes actions into discriminative sub-motions and dynamically invokes domain-specific tools for cross-modal interleaving. It uses reinforcement learning with a hierarchical reward that balances tool usage, sub-motion relevance, and reasoning coherence to encourage autonomous tool use and visually grounded inference.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on HMDB-51, UCF-101, SSv2, Kinetics-400, and Kinetics-600, with improved fine-grained action discrimination and robustness to cross-modal hallucination, demonstrating strong robustness and generalization.

Conclusion: Shifting from text-centric reasoning toward visually grounded inference through sub-motion decomposition and tool-augmented RL enhances open-vocabulary action recognition and reduces cross-modal hallucinations, with broad applicability.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
potential in bridging visual and textual reasoning, yet their reliance on
text-centric priors often limits their ability to disentangle semantically
similar actions in open-vocabulary scenarios. To address this, we propose
Video-STAR, a framework that harmonizes contextual sub-motion decomposition
with tool-augmented reinforcement learning for open-vocabulary action
recognition (OVAR). Unlike prior methods that treat actions as monolithic
entities, our approach innovatively decomposes actions into discriminative
sub-motions for fine-grained matching while dynamically invoking
domain-specific tools for cross-modal interleaving, thereby enabling
category-specific reasoning capacity and reducing cross-modal hallucination.
Moreover, by designing a hierarchical reward that balances tool-usage
efficiency, sub-motion relevance, and structural coherence in reasoning, our
method autonomously leverages external tools to prioritize sub-motion patterns
without explicit supervision, transmitting from text-centric reasoning to
visually grounded inference. Extensive evaluations on HMDB-51, UCF-101, SSv2,
Kinetics-400, and Kinetics-600 datasets demonstrate our state-of-the-art
performance, outperforming existing methods in distinguishing fine-grained
actions and handling cross-modal hallucination, validating our excellent
robustness and generalization.

TL;DR: A new Visual Iconicity Challenge benchmarks vision-language models on sign-language iconicity via three tasks (phonological form prediction, transparency, and graded iconicity ratings) using Sign Language of the Netherlands. Thirteen state-of-the-art models show limited parity with humans: some phonological detail recovered, transparency far from human baselines, and only modest correlation with human iconicity ratings; stronger phonological prediction aligns with iconicity judgments, suggesting shared visually grounded structure and need for embodied learning approaches.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Iconicity links form and meaning, especially in signed languages, making it a natural testbed for grounding in multimodal models. The study aims to diagnose VLMs’ ability to infer dynamic, visually grounded mappings from motion, and to bridge psycholinguistic measures with AI evaluation to guide improvements.

Method: Introduce the Visual Iconicity Challenge, a video-based benchmark with three tasks: (i) phonological sign-form prediction (handshape, location), (ii) transparency (inferring meaning from visual form), and (iii) graded iconicity ratings. Evaluate 13 state-of-the-art VLMs in zero- and few-shot settings on Sign Language of the Netherlands, compared to human baselines.

Result: VLMs recover some handshape and location detail but lag behind humans on phonological form prediction; they are far from human baselines on transparency; only top models show moderate correlation with human iconicity ratings; models with stronger phonological form prediction tend to correlate better with iconicity judgments, indicating shared sensitivity to groundable structure.

Conclusion: The diagnostic tasks are validated and point to the value of human-centric signals and embodied learning approaches to improve iconicity modeling and visual grounding in multimodal models.

Abstract: Iconicity, the resemblance between linguistic form and meaning, is pervasive
in signed languages, offering a natural testbed for visual grounding. For
vision-language models (VLMs), the challenge is to recover such essential
mappings from dynamic human motion rather than static context. We introduce the
\textit{Visual Iconicity Challenge}, a novel video-based benchmark that adapts
psycholinguistic measures to evaluate VLMs on three tasks: (i) phonological
sign-form prediction (e.g., handshape, location), (ii) transparency (inferring
meaning from visual form), and (iii) graded iconicity ratings. We assess $13$
state-of-the-art VLMs in zero- and few-shot settings on Sign Language of the
Netherlands and compare them to human baselines. On \textit{phonological form
prediction}, VLMs recover some handshape and location detail but remain below
human performance; on \textit{transparency}, they are far from human baselines;
and only top models correlate moderately with human \textit{iconicity ratings}.
Interestingly, \textit{models with stronger phonological form prediction
correlate better with human iconicity judgment}, indicating shared sensitivity
to visually grounded structure. Our findings validate these diagnostic tasks
and motivate human-centric signals and embodied learning methods for modelling
iconicity and improving visual grounding in multimodal models.

*Chong Mou,Qichao Sun,Yanze Wu,Pengze Zhang,Xinghui Li,Fulong Ye,Songtao Zhao,Qian He*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: InstructX proposes a unified framework that uses Multimodal LLMs to guide diffusion-based editing for both images and videos; training on image data yields emergent video editing abilities; modality-specific MLLM features enable a single model for both tasks, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Growing interest in leveraging Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) to boost diffusion-model editing; existing work lacks in-depth analysis of MLLM design choices and struggles with video editing due to data and modeling gaps; a unified, instruction-driven approach across image and video editing is desirable.

Method: A comprehensive study of integrating MLLMs and diffusion models for instruction-driven editing; development of InstructX, a unified framework for image and video editing; analysis of cooperation/distinction between image and video editing in a single model; show that image-trained data can yield emergent video editing capabilities; incorporate modality-specific MLLM features to unify tasks; extensive experiments across diverse image/video editing tasks.

Result: Demonstrates broad applicability to image and video editing tasks and achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: A unified, instruction-driven editing framework that leverages image-trained MLLMs yields emergent video capabilities and, with modality-specific features, unifies image and video editing under a single model, showing strong empirical performance and promising directions for future work.

Abstract: With recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) showing
strong visual understanding and reasoning, interest is growing in using them to
improve the editing performance of diffusion models. Despite rapid progress,
most studies lack an in-depth analysis of MLLM design choices. Moreover, the
integration of MLLMs and diffusion models remains an open challenge in some
difficult tasks, such as video editing. In this paper, we present InstructX, a
unified framework for image and video editing. Specifically, we conduct a
comprehensive study on integrating MLLMs and diffusion models for
instruction-driven editing across diverse tasks. Building on this study, we
analyze the cooperation and distinction between images and videos in unified
modeling. (1) We show that training on image data can lead to emergent video
editing capabilities without explicit supervision, thereby alleviating the
constraints imposed by scarce video training data. (2) By incorporating
modality-specific MLLM features, our approach effectively unifies image and
video editing tasks within a single model. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our method can handle a broad range of image and video editing tasks and
achieves state-of-the-art performance.

*Lu Liu,Chunlei Cai,Shaocheng Shen,Jianfeng Liang,Weimin Ouyang,Tianxiao Ye,Jian Mao,Huiyu Duan,Jiangchao Yao,Xiaoyun Zhang,Qiang Hu,Guangtao Zhai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MoA-VR is a modular Mixture-of-Agents video restoration system that mimics expert reasoning with three coordinated agents (degradation ID, routing/restoration, quality assessment) and uses LLM-driven routing and VLM-based degradation identification, plus new datasets (Res-VQ) and VQA tailored for restoration; it outperforms baselines across diverse degradations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world videos suffer from complex, compound degradations; existing methods lack generalization and require manual model selection or monolithic architectures. A modular, intelligent system can adapt to varied degradations like noise, compression, and low-light.

Method: Three agents: Degradation Identification (VLM-based degradation identifier), Routing and Restoration (self-adaptive router using LLMs), Restoration Quality Assessment (VLM-based VQA). Build a large-scale degradation benchmark, create Res-VQ dataset for quality assessment, and train evaluate. The router learns restoration strategies by observing tool usage patterns (self-adaptive).

Result: MoA-VR achieves improved performance on diverse and compound degradations, outperforming existing baselines in objective metrics and perceptual quality.

Conclusion: Integrating multimodal intelligence and modular reasoning yields robust general-purpose video restoration; contributions include benchmark, VLM-based identifiers, LLM-driven routing, and VQA model; potential for broader generalization.

Abstract: Real-world videos often suffer from complex degradations, such as noise,
compression artifacts, and low-light distortions, due to diverse acquisition
and transmission conditions. Existing restoration methods typically require
professional manual selection of specialized models or rely on monolithic
architectures that fail to generalize across varying degradations. Inspired by
expert experience, we propose MoA-VR, the first
\underline{M}ixture-\underline{o}f-\underline{A}gents \underline{V}ideo
\underline{R}estoration system that mimics the reasoning and processing
procedures of human professionals through three coordinated agents: Degradation
Identification, Routing and Restoration, and Restoration Quality Assessment.
Specifically, we construct a large-scale and high-resolution video degradation
recognition benchmark and build a vision-language model (VLM) driven
degradation identifier. We further introduce a self-adaptive router powered by
large language models (LLMs), which autonomously learns effective restoration
strategies by observing tool usage patterns. To assess intermediate and final
processed video quality, we construct the \underline{Res}tored
\underline{V}ideo \underline{Q}uality (Res-VQ) dataset and design a dedicated
VLM-based video quality assessment (VQA) model tailored for restoration tasks.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that MoA-VR effectively handles diverse and
compound degradations, consistently outperforming existing baselines in terms
of both objective metrics and perceptual quality. These results highlight the
potential of integrating multimodal intelligence and modular reasoning in
general-purpose video restoration systems.

*Jiayun Luo,Wan-Cyuan Fan,Lyuyang Wang,Xiangteng He,Tanzila Rahman,Purang Abolmaesumi,Leonid Sigal*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ViT high-norm tokens, named ViT attention sinks, carry high-level semantic information that can enhance LVLM reasoning when leveraged; the study introduces training-free and training-based methods to exploit these tokens, achieving notable performance gains across LVLMs and visual reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understand which visual tokens in ViT most contribute to understanding and reasoning in LVLMs, shifting focus from LLM attention biases to the vision encoder to unlock latent semantic signals.

Method: Identify high-norm tokens in ViT (ViT attention sinks) as a proxy for semantically rich visual signals. Perform qualitative and quantitative analyses to characterize these tokens. Propose and evaluate both training-free and training-based approaches to better propagate and utilize these signals to the LLM, and measure improvements across multiple LVLMs and visual reasoning tasks.

Result: The sink tokens encapsulate high-level semantic concepts from images. Explicitly leveraging these tokens yields substantial improvements in visual reasoning across a range of LVLMs and tasks, indicating the untapped potential of ViT attention sinks.

Conclusion: ViT attention sinks are important yet overlooked components in LVLMs. Properly leveraging high-norm ViT tokens can significantly boost visual understanding and reasoning, suggesting design and training strategies that emphasize the role of the vision encoder in LVLMs.

Abstract: Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) have recently emerged as powerful
architectures capable of understanding and reasoning over both visual and
textual information. These models typically rely on two key components: a
Vision Transformer (ViT) and a Large Language Model (LLM). ViT encodes visual
content into a sequence of image tokens and serves as the perceptual front-end
-- the eyes of the model. In contrast, the LLM interprets these tokens to
perform high-level reasoning, generates responses, and functions as the
cognitive core -- the brain of the model. However, it remains unclear which
visual tokens contribute most significantly to understanding and reasoning, and
how effectively these signals are propagated from ViT to the LLM. While most
existing works have focused on identifying attention sinks, low-semantic tokens
receiving disproportionately high attention, within the LLM, we shift the focus
to the vision encoder by identifying a class of high-norm visual tokens from
ViT, referred to as ViT attention sinks -- a problem that has been rarely
studied but is indeed very important for LVLMs. Our findings show that these
ViT sinks encapsulate high-level semantic concepts from images, allowing the
LLM to perform more effective understanding and reasoning. Despite their
importance, these sink tokens are often overlooked in existing LVLM
architectures. To explore their contribution, we present both qualitative and
quantitative analyses of the information embedded in these sink tokens. We also
propose both training-free and training-based approaches to better leverage how
this information is interpreted by the LLM, and to what extent. By explicitly
utilizing these tokens, we demonstrate substantial improvements across a range
of LVLMs and visual reasoning tasks, highlighting the untapped potential of ViT
attention sinks in enhancing visual reasoning.

*Md Kowsher,Ali O. Polat,Ehsan Mohammady Ardehaly,Mehrdad Salehi,Zia Ghiasi,Prasanth Murali,Chen Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SliceFine is a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method that updates only weight slices (subnetworks) in pretrained models, supported by a universal winning slice hypothesis. It achieves performance on par with state-of-the-art PEFT methods without introducing new parameters, while offering faster training and better memory efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reduce the cost and complexity of fine-tuning large pretrained models by exploiting redundancy in their weight matrices, and provide a theory-backed PEFT approach that does not rely on adapters.

Method: Develop a theoretical framework showing two phenomena—spectral balance across weight slices and high task energy in backbone representations—that imply a universal winning slice exists. Propose SliceFine, which updates only selected slices of the original weights, introducing zero new parameters and avoiding adapters.

Result: Empirically, SliceFine matches state-of-the-art PEFT performance on language and vision tasks and substantially improves training speed, memory efficiency, and model compactness.

Conclusion: Provides a theoretically grounded alternative to existing PEFT techniques, bridging theory and practice and highlighting redundancy in pretrained weights that can be leveraged for efficient fine-tuning without additional parameters.

Abstract: This paper presents a theoretical framework explaining why fine tuning small,
randomly selected subnetworks (slices) within pre trained models can be
sufficient for downstream adaptation. We prove that pretrained networks exhibit
a universal winning slice property arising from two phenomena: (1) spectral
balance the eigenspectra of different weight matrix slices are remarkably
similar; and (2) high task energy their backbone representations retain rich,
task relevant features. This leads to the Universal Winning Slice Hypothesis,
which provides a theoretical foundation for parameter efficient fine tuning
(PEFT) in large scale models. Inspired by this, we propose SliceFine, a PEFT
method that exploits this inherent redundancy by updating only selected slices
of the original weights introducing zero new parameters, unlike adapter-based
approaches. Empirically, SliceFine matches the performance of state of the art
PEFT methods across language and vision tasks, while significantly improving
training speed, memory efficiency, and model compactness. Our work bridges
theory and practice, offering a theoretically grounded alternative to existing
PEFT techniques.

*Zhiyuan Zhang,Can Wang,Dongdong Chen,Jing Liao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FlexTraj introduces a unified point-based trajectory control framework for image-to-video generation, enabling dense or sparse control with robust alignment-agnostic performance and faster convergence via a sequence-concatenation training scheme and annealing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need for flexible, robust trajectory control in video generation. Existing methods inject trajectory conditions via token concatenation or ControlNet, which can be inefficient or brittle under misalignment. A unified point-based representation—encoding each point with a segmentation ID, a temporally consistent trajectory ID, and an optional color channel—could enable multi-granularity control and smoother training.

Method: Proposes a unified point-based motion representation where each point carries a segmentation ID, a temporally consistent trajectory ID, and an optional color channel for appearance cues. Uses a sequence-concatenation scheme to inject trajectory conditions into the video generator, rather than token concatenation or ControlNet. Trains with an annealing strategy that gradually reduces reliance on complete supervision and aligned conditions to improve robustness. Demonstrates multi-granularity, alignment-agnostic trajectory control and supports various video-generation applications.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate faster convergence, stronger controllability, and more efficient inference with robust performance under unaligned conditions. Applications include motion cloning, drag-based image-to-video, motion interpolation, camera redirection, flexible action control, and mesh animations.

Conclusion: FlexTraj delivers a flexible, alignment-robust trajectory control framework for image-to-video generation, achieving faster convergence, stronger controllability, and efficient inference while enabling a range of applications such as motion cloning, interpolation, and mesh animation.

Abstract: We present FlexTraj, a framework for image-to-video generation with flexible

enabling both dense and sparse trajectory control. Instead of injecting
trajectory conditions into the video generator through token concatenation or
ControlNet, FlexTraj employs an efficient sequence-concatenation scheme that
achieves faster convergence, stronger controllability, and more efficient

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Progressive, hierarchical spatial reasoning in vision-language models via SpatialLadder: a 26k-sample multimodal dataset and a three-stage training pipeline yielding a 3B SpatialLadder model with strong in-domain and out-of-domain performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current approaches to spatial reasoning in Vision-Language Models struggle because they learn spatial reasoning directly without establishing hierarchical foundations of perception and understanding; a staged, progressive framework may build more robust spatial intelligence.

Method: Introduce SpatialLadder-26k, a multimodal dataset (26,610 samples) covering object localization, single-image, multi-view, and video spatial tasks with a standardized pipeline; implement a three-stage progressive training framework: (1) establish spatial perception via object localization, (2) develop spatial understanding through multi-dimensional spatial tasks, (3) strengthen complex reasoning via reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards; train SpatialLadder, a 3B-parameter model.

Result: SpatialLadder achieves state-of-the-art spatial reasoning performance with a 23.4% average improvement over the base model; surpasses GPT-4o by 20.8% and Gemini-2.0-Flash by 10.1%; shows 7.2% improvement on out-of-domain benchmarks, indicating robust generalization.

Conclusion: Progressive training from perception to reasoning is essential for robust spatial intelligence and generalizes beyond in-domain tasks.

Abstract: Spatial reasoning remains a fundamental challenge for Vision-Language Models
(VLMs), with current approaches struggling to achieve robust performance
despite recent advances. We identify that this limitation stems from a critical
gap: existing methods attempt to learn spatial reasoning directly without
establishing the hierarchical foundations of perception and understanding. To
address this challenge, we present a comprehensive methodology for building
spatial intelligence progressively. We introduce SpatialLadder-26k, a
multimodal dataset containing 26,610 samples spanning object localization,
single image, multi-view, and video spatial reasoning tasks, constructed
through a standardized pipeline that ensures systematic coverage across
modalities. Building on this dataset, we design a three-stage progressive
training framework that (1) establishes spatial perception through object
localization, (2) develops spatial understanding through multi-dimensional
spatial tasks, and (3) strengthens complex reasoning via reinforcement learning
with verifiable rewards. This approach yields SpatialLadder, a 3B-parameter
model that achieves state-of-the-art performance on spatial reasoning
benchmarks, with 23.4% average improvement over the base model, surpassing
GPT-4o by 20.8% and Gemini-2.0-Flash by 10.1%. Notably, SpatialLadder maintains
strong generalization with 7.2% improvement on out-of-domain benchmarks,
demonstrating that progressive training from perception to reasoning is
essential for robust spatial intelligence.

*Rishubh Parihar,Or Patashnik,Daniil Ostashev,R. Venkatesh Babu,Daniel Cohen-Or,Kuan-Chieh Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduces Kontinuous Kontext, an instruction-driven image editing model with continuous control over edit strength via a scalar input, mapped into the model's modulation space by a lightweight projector, trained on synthetic data. It enables fine-grained edits across diverse tasks without attribute-specific training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Relying solely on natural-language instructions yields limited fine-grained control over edit strength. A continuous, user-adjustable edit strength is desirable to achieve subtle to strong modifications while maintaining alignment with the instruction.

Method: Extend a state-of-the-art image editing model with an additional scalar edit-strength input. Train a lightweight projector that maps (edit instruction, scalar strength) to coefficients in the model's modulation space. Create a diverse synthetic dataset of image–edit–instruction–strength quadruplets using existing generative models, followed by filtering to ensure quality. Apply the approach across editing axes (stylization, attribute, material, background, shape) without attribute-specific training.

Result: The model provides fine-grained, continuous control over edit strength, enabling gradual transitions from no change to fully realized edits. It generalizes to a range of operations and does not require per-attribute training.

Conclusion: Kontinuous Kontext offers a unified, scalable framework for controllable image editing driven by natural language, with explicit, continuous strength control across diverse edit types and without the need for attribute-specific training.

Abstract: Instruction-based image editing offers a powerful and intuitive way to
manipulate images through natural language. Yet, relying solely on text
instructions limits fine-grained control over the extent of edits. We introduce
Kontinuous Kontext, an instruction-driven editing model that provides a new
dimension of control over edit strength, enabling users to adjust edits
gradually from no change to a fully realized result in a smooth and continuous
manner. Kontinuous Kontext extends a state-of-the-art image editing model to
accept an additional input, a scalar edit strength which is then paired with
the edit instruction, enabling explicit control over the extent of the edit. To
inject this scalar information, we train a lightweight projector network that
maps the input scalar and the edit instruction to coefficients in the model's
modulation space. For training our model, we synthesize a diverse dataset of
image-edit-instruction-strength quadruplets using existing generative models,
followed by a filtering stage to ensure quality and consistency. Kontinuous
Kontext provides a unified approach for fine-grained control over edit strength
for instruction driven editing from subtle to strong across diverse operations
such as stylization, attribute, material, background, and shape changes,
without requiring attribute-specific training.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper exposes a deficiency in long-chain reflective reasoning in current Multimodal LLMs, introduces MM-HELIX—a benchmark with 1,260 samples across 42 tasks—and a methodology to enhance reasoning via data and training. It presents MM-HELIX-100K (100k reflective traces) and Adaptive Hybrid Policy Optimization (AHPO) to fuse supervised and online learning. Applied to Qwen2.5-VL-7B, the approach yields +18.6% accuracy on MM-HELIX and +5.7% average gain on general math/logic tasks, demonstrating learnability and generalization of reflective reasoning in MLLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs perform well on standard reasoning but struggle with long-chain reflective reasoning required for complex, real-world problems; there is a need to systematically evaluate and improve this capability.

Method: 1) Construct MM-HELIX benchmark via data synthesis (1260 samples, 42 tasks) requiring iterative thinking/backtracking. 2) Create MM-HELIX-100K by Step-Elicited Response Generation for instruction-tuning. 3) Propose Adaptive Hybrid Policy Optimization (AHPO) to unite offline supervision and online optimization in one stage to mitigate sparse rewards and forgetting after SFT. 4) Evaluate on Qwen2.5-VL-7B and test generalization.

Result: MM-HELIX reveals deficits in long-chain reflective reasoning among existing MLLMs. AHPO with MM-HELIX-100K data improves performance: +18.6% accuracy on the MM-HELIX benchmark and +5.7% average gain on broader math/logic tasks compared to the baseline.

Conclusion: Reflective reasoning in MLLMs can be effectively learned and generalized through targeted data generation and hybrid training strategies, enabling more capable multimodal models.

Abstract: While current Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated
proficiency in reasoning tasks such as mathematics and logic, their capacity
for long-chain reflective reasoning, a prerequisite for solving complex
real-world problems, remains largely underexplored. In this work, we first
conduct an extensive empirical investigation to evaluate this capability.
Leveraging a carefully designed data synthesis engine, we construct MM-HELIX, a
multimodal benchmark consisting 1,260 samples of 42 challenging synthetic tasks
that require iterative thinking and backtracking. Empirical results on this
benchmark reveal that existing MLLMs exhibit significant performance deficits
in long-chain reflective reasoning. To address this limitation, we generate
post-training data and further explore learning paradigms for exploiting such
data. We first develop the Step-Elicited Response Generation pipeline to create
MM-HELIX-100K, a large-scale dataset of 100k high-quality, reflective reasoning
traces for instruction-tuning stage. Given that standard Reinforcement Learning
fails on complex tasks due to sparse reward signals and catastrophic forgetting
after Supervised Fine-Tuning, we propose Adaptive Hybrid Policy Optimization
(AHPO), a novel training strategy that dynamically unifies offline supervision
and online optimization into a single stage. This strategy enables the model to
learn from expert data when rewards are sparse and conduct independent
exploration once proficient. When applied to the Qwen2.5-VL-7B baseline, our
method achieves a +18.6\% accuracy improvement on MM-HELIX benchmark and
demonstrates strong generalization with a +5.7\% average performance gain on
general mathematic and logic tasks. Our work demonstrate that reflective
reasoning in MLLMs can be effectively learned and generalized, paving the way
for developing more capable MLLMs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VideoNorms introduces a benchmark with 1000+ video clip–norm pairs across US and Chinese cultures to evaluate VideoLLMs' cultural grounding, using a human–AI annotation workflow.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for culturally aware grounding in VideoLLMs and the lack of benchmarks that capture socio-cultural norms and cross-cultural differences.

Method: Construct VideoNorms with norms grounded in speech-act theory, including adherence/violation labels and verbal/non-verbal evidence. Use a teacher model with theoretically grounded prompting to generate candidate annotations, then have trained human experts validate and correct them. Evaluate open-weight VideoLLMs on the dataset to assess cross-cultural performance.

Result: Models show: (1) worse performance on norm violations than adherence; (2) poorer performance for Chinese culture than US culture; (3) greater difficulty in providing non-verbal evidence than verbal evidence for adherence/violation, and struggle to map to exact norms; (4) non-humorous formal contexts worsen model performance relative to humans.

Conclusion: Cultural grounding is essential for VideoLLMs; the VideoNorms benchmark and the described collaboration framework help identify gaps and guide targeted improvements in culturally aware training.

Abstract: As Video Large Language Models (VideoLLMs) are deployed globally, they
require understanding of and grounding in the relevant cultural background. To
properly assess these models' cultural awareness, adequate benchmarks are
needed. We introduce VideoNorms, a benchmark of over 1000 (video clip, norm)
pairs from US and Chinese cultures annotated with socio-cultural norms grounded
in speech act theory, norm adherence and violations labels, and verbal and
non-verbal evidence. To build VideoNorms, we use a human-AI collaboration
framework, where a teacher model using theoretically-grounded prompting
provides candidate annotations and a set of trained human experts validate and
correct the annotations. We benchmark a variety of open-weight VideoLLMs on the
new dataset which highlight several common trends: 1) models performs worse on
norm violation than adherence; 2) models perform worse w.r.t Chinese culture
compared to the US culture; 3) models have more difficulty in providing
non-verbal evidence compared to verbal for the norm adhere/violation label and
struggle to identify the exact norm corresponding to a speech-act; and 4)
unlike humans, models perform worse in formal, non-humorous contexts. Our
findings emphasize the need for culturally-grounded video language model
training - a gap our benchmark and framework begin to address.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ARTDECO delivers on-the-fly monocular 3D reconstruction by fusing fast feed-forward 3D foundation-models with SLAM-style reliability through a hierarchical Gaussian representation and LoD-aware rendering, yielding SLAM-like speed, robustness, and near-optimized fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: On-the-fly monocular 3D reconstruction faces a fidelity-speed trade-off: per-scene optimization yields high fidelity but is slow, while feed-forward models are fast but less accurate/robust. The work aims to bridge this gap for real-time, robust 3D digitization.

Method: Leverage 3D foundation models for pose estimation and point prediction, followed by a Gaussian decoder that converts multi-scale features into structured 3D Gaussians. Introduce a hierarchical Gaussian representation with Level-of-Detail (LoD)-aware rendering to balance fidelity and efficiency.

Result: Experiments on eight diverse indoor and outdoor benchmarks show interactive performance comparable to SLAM, robustness similar to feed-forward systems, and reconstruction quality close to per-scene optimization.

Conclusion: ARTDECO provides a practical path toward on-the-fly digitization of real-world environments with accurate geometry and high visual fidelity, combining efficiency with reliability for real-time 3D reconstruction.

Abstract: On-the-fly 3D reconstruction from monocular image sequences is a
long-standing challenge in computer vision, critical for applications such as
real-to-sim, AR/VR, and robotics. Existing methods face a major tradeoff:
per-scene optimization yields high fidelity but is computationally expensive,
whereas feed-forward foundation models enable real-time inference but struggle
with accuracy and robustness. In this work, we propose ARTDECO, a unified
framework that combines the efficiency of feed-forward models with the
reliability of SLAM-based pipelines. ARTDECO uses 3D foundation models for pose
estimation and point prediction, coupled with a Gaussian decoder that
transforms multi-scale features into structured 3D Gaussians. To sustain both
fidelity and efficiency at scale, we design a hierarchical Gaussian
representation with a LoD-aware rendering strategy, which improves rendering
fidelity while reducing redundancy. Experiments on eight diverse indoor and
outdoor benchmarks show that ARTDECO delivers interactive performance
comparable to SLAM, robustness similar to feed-forward systems, and
reconstruction quality close to per-scene optimization, providing a practical
path toward on-the-fly digitization of real-world environments with both
accurate geometry and high visual fidelity. Explore more demos on our project

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduces VideoCanvas for arbitrary spatio-temporal video completion, decoupling spatial and temporal conditioning to overcome temporal ambiguity in causal VAEs, using zero-padding for spatial control and Temporal RoPE Interpolation for continuous temporal conditioning; introduces VideoCanvasBench benchmark; reports state-of-the-art results in flexible, unified video generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Unify controllable video generation tasks (inpainting, extension, interpolation, first-frame editing, etc.) under a single framework and enable fine-grained, pixel-accurate control over both where and when to edit in a video, while addressing the temporal ambiguity inherent in latent video diffusion models.

Method: Hybrid conditioning that decouples space and time: (1) spatial placement via zero-padding; (2) temporal alignment via Temporal RoPE Interpolation that assigns a continuous fractional position within the latent sequence. Builds on In-Context Conditioning with a frozen backbone and a zero-parameter approach. Introduces VideoCanvasBench as a dedicated benchmark for arbitrary spatio-temporal video completion.

Result: VideoCanvas outperforms existing conditioning paradigms on the new benchmark, achieving higher intra-scene fidelity and inter-scene creativity and establishing a new state-of-the-art in flexible and unified video generation.

Conclusion: VideoCanvas provides a practical, zero-parameter approach to fine-grained spatio-temporal video editing, resolving VAE temporal ambiguity and enabling pixel-frame-aware control on a frozen backbone, with a dedicated benchmark confirming its advantages.

Abstract: We introduce the task of arbitrary spatio-temporal video completion, where a
video is generated from arbitrary, user-specified patches placed at any spatial
location and timestamp, akin to painting on a video canvas. This flexible
formulation naturally unifies many existing controllable video generation
tasks--including first-frame image-to-video, inpainting, extension, and
interpolation--under a single, cohesive paradigm. Realizing this vision,
however, faces a fundamental obstacle in modern latent video diffusion models:
the temporal ambiguity introduced by causal VAEs, where multiple pixel frames
are compressed into a single latent representation, making precise frame-level
conditioning structurally difficult. We address this challenge with
VideoCanvas, a novel framework that adapts the In-Context Conditioning (ICC)
paradigm to this fine-grained control task with zero new parameters. We propose
a hybrid conditioning strategy that decouples spatial and temporal control:
spatial placement is handled via zero-padding, while temporal alignment is
achieved through Temporal RoPE Interpolation, which assigns each condition a
continuous fractional position within the latent sequence. This resolves the
VAE's temporal ambiguity and enables pixel-frame-aware control on a frozen
backbone. To evaluate this new capability, we develop VideoCanvasBench, the
first benchmark for arbitrary spatio-temporal video completion, covering both
intra-scene fidelity and inter-scene creativity. Experiments demonstrate that
VideoCanvas significantly outperforms existing conditioning paradigms,
establishing a new state of the art in flexible and unified video generation.

Conclusion: SciVideoBench provides a targeted benchmark to push the development of advanced multimodal video reasoning in scientific contexts. It helps identify key bottlenecks and offers directions for enhancing domain-specific reasoning, perception, and grounding in LMMs, contributing to progress toward AI co-scientists.

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have achieved remarkable progress across
various capabilities; however, complex video reasoning in the scientific domain
remains a significant and challenging frontier. Current video benchmarks
predominantly target general scenarios where perception/recognition is heavily
relied on, while with relatively simple reasoning tasks, leading to saturation
and thus failing to effectively evaluate advanced multimodal cognitive skills.
To address this critical gap, we introduce SciVideoBench, a rigorous benchmark
specifically designed to assess advanced video reasoning in scientific
contexts. SciVideoBench consists of 1,000 carefully crafted multiple-choice
questions derived from cutting-edge scientific experimental videos spanning
over 25 specialized academic subjects and verified by a semi-automatic system.
Each question demands sophisticated domain-specific knowledge, precise
spatiotemporal perception, and intricate logical reasoning, effectively
challenging models' higher-order cognitive abilities. Our evaluation highlights
significant performance deficits in state-of-the-art proprietary and
open-source LMMs, including Gemini 2.5 Pro and Qwen2.5-VL, indicating
substantial room for advancement in video reasoning capabilities. Detailed
analyses of critical factors such as reasoning complexity and visual grounding
provide valuable insights and clear direction for future developments in LMMs,
driving the evolution of truly capable multimodal AI co-scientists. We hope
SciVideoBench could fit the interests of the community and help to push the
boundary of cutting-edge AI for border science.

*Maham Tanveer,Yang Zhou,Simon Niklaus,Ali Mahdavi Amiri,Hao Zhang,Krishna Kumar Singh,Nanxuan Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A multi-modal video inbetweening framework using DiT with two branches for content and motion, mapping controls to a sparse point-based representation, enabling controllable and precise intermediate frames.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video inbetweening methods struggle with large or complex motions and lack fine-grained, user-intended control over intermediate frames.

Method: Uses Diffusion Transformer as the generative backbone; introduces a two-branch architecture (motion and content) fed by a common sparse point-based representation of multi-modal controls (depth transitions, layering, motion trajectories, text prompts, and target regions); includes a stage-wise training strategy to align controls with denoising dynamics.

Result: Qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that the multi-modal controls yield more dynamic, customizable, and contextually accurate interpolations, improving flexibility without sacrificing precision.

Conclusion: The framework achieves a balance between flexibility and precision for fine-grained video interpolation and supports diverse user intents through modular control mechanisms.

Abstract: Video inbetweening creates smooth and natural transitions between two image
frames, making it an indispensable tool for video editing and long-form video
synthesis. Existing works in this domain are unable to generate large, complex,
or intricate motions. In particular, they cannot accommodate the versatility of
user intents and generally lack fine control over the details of intermediate
frames, leading to misalignment with the creative mind. To fill these gaps, we
introduce \modelname{}, a video inbetweening framework that allows multi-modal
controls, including depth transition and layering, motion trajectories, text
prompts, and target regions for movement localization, while achieving a
balance between flexibility, ease of use, and precision for fine-grained video
interpolation. To achieve this, we adopt the Diffusion Transformer (DiT)
architecture as our video generative model, due to its proven capability to
generate high-quality long videos. To ensure compatibility between DiT and our
multi-modal controls, we map all motion controls into a common sparse and
user-friendly point-based representation as the video/noise input. Further, to
respect the variety of controls which operate at varying levels of granularity
and influence, we separate content controls and motion controls into two
branches to encode the required features before guiding the denoising process,
resulting in two generators, one for motion and the other for content. Finally,
we propose a stage-wise training strategy to ensure that our model learns the
multi-modal controls smoothly. Extensive qualitative and quantitative
experiments demonstrate that multi-modal controls enable a more dynamic,
customizable, and contextually accurate visual narrative.

*Changyao Tian,Hao Li,Gen Luo,Xizhou Zhu,Weijie Su,Hanming Deng,Jinguo Zhu,Jie Shao,Ziran Zhu,Yunpeng Liu,Lewei Lu,Wenhai Wang,Hongsheng Li,Jifeng Dai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes NaViL, a native end-to-end multimodal LLM trained under data constraints. Demonstrates that end-to-end design with an optimal meta-architecture and favorable scaling between vision encoders and LLMs yields competitive results across 14 benchmarks, highlighting insights for future native MLLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs rely on compositional training with pre-trained encoders and decoupled training; their scaling behavior under data limits is unclear. The paper investigates end-to-end native MLLMs to understand design space and scaling laws under practical data constraints.

Method: Systematic exploration of the design space for native end-to-end MLLMs to identify an optimal meta-architecture that balances performance and training cost; study the scaling relationship between visual encoders and LLMs; propose NaViL with a simple, cost-effective training recipe.

Result: Identifies a positive correlation between the capacity of visual encoders and LLMs in native MLLMs; NaViL achieves competitive performance on 14 multimodal benchmarks compared to existing MLLMs.

Conclusion: End-to-end native MLLMs can be effectively scaled by jointly tuning vision and language components; the proposed NaViL offers a practical recipe and provides insights for future native MLLMs and scalable multimodal modeling.

Abstract: Compositional training has been the de-facto paradigm in existing Multimodal
Large Language Models (MLLMs), where pre-trained vision encoders are connected
with pre-trained LLMs through continuous multimodal pre-training. However, the
multimodal scaling property of this paradigm remains difficult to explore due
to the separated training. In this paper, we focus on the native training of
MLLMs in an end-to-end manner and systematically study its design space and
scaling property under a practical setting, i.e., data constraint. Through
careful study of various choices in MLLM, we obtain the optimal
meta-architecture that best balances performance and training cost. After that,
we further explore the scaling properties of the native MLLM and indicate the
positively correlated scaling relationship between visual encoders and LLMs.
Based on these findings, we propose a native MLLM called NaViL, combined with a
simple and cost-effective recipe. Experimental results on 14 multimodal
benchmarks confirm the competitive performance of NaViL against existing MLLMs.
Besides that, our findings and results provide in-depth insights for the future
study of native MLLMs.

*Meixi Song,Xin Lin,Dizhe Zhang,Haodong Li,Xiangtai Li,Bo Du,Lu Qi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: D^2GS: a unified approach for sparse-view 3D Gaussian Splatting that uses depth-and-density dropout to curb overfitting and distance-aware supervision to enhance far-field fidelity, plus a stability metric; yields improved visual quality and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sparse-view 3DGS suffers from overfitting near the camera due to high Gaussian density and underfitting in distant regions due to insufficient coverage, leading to degraded stability and quality.

Method: Introduce Depth-and-Density Guided Dropout to adaptively mask redundant Gaussians based on local depth and density; introduce Distance-Aware Fidelity Enhancement to provide targeted supervision for far-field areas; propose a stability-oriented evaluation metric for Gaussian distributions; validate on multiple datasets with qualitative and quantitative improvements.

Result: Significant improvements in visual quality and robustness under sparse view, demonstrated across multiple datasets; the proposed metric provides insights into the stability of learned Gaussians; project page available.

Conclusion: D^2GS effectively alleviates both overfitting and underfitting in sparse-view 3D Gaussian Splatting and offers a practical framework with improved robustness and a new stability metric.

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) enable real-time,
high-fidelity novel view synthesis (NVS) with explicit 3D representations.
However, performance degradation and instability remain significant under
sparse-view conditions. In this work, we identify two key failure modes under
sparse-view conditions: overfitting in regions with excessive Gaussian density
near the camera, and underfitting in distant areas with insufficient Gaussian
coverage. To address these challenges, we propose a unified framework D$^2$GS,
comprising two key components: a Depth-and-Density Guided Dropout strategy that
suppresses overfitting by adaptively masking redundant Gaussians based on
density and depth, and a Distance-Aware Fidelity Enhancement module that
improves reconstruction quality in under-fitted far-field areas through
targeted supervision. Moreover, we introduce a new evaluation metric to
quantify the stability of learned Gaussian distributions, providing insights
into the robustness of the sparse-view 3DGS. Extensive experiments on multiple
datasets demonstrate that our method significantly improves both visual quality
and robustness under sparse view conditions. The project page can be found at:

*Tajamul Ashraf,Umair Nawaz,Abdelrahman M. Shaker,Rao Anwer,Philip Torr,Fahad Shahbaz Khan,Salman Khan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A vision-centric agent framework (MATRIX) is proposed to scale multimodal tool-use by automatically synthesizing trajectories and using step-wise preferences for fine-tuning a VLM controller. It builds M-TRACE (28.5k tasks, 177k trajectories) and Pref-X (11k preference pairs), yielding a MATRIX agent that outperforms open- and closed-source VLMs on Agent-X, GTA, and GAIA.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Scarcity of high-quality multimodal trajectories and high cost of manual annotation limit VLMs' reasoning and tool-use capabilities. Automated trajectory synthesis and preference-guided fine-tuning aim to scale robust multimodal decision-making.

Method: 1) Construct M-TRACE, a large-scale multimodal trajectory dataset (28.5k tasks, 177k verified trajectories) for imitation-based trajectory tuning. 2) Train MATRIX Agent, a VLM controller finetuned on M-TRACE for stepwise tool reasoning. 3) Generate Pref-X, 11k automatically created preference pairs for finer alignment. 4) Optimize MATRIX with stepwise preference learning on Pref-X. 

Result: MATRIX consistently surpasses both open- and closed-source VLMs on three benchmarks (Agent-X, GTA, GAIA), demonstrating scalable and effective multimodal tool use.

Conclusion: The proposed data synthesis and preference-guided fine-tuning pipeline yields strong tool-use performance and demonstrates scalable multimodal reasoning, with open data/code available for reproducibility.

Abstract: Vision language models (VLMs) are increasingly deployed as controllers with
access to external tools for complex reasoning and decision-making, yet their
effectiveness remains limited by the scarcity of high-quality multimodal
trajectories and the cost of manual annotation. We address this challenge with
a vision-centric agent tuning framework that automatically synthesizes
multimodal trajectories, generates step-wise preference pairs, and trains a VLM
controller for robust tool-use reasoning. Our pipeline first constructs
M-TRACE, a large-scale dataset of 28.5K multimodal tasks with 177K verified
trajectories, enabling imitation-based trajectory tuning. Building on this, we
develop MATRIX Agent, a controller finetuned on M-TRACE for step-wise tool
reasoning. To achieve finer alignment, we further introduce Pref-X, a set of
11K automatically generated preference pairs, and optimize MATRIX on it via
step-wise preference learning. Across three benchmarks, Agent-X, GTA, and GAIA,
MATRIX consistently surpasses both open- and closed-source VLMs, demonstrating
scalable and effective multimodal tool use. Our data and code is avaliable at

### [103] [ReSplat: Learning Recurrent Gaussian Splats](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08575)
*Haofei Xu,Daniel Barath,Andreas Geiger,Marc Pollefeys*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ReSplat introduces a recurrent, gradient-free refinement of 3D Gaussian splats that uses rendering error as feedback, initialized by a 16× subsampled reconstruction that produces 16× fewer Gaussians, achieving state-of-the-art results with faster rendering and fewer Gaussians.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the limitations of single-pass feed-forward Gaussian splatting (limited optimization, potential brittleness to unseen data) by enabling iterative refinement without explicit gradient computation, improving generalization and efficiency.

Method: A feed-forward recurrent Gaussian splatting model that updates Gaussian parameters iteratively using the rendering error as a feedback signal, rather than explicit gradient-based guidance. Initialization uses a compact reconstruction model operating on a 16× subsampled space, yielding 16× fewer Gaussians than per-pixel approaches.

Result: Extensive evaluations across varying numbers of input views (2, 8, 16), resolutions (256×256 to 540×960), and datasets (DL3DV and RealEstate10K) show state-of-the-art performance with substantially fewer Gaussians and faster rendering.

Conclusion: Rendering-error feedback enables robust, data-adaptive refinement of Gaussians, balancing accuracy and efficiency and improving generalization to unseen data distributions.

Abstract: While feed-forward Gaussian splatting models provide computational efficiency
and effectively handle sparse input settings, their performance is
fundamentally limited by the reliance on a single forward pass during
inference. We propose ReSplat, a feed-forward recurrent Gaussian splatting
model that iteratively refines 3D Gaussians without explicitly computing
gradients. Our key insight is that the Gaussian splatting rendering error
serves as a rich feedback signal, guiding the recurrent network to learn
effective Gaussian updates. This feedback signal naturally adapts to unseen
data distributions at test time, enabling robust generalization. To initialize
the recurrent process, we introduce a compact reconstruction model that
operates in a $16 \times$ subsampled space, producing $16 \times$ fewer
Gaussians than previous per-pixel Gaussian models. This substantially reduces
computational overhead and allows for efficient Gaussian updates. Extensive
experiments across varying of input views (2, 8, 16), resolutions ($256 \times
256$ to $540 \times 960$), and datasets (DL3DV and RealEstate10K) demonstrate
that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance while significantly
reducing the number of Gaussians and improving the rendering speed. Our project

### [104] [FLEET: Formal Language-Grounded Scheduling for Heterogeneous Robot Teams](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07417)
*Corban Rivera,Grayson Byrd,Meghan Booker,Bethany Kemp,Allison Gaines,Emma Holmes,James Uplinger,Celso M de Melo,David Handelman*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: FLEET converts free-form natural-language instructions into optimized, makespan-minimizing schedules for heterogeneous robot teams by using an LLM to generate a task graph and a capability-aware robot-task fitness matrix, and a MILP backend to compute the schedule, with agentic closed-loop execution; achieves better success than baselines in multi-task benchmarks and hardware trials.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between language-guided autonomy and formal planning. Language-only planners suffer long-horizon coordination and hallucination; purely formal methods require closed-world models. A hybrid approach can leverage natural language input while producing provably optimized schedules.

Method: An LLM front-end outputs (i) a task graph with durations and precedence and (ii) a capability-aware robot–task fitness matrix. A formal back-end solves a makespan-minimization problem (MILP) while the robots execute free-form subtasks with agentic closed-loop control. Evaluation spans multiple language-guided autonomy benchmarks with two-agent heterogenous tasks; ablations isolate the roles of MILP vs LLM-derived fitness. Hardware trials with two quadruped robots demonstrate real-world applicability.

Result: FLEET achieves higher success than state-of-the-art generative planners on two-agent, heterogeneous-task benchmarks. Ablations indicate MILP mainly improves temporal structure, while LLM-derived fitness is decisive for capability-coupled tasks; the combination yields the highest overall performance. Real-world hardware experiments with disjoint robot capabilities corroborate the approach.

Conclusion: A hybrid, language-to-optimization framework can effectively coordinate heterogeneous robot teams guided by natural language. MILP handles scheduling structure while LLMs provide capability-aware evaluation, yielding robust performance across simulation benchmarks and physical experiments.

Abstract: Coordinating heterogeneous robot teams from free-form natural-language
instructions is hard. Language-only planners struggle with long-horizon
coordination and hallucination, while purely formal methods require
closed-world models. We present FLEET, a hybrid decentralized framework that
turns language into optimized multi-robot schedules. An LLM front-end produces
(i) a task graph with durations and precedence and (ii) a capability-aware
robot--task fitness matrix; a formal back-end solves a makespan-minimization
problem while the underlying robots execute their free-form subtasks with
agentic closed-loop control. Across multiple free-form language-guided autonomy
coordination benchmarks, FLEET improves success over state of the art
generative planners on two-agent teams across heterogeneous tasks. Ablations
show that mixed integer linear programming (MILP) primarily improves temporal
structure, while LLM-derived fitness is decisive for capability-coupled tasks;
together they deliver the highest overall performance. We demonstrate the
translation to real world challenges with hardware trials using a pair of
quadruped robots with disjoint capabilities.

### [105] [VeMo: A Lightweight Data-Driven Approach to Model Vehicle Dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07447)
*Girolamo Oddo,Roberto Nuca,Matteo Parsani*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A lightweight GRU-based encoder-decoder model predicts a vehicle's future states from past onboard measurements and driver actions, achieving <2.6% mean relative error in extreme dynamics; robust to noise and yields physically consistent outputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vehicle dynamics models are hard to obtain for autonomous driving due to information scarcity; there is a need for data-driven, lightweight models that can be trained on existing vehicles and handle noisy data while maintaining plausible dynamics.

Method: A Gate Recurrent Unit (GRU) encoder-decoder architecture that correlates future states with past states and control actions, trained in a data-driven manner without imposing explicit physical constraints.

Result: The model achieves a maximum mean relative error below 2.6% under extreme dynamic conditions and shows robustness to noisy inputs across relevant frequency components; output signals (longitudinal/lateral accelerations, yaw rate, longitudinal velocity) remain physically plausible.

Conclusion: A data-driven, constraint-free GRU-based model can deliver physically consistent vehicle dynamics predictions in information-scarce scenarios, with strong accuracy in extreme dynamics and resilience to noise, making it suitable for autonomous driving applications.

Abstract: Developing a dynamic model for a high-performance vehicle is a complex
problem that requires extensive structural information about the system under
analysis. This information is often unavailable to those who did not design the
vehicle and represents a typical issue in autonomous driving applications,
which are frequently developed on top of existing vehicles; therefore, vehicle
models are developed under conditions of information scarcity. This paper
proposes a lightweight encoder-decoder model based on Gate Recurrent Unit
layers to correlate the vehicle's future state with its past states, measured
onboard, and control actions the driver performs. The results demonstrate that
the model achieves a maximum mean relative error below 2.6% in extreme dynamic
conditions. It also shows good robustness when subject to noisy input data
across the interested frequency components. Furthermore, being entirely
data-driven and free from physical constraints, the model exhibits physical
consistency in the output signals, such as longitudinal and lateral
accelerations, yaw rate, and the vehicle's longitudinal velocity.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: GPU-accelerated, sampling-based hybrid IK solver (HJCD-IK) that outperforms state-of-the-art in speed and accuracy, with broad, high-quality samples and low MMD; open-sourced.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Inverse Kinematics is fundamental; analytical solvers are restricted; numerical optimization is general but expensive and prone to local minima. GPUs enable sampling+optimization to improve accuracy and speed; need robust, fast IK.

Method: Introduce HJCD-IK: a GPU-accelerated, sampling-based hybrid solver. It uses an orientation-aware greedy coordinate descent initialization, followed by a Jacobian-based polishing routine. Produces a broad distribution of high-quality samples and optimizes to reduce MMD; evaluated against state-of-the-art on accuracy-speed trade-offs.

Result: Faster convergence and higher accuracy than state-of-the-art; consistently on the accuracy–latency Pareto frontier; often order-of-magnitude gains; broad high-quality sample distribution with the lowest maximum mean discrepancy.

Conclusion: Code is open-source, enabling the community to adopt and extend the approach; contributes to robust, fast IK solvers on GPUs.

Abstract: Inverse Kinematics (IK) is a core problem in robotics, in which joint
configurations are found to achieve a desired end-effector pose. Although
analytical solvers are fast and efficient, they are limited to systems with low
degrees-of-freedom and specific topological structures. Numerical
optimization-based approaches are more general, but suffer from high
computational costs and frequent convergence to spurious local minima. Recent
efforts have explored the use of GPUs to combine sampling and optimization to
enhance both the accuracy and speed of IK solvers. We build on this recent
literature and introduce HJCD-IK, a GPU-accelerated, sampling-based hybrid
solver that combines an orientation-aware greedy coordinate descent
initialization scheme with a Jacobian-based polishing routine. This design
enables our solver to improve both convergence speed and overall accuracy as
compared to the state-of-the-art, consistently finding solutions along the
accuracy-latency Pareto frontier and often achieving order-of-magnitude gains.
In addition, our method produces a broad distribution of high-quality samples,
yielding the lowest maximum mean discrepancy. We release our code open-source
for the benefit of the community.

### [107] [AVO: Amortized Value Optimization for Contact Mode Switching in Multi-Finger Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07548)
*Adam Hung,Fan Yang,Abhinav Kumar,Sergio Aguilera Marinovic,Soshi Iba,Rana Soltani Zarrin,Dmitry Berenson*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Amortized Value Optimization (AVO) uses a learned value function to predict future task performance and guide trajectory optimization across contact-mode sub-tasks, enabling faster planning with better outcomes; validated on screwdriver grasping/turning, achieving similar or better results with ~50% less computation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dexterous manipulation tasks often rely on decomposing into contact-mode sub-tasks, but optimizing each independently ignores future sub-tasks and is computationally expensive. A mechanism to bridge sub-tasks and reduce online compute would improve performance and efficiency.

Method: Introduce a learned value function that estimates total future task cost/performance and embed its gradients into the trajectory optimizer's cost at each planning step. This amortizes future-task information into current optimization, guiding decisions toward states favorable for subsequent sub-tasks.

Result: The approach yields improved performance and enables substantial computation savings, demonstrated on a screwdriver grasping and turning task in simulation and real-world experiments, with ~50% less computational budget needed compared to standard trajectory optimization without the value function.

Conclusion: AVO effectively bridges independently optimized sub-tasks, accelerating trajectory optimization while maintaining or improving task performance in dexterous manipulation.

Abstract: Dexterous manipulation tasks often require switching between different
contact modes, such as rolling, sliding, sticking, or non-contact contact
modes. When formulating dexterous manipulation tasks as a trajectory
optimization problem, a common approach is to decompose these tasks into
sub-tasks for each contact mode, which are each solved independently.
Optimizing each sub-task independently can limit performance, as optimizing
contact points, contact forces, or other variables without information about
future sub-tasks can place the system in a state from which it is challenging
to make progress on subsequent sub-tasks. Further, optimizing these sub-tasks
is very computationally expensive. To address these challenges, we propose
Amortized Value Optimization (AVO), which introduces a learned value function
that predicts the total future task performance. By incorporating this value
function into the cost of the trajectory optimization at each planning step,
the value function gradients guide the optimizer toward states that minimize
the cost in future sub-tasks. This effectively bridges separately optimized
sub-tasks, and accelerates the optimization by reducing the amount of online
computation needed. We validate AVO on a screwdriver grasping and turning task
in both simulation and real world experiments, and show improved performance
even with 50% less computational budget compared to trajectory optimization
without the value function.

### [108] [Inspection Planning Primitives with Implicit Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07611)
*Jingyang You,Hanna Kurniawati,Lashika Medagoda*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: IPIM enables planning entirely on neural SDFs for inspection tasks, achieving comparable trajectory quality to state-of-the-art planners while using up to 70x less memory on large, complex infrastructures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Aging and increasingly complex infrastructures demand efficient, scalable inspection planning. Traditional sampling-based planners are fast but memory-heavy, especially for large structures. Implicit models like neural SDFs offer compact representations, but planners rely on explicit models and incur frequent implicit-explicit conversions.

Method: Introduce Inspection Planning Primitives with Implicit Models (IPIM), a set of primitive computations that allow sampling-based inspection planners to operate directly on neural SDF representations without converting to explicit models.

Result: Evaluation on three scenarios, including a real-world structure with over 92 million triangular mesh faces, shows that a rudimentary IPIM-enabled planner achieves inspection trajectory quality similar to state-of-the-art planners while using up to 70 times less memory than the current state-of-the-art.

Conclusion: IPIM demonstrates that fully implicit-model-based inspection planning is both feasible and memory-efficient for large and complex structures, enabling scalable, high-quality trajectories without the overhead of explicit-model representations.

Abstract: The aging and increasing complexity of infrastructures make efficient
inspection planning more critical in ensuring safety. Thanks to sampling-based
motion planning, many inspection planners are fast. However, they often require
huge memory. This is particularly true when the structure under inspection is
large and complex, consisting of many struts and pillars of various geometry
and sizes. Such structures can be represented efficiently using implicit
models, such as neural Signed Distance Functions (SDFs). However, most
primitive computations used in sampling-based inspection planner have been
designed to work efficiently with explicit environment models, which in turn
requires the planner to use explicit environment models or performs frequent
transformations between implicit and explicit environment models during
planning. This paper proposes a set of primitive computations, called
Inspection Planning Primitives with Implicit Models (IPIM), that enable
sampling-based inspection planners to entirely use neural SDFs representation
during planning. Evaluation on three scenarios, including inspection of a
complex real-world structure with over 92M triangular mesh faces, indicates
that even a rudimentary sampling-based planner with IPIM can generate
inspection trajectories of similar quality to those generated by the
state-of-the-art planner, while using up to 70x less memory than the
state-of-the-art inspection planner.

### [109] [GATO: GPU-Accelerated and Batched Trajectory Optimization for Scalable Edge Model Predictive Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07625)
*Alexander Du,Emre Adabag,Gabriel Bravo,Brian Plancher*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: GATO is a GPU-accelerated batched nonlinear trajectory optimization (TO) solver for MPC that enables real-time throughput for moderate batch sizes (tens to low hundreds) by co-designing algorithms, software, and hardware. It achieves large speedups over CPU and GPU baselines and is open-source.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-time MPC requires solving many nonlinear TO problems in batches. Existing GPU approaches either optimize for a single large solve, scale to very large batches at slower-than-real-time rates, or limit model generality. This leaves a gap for moderate batch sizes where real-time throughput is critical.

Method: GATO employs GPU acceleration with a combination of block-, warp-, and thread-level parallelism both within and across solves, enabling ultra-high performance. It is co-designed across the algorithm, software implementation, and hardware considerations to optimize throughput for moderate batch sizes.

Result: Simulated benchmarks show speedups of 18–21x over CPU baselines and 1.4–16x over GPU baselines as batch size grows. Case studies indicate improved disturbance rejection and convergence behavior. Hardware validation on an industrial manipulator corroborates practical viability.

Conclusion: GATO is open source and demonstrated to fill the real-time throughput gap for moderate batch-size MPC applications, offering reproducible, high-performance batched TO on GPUs.

Abstract: While Model Predictive Control (MPC) delivers strong performance across
robotics applications, solving the underlying (batches of) nonlinear trajectory
optimization (TO) problems online remains computationally demanding. Existing
GPU-accelerated approaches typically (i) parallelize a single solve to meet
real-time deadlines, (ii) scale to very large batches at slower-than-real-time
rates, or (iii) achieve speed by restricting model generality (e.g., point-mass
dynamics or a single linearization). This leaves a large gap in solver
performance for many state-of-the-art MPC applications that require real-time
batches of tens to low-hundreds of solves. As such, we present GATO, an open
source, GPU-accelerated, batched TO solver co-designed across algorithm,
software, and computational hardware to deliver real-time throughput for these
moderate batch size regimes. Our approach leverages a combination of block-,
warp-, and thread-level parallelism within and across solves for ultra-high
performance. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through a
combination of: simulated benchmarks showing speedups of 18-21x over CPU
baselines and 1.4-16x over GPU baselines as batch size increases; case studies
highlighting improved disturbance rejection and convergence behavior; and
finally a validation on hardware using an industrial manipulator. We open
source GATO to support reproducibility and adoption.

### [110] [Differentiable Particle Optimization for Fast Sequential Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07674)
*Lucas Chen,Shrutheesh Raman Iyer,Zachary Kingston*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: GPU-accelerated end-to-end trajectory optimization (SPaSM) that jointly handles object placement and robot trajectory constraints using a fully GPU-parallel approach; achieves millisecond solutions and large speedups.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sequential manipulation requires collision-free, constraint-satisfying trajectories in high-dimensional spaces; CPU-bound methods are too slow for real-time, scalable planning; GPU acceleration with minimal data transfer can unlock real-time performance.

Method: Two-stage particle optimization: Stage 1 massively parallel sampling to satisfy placement constraints; Stage 2 lift to full joint-space trajectory optimization. All computations compiled into optimized CUDA kernels with no CPU coordination, enabling end-to-end optimization. Unlike hierarchical methods, SPaSM jointly optimizes placements and trajectories.

Result: Experiments on challenging benchmarks show solution times in the milliseconds range with 100% success rate and roughly 4000x speedup compared with existing approaches.

Conclusion: SPaSM demonstrates the viability of fully GPU-based, end-to-end trajectory optimization for sequential manipulation tasks, reducing data transfer and synchronization overhead and enabling real-time planning in complex scenes; potential extensions could handle more constraints or multi-robot scenarios.

Abstract: Sequential robot manipulation tasks require finding collision-free
trajectories that satisfy geometric constraints across multiple object
interactions in potentially high-dimensional configuration spaces. Solving
these problems in real-time and at large scales has remained out of reach due
to computational requirements. Recently, GPU-based acceleration has shown
promising results, but prior methods achieve limited performance due to CPU-GPU
data transfer overhead and complex logic that prevents full hardware
utilization. To this end, we present SPaSM (Sampling Particle optimization for
Sequential Manipulation), a fully GPU-parallelized framework that compiles
constraint evaluation, sampling, and gradient-based optimization into optimized
CUDA kernels for end-to-end trajectory optimization without CPU coordination.
The method consists of a two-stage particle optimization strategy: first
solving placement constraints through massively parallel sampling, then lifting
solutions to full trajectory optimization in joint space. Unlike hierarchical
approaches, SPaSM jointly optimizes object placements and robot trajectories to
handle scenarios where motion feasibility constrains placement options.
Experimental evaluation on challenging benchmarks demonstrates solution times
in the realm of $\textbf{milliseconds}$ with a 100% success rate; a
$4000\times$ speedup compared to existing approaches.

*Raghav Mishra,Ian R. Manchester*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Emerging-Barrier Model-Based Diffusion (EB-MBD) mitigates constraint-induced degradation by gradually introducing barrier constraints, improving performance and reducing computation relative to projections.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Constraints in Model-Based Diffusion can cause severe performance degradation due to sampling inefficiency in Monte Carlo score estimation; there is a need for a scalable, efficient constraint-handling mechanism.

Method: Introduce progressively applied barrier functions (emerging barriers) inspired by interior point methods; schedule barrier parameters based on sampling liveliness per iteration to balance constraint satisfaction and exploration; avoid explicit projection.

Result: On 2D collision avoidance and 3D underwater manipulator tasks, EB-MBD yields lower-cost solutions than standard MBD and dramatically reduces computation time compared to projection-based methods.

Conclusion: Emerging barriers provide robust, efficient constraint handling for diffusion-based planners, enabling better solution quality with lower computational overhead.

Abstract: We propose enforcing constraints on Model-Based Diffusion by introducing
emerging barrier functions inspired by interior point methods. We show that
constraints on Model-Based Diffusion can lead to catastrophic performance
degradation, even on simple 2D systems due to sample inefficiency in the Monte
Carlo approximation of the score function. We introduce Emerging-Barrier
Model-Based Diffusion (EB-MBD) which uses progressively introduced barrier
constraints to avoid these problems, significantly improving solution quality,
without the need for computationally expensive operations such as projections.
We analyze the sampling liveliness of samples each iteration to inform barrier
parameter scheduling choice. We demonstrate results for 2D collision avoidance
and a 3D underwater manipulator system and show that our method achieves lower
cost solutions than Model-Based Diffusion, and requires orders of magnitude
less computation time than projection based methods.

### [112] [Probabilistically-Safe Bipedal Navigation over Uncertain Terrain via Conformal Prediction and Contraction Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07725)
*Kasidit Muenprasitivej,Ye Zhao,Glen Chou*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A probabilistically safe MPC framework for bipedal locomotion on uncertain terrain, integrating GP-based terrain estimation, CP-calibrated confidence intervals, contraction-based reachable tubes, and a LIPM flywheel torque controller to guarantee probabilistic safety and goal reachability; validated in MuJoCo.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable robust, safe traversal of rough terrain by bipedal robots under elevation uncertainty, addressing dynamic feasibility and centroidal robustness with probabilistic guarantees.

Method: 1) A high-level MPC navigation with a specified safety confidence. 2) Gaussian Process regression to model terrain elevations and Conformal Prediction to produce calibrated confidence intervals. 3) Contraction-based reachable tubes that account for terrain uncertainty to ensure convergence and tube invariance. 4) A contraction-based flywheel torque control law for the reduced-order LIPM to stabilize CoM angular momentum. 5) Prove forward invariance of the torque law via exponential stabilization to the planner trajectory. 6) Evaluation on the Digit bipedal robot in MuJoCo.

Result: Formal probabilistic safety and goal reachability guarantees; forward invariance and exponential stabilization of the actual CoM trajectory to the planned trajectory; simulations demonstrating effectiveness on a Digit biped in MuJoCo.

Conclusion: The framework combines uncertainty-quantified terrain modeling (GP + CP) with contraction-based planning and control for probabilistic safety in rough-terrain bipedal locomotion, validated in physics-based simulations; promising for robust real-world deployment pending real-time computation and hardware experiments.

Abstract: We address the challenge of enabling bipedal robots to traverse rough terrain
by developing probabilistically safe planning and control strategies that
ensure dynamic feasibility and centroidal robustness under terrain uncertainty.
Specifically, we propose a high-level Model Predictive Control (MPC) navigation
framework for a bipedal robot with a specified confidence level of safety that
(i) enables safe traversal toward a desired goal location across a terrain map
with uncertain elevations, and (ii) formally incorporates uncertainty bounds
into the centroidal dynamics of locomotion control. To model the rough terrain,
we employ Gaussian Process (GP) regression to estimate elevation maps and
leverage Conformal Prediction (CP) to construct calibrated confidence intervals
that capture the true terrain elevation. Building on this, we formulate
contraction-based reachable tubes that explicitly account for terrain
uncertainty, ensuring state convergence and tube invariance. In addition, we
introduce a contraction-based flywheel torque control law for the reduced-order
Linear Inverted Pendulum Model (LIPM), which stabilizes the angular momentum
about the center-of-mass (CoM). This formulation provides both probabilistic
safety and goal reachability guarantees. For a given confidence level, we
establish the forward invariance of the proposed torque control law by
demonstrating exponential stabilization of the actual CoM phase-space
trajectory and the desired trajectory prescribed by the high-level planner.
Finally, we evaluate the effectiveness of our planning framework through
physics-based simulations of the Digit bipedal robot in MuJoCo.

### [113] [Injecting Hallucinations in Autonomous Vehicles: A Component-Agnostic Safety Evaluation Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07749)
*Alexandre Moreira Nascimento,Gabriel Kenji Godoy Shimanuki,Lúcio Flavio Vismari,João Batista Camargo Jr,Jorge Rady de Almeida Jr,Paulo Sergio Cugnasca,Anna Carolina Muller Queiroz,Jeremy Noah Bailenson*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A component-agnostic hallucination-injection framework for AV perception failures, demonstrated via 18k+ simulations of unsignalized street crossings; shows certain hallucinations (latency, drift) markedly raise collision/near-miss risk; enables scalable AV safety validation and fault-tolerance research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome siloed fault-injection studies that target a single sensor or MP module by reframing perception failures as hallucinations, an observable-effect abstraction that enables cross-component analysis and integration into unified simulation environments for AV safety validation.

Method: Define six plausible perception hallucination types; implement a configurable, component-agnostic hallucination injector within an open-source simulator; run 18,350 simulations of AVs crossing an unsignalized transverse street with traffic to study safety impacts.

Result: The framework is statistically validated and shows quantifiable impacts of hallucination types on collisions and near misses; perceptual latency and drift notably increase collision risk; demonstrates scalability, interoperability, and potential to accelerate AV safety validations.

Conclusion: A scalable, statistically validated, component-agnostic framework for AV safety validation that can accommodate novel MP architectures; can reduce time-to-market and underpin future research on fault tolerance and resilient AV design.

Abstract: Perception failures in autonomous vehicles (AV) remain a major safety concern
because they are the basis for many accidents. To study how these failures
affect safety, researchers typically inject artificial faults into hardware or
software components and observe the outcomes. However, existing fault injection
studies often target a single sensor or machine perception (MP) module,
resulting in siloed frameworks that are difficult to generalize or integrate
into unified simulation environments. This work addresses that limitation by
reframing perception failures as hallucinations, false perceptions that distort
an AV situational awareness and may trigger unsafe control actions. Since
hallucinations describe only observable effects, this abstraction enables
analysis independent of specific sensors or algorithms, focusing instead on how
their faults manifest along the MP pipeline. Building on this concept, we
propose a configurable, component-agnostic hallucination injection framework
that induces six plausible hallucination types in an iterative open-source
simulator. More than 18,350 simulations were executed in which hallucinations
were injected while AVs crossed an unsignalized transverse street with traffic.
The results statistically validate the framework and quantify the impact of
each hallucination type on collisions and near misses. Certain hallucinations,
such as perceptual latency and drift, significantly increase the risk of
collision in the scenario tested, validating the proposed paradigm can stress
the AV system safety. The framework offers a scalable, statistically validated,
component agnostic, and fully interoperable toolset that simplifies and
accelerates AV safety validations, even those with novel MP architectures and
components. It can potentially reduce the time-to-market of AV and lay the
foundation for future research on fault tolerance, and resilient AV design.

*YuHang Tang,Yixuan Lou,Pengfei Han,Haoming Song,Xinyi Ye,Dong Wang,Bin Zhao*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: TrajSkill enables cross-embodiment robot manipulation by encoding human motion as sparse optical-flow trajectories and conditioning a video-to-action model on these cues plus visual/text inputs, achieving improved metrics in simulation and successful real-robot transfers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a large embodiment gap between humans and robots, and reliance on paired datasets or hand-crafted rewards limits scalability and generalization for learning manipulation skills from videos.

Method: Represent human motions as sparse optical-flow trajectories (embodiment-agnostic cues); condition on these trajectories together with visual and textual inputs; jointly synthesize temporally consistent robot manipulation videos and translate them into executable actions for cross-embodiment skill transfer.

Result: In MetaWorld simulation, TrajSkill reduces FVD by 39.6% and KVD by 36.6% versus state-of-the-art, with cross-embodiment success rate improved by up to 16.7%. Real-robot kitchen manipulation experiments validate practical human-to-robot skill transfer across embodiments.

Conclusion: TrajSkill demonstrates practical cross-embodiment skill transfer from human demonstration videos by leveraging embodiment-agnostic motion cues and joint video synthesis with action translation, achieving notable simulation gains and real-world applicability.

Abstract: Learning manipulation skills from human demonstration videos presents a
promising yet challenging problem, primarily due to the significant embodiment
gap between human body and robot manipulators. Existing methods rely on paired
datasets or hand-crafted rewards, which limit scalability and generalization.
We propose TrajSkill, a framework for Trajectory Conditioned Cross-embodiment
Skill Transfer, enabling robots to acquire manipulation skills directly from
human demonstration videos. Our key insight is to represent human motions as
sparse optical flow trajectories, which serve as embodiment-agnostic motion
cues by removing morphological variations while preserving essential dynamics.
Conditioned on these trajectories together with visual and textual inputs,
TrajSkill jointly synthesizes temporally consistent robot manipulation videos
and translates them into executable actions, thereby achieving cross-embodiment
skill transfer. Extensive experiments are conducted, and the results on
simulation data (MetaWorld) show that TrajSkill reduces FVD by 39.6\% and KVD
by 36.6\% compared with the state-of-the-art, and improves cross-embodiment
success rate by up to 16.7\%. Real-robot experiments in kitchen manipulation
tasks further validate the effectiveness of our approach, demonstrating
practical human-to-robot skill transfer across embodiments.

*Yandu Chen,Kefan Gu,Yuqing Wen,Yucheng Zhao,Tiancai Wang,Liqiang Nie*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: IntentionVLA introduces curriculum-based reasoning data and efficient inference to enable intention-driven vision-language-action control, achieving strong improvements and generalization in HRI tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLAs pretrained on generic multimodal tasks poorly support embodied reasoning and implicit human-intention understanding; there is a need for reasoning-guided manipulation and fast inference under indirect instructions.

Method: Train with a reasoning-data curriculum combining intention inference, spatial grounding, and compact embodied reasoning; finetune using compact reasoning outputs as contextual guidance for action generation.

Result: Substantial gains: +18% success with direct instructions vs pi_0; +28% vs ECoT under intention instructions; strong OOD gains (over 2x baselines); 40% success in zero-shot HRI.

Conclusion: IntentionVLA is a promising direction for next-generation embodied intelligence and HRI, leveraging reasoning-grounded pretraining and efficient inference to improve performance and generalization.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models leverage pretrained vision-language
models (VLMs) to couple perception with robotic control, offering a promising
path toward general-purpose embodied intelligence. However, current SOTA VLAs
are primarily pretrained on multimodal tasks with limited relevance to embodied
scenarios, and then finetuned to map explicit instructions to actions.
Consequently, due to the lack of reasoning-intensive pretraining and
reasoning-guided manipulation, these models are unable to perform implicit
human intention reasoning required for complex, real-world interactions. To
overcome these limitations, we propose \textbf{IntentionVLA}, a VLA framework
with a curriculum training paradigm and an efficient inference mechanism. Our
proposed method first leverages carefully designed reasoning data that combine
intention inference, spatial grounding, and compact embodied reasoning,
endowing the model with both reasoning and perception capabilities. In the
following finetuning stage, IntentionVLA employs the compact reasoning outputs
as contextual guidance for action generation, enabling fast inference under
indirect instructions. Experimental results show that IntentionVLA
substantially outperforms $\pi_0$, achieving 18\% higher success rates with
direct instructions and 28\% higher than ECoT under intention instructions. On
out-of-distribution intention tasks, IntentionVLA achieves over twice the
success rate of all baselines, and further enables zero-shot human-robot
interaction with 40\% success rate. These results highlight IntentionVLA as a
promising paradigm for next-generation human-robot interaction (HRI) systems.

*Grace Cai,Nithin Parepally,Laura Zheng,Ming C. Lin*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: GM3 is a generalized tire-level micro-mobility model using a tire-brush representation that supports arbitrary wheel layouts, with a model-agnostic simulator for comparison against KBM and other models; validated on Stanford Drone Dataset deathCircle for bikers, skaters, and carts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MMV models rely on variants of the Kinematic Bicycle Model or mode-specific physics and fail to capture tire slip, load transfer, and rider/vehicle lean across diverse wheel configurations; there is no unified physics-based model that spans common MMVs.

Method: Introduce GM3, a tire-brush-based formulation that supports single/double track and multi-wheel platforms; develop a model-agnostic simulation framework with fixed-step RK4 integration, human-in-the-loop and scripted control, real-time trajectory traces and logging to enable cross-model comparisons with KBM and others.

Result: GM3 offers a unified physics-based MMV model and an accompanying framework for cross-configuration comparisons; empirical validation on the Stanford Drone Dataset deathCircle scene demonstrates applicability to biker, skater, and cart classes.

Conclusion: GM3 enables physics-consistent MMV modeling across wheel layouts, decouples dynamics from vehicle/layout specification, and facilitates fair comparisons with KBM, advancing training and evaluation for autonomous systems and urban traffic simulations.

Abstract: Modeling the dynamics of micro-mobility vehicles (MMV) is becoming
increasingly important for training autonomous vehicle systems and building
urban traffic simulations. However, mainstream tools rely on variants of the
Kinematic Bicycle Model (KBM) or mode-specific physics that miss tire slip,
load transfer, and rider/vehicle lean. To our knowledge, no unified,
physics-based model captures these dynamics across the full range of common
MMVs and wheel layouts. We propose the "Generalized Micro-mobility Model"
(GM3), a tire-level formulation based on the tire brush representation that
supports arbitrary wheel configurations, including single/double track and
multi-wheel platforms. We introduce an interactive model-agnostic simulation
framework that decouples vehicle/layout specification from dynamics to compare
the GM3 with the KBM and other models, consisting of fixed step RK4
integration, human-in-the-loop and scripted control, real-time trajectory
traces and logging for analysis. We also empirically validate the GM3 on the
Stanford Drone Dataset's deathCircle (roundabout) scene for biker, skater, and
cart classes.

*Guowei Zou,Haitao Wang,Hejun Wu,Yukun Qian,Yuhang Wang,Weibing Li*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: DM1 introduces dispersive regularization to MeanFlow-based flow policies to prevent representation collapse in multi-modal robotic manipulation, preserving one-step sampling; achieves large speedups and higher success on RoboMimic and real-robot tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Flow-based policies enable fast, one-step action generation but suffer from representation collapse and indistinguishable visual embeddings, which harms precise manipulation.

Method: Incorporates dispersive regularization variants across multiple intermediate embedding layers within a flow-matching framework (MeanFlow) to encourage diverse representations across training batches without extra modules or special training procedures.

Result: On RoboMimic benchmarks, DM1 achieves 0.07s inference (20-40x faster than 2-3.5s baselines) and improves success by 10-20 percentage points; Lift task success 99% vs 85% baseline. Real-robot deployment on a Franka Panda shows effective sim-to-real transfer.

Conclusion: Leverages representation regularization to enable robust, efficient, one-step flow-based manipulation, presenting a simple yet powerful approach for improved manipulation performance.

Abstract: The ability to learn multi-modal action distributions is indispensable for
robotic manipulation policies to perform precise and robust control. Flow-based
generative models have recently emerged as a promising solution to learning
distributions of actions, offering one-step action generation and thus
achieving much higher sampling efficiency compared to diffusion-based methods.
However, existing flow-based policies suffer from representation collapse, the
inability to distinguish similar visual representations, leading to failures in
precise manipulation tasks. We propose DM1 (MeanFlow with Dispersive
Regularization for One-Step Robotic Manipulation), a novel flow matching
framework that integrates dispersive regularization into MeanFlow to prevent
collapse while maintaining one-step efficiency. DM1 employs multiple dispersive
regularization variants across different intermediate embedding layers,
encouraging diverse representations across training batches without introducing
additional network modules or specialized training procedures. Experiments on
RoboMimic benchmarks show that DM1 achieves 20-40 times faster inference (0.07s
vs. 2-3.5s) and improves success rates by 10-20 percentage points, with the
Lift task reaching 99% success over 85% of the baseline. Real-robot deployment
on a Franka Panda further validates that DM1 transfers effectively from
simulation to the physical world. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first work to leverage representation regularization to enable flow-based
policies to achieve strong performance in robotic manipulation, establishing a
simple yet powerful approach for efficient and robust manipulation.

TL;DR: A large-scale underwater Vision-Language-Action dataset (USIM) and a general multimodal VLA model (U0) with a perception enhancement module (CAP), achieving strong multi-task performance in underwater robotics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Underwater robotics suffer from scarce large-scale datasets and limited autonomous multi-task capabilities; a simulation-based, multimodal dataset and generalizable model are needed to advance underwater autonomy.

Method: USIM provides 561K frames, 1,852 trajectories, 15.6 hours of BlueROV2 interactions across 20 tasks in 9 scenarios; U0 integrates binocular vision and other sensors via multimodal fusion and uses a CAP module for spatial understanding and manipulation.

Result: Across tasks (inspection, obstacle avoidance, scanning, dynamic tracking) 80% success; mobile manipulation reduces distance to target by 21.2% vs baselines.

Conclusion: VLA models can be effectively applied to underwater robotics; USIM enables scalable dataset construction and practical general underwater robots, advancing autonomy in challenging underwater environments.

Abstract: Underwater environments present unique challenges for robotic operation,
including complex hydrodynamics, limited visibility, and constrained
communication. Although data-driven approaches have advanced embodied
intelligence in terrestrial robots and enabled task-specific autonomous
underwater robots, developing underwater intelligence capable of autonomously
performing multiple tasks remains highly challenging, as large-scale,
high-quality underwater datasets are still scarce. To address these
limitations, we introduce USIM, a simulation-based multi-task
Vision-Language-Action (VLA) dataset for underwater robots. USIM comprises over
561K frames from 1,852 trajectories, totaling approximately 15.6 hours of
BlueROV2 interactions across 20 tasks in 9 diverse scenarios, ranging from
visual navigation to mobile manipulation. Building upon this dataset, we
propose U0, a VLA model for general underwater robots, which integrates
binocular vision and other sensor modalities through multimodal fusion, and
further incorporates a convolution-attention-based perception focus enhancement
module (CAP) to improve spatial understanding and mobile manipulation. Across
tasks such as inspection, obstacle avoidance, scanning, and dynamic tracking,
the framework achieves a success rate of 80%, while in challenging mobile
manipulation tasks, it reduces the distance to the target by 21.2% compared
with baseline methods, demonstrating its effectiveness. USIM and U0 show that
VLA models can be effectively applied to underwater robotic applications,
providing a foundation for scalable dataset construction, improved task
autonomy, and the practical realization of intelligent general underwater
robots.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The work addresses the challenge of autonomous navigation in dynamic, human-populated indoor environments using only onboard RGB-D sensors and odometry, requiring safe, efficient, and socially compliant behavior without global maps.

Method: They augment the Falcon model with a Proactive Risk Perception Module that learns to predict distance-based collision risk scores for surrounding humans, enabling proactive collision avoidance and improved spatial awareness based on RGB-D observations.

Result: Evaluation on the Social-HM3D benchmark shows improved personal-space compliance and robust goal-directed navigation in crowded indoor scenes, earning 2nd place among 16 teams.

Conclusion: Introducing a proactive risk perception component enhances social navigation performance under restricted sensing and mapless operation, offering more robust collision avoidance in dynamic human environments.

Abstract: In this report, we describe the technical details of our submission to the
IROS 2025 RoboSense Challenge Social Navigation Track. This track focuses on
developing RGBD-based perception and navigation systems that enable autonomous
agents to navigate safely, efficiently, and socially compliantly in dynamic
human-populated indoor environments. The challenge requires agents to operate
from an egocentric perspective using only onboard sensors including RGB-D
observations and odometry, without access to global maps or privileged
information, while maintaining social norm compliance such as safe distances
and collision avoidance. Building upon the Falcon model, we introduce a
Proactive Risk Perception Module to enhance social navigation performance. Our
approach augments Falcon with collision risk understanding that learns to
predict distance-based collision risk scores for surrounding humans, which
enables the agent to develop more robust spatial awareness and proactive
collision avoidance behaviors. The evaluation on the Social-HM3D benchmark
demonstrates that our method improves the agent's ability to maintain personal
space compliance while navigating toward goals in crowded indoor scenes with
dynamic human agents, achieving 2nd place among 16 participating teams in the
challenge.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: DualTHOR supplies a dual-arm humanoid simulation platform with continuous transition and contingency handling, while Proprio-MLLM injects proprioceptive signals into an MLLM via motion-based position embeddings and a cross-spatial encoder to boost long-horizon planning, achieving ~19.75% planning improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper targets two bottlenecks in embodied AI for humanoids: (1) the lack of simulation platforms to systematically evaluate and collect data for dual-arm humanoid tasks, and (2) limited embodiment awareness in current MLLMs that hampers planning about arm selection and body pose.

Method: (1) Build DualTHOR, a dual-arm humanoid simulator with continuous transition dynamics and a contingency mechanism to handle unexpected events. (2) Develop Proprio-MLLM by integrating proprioceptive information with motion-based position embeddings and a cross-spatial encoder to improve embodiment-aware reasoning in planning.

Result: Experiments indicate current MLLMs struggle in this environment, while Proprio-MLLM achieves an average planning performance improvement of 19.75%. The work provides both a simulation platform and an effective model; code is available at the provided link.

Conclusion: The work offers a valuable simulation tool and an embodiment-aware model that advance embodied intelligence in humanoid robotics, enabling more reliable long-horizon planning for dual-arm tasks.

Abstract: In recent years, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated
the ability to serve as high-level planners, enabling robots to follow complex
human instructions. However, their effectiveness, especially in long-horizon
tasks involving dual-arm humanoid robots, remains limited. This limitation
arises from two main challenges: (i) the absence of simulation platforms that
systematically support task evaluation and data collection for humanoid robots,
and (ii) the insufficient embodiment awareness of current MLLMs, which hinders
reasoning about dual-arm selection logic and body positions during planning. To
address these issues, we present DualTHOR, a new dual-arm humanoid simulator,
with continuous transition and a contingency mechanism. Building on this
platform, we propose Proprio-MLLM, a model that enhances embodiment awareness
by incorporating proprioceptive information with motion-based position
embedding and a cross-spatial encoder. Experiments show that, while existing
MLLMs struggle in this environment, Proprio-MLLM achieves an average
improvement of 19.75% in planning performance. Our work provides both an
essential simulation platform and an effective model to advance embodied
intelligence in humanoid robotics. The code is available at

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: GRACE grounds VLM-based reasoning into executable analytic concepts (EAC) to bridge semantic-to-physical gaps, enabling precise robot manipulation with zero-shot generalization to articulated objects in simulation and real world.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a persistent gap between high-level semantic understanding from vision-language models and the low-level physical control needed for manipulation in unstructured environments.

Method: Introduce executable analytic concepts (EAC) as blueprints encoding affordances, geometric constraints, and manipulation semantics. Use a structured policy scaffolding pipeline to map natural language and visuals into instantiated EACs, from which grasp poses, force directions, and feasible motion trajectories are derived for execution.

Result: GRACE achieves strong zero-shot generalization across articulated objects in both simulated and real-world settings without task-specific training.

Conclusion: GRACE provides a unified, interpretable interface bridging semantic reasoning and physical execution, enabling precise and generalizable manipulation through semantic-physical grounding.

Abstract: Enabling robots to perform precise and generalized manipulation in
unstructured environments remains a fundamental challenge in embodied AI. While
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
semantic reasoning and task planning, a significant gap persists between their
high-level understanding and the precise physical execution required for
real-world manipulation. To bridge this "semantic-to-physical" gap, we
introduce GRACE, a novel framework that grounds VLM-based reasoning through
executable analytic concepts (EAC)-mathematically defined blueprints that
encode object affordances, geometric constraints, and semantics of
manipulation. Our approach integrates a structured policy scaffolding pipeline
that turn natural language instructions and visual information into an
instantiated EAC, from which we derive grasp poses, force directions and plan
physically feasible motion trajectory for robot execution. GRACE thus provides
a unified and interpretable interface between high-level instruction
understanding and low-level robot control, effectively enabling precise and
generalizable manipulation through semantic-physical grounding. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that GRACE achieves strong zero-shot generalization
across a variety of articulated objects in both simulated and real-world
environments, without requiring task-specific training.

### [122] [Orientation Learning and Adaptation towards Simultaneous Incorporation of Multiple Local Constraints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07986)
*Gaofeng Li,Peisen Xu,Ruize Wang,Qi Ye,Jiming Chen,Dezhen Song,Yanlong Huang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Introduces an angle-axis-based representation in SO(3) with a weighted-average fusion of multiple locally-constrained trajectories to learn orientation tasks on non-Euclidean space, improving constraint incorporation and allowing Euclidean learners to be reused.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SO(3) is a curved Riemannian manifold; non-Euclidean distortion makes it hard to incorporate multiple local constraints and to reuse ordinary Euclidean-learning methods. The work aims to enable multiple local constraints, smooth trajectory generation, and consideration of angular acceleration.

Method: Proposes an Angle-Axis Space-based orientation representation. Develops a weighted-average mechanism in SO(3) using angle-axis coordinates. Generates multiple trajectories by enforcing different local constraints at various basepoints and fuses them via a weighted average to produce a smooth trajectory, enabling simultaneous incorporation of multiple local constraints.

Result: Simulation and experimental results show the approach can adapt orientations toward arbitrary via-points, handle angular-acceleration constraints, and incorporate multiple local constraints, achieving benefits such as reduced acceleration costs.

Conclusion: The method addresses non-Euclidean distortion, enabling reuse of Euclidean learning algorithms in SO(3) space, and improves the handling of multiple local constraints and acceleration costs compared to existing solutions.

Abstract: Orientation learning plays a pivotal role in many tasks. However, the
rotation group SO(3) is a Riemannian manifold. As a result, the distortion
caused by non-Euclidean geometric nature introduces difficulties to the
incorporation of local constraints, especially for the simultaneous
incorporation of multiple local constraints. To address this issue, we propose
the Angle-Axis Space-based orientation representation method to solve several
orientation learning problems, including orientation adaptation and
minimization of angular acceleration. Specifically, we propose a weighted
average mechanism in SO(3) based on the angle-axis representation method. Our
main idea is to generate multiple trajectories by considering different local
constraints at different basepoints. Then these multiple trajectories are fused
to generate a smooth trajectory by our proposed weighted average mechanism,
achieving the goal to incorporate multiple local constraints simultaneously.
Compared with existing solution, ours can address the distortion issue and make
the off-theshelf Euclidean learning algorithm be re-applicable in non-Euclidean
space. Simulation and Experimental evaluations validate that our solution can
not only adapt orientations towards arbitrary desired via-points and cope with
angular acceleration constraints, but also incorporate multiple local
constraints simultaneously to achieve extra benefits, e.g., achieving smaller
acceleration costs.

Specifically, FastUMI-100K contains over 100K+ demonstration trajectories
collected across representative household environments, covering 54 tasks and
hundreds of object types. Our dataset integrates multimodal streams, including
end-effector states, multi-view wrist-mounted fisheye images and textual
annotations. Each trajectory has a length ranging from 120 to 500 frames.

### [124] [Towards Reliable LLM-based Robot Planning via Combined Uncertainty Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08044)
*Shiyuan Yin,Chenjia Bai,Zihao Zhang,Junwei Jin,Xinxin Zhang,Chi Zhang,Xuelong Li*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: CURE decomposes planning uncertainty into epistemic and intrinsic components, further splitting epistemic into task clarity and task familiarity. It uses random network distillation and MLP heads driven by LLM features to estimate uncertainty, validated in kitchen manipulation and tabletop rearrangement with improved alignment to actual outcomes versus prior methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM-based planning often yields overconfident, unsafe plans due to hallucinations. Distinguishing between epistemic and intrinsic uncertainty, and further subdividing epistemic uncertainty, can lead to more reliable and safer embodied planning.

Method: Estimate overall uncertainty via random network distillation (RND) and MLP regression heads fed by LLM-derived features. Decompose into intrinsic uncertainty and epistemic uncertainty, with the latter further split into task clarity and task familiarity. Validate in two embodied settings (kitchen manipulation and tabletop rearrangement).

Result: Uncertainty estimates produced by CURE are more closely aligned with actual execution outcomes than those from existing methods, indicating improved reliability of LLM-based planning.

Conclusion: Decomposing uncertainty and using targeted estimators yields more trustworthy embodied planning, mitigating hallucinations and unsafe plans in LLM-guided robots.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate advanced reasoning abilities,
enabling robots to understand natural language instructions and generate
high-level plans with appropriate grounding. However, LLM hallucinations
present a significant challenge, often leading to overconfident yet potentially
misaligned or unsafe plans. While researchers have explored uncertainty
estimation to improve the reliability of LLM-based planning, existing studies
have not sufficiently differentiated between epistemic and intrinsic
uncertainty, limiting the effectiveness of uncertainty estimation. In this
paper, we present Combined Uncertainty estimation for Reliable Embodied
planning (CURE), which decomposes the uncertainty into epistemic and intrinsic
uncertainty, each estimated separately. Furthermore, epistemic uncertainty is
subdivided into task clarity and task familiarity for more accurate evaluation.
The overall uncertainty assessments are obtained using random network
distillation and multi-layer perceptron regression heads driven by LLM
features. We validated our approach in two distinct experimental settings:
kitchen manipulation and tabletop rearrangement experiments. The results show
that, compared to existing methods, our approach yields uncertainty estimates
that are more closely aligned with the actual execution outcomes.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A lightweight abdomen-mounted autonomous ultrasound robot uses AI with memory-attentive perception to autonomously obtain standard liver planes and detect pathology, demonstrating robustness in motion and resource-limited settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Liver ultrasound requires locating multiple non-continuous planes and expert skill, yet expert sonographers are scarce in resource-limited regions; there is a need for autonomous, cost-effective tools to provide expert-level diagnostics.

Method: A 588-gram, 6-DOF cable-driven robot mounted on the abdomen integrates an AI agent with multi-modal perception and memory attention to localize unseen target structures, autonomously acquire standard liver ultrasound planes, and detect pathology; evaluated in patients including two from the high-altitude city Xining.

Result: The system autonomously obtains expert-level standard liver ultrasound planes and detects pathology in patients, demonstrating robustness to rapid motion and wilderness environments; claimed as the first autonomous sonography demonstration across multiple challenging scenarios.

Conclusion: This approach could transform access to expert-level liver diagnostics in underserved regions, offering a scalable, motion-robust solution for autonomous bedside ultrasound, with potential for broader clinical validation and deployment.

Abstract: Liver disease is a major global health burden. While ultrasound is the
first-line diagnostic tool, liver sonography requires locating multiple
non-continuous planes from positions where target structures are often not
visible, for biometric assessment and lesion detection, requiring significant
expertise. However, expert sonographers are severely scarce in resource-limited
regions. Here, we develop an autonomous lightweight ultrasound robot comprising
an AI agent that integrates multi-modal perception with memory attention for
localization of unseen target structures, and a 588-gram 6-degrees-of-freedom
cable-driven robot. By mounting on the abdomen, the system enhances robustness
against motion. Our robot can autonomously acquire expert-level standard liver
ultrasound planes and detect pathology in patients, including two from Xining,
a 2261-meter-altitude city with limited medical resources. Our system performs
effectively on rapid-motion individuals and in wilderness environments. This
work represents the first demonstration of autonomous sonography across
multiple challenging scenarios, potentially transforming access to expert-level
diagnostics in underserved regions.

### [126] [Accurate and Noise-Tolerant Extraction of Routine Logs in Robotic Process Automation (Extended Version)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08118)
*Massimiliano de Leoni,Faizan Ahmed Khan,Simone Agostinelli*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A clustering-based approach improves discovery of routine logs from UI interaction logs, enabling robust routine-type models for robotic process automation, especially under noisy execution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enable routine-type model discovery for robotic process automation by deriving routine logs from user interaction logs. Existing work either extracts only action sets or lacks evaluation under noise, limiting model discovery in real-world variability.

Method: Apply clustering to UI logs to extract routine logs, evaluated across nine UI logs with injected noise; compare against adapted existing techniques not designed for routine log discovery.

Result: The proposed method yields more accurate routine logs than state-of-the-art approaches, particularly in noisy scenarios, as measured by standard metrics.

Conclusion: Clustering-based routine-log discovery enhances robustness to noise, supporting more reliable routine-type models for RPA.

Abstract: Robotic Process Mining focuses on the identification of the routine types
performed by human resources through a User Interface. The ultimate goal is to
discover routine-type models to enable robotic process automation. The
discovery of routine-type models requires the provision of a routine log.
Unfortunately, the vast majority of existing works do not directly focus on
enabling the model discovery, limiting themselves to extracting the set of
actions that are part of the routines. They were also not evaluated in
scenarios characterized by inconsistent routine execution, hereafter referred
to as noise, which reflects natural variability and occasional errors in human
performance. This paper presents a clustering-based technique that aims to
extract routine logs. Experiments were conducted on nine UI logs from the
literature with different levels of injected noise. Our technique was compared
with existing techniques, most of which are not meant to discover routine logs
but were adapted for the purpose. The results were evaluated through standard
state-of-the-art metrics, showing that we can extract more accurate routine
logs than what the state of the art could, especially in the presence of noise.

Conclusion: NavSpace reveals spatial intelligence gaps in current navigation agents; SNav advances spatially intelligent navigation and offers a strong foundation for future research; ongoing work could explore broader tasks and real-world deployment.

Abstract: Instruction-following navigation is a key step toward embodied intelligence.
Prior benchmarks mainly focus on semantic understanding but overlook
systematically evaluating navigation agents' spatial perception and reasoning
capabilities. In this work, we introduce the NavSpace benchmark, which contains
six task categories and 1,228 trajectory-instruction pairs designed to probe
the spatial intelligence of navigation agents. On this benchmark, we
comprehensively evaluate 22 navigation agents, including state-of-the-art
navigation models and multimodal large language models. The evaluation results
lift the veil on spatial intelligence in embodied navigation. Furthermore, we
propose SNav, a new spatially intelligent navigation model. SNav outperforms
existing navigation agents on NavSpace and real robot tests, establishing a
strong baseline for future work.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: TRPO outperforms PID and other RL methods for CDPR control under underconstrained, low-frequency update conditions, achieving the lowest RMS errors and robust performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate and compare classical PID control with modern reinforcement learning approaches in real-world cable-driven parallel robots under practical constraints (underconstrained dynamics and coarse time discretization), and to identify robust control methods for noisy environments.

Method: Empirical comparison on real CDPRs between PID, DDPG, PPO, and TRPO. Experiments consider underconstrained dynamics and limited time discretization. Performance measured via RMS error across multiple trajectories and varying control update intervals to assess robustness.

Result: TRPO achieved the lowest RMS errors across tested trajectories and was robust to larger control update intervals, outperforming PID, DDPG, and PPO. It balances exploration and exploitation, enabling stable control in noisy, real-world settings while reducing reliance on high-frequency sensor feedback and heavy computation.

Conclusion: TRPO shows strong potential as a robust controller for complex, real-world robotic tasks under practical constraints, with promising implications for sensor fusion and hybrid control strategies in dynamic environments.

Abstract: This study evaluates the performance of classical and modern control methods
for real-world Cable-Driven Parallel Robots (CDPRs), focusing on
underconstrained systems with limited time discretization. A comparative
analysis is conducted between classical PID controllers and modern
reinforcement learning algorithms, including Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient
(DDPG), Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), and Trust Region Policy
Optimization (TRPO). The results demonstrate that TRPO outperforms other
methods, achieving the lowest root mean square (RMS) errors across various
trajectories and exhibiting robustness to larger time intervals between control
updates. TRPO's ability to balance exploration and exploitation enables stable
control in noisy, real-world environments, reducing reliance on high-frequency
sensor feedback and computational demands. These findings highlight TRPO's
potential as a robust solution for complex robotic control tasks, with
implications for dynamic environments and future applications in sensor fusion
or hybrid control strategies.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: An interactive art installation, Airy, makes two RL-trained robot arms compete to lift a bedsheet, using competition, embodied familiarity, and sensor-to-sense mapping to reveal machine intent. Across five exhibitions, audiences read strategies and emotional states in real time, turning a black-box AI into a public interface.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve safety, trust, and public oversight as robots operate in shared human spaces by making complex multi-agent AI decision-making legible and interpretable to non-experts.

Method: Two reinforcement-trained robot arms compete to snap a bedsheet skyward. The design relies on three principles: (1) competition as a clear metric (who lifts higher), (2) embodied familiarity (fabric snapping is recognizable to audiences), and (3) sensor-to-sense mapping (cooperation or rivalry is conveyed via forest and weather projections). The installation was exhibited in five international venues, with viewers and their reactions observed.

Result: Audiences consistently read the robots' strategies, conflict, and cooperation in real time. Emotional responses track with the system's inferred internal state, indicating intuitive interpretation of the agents' behavior across cultures.

Conclusion: Sensory metaphors can turn opaque, black-box AI into a public-facing interface, enabling real-time interpretation of machine intent and fostering transparency in human–robot interactions.

Abstract: As industrial robots move into shared human spaces, their opaque decision
making threatens safety, trust, and public oversight. This artwork, Airy, asks
whether complex multi agent AI can become intuitively understandable by staging
a competition between two reinforcement trained robot arms that snap a bedsheet
skyward. Building on three design principles, competition as a clear metric
(who lifts higher), embodied familiarity (audiences recognize fabric snapping),
and sensor to sense mapping (robot cooperation or rivalry shown through forest
and weather projections), the installation gives viewers a visceral way to read
machine intent. Observations from five international exhibitions indicate that
audiences consistently read the robots' strategies, conflict, and cooperation
in real time, with emotional reactions that mirror the system's internal state.
The project shows how sensory metaphors can turn a black box into a public
interface.

### [130] [Reliability of Single-Level Equality-Constrained Inverse Optimal Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08406)
*Filip Bečanović,Kosta Jovanović,Vincent Bonnet*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A single-level reformulation of bilevel inverse optimal control (IOC) for equality-constrained human-motion models yields equivalent results to the traditional bilevel approach while offering much greater robustness to noise and substantial speedups (≈15x) on a planar reaching task.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Inverse optimal control aims to recover the objective (cost) weights governing human motion from observed trajectories. Classical IOC methods rely on slow bilevel optimization or fast but noise-sensitive least-squares on optimality conditions. There is a need for a faster, robust IOC method that preserves accuracy.

Method: The paper introduces a single-level reformulation of the bilevel IOC within equality-constrained optimal control models of human motion. It replaces the bilevel structure with a single-level formulation and tests robustness to noise via numerical simulations on a human-like planar reaching task, comparing against a classical bilevel IOC implementation.

Result: The single-level reformulation achieves equivalent results to the bilevel method while being resilient to very large noise levels and reducing IOC computation time by a factor of 15 on the tested planar reaching task.

Conclusion: A fast, robust alternative to bilevel IOC is feasible for human-motion models with equality constraints, providing equivalent cost-weight recovery with substantially improved computational efficiency.

Abstract: Inverse optimal control (IOC) allows the retrieval of optimal cost function
weights, or behavioral parameters, from human motion. The literature on IOC
uses methods that are either based on a slow bilevel process or a fast but
noise-sensitive minimization of optimality condition violation. Assuming
equality-constrained optimal control models of human motion, this article
presents a faster but robust approach to solving IOC using a single-level
reformulation of the bilevel method and yields equivalent results. Through
numerical experiments in simulation, we analyze the robustness to noise of the
proposed single-level reformulation to the bilevel IOC formulation with a
human-like planar reaching task that is used across recent studies. The
approach shows resilience to very large levels of noise and reduces the
computation time of the IOC on this task by a factor of 15 when compared to a
classical bilevel implementation.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Automates validation of the largest collision-free sphere (CFS) for a 6-6 SGPM using CAD API; samples MP poses in a shell around the CFS and checks all leg-pair collisions to confirm safety; generalizable to spatial parallel manipulators.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ensure safe, optimal CFS sizing for parallel manipulators; reduce manual collision analysis by leveraging CAD automation; provide a generalizable approach.

Method: For a fixed MP orientation, enumerate sample positions within a shell enclosing the CFS; update MP pose via CAD API for each sample; for each pose, check every leg pair for collisions; declare CFS validated if no collisions occur inside the CFS; use this to validate precomputed CFS and estimate CFS for any spatial PM.

Result: Yields a yes/no validation of CFS safety and an estimated CFS size; demonstrates applicability to spatial parallel manipulators and automation of collision checks via CAD API.

Conclusion: The approach offers a general, automated framework for CFS validation in SGPMs and other spatial parallel manipulators, enabling safer design and verification workflows.

Abstract: This paper presents a method of validation of the size of the largest
collision-free sphere (CFS) of a 6-6 Stewart-Gough platform manipulator (SGPM)
for a given orientation of its moving platform (MP) using the Application
Programming Interface (API) of a CAD software. The position of the MP is
updated via the API in an automated manner over a set of samples within a shell
enclosing the surface of the CFS. For each pose of the manipulator, each pair
of legs is investigated for mutual collisions. The CFS is considered safe or
validated iff none of the points falling inside the CFS lead to a collision
between any pair of legs. This approach can not only validate the safety of a
precomputed CFS, but also estimate the same for any spatial parallel
manipulator.

TL;DR: GLUESTICK provides a post-pruning recovery for Vision-Language-Action models by a one-shot weight-space interpolation between dense and pruned models to create a corrective term, enabling near-original performance with sparsity maintained, no extra training, and a tunable efficiency–accuracy tradeoff.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pruning degrades VLA performance and safety in robotics, while retraining to recover is costly and impractical; a lightweight, hardware-friendly recovery technique that works across pruning methods is needed.

Method: Compute a corrective term via a one-shot interpolation between dense and pruned weight spaces; apply the term during inference in each pruned layer; no additional training; pruning-agnostic; introduces a single hyperparameter controlling trade-off between efficiency and accuracy.

Result: Evaluated on diverse VLA architectures and tasks in manipulation and navigation; achieves competitive memory efficiency and substantially improves success rates; reductions in safety violations compared to naive pruning.

Conclusion: GLUESTICK demonstrates an effective and practical post-pruning correction for VLA systems, enabling deployment on resource-limited hardware without retraining; future work could explore broader tasks, dynamic adjustments, or interactions with different pruning strategies.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have advanced robotic capabilities but
remain challenging to deploy on resource-limited hardware. Pruning has enabled
efficient compression of large language models (LLMs), yet it is largely
understudied in robotics. Surprisingly, we observe that pruning VLA models
leads to drastic degradation and increased safety violations. We introduce
GLUESTICK, a post-pruning recovery method that restores much of the original
model's functionality while retaining sparsity benefits. Our method performs a
one-time interpolation between the dense and pruned models in weight-space to
compute a corrective term. This correction is used during inference by each
pruned layer to recover lost capabilities with minimal overhead. GLUESTICK
requires no additional training, is agnostic to the pruning algorithm, and
introduces a single hyperparameter that controls the tradeoff between
efficiency and accuracy. Across diverse VLA architectures and tasks in
manipulation and navigation, GLUESTICK achieves competitive memory efficiency
while substantially recovering success rates and reducing safety violations.

Motivation: To reduce reliance on manual data collection, camera calibration, depth sensors, and costly motion capture for dexterous manipulation, by learning from in-the-wild videos to scale datasets and improve realism.

Method: An automated framework that uses third-person videos of humans manipulating rigid objects, bypassing camera calibration, depth sensors, 3D object assets, and hand/object annotations. It directly controls a humanoid robot in simulation, uses novel contact-based rewards, and learns from noisy, in-the-wild hand–object poses estimated from videos; capable of using both real and synthetic videos to generate skills.

Conclusion: DexMan demonstrates a scalable approach to learning generalist dexterous manipulation by leveraging in-the-wild videos for automated skill generation, reducing calibration and mocap requirements and enabling broad dataset creation for simulation-based dexterous manipulation.

Abstract: We present DexMan, an automated framework that converts human visual
demonstrations into bimanual dexterous manipulation skills for humanoid robots
in simulation. Operating directly on third-person videos of humans manipulating
rigid objects, DexMan eliminates the need for camera calibration, depth
sensors, scanned 3D object assets, or ground-truth hand and object motion
annotations. Unlike prior approaches that consider only simplified floating
hands, it directly controls a humanoid robot and leverages novel contact-based
rewards to improve policy learning from noisy hand-object poses estimated from
in-the-wild videos.
  DexMan achieves state-of-the-art performance in object pose estimation on the
TACO benchmark, with absolute gains of 0.08 and 0.12 in ADD-S and VSD.
Meanwhile, its reinforcement learning policy surpasses previous methods by 19%
in success rate on OakInk-v2. Furthermore, DexMan can generate skills from both

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: R2RGen is a simulator- and rendering-free real-to-real 3D data generation framework that augments a single demonstration to create diverse real-world pointcloud observation-action pairs, improving data efficiency for generalized visuomotor policies in mobile manipulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable spatial generalization in robotic manipulation without extensive human demonstrations or a sim-to-real gap, and to overcome fixed-base and fixed-camera limitations by scalable real-world data generation.

Method: R2RGen uses a single source demonstration, with an annotation mechanism to parse scene and trajectory; employs group-wise augmentation for complex multi-object setups; applies camera-aware processing to align generated data with real 3D sensors; fully simulator- and rendering-free.

Result: Empirically improves data efficiency across extensive experiments; shows strong potential for scaling and deployment on mobile manipulation.

Conclusion: R2RGen provides an efficient, plug-and-play solution for generating realistic 3D data to train generalized visuomotor policies, addressing data scarcity and enabling scalable real-world robotic manipulation.

Abstract: Towards the aim of generalized robotic manipulation, spatial generalization
is the most fundamental capability that requires the policy to work robustly
under different spatial distribution of objects, environment and agent itself.
To achieve this, substantial human demonstrations need to be collected to cover
different spatial configurations for training a generalized visuomotor policy
via imitation learning. Prior works explore a promising direction that
leverages data generation to acquire abundant spatially diverse data from
minimal source demonstrations. However, most approaches face significant
sim-to-real gap and are often limited to constrained settings, such as
fixed-base scenarios and predefined camera viewpoints. In this paper, we
propose a real-to-real 3D data generation framework (R2RGen) that directly
augments the pointcloud observation-action pairs to generate real-world data.
R2RGen is simulator- and rendering-free, thus being efficient and
plug-and-play. Specifically, given a single source demonstration, we introduce
an annotation mechanism for fine-grained parsing of scene and trajectory. A
group-wise augmentation strategy is proposed to handle complex multi-object
compositions and diverse task constraints. We further present camera-aware
processing to align the distribution of generated data with real-world 3D
sensor. Empirically, R2RGen substantially enhances data efficiency on extensive
experiments and demonstrates strong potential for scaling and application on
mobile manipulation.

*Xueyi Liu,He Wang,Li Yi*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A data-efficient sim-to-real framework for in-hand rotation that uses a joint-wise dynamics model to adapt a single policy to diverse objects and conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The reality gap between simulation and real-world dexterous manipulation makes transferring policies hard. Prior work is limited to constrained geometries, sizes, wrist poses, and often customized hardware. A generalizable solution is needed for broad object diversity and operation.

Method: Train a policy in simulation and learn a joint-wise dynamics model that factorizes dynamics across joints, compresses system-wide effects into low-dimensional variables, and learns each joint's evolution from its own dynamic profile. Use a fully autonomous real-world data collection approach to fit the model with limited real data and adapt the sim policy's actions accordingly, enabling generalization across whole-hand interactions and object categories.

Result: A single policy successfully rotates challenging objects with complex shapes (including animals), high aspect ratios up to 5.33, and small sizes, across varied wrist orientations and rotation axes. Real-world evaluations and teleoperation demonstrations validate robustness and generality.

Conclusion: The joint-wise dynamics bridging framework effectively closes the sim-to-real gap for dexterous in-hand rotation, enabling broad generalization with data-efficient adaptation and autonomous data collection, and suggesting applicability to other complex manipulation tasks.

Abstract: Achieving generalized in-hand object rotation remains a significant challenge
in robotics, largely due to the difficulty of transferring policies from
simulation to the real world. The complex, contact-rich dynamics of dexterous
manipulation create a "reality gap" that has limited prior work to constrained
scenarios involving simple geometries, limited object sizes and aspect ratios,
constrained wrist poses, or customized hands. We address this sim-to-real
challenge with a novel framework that enables a single policy, trained in
simulation, to generalize to a wide variety of objects and conditions in the
real world. The core of our method is a joint-wise dynamics model that learns
to bridge the reality gap by effectively fitting limited amount of real-world
collected data and then adapting the sim policy's actions accordingly. The
model is highly data-efficient and generalizable across different whole-hand
interaction distributions by factorizing dynamics across joints, compressing
system-wide influences into low-dimensional variables, and learning each
joint's evolution from its own dynamic profile, implicitly capturing these net
effects. We pair this with a fully autonomous data collection strategy that
gathers diverse, real-world interaction data with minimal human intervention.
Our complete pipeline demonstrates unprecedented generality: a single policy
successfully rotates challenging objects with complex shapes (e.g., animals),
high aspect ratios (up to 5.33), and small sizes, all while handling diverse
wrist orientations and rotation axes. Comprehensive real-world evaluations and
a teleoperation application for complex tasks validate the effectiveness and
robustness of our approach. Website: https://meowuu7.github.io/DexNDM/

*Hongyu Li,Lingfeng Sun,Yafei Hu,Duy Ta,Jennifer Barry,George Konidaris,Jiahui Fu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: NovaFlow enables zero-shot cross-embodiment manipulation by converting task descriptions into actionable plans via video-generated object flow and perception, supporting rigid, articulated, and deformable objects without demonstrations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome limits of in-distribution tasks and embodiment-specific fine-tuning; achieve cross-robot transfer without demonstrations or retraining.

Method: From a task description, synthesize a video of the task using a generative model; distill into 3D actionable object flow via off-the-shelf perception; compute relative poses for rigid objects and realize them as robot actions through grasp proposals and trajectory optimization; for deformable objects, use the flow as a tracking objective in model-based planning with a particle-based dynamics model; decouple task understanding from low-level control to enable cross-embodiment transfer; validate on rigid, articulated, and deformable manipulation with a Franka arm and a Spot robot.

Result: Demonstrates effective zero-shot manipulation across rigid, articulated, and deformable objects on two robots without demonstrations or embodiment-specific training.

Conclusion: Decoupling task understanding from low-level control enables robust cross-embodiment transfer; NovaFlow offers a general framework for zero-shot robotic manipulation.

Abstract: Enabling robots to execute novel manipulation tasks zero-shot is a central
goal in robotics. Most existing methods assume in-distribution tasks or rely on
fine-tuning with embodiment-matched data, limiting transfer across platforms.
We present NovaFlow, an autonomous manipulation framework that converts a task
description into an actionable plan for a target robot without any
demonstrations. Given a task description, NovaFlow synthesizes a video using a
video generation model and distills it into 3D actionable object flow using
off-the-shelf perception modules. From the object flow, it computes relative
poses for rigid objects and realizes them as robot actions via grasp proposals
and trajectory optimization. For deformable objects, this flow serves as a
tracking objective for model-based planning with a particle-based dynamics
model. By decoupling task understanding from low-level control, NovaFlow
naturally transfers across embodiments. We validate on rigid, articulated, and
deformable object manipulation tasks using a table-top Franka arm and a Spot
quadrupedal mobile robot, and achieve effective zero-shot execution without
demonstrations or embodiment-specific training. Project website:

### [137] [Scalable Offline Metrics for Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08571)
*Animikh Aich,Adwait Kulkarni,Eshed Ohn-Bar*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Offline evaluation for perception-based planning in robotics correlates poorly with online performance; introducing an epistemic-uncertainty-based offline metric improves correlation by >13% and generalizes to real-world settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current offline metrics fail to predict closed-loop online behavior in driving policies; better evaluation methods are needed to bridge offline and online performance, especially for urban maneuvers.

Method: Study includes simulation and real-world experiments to compare offline vs online correlations; proposes a metric based on epistemic uncertainty to flag events likely to cause online errors; measures correlation improvements.

Result: Epistemic-uncertainty offline metric yields over 13% improvement in correlation with online performance vs previous offline metrics; gains are larger in real-world settings.

Conclusion: Offline evaluation can be made more predictive of online performance by incorporating epistemic uncertainty; the proposed metric better captures risk of closed-loop failures, though further validation and generalization is warranted.

Abstract: Real-World evaluation of perception-based planning models for robotic
systems, such as autonomous vehicles, can be safely and inexpensively conducted
offline, i.e., by computing model prediction error over a pre-collected
validation dataset with ground-truth annotations. However, extrapolating from
offline model performance to online settings remains a challenge. In these
settings, seemingly minor errors can compound and result in test-time
infractions or collisions. This relationship is understudied, particularly
across diverse closed-loop metrics and complex urban maneuvers. In this work,
we revisit this undervalued question in policy evaluation through an extensive
set of experiments across diverse conditions and metrics. Based on analysis in
simulation, we find an even worse correlation between offline and online
settings than reported by prior studies, casting doubts on the validity of
current evaluation practices and metrics for driving policies. Next, we bridge
the gap between offline and online evaluation. We investigate an offline metric
based on epistemic uncertainty, which aims to capture events that are likely to
cause errors in closed-loop settings. The resulting metric achieves over 13%
improvement in correlation compared to previous offline metrics. We further
validate the generalization of our findings beyond the simulation environment
in real-world settings, where even greater gains are observed.

### [138] [BLAZER: Bootstrapping LLM-based Manipulation Agents with Zero-Shot Data Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08572)
*Rocktim Jyoti Das,Harsh Singh,Diana Turmakhan,Muhammad Abdullah Sohail,Mingfei Han,Preslav Nakov,Fabio Pizzati,Ivan Laptev*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: BLAZER is a framework that learns robotic manipulation policies from automatically generated data: it uses zero-shot LLM planners to create demonstrations in simulation, fine-tunes the LLM to enhance planning, and transfers to sensor-based manipulation, achieving strong zero-shot improvements in sim and real, generalizing beyond training tasks, and enabling smaller LLMs; code/data will be released.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robotics lacks internet-scale demonstrations and massive, curated datasets like vision/language domains, making scalable learning hard. The goal is to scale data/model size and enable robust, generalizable policies with less manual data collection.

Method: Use zero-shot LLM planners to generate diverse manipulation demonstrations in simulation. Use successful demonstrations to finetune an LLM to improve planning. Transfer acquired skills to sensor-based manipulation without human supervision. Evaluate in both simulation and real environments; test generalization beyond training tasks. Code/data to be released.

Result: BLAZER significantly improves zero-shot manipulation in both simulated and real environments, even on tasks outside the training pool, and enables downscaling of LLM models.

Conclusion: A scalable, automation-driven framework for robotics policy learning that closes the sim-to-real gap, reduces reliance on manually collected data, and supports smaller LLMs while maintaining strong zero-shot performance.

Abstract: Scaling data and models has played a pivotal role in the remarkable progress
of computer vision and language. Inspired by these domains, recent efforts in
robotics have similarly focused on scaling both data and model size to develop
more generalizable and robust policies. However, unlike vision and language,
robotics lacks access to internet-scale demonstrations across diverse robotic
tasks and environments. As a result, the scale of existing datasets typically
suffers from the need for manual data collection and curation. To address this
problem, here we propose BLAZER, a framework that learns manipulation policies
from automatically generated training data. We build on the zero-shot
capabilities of LLM planners and automatically generate demonstrations for
diverse manipulation tasks in simulation. Successful examples are then used to
finetune an LLM and to improve its planning capabilities without human
supervision. Notably, while BLAZER training requires access to the simulator's
state, we demonstrate direct transfer of acquired skills to sensor-based
manipulation. Through extensive experiments, we show BLAZER to significantly
improve zero-shot manipulation in both simulated and real environments.
Moreover, BLAZER improves on tasks outside of its training pool and enables
downscaling of LLM models. Our code and data will be made publicly available on
the project page.

*Faruk Alpay,Hamdi Alakkad*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Truth-Aware Decoding (TAD) is a verification-oriented decoding framework that inserts a lattice of semantic guards at decode time to align neural generation with knowledge bases, reducing hallucinations while maintaining throughput.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To curb factual inaccuracies in instruction-tuned language models by combining probabilistic program semantics with knowledge-grounded verification, providing a formal bridge between large-scale models and verifiable guarantees.

Method: Introduces a constraint-based semantics that treats oracle filtering as a program-logic judgment; proves greedy decoding has local likelihood dominance under sound and complete guards (Theorem 2.7); defines an entropy-style invariant quantifying factual risk via knowledge-aware safe mass; develops a multi-agent operational calculus with verified Lean artefacts to certify implementation behavior.

Result: Empirical and algorithmic studies show the guardrails reduce hallucinations without sacrificing throughput, demonstrating a practical path to verifiable, knowledge-aligned generation.

Conclusion: TAD offers a pragmatic integration of formal verification concepts with empirical language models, yielding safer, more factually grounded generation while preserving efficiency.

Abstract: This paper introduces Truth-Aware Decoding (TAD), a verification-oriented
decoding scheme that aligns neural language generation with knowledge bases.
Situated in the tradition of probabilistic program semantics for sequence
models, TAD augments modern instruction-tuned systems with a lattice of
semantic guards that operate at decode time. Our contributions are fourfold:
(i) a constraint-based semantics that renders oracle filtering as a
program-logic judgment, (ii) a proof that greedy selection enjoys local
likelihood dominance under sound and complete guards (Theorem 2.7), (iii) an
entropy-style invariant that quantifies factual risk via knowledge-aware safe
mass, and (iv) a multi-agent operational calculus with verified Lean artefacts
to certify implementation behaviour. Numerical and algorithmic case studies
confirm that the resulting guardrails reduce hallucinations without sacrificing
throughput, yielding a pragmatic bridge between large-scale empirical models
and formal verification.

*Tianxiang Xu,Zhichao Wen,Xinyu Zhao,Jun Wang,Yan Li,Chang Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: L2M-AID combines LLM-powered semantic interpretation with MARL (MAPPO) to autonomously defend IIoT/CPS, achieving high detection with strong stability preservation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Industrial IoT security must understand adversary intent in context; traditional detectors struggle with CPS stability constraints and complex multis etapas attacks.

Method: Use an LLM to translate unstructured telemetry into a semantic state for agents; employ MAPPO for cooperative multi-agent RL; design a reward that balances threat neutralization with maintaining physical process stability; validate on SWaT and a MITRE ATT&CK ICS-based synthetic dataset.

Result: 97.2% detection rate, >80% reduction in false positives, and 4x faster response times; superior to traditional IDS, DL detectors, and single-agent RL baselines; better maintenance of physical process stability.

Conclusion: L2M-AID demonstrates a robust, LLM-enabled, multi-agent defense paradigm for critical infrastructure, showing strong detection, fewer false alarms, faster responses, and better process stability.

Abstract: The increasing integration of Industrial IoT (IIoT) exposes critical
cyber-physical systems to sophisticated, multi-stage attacks that elude
traditional defenses lacking contextual awareness. This paper introduces
L2M-AID, a novel framework for Autonomous Industrial Defense using
LLM-empowered, Multi-agent reinforcement learning. L2M-AID orchestrates a team
of collaborative agents, each driven by a Large Language Model (LLM), to
achieve adaptive and resilient security. The core innovation lies in the deep
fusion of two AI paradigms: we leverage an LLM as a semantic bridge to
translate vast, unstructured telemetry into a rich, contextual state
representation, enabling agents to reason about adversary intent rather than
merely matching patterns. This semantically-aware state empowers a Multi-Agent
Reinforcement Learning (MARL) algorithm, MAPPO, to learn complex cooperative
strategies. The MARL reward function is uniquely engineered to balance security
objectives (threat neutralization) with operational imperatives, explicitly
penalizing actions that disrupt physical process stability. To validate our
approach, we conduct extensive experiments on the benchmark SWaT dataset and a
novel synthetic dataset generated based on the MITRE ATT&CK for ICS framework.
Results demonstrate that L2M-AID significantly outperforms traditional IDS,
deep learning anomaly detectors, and single-agent RL baselines across key
metrics, achieving a 97.2% detection rate while reducing false positives by
over 80% and improving response times by a factor of four. Crucially, it
demonstrates superior performance in maintaining physical process stability,
presenting a robust new paradigm for securing critical national infrastructure.

### [141] [Base Models Know How to Reason, Thinking Models Learn When](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07364)
*Constantin Venhoff,Iván Arcuschin,Philip Torr,Arthur Conmy,Neel Nanda*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A study investigates whether 'thinking' LMs gain new reasoning abilities or repurpose existing ones. It proposes a hybrid model that triggers base-model reasoning at the right moment and introduces an unsupervised method to reveal interpretable reasoning. The hybrid recovers up to 91% of the gap to thinking models on GSM8K/MATH500 while only steering 12% of tokens, suggesting pre-training builds reasoning and post-training optimizes deployment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand whether thinking-language models rely on newly learned reasoning capabilities or on repurposing pre-existing base-model abilities, and to test causal activation of these mechanisms during inference.

Method: Introduce a hybrid model that activates base-model reasoning at opportune times to elicit thinking-model-level chains. Develop an unsupervised, bottom-up method to uncover human-interpretable reasoning behaviors in thinking models without manual/LLM-derived assumptions. Evaluate across 3 base and 4 thinking models on GSM8K and MATH500, measuring performance gains and the proportion of tokens steered.

Result: The hybrid approach recovers up to 91% of the performance gap to thinking models without updating weights, steering only about 12% of tokens. This validates that existing reasoning mechanisms in base models can be activated to mimic thinking-model reasoning, enabling a causal test of such mechanisms.

Conclusion: Pre-training endows models with most reasoning capabilities; post-training optimizes the timing of invoking these mechanisms for efficient inference. This reframes thinking-model training by separating capability acquisition (pre-training) from deployment efficiency (post-training).

Abstract: Why do thinking language models like DeepSeek R1 outperform their base
counterparts? Despite consistent performance gains, it remains unclear to what
extent thinking models learn entirely new reasoning capabilities or repurpose
pre-existing base model ones. In this work, we propose a hybrid model where we
activate reasoning mechanisms in base models at the right time to elicit
thinking-model-level reasoning chains, implying that thinking models exploit
already existing capabilities. To ground our analysis, we introduce an
unsupervised, bottom-up approach for uncovering human-interpretable reasoning
behaviors in thinking models. This approach provides an unbiased method to
discover reasoning behaviors without imposing manual or LLM-derived
assumptions. Across three base and four thinking models, using GSM8K and
MATH500, our hybrid model recovers up to 91% of the performance gap to thinking
models without any weight updates while steering only 12% of tokens.
Concretely, our empirical setup provides a simple, causal way to test the
effectiveness of existing reasoning mechanisms in base models by invoking them
directly and measuring the resulting task performance. More broadly, these
results reframe our understanding of how thinking models are trained:
pre-training is when models acquire most of their reasoning mechanisms, and
post-training teaches efficient deployment of these mechanisms at the right
time, enabling efficient use of their inference-time compute.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes continuous AI-driven mental health assessment using generative AI and mental health digital twins (MHDTs) to replace static diagnostics, using ADHD as a case study; outlines a conceptual framework and a research agenda for personalized, longitudinal care.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome capacity constraints in neuropsychology and enable dynamic, patient-centered care through ongoing data collection and AI-assisted assessment.

Method: Conceptual framework combining frequent AI-enabled experience sampling, diagnostic reconciliation across care pathways, and MHDTs—continuously updated computational models of individual symptom dynamics—grounded in existing evidence and paired with a mapped research agenda.

Result: A conceptual framework proposing continuous AI-driven assessment and MHDTs for mental health care; discusses potential benefits and outlines steps for operationalization, but provides no empirical results yet.

Conclusion: Continuous, data-rich, patient-centered AI approaches could transform mental health care by improving access and efficacy, contingent on developing MHDTs and validating them in real-world settings.

Abstract: Static solutions don't serve a dynamic mind. Thus, we advocate a shift from
static mental health diagnostic assessments to continuous, artificial
intelligence (AI)-driven assessment. Focusing on
Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) as a case study, we explore how
generative AI has the potential to address current capacity constraints in
neuropsychology, potentially enabling more personalized and longitudinal care
pathways. In particular, AI can efficiently conduct frequent, low-level
experience sampling from patients and facilitate diagnostic reconciliation
across care pathways. We envision a future where mental health care benefits
from continuous, rich, and patient-centered data sampling to dynamically adapt
to individual patient needs and evolving conditions, thereby improving both
accessibility and efficacy of treatment. We further propose the use of mental
health digital twins (MHDTs) - continuously updated computational models that
capture individual symptom dynamics and trajectories - as a transformative
framework for personalized mental health care. We ground this framework in
empirical evidence and map out the research agenda required to refine and
operationalize it.

TL;DR: ProSEA is a modular multi-agent framework with a Manager coordinating Expert Agents, enabling iterative problem solving, adaptive replanning, and reporting detailed failure reasons and constraints; it outperforms baselines on FinanceBench without human feedback, enabling transparent, adaptive AI agents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI agents rely on static planning and brittle interactions, lacking true collaboration, adaptive reasoning, and transparent failure insights; a flexible, exploratory, human-aligned framework is needed.

Method: A hierarchical architecture with a Manager Agent orchestrating domain-specific Expert Agents. It decomposes tasks, adaptively replans based on structured feedback from failed attempts, and reports failure reasons and newly discovered constraints. It operates autonomously with optional human collaboration and uses exploratory traces to refine plans.

Result: On FinanceBench, ProSEA outperforms state-of-the-art baselines without human feedback and demonstrates robust performance on reasoning-heavy tasks.

Conclusion: ProSEA has potential as a foundation for transparent, adaptive, and human-aligned AI agents, enabling more capable multi-agent collaboration and robust problem solving.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have empowered AI agents to tackle increasingly
complex tasks. However, most existing agents remain limited to static planning
and brittle interactions, falling short of true collaboration or adaptive
reasoning. We introduce ProSEA, a modular, general-purpose multi-agent
framework designed for iterative problem solving through exploration and plan
evolution. ProSEA features a hierarchical architecture in which a Manager Agent
orchestrates domain-specialized Expert Agents, decomposes tasks, and adaptively
replans based on structured feedback from failed attempts. Unlike prior
systems, ProSEA agents report not only success or failure but also detailed
reasons for failure and newly discovered constraints, enabling dynamic plan
refinement informed by exploratory traces. The framework operates autonomously
but supports seamless integration with human collaborators when needed.
Experiments on the challenging FinanceBench benchmark demonstrate that ProSEA,
even without human feedback, outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and
achieves robust performance across reasoning-heavy tasks. These results
underscore ProSEA's potential as a foundation for more transparent, adaptive,
and human-aligned AI agents.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TESTAM+ improves spatial-temporal forecasting by integrating physical road topology with data-driven features via a SpatioSemantic Expert, outperforming TESTAM and MegaCRN with fewer, strategically designed experts and lower latency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address TESTAM's lack of explicit road topology modeling, which limits spatial reasoning in complex urban networks.

Method: Hybrid graph construction combining physical topology and feature similarity; introduce SpatioSemantic Expert; strategically select a subset of experts (Adaptive, SpatioSemantic) rather than naive ensemble; evaluate on METR LA and PEMS BAY; compare against MegaCRN and previous TESTAM.

Result: METR LA MAE drops from 3.14 to 3.10 (1.3% improvement); PEMS BAY MAE drops from 1.72 to 1.65 (4.1%); Adaptive Expert and SpatioSemantic Expert achieve 1.63 MAE on PEMS BAY; Identity + Adaptive reduces MAE by 11.5% versus MegaCRN on METR LA (2.99 vs 3.38); inference latency reduced by 53.1% relative to full four-expert TESTAM+.

Conclusion: Fewer, well-designed experts with topology-informed components yield better performance and efficiency, enabling real-time deployment and establishing new state-of-the-art results.

Abstract: Traffic forecasting is fundamental to intelligent transportation systems,
enabling congestion mitigation and emission reduction in increasingly complex
urban environments. While recent graph neural network approaches have advanced
spatial temporal modeling, existing mixture of experts frameworks like Time
Enhanced Spatio Temporal Attention Model (TESTAM) lack explicit incorporation
of physical road network topology, limiting their spatial capabilities. We
present TESTAM+, an enhanced spatio temporal forecasting framework that
introduces a novel SpatioSemantic Expert integrating physical road topology
with data driven feature similarity through hybrid graph construction. TESTAM+
achieves significant improvements over TESTAM: 1.3% MAE reduction on METR LA
(3.10 vs. 3.14) and 4.1% improvement on PEMS BAY (1.65 vs. 1.72). Through
comprehensive ablation studies, we discover that strategic expert selection
fundamentally outperforms naive ensemble aggregation. Individual experts
demonstrate remarkable effectiveness: the Adaptive Expert achieves 1.63 MAE on
PEMS BAY, outperforming the original three expert TESTAM (1.72 MAE), while the
SpatioSemantic Expert matches this performance with identical 1.63 MAE. The
optimal Identity + Adaptive configuration achieves an 11.5% MAE reduction
compared to state of the art MegaCRN on METR LA (2.99 vs. 3.38), while reducing
inference latency by 53.1% compared to the full four expert TESTAM+. Our
findings reveal that fewer, strategically designed experts outperform complex
multi expert ensembles, establishing new state of the art performance with
superior computational efficiency for real time deployment.

*Penghang Liu,Elizabeth Fons,Svitlana Vyetrenko,Daniel Borrajo,Vamsi Potluru,Manuela Veloso*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TS-Agent decouples time-series reasoning into two parts: LLM-based evidence gathering and stepwise deduction, and specialized time-series tools for numerical extraction, using an explicit evidence log, self-critique, and a final quality gate to improve interpretability and reduce hallucination.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs show strong reasoning but struggle with time-series tasks, often producing hallucinations or leaking knowledge when handling raw numeric data. Time-series data require precise statistical/structural analysis that LLMs alone cannot reliably provide. The proposed approach aims to preserve the native numeric form, ensure interpretability, and mitigate knowledge leakage by separating concerns.

Method: Interact with raw numeric sequences via atomic operators, record outputs in an explicit evidence log, and iteratively refine reasoning under a self-critic and a final quality gate. The LLM is used for evidence gathering and synthesis, while dedicated time-series analytical tools extract statistical/structural information. No multi-modal alignment training is employed, avoiding tokenization or embedding-based representations and preserving time-series fidelity.

Result: Empirical evaluation on established benchmarks shows TS-Agent achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art LLMs on understanding benchmarks, and delivers significant improvements on time-series reasoning tasks where memorization is common and zero-shot performance is weak.

Conclusion: The architecture preserves the native form of time-series data, enhancing interpretability and verifiability, reducing knowledge leakage and hallucination, and validating the viability of using LLMs for evidence-driven reasoning coupled with specialized numerical tools.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown strong abilities in reasoning and
problem solving, but recent studies reveal that they still struggle with time
series reasoning tasks, where outputs are often affected by hallucination or
knowledge leakage. In this work we propose TS-Agent, a time series reasoning
agent that leverages LLMs strictly for what they excel at, i.e., gathering
evidence and synthesizing it into conclusions through step-by-step reasoning,
while delegating the extraction of statistical and structural information to
time series analytical tools. Instead of mapping time series into text tokens,
images, or embeddings, our agent interacts with raw numeric sequences through
atomic operators, records outputs in an explicit evidence log, and iteratively
refines its reasoning under the guidance of a self-critic and a final quality
gate. This design avoids multi-modal alignment training, preserves the native
form of time series, ensures interpretability and verifiability, and mitigates
knowledge leakage or hallucination. Empirically, we evaluate the agent on
established benchmarks. Our experiments show that TS-Agent achieves performance
comparable to state-of-the-art LLMs on understanding benchmarks, and delivers
significant improvements on reasoning tasks, where existing models often rely
on memorization and fail in zero-shot settings.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Zero-shot, vanilla LLMs (e.g., ChatGPT) can understand BPMN process models from images, identify syntactic/logical/semantic issues, and reason about them at depth; performance varies by model; LLMs can aid business process designers; anthropomorphic behavior observed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate whether off-the-shelf LLMs can understand, reason about, and interact with BPMN process models via natural language, assess cross-model performance, and explore cognitive-like properties such as internal reasoning traces and anthropomorphism in process analysis.

Method: Empirical study using several LLMs to interact with BPMN process models presented as images. Tasks included identifying syntactic/logical/semantic errors and performing deeper reasoning about the process. Comparisons across models on accuracy and effectiveness and examination of the LLMs' purported 'thought processes.'

Result: A vanilla untrained LLM like ChatGPT (model o3) in zero-shot setting effectively understands BPMN process models from images and answers queries about them at syntactic, logical, and semantic levels. There is variation across different LLMs in accuracy and effectiveness. LLMs can serve as valuable assistants for business process designers and users.

Conclusion: LLMs have practical potential as assistants in business process design and analysis, even in zero-shot settings, though model performance varies and there are indications of anthropomorphic behavior in their reasoning.

Abstract: In this paper, we report our experience with several LLMs for their ability
to understand a process model in an interactive, conversational style, find
syntactical and logical errors in it, and reason with it in depth through a
natural language (NL) interface. Our findings show that a vanilla, untrained
LLM like ChatGPT (model o3) in a zero-shot setting is effective in
understanding BPMN process models from images and answering queries about them
intelligently at syntactic, logic, and semantic levels of depth. Further,
different LLMs vary in performance in terms of their accuracy and
effectiveness. Nevertheless, our empirical analysis shows that LLMs can play a
valuable role as assistants for business process designers and users. We also
study the LLM's "thought process" and ability to perform deeper reasoning in
the context of process analysis and optimization. We find that the LLMs seem to
exhibit anthropomorphic properties.

TL;DR: A formal risk-reduction optimization framework for Medical Intelligent Systems under the EU AI Act, comparing MIP, SAT, and CP, modeled in MiniZinc, with an empirical study to guide integration into ethical risk management.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MIS are increasingly used in healthcare and, under the EU AI Act, are often high-risk. This necessitates formal risk management that aligns with trustworthy AI ethics. The work targets risk-reduction optimization to balance ethical requirements within MIS.

Method: Formulate risk-reduction as a constrained optimization problem. Compare three resolution paradigms—Mixed Integer Programming (MIP), Satisfiability (SAT), and Constraint Programming (CP). Model the problem in MiniZinc, and conduct a comparative experimental study evaluating performance, expressiveness, and scalability. Discuss how the MiniZinc model can be integrated into a broader trustworthy AI risk-management process for MIS.

Result: The paper provides a mathematical formulation and a MiniZinc model for the optimization task and offers a comparative empirical study of MIP, SAT, and CP in terms of performance, expressiveness, and scalability. It also discusses the identified limits of the methodology and outlines perspectives for integrating the model into a complete ethical risk-management workflow for MIS.

Conclusion: The work delivers insights on applying MIP, SAT, and CP to ethical risk management in MIS and presents a path toward incorporating the model into a holistic, trustworthy AI risk-management process.

Abstract: Medical Intelligent Systems (MIS) are increasingly integrated into healthcare
workflows, offering significant benefits but also raising critical safety and
ethical concerns. According to the European Union AI Act, most MIS will be
classified as high-risk systems, requiring a formal risk management process to
ensure compliance with the ethical requirements of trustworthy AI. In this
context, we focus on risk reduction optimization problems, which aim to reduce
risks with ethical considerations by finding the best balanced assignment of
risk assessment values according to their coverage of trustworthy AI ethical
requirements. We formalize this problem as a constrained optimization task and
investigate three resolution paradigms: Mixed Integer Programming (MIP),
Satisfiability (SAT), and Constraint Programming(CP).Our contributions include
the mathematical formulation of this optimization problem, its modeling with
the Minizinc constraint modeling language, and a comparative experimental study
that analyzes the performance, expressiveness, and scalability of each approach
to solving. From the identified limits of the methodology, we draw some
perspectives of this work regarding the integration of the Minizinc model into
a complete trustworthy AI ethical risk management process for MIS.

### [149] [CompassLLM: A Multi-Agent Approach toward Geo-Spatial Reasoning for Popular Path Query](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07516)
*Md. Nazmul Islam Ananto,Shamit Fatin,Mohammed Eunus Ali,Md Rizwan Parvez*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CompassLLM uses a two-stage, multi-agent LLM framework to tackle popular path queries in geo-spatial data: a SEARCH stage that finds popular routes and a GENERATE stage that fabricates novel paths when needed, achieving high search accuracy, competitive generation quality, and cost efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional path-query methods require retraining and extensive tuning to adapt to new data; there is a need for flexible, scalable approaches that can leverage reasoning capabilities of LLMs for spatial and graph-structured problems without heavy retraining.

Method: A two-stage pipeline with multiple LLM agents. SEARCH stage identifies popular paths from historical trajectories; GENERATE stage synthesizes plausible new paths when no existing one matches the query. The system leverages LLMs' spatial/graph reasoning to perform both stages in a data-driven, adaptive manner. Experimental evaluation on real and synthetic datasets demonstrates improved search accuracy and competitive generation performance, with cost considerations.

Result: CompassLLM achieves superior accuracy in the SEARCH stage and competitive performance in the GENERATE stage compared to baselines, while remaining cost-effective.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates the viability of integrating LLM-based multi-agent reasoning into geo-spatial path queries, offering improved search quality and adaptable path synthesis without extensive retraining.

Abstract: The popular path query - identifying the most frequented routes between
locations from historical trajectory data - has important applications in urban
planning, navigation optimization, and travel recommendations. While
traditional algorithms and machine learning approaches have achieved success in
this domain, they typically require model training, parameter tuning, and
retraining when accommodating data updates. As Large Language Models (LLMs)
demonstrate increasing capabilities in spatial and graph-based reasoning, there
is growing interest in exploring how these models can be applied to geo-spatial
problems.
  We introduce CompassLLM, a novel multi-agent framework that intelligently
leverages the reasoning capabilities of LLMs into the geo-spatial domain to
solve the popular path query. CompassLLM employs its agents in a two-stage
pipeline: the SEARCH stage that identifies popular paths, and a GENERATE stage
that synthesizes novel paths in the absence of an existing one in the
historical trajectory data. Experiments on real and synthetic datasets show
that CompassLLM demonstrates superior accuracy in SEARCH and competitive
performance in GENERATE while being cost-effective.

### [150] [Measuring and Mitigating Identity Bias in Multi-Agent Debate via Anonymization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07517)
*Hyeong Kyu Choi,Xiaojin Zhu,Yixuan Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes a principled MAD framework to mitigate identity bias by anonymizing agent identities and introducing an Identity Bias Coefficient (IBC); finds identity bias is widespread with stronger sycophancy than self-bias and shows anonymization improves reasoning reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address reliability issues in multi-agent debate arising from identity-driven biases (sycophancy and self-bias) that cause agents to uncritically adopt peers or cling to their own outputs.

Method: Formalize debate dynamics as an identity-weighted Bayesian update; introduce response anonymization to remove origin identity signals; define and compute Identity Bias Coefficient (IBC) to quantify following peers vs. self; conduct empirical studies across multiple models, datasets, and debate rounds.

Result: Identity bias is pervasive in MAD; sycophancy dominates self-bias; anonymizing responses reduces bias and promotes content-based reasoning; results validated across several setups.

Conclusion: Masking identity is necessary for reliable MAD reasoning; provides code and toolkit to enable replication and further research.

Abstract: Multi-agent debate (MAD) aims to improve large language model (LLM) reasoning
by letting multiple agents exchange answers and then aggregate their opinions.
Yet recent studies reveal that agents are not neutral: they are prone to
identity-driven sycophancy and self-bias, uncritically adopting a peer's view
or stubbornly adhering to their own prior output, undermining the reliability
of debate. In this work, we present the first principled framework that joins
sycophancy and self-bias to mitigate and quantify identity bias in MAD. First,
we formalize the debate dynamics as an identity-weighted Bayesian update
process. Second, we propose response anonymization: by removing identity
markers from prompts, agents cannot distinguish "self" from "peer", which
forces equal weights on agent identity, thereby reducing bias. Third, we define
the Identity Bias Coefficient (IBC), a principled metric that measures how
often an agent follows a peer versus itself. Empirical studies across multiple
models, datasets and debate rounds confirm that identity bias is widespread,
with sycophancy far more common than self-bias. Our findings highlight the need
to "mask" identity to ensure that MAD systems reason based on content rather
than source identity. Code is released in

TL;DR: Hybrid PII detection framework RECAP blends deterministic regex with context-aware LLMs to detect over 300 PII types across 13 low-resource locales, without retraining, achieving superior weighted F1 over baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PII detection in low-resource languages faces linguistic diversity and limited annotated data; scalable compliance tooling is needed.

Method: Three-phase refinement pipeline combining regular expressions and LLMs; modular design; disambiguation and filtering; supports 300 entity types without retraining.

Result: On nervaluate benchmark, RECAP outperforms fine-tuned NER models by 82% and zero-shot LLMs by 17% in weighted F1.

Conclusion: Offers scalable, adaptable, efficient PII detection for privacy-compliance focused applications.

Abstract: The detection of Personally Identifiable Information (PII) is critical for
privacy compliance but remains challenging in low-resource languages due to
linguistic diversity and limited annotated data. We present RECAP, a hybrid
framework that combines deterministic regular expressions with context-aware
large language models (LLMs) for scalable PII detection across 13 low-resource
locales. RECAP's modular design supports over 300 entity types without
retraining, using a three-phase refinement pipeline for disambiguation and
filtering. Benchmarked with nervaluate, our system outperforms fine-tuned NER
models by 82% and zero-shot LLMs by 17% in weighted F1-score. This work offers
a scalable and adaptable solution for efficient PII detection in
compliance-focused applications.

TL;DR: A position paper arguing for a unified, live, quality-controlled AI evaluation framework and introducing PeerBench, a community-governed proctored benchmark with sealed execution, rolling item banks, and delayed transparency to restore trustworthy progress measurement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI benchmarks suffer from contamination, selective reporting, and quality-control gaps, fueling hype and misleading progress; in high-stakes evaluation, credibility is required; AI's societal impact necessitates trustworthy measurement.

Method: Critical analysis of the evaluation ecosystem; distillation of essential requirements for trustworthy benchmarks; proposal of PeerBench as a blueprint featuring sealed execution, rolling renewal item banks, and delayed transparency; emphasis on community governance and proctoring.

Result: A conceptual blueprint for PeerBench; concrete design principles for robust evaluation; a pathway toward a unified benchmarking paradigm rather than ad hoc efforts.

Conclusion: Sustainable AI progress requires moving away from laissez-faire evaluation toward a unified, proctored, quality-controlled benchmarking framework; PeerBench represents a first step toward restoring integrity and credible AI progress measurement.

Abstract: The meteoric rise of Artificial Intelligence (AI), with its rapidly expanding
market capitalization, presents both transformative opportunities and critical
challenges. Chief among these is the urgent need for a new, unified paradigm
for trustworthy evaluation, as current benchmarks increasingly reveal critical
vulnerabilities. Issues like data contamination and selective reporting by
model developers fuel hype, while inadequate data quality control can lead to
biased evaluations that, even if unintentionally, may favor specific
approaches. As a flood of participants enters the AI space, this "Wild West" of
assessment makes distinguishing genuine progress from exaggerated claims
exceptionally difficult. Such ambiguity blurs scientific signals and erodes
public confidence, much as unchecked claims would destabilize financial markets
reliant on credible oversight from agencies like Moody's.
  In high-stakes human examinations (e.g., SAT, GRE), substantial effort is
devoted to ensuring fairness and credibility; why settle for less in evaluating
AI, especially given its profound societal impact? This position paper argues
that the current laissez-faire approach is unsustainable. We contend that true,
sustainable AI advancement demands a paradigm shift: a unified, live, and
quality-controlled benchmarking framework robust by construction, not by mere
courtesy and goodwill. To this end, we dissect the systemic flaws undermining
today's AI evaluation, distill the essential requirements for a new generation
of assessments, and introduce PeerBench, a community-governed, proctored
evaluation blueprint that embodies this paradigm through sealed execution, item
banking with rolling renewal, and delayed transparency. Our goal is to pave the
way for evaluations that can restore integrity and deliver genuinely
trustworthy measures of AI progress.

### [153] [AgentAsk: Multi-Agent Systems Need to Ask](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07593)
*Bohan Lin,Kuo Yang,Yingchuan Lai,Yudong Zhang,Chen Zhang,Guibin Zhang,Xinlei Yu,Miao Yu,Xu Wang,Yang Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AgentAsk is a plug-and-play clarification module for LLM-based multi-agent systems that targets edge-level error propagation with a three-stage pipeline and RL optimization, yielding accuracy gains with minimal overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Inter-agent handoffs in multi-agent LLM systems create edge-level error cascades that can undercut single-agent baselines. There is a need for scalable, architecture-agnostic interventions to arrest propagation without heavy costs.

Method: A three-stage pipeline: (i) distill edge-level judgments from curated failure traces into a compact policy; (ii) supervise the policy to decide when/what/whom/how to ask; (iii) online optimization with E-GRPO reinforcement learning that balances accuracy, latency, and cost. The module is architecture-agnostic and plug-in to existing orchestrations.

Result: Empirical evaluation on math, reasoning, and coding benchmarks shows AgentAsk improves accuracy and robustness over public multi-agent baselines with minimal overhead; latency and extra cost are under 5%, approaching the performance of a strong evaluator.

Conclusion: Provides a principled taxonomy of edge-level errors and a practical recipe for link-local intervention, offering a scalable path toward more reliable LLM-based multi-agent systems.

Abstract: Multi-agent systems built on large language models (LLMs) promise enhanced
problem-solving capabilities through collaborative division of labor. However,
they frequently underperform single-agent baselines due to edge-level error
cascades: minor inaccuracies at one message handoff propagate across the entire
chain. We propose AgentAsk, a lightweight and plug-and-play clarification
module that treats every inter-agent message as a potential failure point and
inserts minimally necessary questions to arrest error propagation. AgentAsk
follows a three-stage pipeline: (i) distilling edge-level judgments from
curated failure traces into a compact policy, (ii) supervising the policy to
determine when/what/whom/how to ask, and (iii) optimizing online with E-GRPO, a
reinforcement learning objective that balances accuracy, latency, and cost. The
module is architecture-agnostic and easy to integrate into existing
orchestration. Across math, reasoning, and coding benchmarks, AgentAsk
consistently improves accuracy and robustness over public multi-agent
implementations while keeping overhead minimal, with latency and extra cost all
less than 5%, approaching the performance of a strong evaluator. Beyond
empirical improvements, we contribute a principled taxonomy of edge-level
errors and a practical recipe for link-local intervention, offering a scalable
pathway toward more reliable LLM-based multi-agent systems.

### [154] [Traceability and Accountability in Role-Specialized Multi-Agent LLM Pipelines](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07614)
*Amine Barrak*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A traceable Planner -> Executor -> Critic pipeline with structured handoffs improves reliability and accountability in multi-agent LLM systems; error propagation is mitigated, but optimal design is task-dependent and heterogeneous pipelines often be more efficient.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Trust, accountability, and fault analysis in sequential LLM-driven workflows; existing pipelines suffer from silent error propagation across stages.

Method: Empirical evaluation of eight configurations across three LLMs and three benchmarks; analysis of where errors originate, how they propagate, and how repairs and harms accrue; comparison of accuracy, cost, and latency.

Result: Structured, accountable handoffs markedly improve accuracy and prevent cascading failures; each role shows distinct strengths/risks (planning vs. critique); heterogeneous pipelines can be more efficient in terms of accuracy-cost-latency trade-offs.

Conclusion: Provides a practical, data-driven framework for designing, tracing, and debugging reliable, predictable, and accountable multi-agent systems using a Planner -> Executor -> Critic paradigm.

Abstract: Sequential multi-agent systems built with large language models (LLMs) can
automate complex software tasks, but they are hard to trust because errors
quietly pass from one stage to the next. We study a traceable and accountable
pipeline, meaning a system with clear roles, structured handoffs, and saved
records that let us trace who did what at each step and assign blame when
things go wrong. Our setting is a Planner -> Executor -> Critic pipeline. We
evaluate eight configurations of three state-of-the-art LLMs on three
benchmarks and analyze where errors start, how they spread, and how they can be
fixed. Our results show: (1) adding a structured, accountable handoff between
agents markedly improves accuracy and prevents the failures common in simple
pipelines; (2) models have clear role-specific strengths and risks (e.g.,
steady planning vs. high-variance critiquing), which we quantify with repair
and harm rates; and (3) accuracy-cost-latency trade-offs are task-dependent,
with heterogeneous pipelines often the most efficient. Overall, we provide a
practical, data-driven method for designing, tracing, and debugging reliable,
predictable, and accountable multi-agent systems.

*Hannah R. Lawrence,Shannon Wiltsey Stirman,Samuel Dorison,Taedong Yun,Megan Jones Bell*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GenAI can enhance and scale training of mental health service providers, offering a lower-risk, high-impact use case beyond chatbots; a real-world case study shows improved training of veterans to support peers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is optimism about GenAI in mental health but also concerns; the dominant focus on chatbots overlooks training as a scalable, lower-risk application that could alleviate workforce shortages and improve care quality.

Method: A conceptual argument supported by a real-world case study demonstrating how GenAI was used to train veterans to support one another's mental health.

Result: GenAI-assisted training improved the training process for veterans, illustrating potential for scalable, effective mental health service provision training.

Conclusion: Invest in GenAI to support training of mental health providers; this approach may be lower-risk and high-impact, warranting further research and deployment efforts.

Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence (Generative AI) is transforming
healthcare. With this evolution comes optimism regarding the impact it will
have on mental health, as well as concern regarding the risks that come with
generative AI operating in the mental health domain. Much of the investment in,
and academic and public discourse about, AI-powered solutions for mental health
has focused on therapist chatbots. Despite the common assumption that chatbots
will be the most impactful application of GenAI to mental health, we make the
case here for a lower-risk, high impact use case: leveraging generative AI to
enhance and scale training in mental health service provision. We highlight key
benefits of using generative AI to help train people to provide mental health
services and present a real-world case study in which generative AI improved
the training of veterans to support one another's mental health. With numerous
potential applications of generative AI in mental health, we illustrate why we
should invest in using generative AI to support training people in mental
health service provision.

*Yinglun Zhu,Jiancheng Zhang,Fuzhi Tang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Standard metrics underestimate compositional reasoning; introduce group matching score and Test-Time Matching (TTM) to reveal and boost hidden capabilities, achieving state-of-the-art results across multiple datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Metric biases hide true model capabilities; need group-structure-aware metrics and self-improvement methods to better assess and enhance compositional reasoning in VLMs/MLLMs.

Method: Develop group matching score to exploit group structure; demonstrate overfitting to group matchings transfers hidden capabilities; propose Test-Time Matching (TTM), an iterative self-improving loop that bootstraps performance without extra supervision.

Result: SigLIP-B16 exceeds prior results; GPT-4.1 surpasses estimated human performance on Winoground; TTM yields further gains, e.g., SigLIP-B16 beats GPT-4.1 on MMVP-VLM; up to 85.7% relative gains on WhatsUp; consistent improvements across 16 datasets.

Conclusion: Adjusting evaluation metrics and introducing test-time self-improvement can uncover and elevate compositional reasoning capabilities, pushing the frontier of VLM/MLLM performance.

Abstract: Frontier AI models have achieved remarkable progress, yet recent studies
suggest they struggle with compositional reasoning, often performing at or
below random chance on established benchmarks. We revisit this problem and show
that widely used evaluation metrics systematically underestimate model
capability. To address this, we introduce a group matching score that better
exploits group structure and reveals substantial hidden capability in both
contrastive vision-language models (VLMs) and multimodal large language models
(MLLMs). Moreover, simply overfitting to the induced group matchings at test
time transfers this hidden capability into higher scores under standard
evaluation metrics, closing much of the reported gap. This adjustment enables
SigLIP-B16 to surpass all previous results and GPT-4.1 to yield the first
result surpassing estimated human performance on Winoground.
  Building on this insight, we propose Test-Time Matching (TTM), an iterative,
self-improving algorithm that further bootstraps model performance without any
external supervision. TTM delivers additional, non-trivial improvements: for
example, TTM enables SigLIP-B16 to surpass GPT-4.1 on MMVP-VLM, establishing a
new state of the art. Importantly, TTM remains broadly effective even on
benchmarks without metric-induced effects or group structures, achieving
relative gains up to 85.7% on challenging datasets such as WhatsUp. Across 16
dataset variants spanning diverse setups, our experiments demonstrate that TTM
consistently improves model performance and advances the frontier of
compositional reasoning.

### [157] [Safely Exploring Novel Actions in Recommender Systems via Deployment-Efficient Policy Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07635)
*Haruka Kiyohara,Yusuke Narita,Yuta Saito,Kei Tateno,Takuma Udagawa*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A framework to safely explore novel actions in off-policy learning for recommender systems. It introduces Safe OPG (model-free, safety-guaranteed via high-confidence off-policy evaluation) and a Deployment-Efficient policy learning framework that gradually relaxes safety constraints across deployments to balance safety with exploration of novel items.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In dynamic recommender systems, novel items appear frequently and presenting them is important for long-term engagement. Off-policy learning can exploit logged data but poses safety risks when initiating or exploring novel actions; there is a need for guarantees that exploration does not harm user experience.

Method: 1) Safe Off-Policy Policy Gradient (Safe OPG): a model-free safe off-policy learning method using high-confidence off-policy evaluation to enforce safety. 2) Deployment-Efficient Policy Learning for Safe User Exploration: a framework that uses safety margins and gradually relaxes safety regularization across multiple limited deployments to enable exploration while maintaining safety.

Result: Safe OPG almost always satisfies the safety requirement, outperforming unsafe baselines in safety but at times being overly conservative. The deployment framework successfully enables exploration of novel actions by incrementally relaxing safety constraints across deployments, achieving a balance between safety and exploration.

Conclusion: There is a tradeoff between guaranteeing safety and exploring novel actions in off-policy learning for recommender systems. The proposed deployment-efficient framework provides a practical path to safely explore novel items while maintaining safe deployments, addressing the safety-exploration balance.

Abstract: In many real recommender systems, novel items are added frequently over time.
The importance of sufficiently presenting novel actions has widely been
acknowledged for improving long-term user engagement. A recent work builds on
Off-Policy Learning (OPL), which trains a policy from only logged data,
however, the existing methods can be unsafe in the presence of novel actions.
Our goal is to develop a framework to enforce exploration of novel actions with
a guarantee for safety. To this end, we first develop Safe Off-Policy Policy
Gradient (Safe OPG), which is a model-free safe OPL method based on a high
confidence off-policy evaluation. In our first experiment, we observe that Safe
OPG almost always satisfies a safety requirement, even when existing methods
violate it greatly. However, the result also reveals that Safe OPG tends to be
too conservative, suggesting a difficult tradeoff between guaranteeing safety
and exploring novel actions. To overcome this tradeoff, we also propose a novel
framework called Deployment-Efficient Policy Learning for Safe User
Exploration, which leverages safety margin and gradually relaxes safety
regularization during multiple (not many) deployments. Our framework thus
enables exploration of novel actions while guaranteeing safe implementation of
recommender systems.

*Alhim Vera,Karen Sanchez,Carlos Hinojosa,Haidar Bin Hamid,Donghoon Kim,Bernard Ghanem*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A reproducible simulation framework evaluates multimodal agent safety in text-visual settings along three axes: safety improvement over time, unsafe activity detection, and social dynamics. Across eight runs and multiple models, agents show partial success in converting unsafe plans to safe ones, with notable overtrust of misleading visuals; the work reveals current architectural gaps and offers a platform for multimodal safety research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address gaps in reliably evaluating and improving trust, safety, and coherence of autonomous, multimodal agents. The work aims to provide a reproducible framework and metrics (SocialMetrics) to study safety evolution, unsafe-to-safe conversions, and information diffusion across social networks.

Method: Introduce a simulation framework with layered memory, dynamic planning, and multimodal perception. Equip agents with SocialMetrics to quantify plan revisions, unsafe-to-safe conversions, and diffusion. Evaluate across eight runs with three model families (Claude, GPT-4o mini, Qwen-VL) using five agents, in scenarios that span safety and social dynamics.

Result: Agents can detect direct multimodal contradictions but struggle to align local revisions with global safety (55% success in correcting unsafe plans). Unsafe-to-safe conversion rates: Claude ~75%, GPT-4o mini ~55%, Qwen-VL ~58%. Overall performance ranges from 20% (multi-risk with GPT-4o mini) to 98% (localized fire/heat with Claude). Approximately 45% of unsafe actions are accepted when visuals are misleading, indicating a tendency to overtrust images.

Conclusion: Current architectures exhibit significant limitations in cross-modal safety alignment and resistance to misleading visuals. The reproducible framework provides a valuable platform for studying multimodal safety, coherence, and social dynamics, and highlights the need for improvements to reduce overtrust of visuals and ensure consistency between local plan revisions and global safety.

Abstract: Can generative agents be trusted in multimodal environments? Despite advances
in large language and vision-language models that enable agents to act
autonomously and pursue goals in rich settings, their ability to reason about
safety, coherence, and trust across modalities remains limited. We introduce a
reproducible simulation framework for evaluating agents along three dimensions:
(1) safety improvement over time, including iterative plan revisions in
text-visual scenarios; (2) detection of unsafe activities across multiple
categories of social situations; and (3) social dynamics, measured as
interaction counts and acceptance ratios of social exchanges. Agents are
equipped with layered memory, dynamic planning, multimodal perception, and are
instrumented with SocialMetrics, a suite of behavioral and structural metrics
that quantifies plan revisions, unsafe-to-safe conversions, and information
diffusion across networks. Experiments show that while agents can detect direct
multimodal contradictions, they often fail to align local revisions with global
safety, reaching only a 55 percent success rate in correcting unsafe plans.
Across eight simulation runs with three models - Claude, GPT-4o mini, and
Qwen-VL - five agents achieved average unsafe-to-safe conversion rates of 75,
55, and 58 percent, respectively. Overall performance ranged from 20 percent in
multi-risk scenarios with GPT-4o mini to 98 percent in localized contexts such
as fire/heat with Claude. Notably, 45 percent of unsafe actions were accepted
when paired with misleading visuals, showing a strong tendency to overtrust
images. These findings expose critical limitations in current architectures and
provide a reproducible platform for studying multimodal safety, coherence, and
social dynamics.

*Xiaochen Tang,Zhenya Zhang,Miaomiao Zhang,Jie An*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Online STL-guided RL with differentiable online causation semantics for real-time CPS control, addressing sparse global rewards by emitting per-step, smooth rewards through online STL monitoring.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Guarantee real-time safety-critical behavior in CPS while leveraging reinforcement learning; STL expresses temporal constraints and provides quantitative satisfaction measures; existing STL-guided RL suffers from sparse, nonlocal rewards leading to unstable training.

Method: Introduce online causation monitoring that, at each control step, evaluates distance to STL satisfaction/violation and yields per-step rewards. Provide a smooth differentiable approximation of causation semantics to enable gradient-based RL. Implement a prototype and evaluate on Gym benchmarks against other STL-guided RL methods.

Result: The STL-guided RL with online causation semantics outperforms existing STL-guided RL methods in experiments, yielding more robust and efficient reward generation and improved training stability/performance.

Conclusion: Online causation-based STL monitoring coupled with differentiable reward signals is a promising approach for robust deep-RL in CPS; enables fine-grained, real-time feedback and may generalize across benchmarks; future work could explore scalability and broader CPS scenarios.

Abstract: In real-time and safety-critical cyber-physical systems (CPSs), control
synthesis must guarantee that generated policies meet stringent timing and
correctness requirements under uncertain and dynamic conditions. Signal
temporal logic (STL) has emerged as a powerful formalism of expressing
real-time constraints, with its semantics enabling quantitative assessment of
system behavior. Meanwhile, reinforcement learning (RL) has become an important
method for solving control synthesis problems in unknown environments. Recent
studies incorporate STL-based reward functions into RL to automatically
synthesize control policies. However, the automatically inferred rewards
obtained by these methods represent the global assessment of a whole or partial
path but do not accumulate the rewards of local changes accurately, so the
sparse global rewards may lead to non-convergence and unstable training
performances. In this paper, we propose an online reward generation method
guided by the online causation monitoring of STL. Our approach continuously
monitors system behavior against an STL specification at each control step,
computing the quantitative distance toward satisfaction or violation and
thereby producing rewards that reflect instantaneous state dynamics.
Additionally, we provide a smooth approximation of the causation semantics to
overcome the discontinuity of the causation semantics and make it
differentiable for using deep-RL methods. We have implemented a prototype tool
and evaluated it in the Gym environment on a variety of continuously controlled
benchmarks. Experimental results show that our proposed STL-guided RL method
with online causation semantics outperforms existing relevant STL-guided RL
methods, providing a more robust and efficient reward generation framework for
deep-RL.

TL;DR: Introduces oMeBench, the first expert-curated, large-scale benchmark for organic mechanism reasoning, with 10k+ annotated mechanistic steps, including intermediates, type labels, and difficulty ratings. Proposes oMeS, a dynamic evaluation framework that combines step-level logic and chemical similarity. Found that current LLMs show promising chemical intuition but struggle with consistent multi-step reasoning; prompting strategies and fine-tuning a specialist model yield ~50% accuracy gains over the leading closed-source model. Aims to provide a rigorous foundation for advancing AI-driven chemical reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a gap between apparent chemical intuition in LLMs and genuine, reliable organic mechanism reasoning. A large, expert-curated benchmark and a fine-grained evaluation framework are needed to assess and drive improvements in stepwise, chemically valid reasoning.

Method: Constructed oMeBench with over 10,000 annotated mechanistic steps (including intermediates, type labels, and difficulty ratings). Developed oMeS as a dynamic evaluation framework that blends step-level logical correctness with chemical similarity metrics. Evaluated state-of-the-art LLMs; explored prompting strategies and fine-tuning a specialist model on the dataset to measure improvements.

Result: Current LLMs exhibit promising chemical intuition but struggle with correct and consistent multi-step reasoning. Prompting strategies and fine-tuning a specialist model on oMeBench data improve performance by about 50% over the leading closed-source model.

Conclusion: oMeBench and oMeS offer a rigorous foundation for advancing AI systems toward genuine chemical reasoning in organic chemistry.

Abstract: Organic reaction mechanisms are the stepwise elementary reactions by which
reactants form intermediates and products, and are fundamental to understanding
chemical reactivity and designing new molecules and reactions. Although large
language models (LLMs) have shown promise in understanding chemical tasks such
as synthesis design, it is unclear to what extent this reflects genuine
chemical reasoning capabilities, i.e., the ability to generate valid
intermediates, maintain chemical consistency, and follow logically coherent
multi-step pathways. We address this by introducing oMeBench, the first
large-scale, expert-curated benchmark for organic mechanism reasoning in
organic chemistry. It comprises over 10,000 annotated mechanistic steps with
intermediates, type labels, and difficulty ratings. Furthermore, to evaluate
LLM capability more precisely and enable fine-grained scoring, we propose oMeS,
a dynamic evaluation framework that combines step-level logic and chemical
similarity. We analyze the performance of state-of-the-art LLMs, and our
results show that although current models display promising chemical intuition,
they struggle with correct and consistent multi-step reasoning. Notably, we
find that using prompting strategy and fine-tuning a specialist model on our
proposed dataset increases performance by 50% over the leading closed-source
model. We hope that oMeBench will serve as a rigorous foundation for advancing
AI systems toward genuine chemical reasoning.

### [161] [SurveyG: A Multi-Agent LLM Framework with Hierarchical Citation Graph for Automated Survey Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07733)
*Minh-Anh Nguye,Minh-Duc Nguyen,Nguyen Thi Ha Lan,Kieu Hai Dang,Nguyen Tien Dong,Le Duy Dung*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SurveyG is an LLM-based agent framework that uses a hierarchical citation graph to generate structured, multi-level survey summaries and employs multi-agent validation; it outperforms baselines in coherence and taxonomy alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing auto-survey methods rely on extracting content from related papers and prompting LLMs, but they miss structural relationships among papers, leading to surveys with weak taxonomy and limited contextual understanding of progress. There is a need to embed structural and contextual knowledge to improve coherence and coverage.

Method: Build a hierarchical citation graph with three layers (Foundation, Development, Frontier). Nodes are papers; edges capture both citation dependencies and semantic relatedness. Use horizontal search within layers and vertical depth traversal across layers to produce multi-level summaries. Consolidate into a structured survey outline. Apply a multi-agent validation stage to ensure consistency, coverage, and factual accuracy before final generation.

Result: Empirical evaluations including human expert assessments and LLM-as-a-judge show SurveyG yields more comprehensive surveys with better structure, aligned to the underlying knowledge taxonomy compared to state-of-the-art frameworks.

Conclusion: Integrating hierarchical structure and multi-agent validation enables more coherent, context-aware surveys that reflect the evolution of a field and improve coverage and factual accuracy.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly adopted for automating survey
paper generation \cite{wang2406autosurvey, liang2025surveyx,
yan2025surveyforge,su2025benchmarking,wen2025interactivesurvey}. Existing
approaches typically extract content from a large collection of related papers
and prompt LLMs to summarize them directly. However, such methods often
overlook the structural relationships among papers, resulting in generated
surveys that lack a coherent taxonomy and a deeper contextual understanding of
research progress. To address these shortcomings, we propose \textbf{SurveyG},
an LLM-based agent framework that integrates \textit{hierarchical citation
graph}, where nodes denote research papers and edges capture both citation
dependencies and semantic relatedness between their contents, thereby embedding
structural and contextual knowledge into the survey generation process. The
graph is organized into three layers: \textbf{Foundation},
\textbf{Development}, and \textbf{Frontier}, to capture the evolution of
research from seminal works to incremental advances and emerging directions. By
combining horizontal search within layers and vertical depth traversal across
layers, the agent produces multi-level summaries, which are consolidated into a
structured survey outline. A multi-agent validation stage then ensures
consistency, coverage, and factual accuracy in generating the final survey.
Experiments, including evaluations by human experts and LLM-as-a-judge,
demonstrate that SurveyG outperforms state-of-the-art frameworks, producing
surveys that are more comprehensive and better structured to the underlying
knowledge taxonomy of a field.

### [162] [Haibu Mathematical-Medical Intelligent Agent:Enhancing Large Language Model Reliability in Medical Tasks via Verifiable Reasoning Chains](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07748)
*Yilun Zhang,Dexing Kong*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A verifiable, bootstrapped LLM architecture (MMIA) for medical tasks that audits reasoning, uses retrieved evidence, and stores validated chains as 'theorems' to enable cost-efficient RAG; achieves high error-detection, low false positives, with projected cost savings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-stakes medical AI demands reliability, factual correctness, and explainability. Standard LLMs exhibit factual/logical errors and opaque reasoning, hindering clinical trust and safety. The paper seeks a formally verifiable, auditable reasoning framework for medical administration tasks.

Method: MMIA recursively decomposes complex tasks into atomic, evidence-based steps. The entire reasoning chain is audited for logical coherence and evidence traceability (theorem-proving style). A bootstrapping mode stores validated chains as 'theorems'. Subsequent tasks leverage Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to use the knowledge base for verification rather than expensive first-principles reasoning, reducing cost.

Result: MMIA achieved an error-detection rate >98% with a false-positive rate <1% across four healthcare administration tasks (e.g., DRG/DIP audits, medical insurance adjudication), outperforming baseline LLMs. RAG matching mode is projected to cut average processing costs by ~85% as the knowledge base matures.

Conclusion: The verifiable reasoning framework enhances trust, transparency, and cost-effectiveness of LLMs in critical medical applications, making AI-assisted medicine more viable.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) show promise in medicine but are prone to
factual and logical errors, which is unacceptable in this high-stakes field. To
address this, we introduce the "Haibu Mathematical-Medical Intelligent Agent"
(MMIA), an LLM-driven architecture that ensures reliability through a formally
verifiable reasoning process. MMIA recursively breaks down complex medical
tasks into atomic, evidence-based steps. This entire reasoning chain is then
automatically audited for logical coherence and evidence traceability, similar
to theorem proving. A key innovation is MMIA's "bootstrapping" mode, which
stores validated reasoning chains as "theorems." Subsequent tasks can then be
efficiently solved using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), shifting from
costly first-principles reasoning to a low-cost verification model. We
validated MMIA across four healthcare administration domains, including DRG/DIP
audits and medical insurance adjudication, using expert-validated benchmarks.
Results showed MMIA achieved an error detection rate exceeding 98% with a false
positive rate below 1%, significantly outperforming baseline LLMs. Furthermore,
the RAG matching mode is projected to reduce average processing costs by
approximately 85% as the knowledge base matures. In conclusion, MMIA's
verifiable reasoning framework is a significant step toward creating
trustworthy, transparent, and cost-effective AI systems, making LLM technology
viable for critical applications in medicine.

### [163] [From Noisy to Native: LLM-driven Graph Restoration for Test-Time Graph Domain Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07762)
*Xiangwei Lv,JinLuan Yang,Wang Lin,Jingyuan Chen,Beishui Liao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GRAIL proposes a test-time graph domain adaptation framework that uses an LLM-based generative restorer to convert a target graph into a source-domain-like graph without accessing source data, employing latent feature compression, graph diffusion restoration, discrete tokenization, and RL-guided fine-tuning; validated on multiple datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Source-domain data are often unavailable due to privacy/security concerns, which hampers traditional TT-GDA. The work seeks to leverage the generative power of LLMs to restore a target graph into a native, source-like state at test time, bridging the domain gap without source examples.

Method: Encode target graphs into compact latent representations; apply a graph diffusion process to model the restoration; quantize restored features into discrete tokens; fine-tune an LLM as a generative restorer to transform a noisy target graph into a native, source-like graph; use reinforcement learning with alignment and confidence rewards to further improve restoration quality.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate the framework's effectiveness across various datasets, indicating improved restoration and downstream performance without source data.

Conclusion: Framing TT-GDA as a generative graph restoration problem enables privacy-preserving domain adaptation. Leveraging LLMs to reconstruct source-like graphs at test time bridges modality gaps and opens new directions for graph learning under data privacy constraints.

Abstract: Graph domain adaptation (GDA) has achieved great attention due to its
effectiveness in addressing the domain shift between train and test data. A
significant bottleneck in existing graph domain adaptation methods is their
reliance on source-domain data, which is often unavailable due to privacy or
security concerns. This limitation has driven the development of Test-Time
Graph Domain Adaptation (TT-GDA), which aims to transfer knowledge without
accessing the source examples. Inspired by the generative power of large
language models (LLMs), we introduce a novel framework that reframes TT-GDA as
a generative graph restoration problem, "restoring the target graph to its
pristine, source-domain-like state". There are two key challenges: (1) We need
to construct a reasonable graph restoration process and design an effective
encoding scheme that an LLM can understand, bridging the modality gap. (2) We
need to devise a mechanism to ensure the restored graph acquires the intrinsic
features of the source domain, even without access to the source data. To
ensure the effectiveness of graph restoration, we propose GRAIL, that restores
the target graph into a state that is well-aligned with the source domain.
Specifically, we first compress the node representations into compact latent
features and then use a graph diffusion process to model the graph restoration
process. Then a quantization module encodes the restored features into discrete
tokens. Building on this, an LLM is fine-tuned as a generative restorer to
transform a "noisy" target graph into a "native" one. To further improve
restoration quality, we introduce a reinforcement learning process guided by
specialized alignment and confidence rewards. Extensive experiments demonstrate
the effectiveness of our approach across various datasets.

*Tianle Zhou,Jiakai Xu,Guanhong Liu,Jiaxiang Liu,Haonan Wang,Eugene Wu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ACONIC is a constraint-based, complexity-guided decomposition framework for LLM tasks that improves reliability on complex tasks by decomposing tasks according to formal complexity measures; shows 10-40pp gains on SATBench and Spider.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM decompositions are heuristic and manual; reliability drops on complex tasks; need principled, scalable decomposition guided by formal measures.

Method: Model tasks as constraint satisfaction problems; apply formal complexity metrics to determine decomposition strategy; evaluate on SATBench (combinatorial) and Spider (LLM DB querying).

Result: Decomposing tasks following the complexity measure yields substantial performance gains (10-40 percentage points) compared to baseline heuristic approaches.

Conclusion: ACONIC provides a principled framework for decomposition of complex tasks in LLM workflows; suggests broader applicability and potential improvements in reliability; future work could explore other complexity measures and domains.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) suffer from reliability issues on complex tasks,
as existing decomposition methods are heuristic and rely on agent or manual
decomposition. This work introduces a novel, systematic decomposition framework
that we call Analysis of CONstraint-Induced Complexity (ACONIC), which models
the task as a constraint problem and leveraging formal complexity measures to
guide decomposition. On combinatorial (SATBench) and LLM database querying
tasks (Spider), we find that by decomposing the tasks following the measure of
complexity, agent can perform considerably better (10-40 percentage point).

### [165] [GCPO: When Contrast Fails, Go Gold](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07790)
*Hao Wu,Wei Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GCPO harnesses external reference answers to guide reinforcement learning for LLM reasoning, improving sample efficiency and generalization by using correct solutions when the model errs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RL methods for LLMs (e.g., GRPO) bound a model's rollout performance to its own capabilities, preventing leverage of samples that are all incorrect or all correct. There is a need to incorporate external standard answers to steer learning and enhance reasoning on smaller models.

Method: Group Contrastive Policy Optimization (GCPO) integrates external reference answers into training. When the model cannot solve a problem, the reference provides the correct response to steer updates. It uses contrastive signals to align the model's reasoning with the reference strategy, enabling full use of every sample and mimicking the reference's problem-solving approach during training.

Result: GCPO achieves outstanding improvements over baselines across multiple benchmark datasets, demonstrating stronger reasoning performance for smaller models. The authors provide code at https://github.com/AchoWu/GCPO.

Conclusion: GCPO effectively leverages external reference answers to improve training efficiency and generalization in RL-based reasoning for LLMs, addressing the upper-bound limitation of prior methods and enhancing overall performance.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning has been widely applied to enhance the reasoning
capabilities of large language models. Extending the inference limits of
smaller models has become a prominent research focus. However, algorithms such
as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) suffer from a clear drawback: the
upper bound of a model's rollout responses is entirely determined by the model
itself, preventing the acquisition of knowledge from samples that are either
all incorrect or all correct. In this paper, we introduce Group Contrastive
Policy Optimization (GCPO), a method that incorporates external standard
reference answers. When the model cannot solve a problem, the reference answer
supplies the correct response, steering the model toward an unequivocally
accurate update direction. This approach offers two main advantages: (1) it
improves training efficiency by fully utilizing every sample; (2) it enables
the model to emulate the problem solving strategy of the reference answer
during training, thereby enhancing generalization in reasoning. GCPO achieves
outstanding results across multiple benchmark datasets, yielding substantial
improvements over the baseline model. Our code is available at:

### [166] [Strategic Communication under Threat: Learning Information Trade-offs in Pursuit-Evasion Games](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07813)
*Valerio La Gatta,Dolev Mutzari,Sarit Kraus,VS Subrahmanian*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces SHADOW, a multi-headed RL framework for a Pursuit-Evasion-Exposure-Concealment (PEEC) game where a pursuer learns when to communicate to obtain the evader's position while balancing risk from revealing its own location.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In adversarial environments, information gathering improves situational awareness but also increases exposure to threats. The work formalizes this trade-off in a Pursuit-Evasion-Exposure-Concealment setting and aims to learn risk-aware communication and navigation policies.

Method: Formulate PEEC as a multi-agent RL problem. Train both pursuer and evader policies; the pursuer also learns a discrete communication policy. Introduce SHADOW (Strategic-communication Hybrid Action Decision-making under partial Observation for Warfare), a multi-headed sequential RL architecture that integrates continuous navigation control, discrete communication actions, and opponent modeling for behavior prediction.

Result: Empirical evaluations show SHADOW pursuers achieve higher success rates than six competitive baselines. Ablation studies indicate temporal sequence modeling and opponent modeling are critical. Sensitivity analysis demonstrates policies generalize across varying communication risks and physical asymmetries between agents.

Conclusion: SHADOW provides an effective framework for strategic communication under partial observability in adversarial settings, achieving superior performance and robustness to risk and asymmetry; the findings highlight the importance of temporal modeling and opponent prediction in joint navigation-communication policies.

Abstract: Adversarial environments require agents to navigate a key strategic
trade-off: acquiring information enhances situational awareness, but may
simultaneously expose them to threats. To investigate this tension, we
formulate a PursuitEvasion-Exposure-Concealment Game (PEEC) in which a pursuer
agent must decide when to communicate in order to obtain the evader's position.
Each communication reveals the pursuer's location, increasing the risk of being
targeted. Both agents learn their movement policies via reinforcement learning,
while the pursuer additionally learns a communication policy that balances
observability and risk. We propose SHADOW (Strategic-communication Hybrid
Action Decision-making under partial Observation for Warfare), a multi-headed
sequential reinforcement learning framework that integrates continuous
navigation control, discrete communication actions, and opponent modeling for
behavior prediction. Empirical evaluations show that SHADOW pursuers achieve
higher success rates than six competitive baselines. Our ablation study
confirms that temporal sequence modeling and opponent modeling are critical for
effective decision-making. Finally, our sensitivity analysis reveals that the
learned policies generalize well across varying communication risks and
physical asymmetries between agents.

### [167] [An LLM-Powered Cooperative Framework for Large-Scale Multi-Vehicle Navigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07825)
*Yuping Zhou,Siqi Lai,Jindong Han,Hao Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CityNav proposes a hierarchical, LLM-powered multi-vehicle navigation framework combining a global traffic allocation agent and local navigators with a cooperative dual-reward training objective to scale city-wide routing; it outperforms baselines on large-scale road networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Scale multi-vehicle routing to city-scale networks and capture nonlinear, stochastic, and coupled urban traffic dynamics to improve travel efficiency and reduce congestion.

Method: A hierarchical architecture with a global traffic allocation agent coordinating regional flow and local navigation agents generating routes aligned with global directives; a cooperative reasoning optimization with a dual-reward structure (individual rewards for per-vehicle efficiency, shared rewards for network-wide coordination).

Result: Extensive experiments on four real-world road networks up to 1.6 million roads and 430k intersections show CityNav consistently outperforms nine classical path search and RL baselines in city-scale travel efficiency and congestion mitigation.

Conclusion: LLMs enable scalable, adaptive, and cooperative city-wide traffic navigation, offering a foundation for intelligent, large-scale vehicle routing; project code is available on GitHub.

Abstract: The rise of Internet of Vehicles (IoV) technologies is transforming traffic
management from isolated control to a collective, multi-vehicle process. At the
heart of this shift is multi-vehicle dynamic navigation, which requires
simultaneously routing large fleets under evolving traffic conditions. Existing
path search algorithms and reinforcement learning methods struggle to scale to
city-wide networks, often failing to capture the nonlinear, stochastic, and
coupled dynamics of urban traffic. To address these challenges, we propose
CityNav, a hierarchical, LLM-powered framework for large-scale multi-vehicle
navigation. CityNav integrates a global traffic allocation agent, which
coordinates strategic traffic flow distribution across regions, with local
navigation agents that generate locally adaptive routes aligned with global
directives. To enable effective cooperation, we introduce a cooperative
reasoning optimization mechanism, in which agents are jointly trained with a
dual-reward structure: individual rewards promote per-vehicle efficiency, while
shared rewards encourage network-wide coordination and congestion reduction.
Extensive experiments on four real-world road networks of varying scales (up to
1.6 million roads and 430,000 intersections) and traffic datasets demonstrate
that CityNav consistently outperforms nine classical path search and RL-based
baselines in city-scale travel efficiency and congestion mitigation. Our
results highlight the potential of LLMs to enable scalable, adaptive, and
cooperative city-wide traffic navigation, providing a foundation for
intelligent, large-scale vehicle routing in complex urban environments. Our
project is available at https://github.com/usail-hkust/CityNav.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: FinMR introduces a 3.2k+ multimodal finance QA dataset across 15 topics to benchmark expert‑level financial reasoning in multimodal LLMs; initial results show MLLMs lag professional analysts, highlighting targeted gaps and directions for improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a shortage of high-quality, knowledge‑intensive, multimodal finance benchmarks that assess professional-level reasoning. FinMR addresses this gap by providing a dataset designed to measure expert financial analysis capabilities in real-world settings.

Method: Dataset construction with expert annotation: over 3,200 QA pairs across 15 financial topics, incorporating diverse image types and tasks requiring advanced mathematical reasoning, financial knowledge, and nuanced visual interpretation. Benchmarking conducted with leading closed‑source and open‑source MLLMs.

Result: Benchmarking reveals substantial gaps between MLLMs and professional financial analysts. Models struggle with precise image analysis, correct application of complex financial formulas, and deep contextual financial understanding.

Conclusion: FinMR serves as an essential benchmark to assess and push multimodal financial reasoning toward professional analyst‑level competence, guiding future model development and evaluation in finance.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have made substantial progress in
recent years. However, their rigorous evaluation within specialized domains
like finance is hindered by the absence of datasets characterized by
professional-level knowledge intensity, detailed annotations, and advanced
reasoning complexity. To address this critical gap, we introduce FinMR, a
high-quality, knowledge-intensive multimodal dataset explicitly designed to
evaluate expert-level financial reasoning capabilities at a professional
analyst's standard. FinMR comprises over 3,200 meticulously curated and
expertly annotated question-answer pairs across 15 diverse financial topics,
ensuring broad domain diversity and integrating sophisticated mathematical
reasoning, advanced financial knowledge, and nuanced visual interpretation
tasks across multiple image types. Through comprehensive benchmarking with
leading closed-source and open-source MLLMs, we highlight significant
performance disparities between these models and professional financial
analysts, uncovering key areas for model advancement, such as precise image
analysis, accurate application of complex financial formulas, and deeper
contextual financial understanding. By providing richly varied visual content
and thorough explanatory annotations, FinMR establishes itself as an essential
benchmark tool for assessing and advancing multimodal financial reasoning
toward professional analyst-level competence.

*Zhiqing Cui,Binwu Wang,Qingxiang Liu,Yeqiang Wang,Zhengyang Zhou,Yuxuan Liang,Yang Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Augur is a fully LLM-driven time series forecasting framework that uses a teacher-student setup to perform causal discovery and forecasting, achieving competitive accuracy and strong interpretability and zero-shot generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-based time series forecasting often underutilizes causal reasoning, relies on coarse prompts, and lacks interpretability; there is a need for explicit causal structure to connect covariates and improve generalization.

Method: A two-stage teacher-student architecture: a powerful teacher LLM infers a directed causal graph from time series using heuristic search and pairwise causality testing; a lightweight student refines the graph and encodes high-confidence causal associations as rich textual prompts to perform forecasting.

Result: Empirical evaluation on real-world datasets shows competitive performance against 25 baselines, with robust zero-shot generalization and transparent, traceable variable interactions.

Conclusion: Fully LLM-driven forecasting with explicit causal reasoning can achieve accurate predictions while providing interpretable insights, highlighting a viable path for multimodal time series analysis.

Abstract: Large language models (LLM) have emerged as a promising avenue for time
series forecasting, offering the potential to integrate multimodal data.
However, existing LLM-based approaches face notable limitations-such as
marginalized role in model architectures, reliance on coarse statistical text
prompts, and lack of interpretability. In this work, we introduce Augur, a
fully LLM driven time series forecasting framework that exploits LLM causal
reasoning to discover and use directed causal associations among covariates.
Augur uses a two stage teacher student architecture where a powerful teacher
LLM infers a directed causal graph from time series using heuristic search
together with pairwise causality testing. A lightweight student agent then
refines the graph and fine tune on high confidence causal associations that are
encoded as rich textual prompts to perform forecasting. This design improves
predictive accuracy while yielding transparent, traceable reasoning about
variable interactions. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets with 25
baselines demonstrate that Augur achieves competitive performance and robust
zero-shot generalization.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Introduces DeepResearch-ReportEval, a holistic evaluation framework and benchmark for DeepResearch systems, measuring the quality, redundancy, and factuality of research reports through an LLM-as-a-Judge, with 100 queries across 12 real-world categories and evaluation of four commercial systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Evaluating open-ended, holistic research outputs is difficult. Existing benchmarks focus on isolated capabilities and do not capture the synthesis, insight generation, and factual accuracy required for credible research reports.

Method: Three-dimensional evaluation (quality, redundancy, factuality) using an LLM-as-a-Judge with expert concordance; standardized benchmark of 100 curated queries across 12 real-world categories; comparative evaluation of four leading commercial systems; release of source code and data.

Result: Shows distinct design philosophies and performance trade-offs among the evaluated systems; provides foundational insights for evolving DeepResearch from information assistants to intelligent research partners; demonstrates strong expert concordance in judgments.

Conclusion: The framework and benchmark offer foundational tools to evaluate and guide the development of DeepResearch systems toward reliable, holistic research capabilities, with public release of code and data to enable reproducibility and community-driven improvement.

Abstract: DeepResearch agents represent a transformative AI paradigm, conducting
expert-level research through sophisticated reasoning and multi-tool
integration. However, evaluating these systems remains critically challenging
due to open-ended research scenarios and existing benchmarks that focus on
isolated capabilities rather than holistic performance. Unlike traditional LLM
tasks, DeepResearch systems must synthesize diverse sources, generate insights,
and present coherent findings, which are capabilities that resist simple
verification. To address this gap, we introduce DeepResearch-ReportEval, a
comprehensive framework designed to assess DeepResearch systems through their
most representative outputs: research reports. Our approach systematically
measures three dimensions: quality, redundancy, and factuality, using an
innovative LLM-as-a-Judge methodology achieving strong expert concordance. We
contribute a standardized benchmark of 100 curated queries spanning 12
real-world categories, enabling systematic capability comparison. Our
evaluation of four leading commercial systems reveals distinct design
philosophies and performance trade-offs, establishing foundational insights as
DeepResearch evolves from information assistants toward intelligent research
partners. Source code and data are available at:

*Dave Murray-Rust,Kars Alfrink,Cristina Zaga*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Meaningful transparency links human-centered AI transparency with socio-technical analysis to empower publics to understand and act on civic AI decisions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI in government can be biased and reduce citizen agency; existing transparency emphasizes technical artifacts and misses socio-material context and actionability.

Method: Conceptual development by integrating human-centric transparency with socio-technical systems theory to define 'meaningful transparency' for civic AI.

Result: A framework for transparent civic AI that enables public engagement and connects understanding to potential actions.

Conclusion: Meaningful transparency can improve legitimacy, accountability, and participation in governance AI by aligning explanations with real-world contexts and avenues for action.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence has become a part of the provision of governmental
services, from making decisions about benefits to issuing fines for parking
violations. However, AI systems rarely live up to the promise of neutral
optimisation, creating biased or incorrect outputs and reducing the agency of
both citizens and civic workers to shape the way decisions are made.
Transparency is a principle that can both help subjects understand decisions
made about them and shape the processes behind those decisions. However,
transparency as practiced around AI systems tends to focus on the production of
technical objects that represent algorithmic aspects of decision making. These
are often difficult for publics to understand, do not connect to potential for
action, and do not give insight into the wider socio-material context of
decision making. In this paper, we build on existing approaches that take a
human-centric view on AI transparency, combined with a socio-technical systems
view, to develop the concept of meaningful transparency for civic AI systems:
transparencies that allow publics to engage with AI systems that affect their
lives, connecting understanding with potential for action.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Introduces FinLake-Bench to evaluate leakage robustness in LLM-based financial agents and FactFin, a counterfactual-based framework to reduce leakage; demonstrates improved out-of-sample generalization and risk-adjusted performance over baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the 'profit mirage' caused by information leakage in LLMs used for trading, and the lack of robust leakage-robust benchmarks; aims to enable truly generalizable, causal-driven decision making in LLM agents.

Method: Quantifies leakage across four dimensions and releases FinLake-Bench as a leakage-robust evaluation benchmark. Proposes FactFin, a framework with four components—Strategy Code Generator, Retrieval-Augmented Generation, Monte Carlo Tree Search, and Counterfactual Simulator—that uses counterfactual perturbations to force learning causal drivers rather than memorized outcomes.

Result: Extensive experiments show FactFin surpasses all baselines in out-of-sample generalization and delivers superior risk-adjusted performance.

Conclusion: A leakage-robust benchmarking suite and a counterfactual, causality-focused framework can markedly improve the robustness and effectiveness of LLM-based financial agents, mitigating the profit mirage and promoting truly generalizable trading strategies.

Abstract: LLM-based financial agents have attracted widespread excitement for their
ability to trade like human experts. However, most systems exhibit a "profit
mirage": dazzling back-tested returns evaporate once the model's knowledge
window ends, because of the inherent information leakage in LLMs. In this
paper, we systematically quantify this leakage issue across four dimensions and
release FinLake-Bench, a leakage-robust evaluation benchmark. Furthermore, to
mitigate this issue, we introduce FactFin, a framework that applies
counterfactual perturbations to compel LLM-based agents to learn causal drivers
instead of memorized outcomes. FactFin integrates four core components:
Strategy Code Generator, Retrieval-Augmented Generation, Monte Carlo Tree
Search, and Counterfactual Simulator. Extensive experiments show that our
method surpasses all baselines in out-of-sample generalization, delivering
superior risk-adjusted performance.

### [173] [Enabling Personalized Long-term Interactions in LLM-based Agents through Persistent Memory and User Profiles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07925)
*Rebecca Westhäußer,Wolfgang Minker,Sebatian Zepf*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A framework for personalized, persistent-memory LLM-enabled agents that merge memory, profiles, and multi-source retrieval to enable long-term, user-centered interactions; evaluated on datasets and via a small pilot study.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs currently struggle to deliver durable personalization; retrieval augmentation improves context but lacks user-specific data integration; there is a need for implementable technical requirements and architectural guidance to build adaptive, user-centered LLM agents.

Method: Define a unified notion of personalization, derive technical requirements, and present a framework that integrates persistent memory, dynamic coordination, self-validation, and evolving user profiles with established agentic patterns (multi-agent collaboration, multi-source retrieval); evaluate on three public datasets using retrieval accuracy, response correctness, and BertScore; complement with a five-day pilot user study to gather early user feedback.

Result: The study demonstrates feasibility and potential gains in personalization through empirical evaluation (datasets with specified metrics) and qualitative insights from a five-day pilot study; findings underscore the value of persistent memory and evolving user profiles for adaptive, personalized LLM interactions.

Conclusion: Provides a concrete framework and identify technical requirements to enable personalized long-term interactions for LLM-based agents; outlines pathways for future work, including deeper integration of memory, evolving user profiles, and more extensive user studies.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly serve as the central control unit
of AI agents, yet current approaches remain limited in their ability to deliver
personalized interactions. While Retrieval Augmented Generation enhances LLM
capabilities by improving context-awareness, it lacks mechanisms to combine
contextual information with user-specific data. Although personalization has
been studied in fields such as human-computer interaction or cognitive science,
existing perspectives largely remain conceptual, with limited focus on
technical implementation. To address these gaps, we build on a unified
definition of personalization as a conceptual foundation to derive technical
requirements for adaptive, user-centered LLM-based agents. Combined with
established agentic AI patterns such as multi-agent collaboration or
multi-source retrieval, we present a framework that integrates persistent
memory, dynamic coordination, self-validation, and evolving user profiles to
enable personalized long-term interactions. We evaluate our approach on three
public datasets using metrics such as retrieval accuracy, response correctness,
or BertScore. We complement these results with a five-day pilot user study
providing initial insights into user feedback on perceived personalization. The
study provides early indications that guide future work and highlights the
potential of integrating persistent memory and user profiles to improve the
adaptivity and perceived personalization of LLM-based agents.

### [175] [TaoSR-SHE: Stepwise Hybrid Examination Reinforcement Learning Framework for E-commerce Search Relevance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07972)
*Pengkun Jiao,Yiming Jin,Jianhui Yang,Chenhe Dong,Zerui Huang,Shaowei Yao,Xiaojiang Zhou,Dan Ou,Haihong Tang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TaoSR-SHE presents Stepwise Reward Policy Optimization (SRPO), a stepwise RL framework for Taobao search relevance that uses a hybrid stepwise reward model plus an offline verifier, with data diversification and multi-stage curriculum learning to improve reasoning and relevance prediction over SFT/DPO/GRPO and baselines; enhanced interpretability and robustness in large-scale e-commerce.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome SFT/DPO's poor generalization on long-tail queries and lack of fine-grained, step-by-step supervision for aligned reasoning, and to mitigate RLVR's sparse feedback that hinders logical consistency in complex inference.

Method: Introduce TaoSR-SHE with SRPO, leveraging step-level rewards from a hybrid generative reward model and a human-annotated offline verifier; apply diversified data filtering to promote exploration and prevent policy entropy collapse; employ multi-stage curriculum learning to progressively build capabilities.

Result: Extensive experiments on real-world Taobao search benchmarks show improved reasoning quality and relevance-prediction accuracy, outperforming SFT, DPO, GRPO, and other baselines, while also enhancing interpretability and robustness.

Conclusion: The framework effectively addresses limitations of prior training paradigms by providing fine-grained, interpretable stepwise supervision and robust learning signals, yielding superior performance and potential generalization to large-scale e-commerce relevance tasks.

Abstract: Query-product relevance analysis is a foundational technology in e-commerce
search engines and has become increasingly important in AI-driven e-commerce.
The recent emergence of large language models (LLMs), particularly their
chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning capabilities, offers promising opportunities
for developing relevance systems that are both more interpretable and more
robust. However, existing training paradigms have notable limitations: SFT and
DPO suffer from poor generalization on long-tail queries and from a lack of
fine-grained, stepwise supervision to enforce rule-aligned reasoning. In
contrast, reinforcement learning with verification rewards (RLVR) suffers from
sparse feedback, which provides insufficient signal to correct erroneous
intermediate steps, thereby undermining logical consistency and limiting
performance in complex inference scenarios.
  To address these challenges, we introduce the Stepwise Hybrid Examination
Reinforcement Learning framework for Taobao Search Relevance (TaoSR-SHE). At
its core is Stepwise Reward Policy Optimization (SRPO), a reinforcement
learning algorithm that leverages step-level rewards generated by a hybrid of a
high-quality generative stepwise reward model and a human-annotated offline
verifier, prioritizing learning from critical correct and incorrect reasoning
steps. TaoSR-SHE further incorporates two key techniques: diversified data
filtering to encourage exploration across varied reasoning paths and mitigate
policy entropy collapse, and multi-stage curriculum learning to foster
progressive capability growth. Extensive experiments on real-world search
benchmarks show that TaoSR-SHE improves both reasoning quality and
relevance-prediction accuracy in large-scale e-commerce settings, outperforming
SFT, DPO, GRPO, and other baselines, while also enhancing interpretability and
robustness.

*Dhruv Jain,Harshit Shukla,Gautam Rajeev,Ashish Kulkarni,Chandra Khatri,Shubham Agarwal*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: VoiceAgentBench introduces a large multilingual spoken-agent benchmark for SpeechLMs, revealing gaps in tool orchestration, Indic generalization, and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current speech benchmarks mostly cover isolated tasks (e.g., transcription or QA) and fail to evaluate agentic, multilingual, and culturally nuanced capabilities or sensitivity to adversarial inputs. This gap motivates a benchmark that tests real-world, tool-using, multilingual spoken interactions.

Method: Construct VoiceAgentBench with 5,500+ synthetic spoken queries, including Indian-context dialogues; supports English, Hindi, and 5 other Indian languages; includes single-tool, multi-tool workflows, multi-turn interactions, and safety/adversarial evaluations. Introduce a novel sampling algorithm that selects TTS voices based on speaker embeddings to maximize acoustic diversity. Evaluate tool selection accuracy, structural consistency, correctness of tool invocations, and adversarial robustness.

Result: Experiments reveal substantial gaps in contextual tool orchestration, Indic generalization, and adversarial robustness, indicating current SpeechLMs struggle with integrated, multilingual agentic tasks.

Conclusion: VoiceAgentBench highlights critical limitations of contemporary SpeechLMs in real-world agentic, multilingual settings and points to the need for improved tool integration, cross-linguistic generalization, and robustness in future models.

Abstract: Large-scale Speech Language Models (SpeechLMs) have enabled voice assistants
capable of understanding natural spoken queries and performing complex tasks.
However, existing speech benchmarks primarily focus on isolated capabilities
such as transcription, or question-answering, and do not systematically
evaluate agentic scenarios encompassing multilingual and cultural
understanding, as well as adversarial robustness. To address this, we introduce
VoiceAgentBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate SpeechLMs in
realistic spoken agentic settings. It comprises over 5,500 synthetic spoken
queries, including dialogues grounded in Indian context, covering single-tool
invocations, multi-tool workflows, multi-turn interactions, and safety
evaluations. The benchmark supports English, Hindi, and 5 other Indian
languages, reflecting real-world linguistic and cultural diversity. We simulate
speaker variability using a novel sampling algorithm that selects audios for
TTS voice conversion based on its speaker embeddings, maximizing acoustic and
speaker diversity. Our evaluation measures tool selection accuracy, structural
consistency, and the correctness of tool invocations, including adversarial
robustness. Our experiments reveal significant gaps in contextual tool
orchestration tasks, Indic generalization, and adversarial robustness, exposing
critical limitations of current SpeechLMs.

### [177] [ReInAgent: A Context-Aware GUI Agent Enabling Human-in-the-Loop Mobile Task Navigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07988)
*Haitao Jia,Ming He,Zimo Yin,Likang Wu,Jianping Fan,Jitao Sang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A context-aware, human-in-the-loop mobile task framework ReInAgent using three agents around a shared memory to handle information dilemmas; shows 25% higher success on complex tasks vs Mobile-Agent-v2.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mobile GUI agents often operate autonomously and ignore user engagement, failing in ambiguous, evolving, and conflicting tasks; need for human-in-the-loop design to align with user preferences.

Method: A shared memory with three specialized agents: information-managing agent for slot-based management and user interaction; decision-making agent for conflict-aware planning; reflecting agent for task reflection and information consistency validation; continuous contextual information analysis and collaboration with user.

Result: The approach resolves information dilemmas, yields outcomes closer to user preferences, and achieves a 25% higher success rate on complex tasks compared to Mobile-Agent-v2.

Conclusion: ReInAgent offers a more adaptive and reliable mobile task navigation in real-world scenarios by integrating human-in-the-loop with dynamic information management.

Abstract: Mobile GUI agents exhibit substantial potential to facilitate and automate
the execution of user tasks on mobile phones. However, exist mobile GUI agents
predominantly privilege autonomous operation and neglect the necessity of
active user engagement during task execution. This omission undermines their
adaptability to information dilemmas including ambiguous, dynamically evolving,
and conflicting task scenarios, leading to execution outcomes that deviate from
genuine user requirements and preferences. To address these shortcomings, we
propose ReInAgent, a context-aware multi-agent framework that leverages dynamic
information management to enable human-in-the-loop mobile task navigation.
ReInAgent integrates three specialized agents around a shared memory module: an
information-managing agent for slot-based information management and proactive
interaction with the user, a decision-making agent for conflict-aware planning,
and a reflecting agent for task reflection and information consistency
validation. Through continuous contextual information analysis and sustained
user-agent collaboration, ReInAgent overcomes the limitation of existing
approaches that rely on clear and static task assumptions. Consequently, it
enables more adaptive and reliable mobile task navigation in complex,
real-world scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that ReInAgent
effectively resolves information dilemmas and produces outcomes that are more
closely aligned with genuine user preferences. Notably, on complex tasks
involving information dilemmas, ReInAgent achieves a 25% higher success rate
than Mobile-Agent-v2.

### [178] [Language Models Do Not Embed Numbers Continuously](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08009)
*Alex O. Davies,Roussel Nzoyem,Nirav Ajmeri,Telmo M. Silva Filho*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LM embeddings can reconstruct numeric values with high fidelity but do not encode numbers continuously; PCA shows embedding variance is largely not aligned with numeric input and noise increases with precision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Assess whether LMs truly model continuous numeric values or only appear to do so via reconstruction; evaluate across major providers; analyze embedding geometry with linear reconstruction and PCA; implications for numerically intensive tasks.

Method: Analyze numeric embeddings from OpenAI, Google Gemini, Voyage AI; apply linear reconstruction to recover numbers; perform PCA to measure explained variance; compute R^2; test across increasing decimal precision.

Result: Reconstruction fidelity high (R^2 ≥ 0.95) but PCA explains only a small fraction of variance; many components orthogonal to numeric input; linear reconstruction and explained variance degrade with higher decimal precision.

Conclusion: Embedding spaces do not model continuous numeric values; caution for tasks requiring high numerical precision, large magnitudes, or mixed-sign values; numerical behavior of embeddings is noisy and not continuously encoded.

Abstract: Recent research has extensively studied how large language models manipulate
integers in specific arithmetic tasks, and on a more fundamental level, how
they represent numeric values. These previous works have found that language
model embeddings can be used to reconstruct the original values, however, they
do not evaluate whether language models actually model continuous values as
continuous. Using expected properties of the embedding space, including linear
reconstruction and principal component analysis, we show that language models
not only represent numeric spaces as non-continuous but also introduce
significant noise. Using models from three major providers (OpenAI, Google
Gemini and Voyage AI), we show that while reconstruction is possible with high
fidelity ($R^2 \geq 0.95$), principal components only explain a minor share of
variation within the embedding space. This indicates that many components
within the embedding space are orthogonal to the simple numeric input space.
Further, both linear reconstruction and explained variance suffer with
increasing decimal precision, despite the ordinal nature of the input space
being fundamentally unchanged. The findings of this work therefore have
implications for the many areas where embedding models are used, in-particular
where high numerical precision, large magnitudes or mixed-sign values are
common.

### [179] [PEAR: Phase Entropy Aware Reward for Efficient Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08026)
*Chen Huang,Wei Lu,Wenxuan Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PEAR introduces a phase-sensitive entropy reward to control CoT length in large reasoning models, reducing verbosity while preserving accuracy and showing OOD robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long chain-of-thought explanations in large reasoning models are effective but verbose and costly; there's a positive correlation between entropy and response length across reasoning stages. A phase-aware reward can encourage concise thinking while preserving solution quality.

Method: Develop Phase Entropy Aware Reward (PEAR) that penalizes high entropy during the thinking phase and permits moderate exploration in the final answer phase; integrate into RL fine-tuning to shape CoT length; evaluate on four benchmarks and OOD tests; code released.

Result: PEAR consistently reduces response length across model scales while maintaining competitive accuracy; demonstrates improved out-of-distribution robustness; enables adaptive length control without fixed targets; code at the provided repo.

Conclusion: Phase-aware entropy control is an effective, generalizable method for trimming reasoning traces without sacrificing performance, offering a practical approach to balance conciseness and flexibility in LRMs.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have achieved impressive performance on complex
reasoning tasks by generating detailed chain-of-thought (CoT) explanations.
However, these responses are often excessively long, containing redundant
reasoning steps that inflate inference cost and reduce usability. Controlling
the length of generated reasoning without sacrificing accuracy remains an open
challenge. Through a systematic empirical analysis, we reveal a consistent
positive correlation between model entropy and response length at different
reasoning stages across diverse LRMs: the thinking phase exhibits higher
entropy, reflecting exploratory behavior of longer responses, while the final
answer phase shows lower entropy, indicating a more deterministic solution.This
observation suggests that entropy at different reasoning stages can serve as a
control knob for balancing conciseness and performance. Based on this insight,
this paper introduces Phase Entropy Aware Reward (PEAR), a reward mechanism
that incorporating phase-dependent entropy into the reward design. Instead of
treating all tokens uniformly, PEAR penalize excessive entropy during the
thinking phase and allowing moderate exploration at the final answer phase,
which encourages models to generate concise reasoning traces that retain
sufficient flexibility to solve the task correctly. This enables adaptive
control of response length without relying on explicit length targets or rigid
truncation rules. Extensive experiments across four benchmarks demonstrate that
PEAR consistently reduces response length while sustaining competitive accuracy
across model scales. In addition, PEAR demonstrates strong out-of-distribution
(OOD) robustness beyond the training distribution. Our code is available at:

### [180] [AILoRA: Function-Aware Asymmetric Initialization for Low-Rank Adaptation of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08034)
*Xiaoshuang Ji,Zhendong Zhao,Xiaoyan Gu,Xiaojun Chen,Xin Zhao,Zeyao Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AILoRA improves LoRA by using function-aware asymmetric low-rank priors for the Q and V projections in self-attention, injecting task-adaptive main components into W^Q and generalizable minor components into W^V, leading to better fine-tuning performance and faster convergence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LoRA is effective but suffers from suboptimal performance and slow convergence, partly due to treating attention matrices W^Q and W^V identically. By recognizing their distinct functional roles—W^Q capturing task-specific semantic space and W^V encoding stable token-level features—there is room to tailor the low-rank priors to each; this could improve task adaptation efficiency and generalization.

Method: Propose AILoRA with function-aware asymmetric initialization: initialize LoRA adapters for W^Q using the principal components (high-variance directions) to preserve task-adaptive capacity, and initialize W^V adapters using minor components to retain stable feature representations; apply asymmetric low-rank priors that reflect the different roles of Q and V in attention computation.

Result: Empirical analysis shows W^Q and W^V exhibit distinct parameter characteristics; the asymmetric initialization improves LoRA’s ability to capture attention-specific versus generalizable information, leading to enhanced finetuning performance and faster convergence across tasks/layers.

Conclusion: Accounting for the functional differences between W^Q and W^V when applying LoRA yields a more effective, convergent parameter-efficient finetuning method. AILoRA demonstrates that tailored, asymmetric low-rank priors can strengthen attention adaptation while preserving generalizable representations.

Abstract: Parameter-efficient finetuning (PEFT) aims to mitigate the substantial
computational and memory overhead involved in adapting large-scale pretrained
models to diverse downstream tasks. Among numerous PEFT strategies, Low-Rank
Adaptation (LoRA) has emerged as one of the most widely adopted approaches due
to its robust empirical performance and low implementation complexity. In
practical deployment, LoRA is typically applied to the $W^Q$ and $W^V$
projection matrices of self-attention modules, enabling an effective trade-off
between model performance and parameter efficiency. While LoRA has achieved
considerable empirical success, it still encounters challenges such as
suboptimal performance and slow convergence. To address these limitations, we
introduce \textbf{AILoRA}, a novel parameter-efficient method that incorporates
function-aware asymmetric low-rank priors. Our empirical analysis reveals that
the projection matrices $W^Q$ and $W^V$ in the self-attention mechanism exhibit
distinct parameter characteristics, stemming from their functional differences.
Specifically, $W^Q$ captures task-specific semantic space knowledge essential
for attention distributions computation, making its parameters highly sensitive
to downstream task variations. In contrast, $W^V$ encodes token-level feature
representations that tend to remain stable across tasks and layers. Leveraging
these insights, AILoRA performs a function-aware initialization by injecting
the principal components of $W^Q$ to retain task-adaptive capacity, and the
minor components of $W^V$ to preserve generalizable feature representations.
This asymmetric initialization strategy enables LoRA modules to better capture
the specialized roles of attention parameters, thereby enhancing both
finetuning performance and convergence efficiency.

*Qingyuan Shi,Qingwen Meng,Hao Cheng,Qing Xu,Jianqiang Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LinguaSim uses LLMs to turn natural language into interactive, 3D driving scenarios with a feedback calibration module, achieving better alignment with user intent and reducing unsafe behaviors during safety testing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current NL-to-simulation methods either restrict to 2D or use open-loop, non-interactive backgrounds, which hurts realism and fidelity. There is a need to bridge natural language descriptions with closed-loop, interactive driving simulations to improve safety testing and training.

Method: LinguaSim converts natural language into realistic, interactive 3D scenarios with dynamic vehicle interactions. A feedback calibration module refines generation to align with user intent. The framework constrains adversarial vehicle behaviors using both the scenario description and the guiding autonomous driving model, enabling high-fidelity, NL-driven closed-loop simulations.

Result: Experiments show varying scenario criticality aligned with NL descriptions (ACT: 0.072 s for dangerous vs. 3.532 s for safe; comfortability: 0.654 vs. 0.764). The refinement module reduces excessive aggressiveness, lowering crash rate from 46.9% to 6.3% to better match user intent.

Conclusion: LinguaSim effectively bridges natural language and closed-loop interactive simulations, enabling high-fidelity, intent-aligned scenario generation that enhances safety testing and training.

Abstract: The generation of testing and training scenarios for autonomous vehicles has
drawn significant attention. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled
new scenario generation methods, current methods struggle to balance command
adherence accuracy with the realism of real-world driving environments. To
reduce scenario description complexity, these methods often compromise realism
by limiting scenarios to 2D, or open-loop simulations where background vehicles
follow predefined, non-interactive behaviors. We propose LinguaSim, an
LLM-based framework that converts natural language into realistic, interactive
3D scenarios, ensuring both dynamic vehicle interactions and faithful alignment
between the input descriptions and the generated scenarios. A feedback
calibration module further refines the generation precision, improving fidelity
to user intent. By bridging the gap between natural language and closed-loop,
interactive simulations, LinguaSim constrains adversarial vehicle behaviors
using both the scenario description and the autonomous driving model guiding
them. This framework facilitates the creation of high-fidelity scenarios that
enhance safety testing and training. Experiments show LinguaSim can generate
scenarios with varying criticality aligned with different natural language
descriptions (ACT: 0.072 s for dangerous vs. 3.532 s for safe descriptions;
comfortability: 0.654 vs. 0.764), and its refinement module effectively reduces
excessive aggressiveness in LinguaSim's initial outputs, lowering the crash
rate from 46.9% to 6.3% to better match user intentions.

### [182] [Multi-Condition Conformal Selection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08075)
*Qingyang Hao,Wenbo Liao,Bingyi Jing,Hongxin Wei*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MCCS expands conformal selection to multi-condition settings, providing finite-sample FDR control for both conjunctive and disjunctive needs. It introduces a regionally monotone nonconformity score for conjunctions and uses a global BH procedure for disjunctions, with theoretical guarantees and strong empirical performance across modalities and tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conformal selection with FDR control traditionally handles single-threshold (y > c) problems. Real-world applications (drug discovery, precision medicine, LLM alignment) require selecting candidates under multiple, possibly combined conditions (conjunctive or disjunctive). There is a gap in scalable, provably controlled multi-condition selection.

Method: Proposes Multi-Condition Conformal Selection (MCCS). For conjunctive conditions, introduces a nonconformity score with regional monotonicity to respect multiple thresholds; for disjunctive conditions, applies a global Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) procedure. Provides finite-sample FDR control with theoretical guarantees. Demonstrates compatibility with various condition configurations and data modalities.

Result: Extensive experiments show MCCS outperforms baselines, with good generalizability across different condition combinations, real-world modalities, and multi-task settings.

Conclusion: MCCS enables rigorous, finite-sample FDR-controlled candidate selection in multi-condition environments, offering robust performance and broad applicability across domains.

Abstract: Selecting high-quality candidates from large-scale datasets is critically
important in resource-constrained applications such as drug discovery,
precision medicine, and the alignment of large language models. While conformal
selection methods offer a rigorous solution with False Discovery Rate (FDR)
control, their applicability is confined to single-threshold scenarios (i.e., y
> c) and overlooks practical needs for multi-condition selection, such as
conjunctive or disjunctive conditions. In this work, we propose the
Multi-Condition Conformal Selection (MCCS) algorithm, which extends conformal
selection to scenarios with multiple conditions. In particular, we introduce a
novel nonconformity score with regional monotonicity for conjunctive conditions
and a global Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) procedure for disjunctive conditions,
thereby establishing finite-sample FDR control with theoretical guarantees. The
integration of these components enables the proposed method to achieve rigorous
FDR-controlled selection in various multi-condition environments. Extensive
experiments validate the superiority of MCCS over baselines, its
generalizability across diverse condition combinations, different real-world
modalities, and multi-task scalability.

*Xiaochong Lan,Jie Feng,Yinxing Liu,Xinlei Shi,Yong Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AutoQual: an LLM-based agent that autonomously discovers interpretable quality features for online reviews, mimicking research workflows, and improves engagement metrics on a billion-user platform. It generalizes beyond review quality to transform tacit data knowledge into computable features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quality is domain-dependent and dynamic; traditional hand-crafted features do not scale and deep models lack interpretability. There's a need for interpretable, adaptable feature discovery.

Method: An LLM-based agent adopts reflective reasoning to generate feature hypotheses, operationalizes them via autonomous tools, and stores experience in persistent memory; designed as a general framework for converting tacit data knowledge into explicit features; demonstrated on review quality assessment.

Result: In large-scale A/B tests, the framework increased average reviews viewed per user by 0.79% and improved the conversion rate of review readers by 0.27%.

Conclusion: AutoQual offers a general, interpretable feature discovery framework that can automate knowledge extraction from data; applicable beyond review quality to other domains, enabling scalable, transparent quality assessment.

Abstract: Ranking online reviews by their intrinsic quality is a critical task for
e-commerce platforms and information services, impacting user experience and
business outcomes. However, quality is a domain-dependent and dynamic concept,
making its assessment a formidable challenge. Traditional methods relying on
hand-crafted features are unscalable across domains and fail to adapt to
evolving content patterns, while modern deep learning approaches often produce
black-box models that lack interpretability and may prioritize semantics over
quality. To address these challenges, we propose AutoQual, an LLM-based agent
framework that automates the discovery of interpretable features. While
demonstrated on review quality assessment, AutoQual is designed as a general
framework for transforming tacit knowledge embedded in data into explicit,
computable features. It mimics a human research process, iteratively generating
feature hypotheses through reflection, operationalizing them via autonomous
tool implementation, and accumulating experience in a persistent memory. We
deploy our method on a large-scale online platform with a billion-level user
base. Large-scale A/B testing confirms its effectiveness, increasing average
reviews viewed per user by 0.79% and the conversion rate of review readers by
0.27%.

### [184] [From Ethical Declarations to Provable Independence: An Ontology-Driven Optimal-Transport Framework for Certifiably Fair AI Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08086)
*Sukriti Bhattacharya,Chitro Majumdar*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes a provably fair AI framework that removes all sensitive information and proxies using OWL 2 QL ontologies to identify proxies and Delbaen Majumdar optimal transport to create representations independent of bias, aiming for certifiable fairness in tasks like loan decisions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current bias mitigation methods often rely on decorrelation or surrogate removal and do not provide formal guarantees. The work seeks a provable notion of fairness by removing all proxies and dependencies, yielding truly independent representations.

Method: 1) Define sensitive attributes and infer proxies via OWL 2 QL ontological reasoning to construct a sigma-algebra G of biased patterns. 2) Use Delbaen Majumdar optimal transport to produce fair representations that are independent of G while minimizing L2 distance to preserve accuracy. 3) Model bias as dependence between sigma-algebras, and compile ontological knowledge into measurable structures. 4) Treat the optimal-transport-based transformation as the unique fair transformation.

Result: A mathematically grounded framework that guarantees true independence from the identified bias structure, producing certifiably fair representations. Demonstrates potential in tasks like loan approval where proxies (e.g., ZIP code) could reveal race.

Conclusion: The approach offers a certifiable, theoretically grounded method for trustworthy AI by integrating ontology-driven bias identification with a unique optimal-transport-based fair transformation.

Abstract: This paper presents a framework for provably fair AI that overcomes the
limits of current bias mitigation methods by systematically removing all
sensitive information and its proxies. Using ontology engineering in OWL 2 QL,
it formally defines sensitive attributes and infers their proxies through
logical reasoning, constructing a sigma algebra G that captures the full
structure of biased patterns. Fair representations are then obtained via
Delbaen Majumdar optimal transport, which generates variables independent of G
while minimizing L2 distance to preserve accuracy. This guarantees true
independence rather than mere decorrelation. By modeling bias as dependence
between sigma algebras, compiling ontological knowledge into measurable
structures, and using optimal transport as the unique fair transformation, the
approach ensures complete fairness in tasks like loan approval, where proxies
such as ZIP code reveal race. The result is a certifiable and mathematically
grounded method for trustworthy AI.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Evaluates manipulability of risk aversion in language models (LMs) and their ability to replicate human risk preferences across economic scenarios. Finds partial alignment but notable discrepancies, underscoring the need for refined risk-measurement and design to improve ethical risk management in AI assistants.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As LMs increasingly support decision-making, it is crucial to measure, audit, and adjust their risk-related tendencies to prevent nudging users toward risky choices or embedding biases, ensuring responsible deployment.

Method: Cross-scenario experiments assessing risk aversion manipulatability across economic tasks, including gender-specific attitudes, uncertainty, and role-based decision-making. Models analyzed include DeepSeek Reasoner and Gemini-2.0-flash-lite to gauge alignment with human risk preferences.

Result: LMs show some alignment with human risk behaviors but exhibit notable discrepancies; existing measures of manipulability may be insufficient, pointing to the need for more robust, bio-centric metrics.

Conclusion: To improve safety and effectiveness, AI designers should refine how models represent and adjust risk preferences, aiming for closer alignment with human risk standards and better support for ethical decision-making; further work is needed to enhance manipulability assessment and model design.

Abstract: Responsible AI demands systems whose behavioral tendencies can be effectively
measured, audited, and adjusted to prevent inadvertently nudging users toward
risky decisions or embedding hidden biases in risk aversion. As language models
(LMs) are increasingly incorporated into AI-driven decision support systems,
understanding their risk behaviors is crucial for their responsible deployment.
This study investigates the manipulability of risk aversion (MoRA) in LMs,
examining their ability to replicate human risk preferences across diverse
economic scenarios, with a focus on gender-specific attitudes, uncertainty,
role-based decision-making, and the manipulability of risk aversion. The
results indicate that while LMs such as DeepSeek Reasoner and
Gemini-2.0-flash-lite exhibit some alignment with human behaviors, notable
discrepancies highlight the need to refine bio-centric measures of
manipulability. These findings suggest directions for refining AI design to
better align human and AI risk preferences and enhance ethical decision-making.
The study calls for further advancements in model design to ensure that AI
systems more accurately replicate human risk preferences, thereby improving
their effectiveness in risk management contexts. This approach could enhance
the applicability of AI assistants in managing risk.

### [186] [Prepared mind, fast response: A temporal decoupling framework for adaptive knowledge orchestration in open-domain dialogue](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08175)
*Jinling Gan,Churong Liang,Runnan Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PMFR introduces asynchronous knowledge refinement with a temporal decoupling framework to decouple latency from quality in open-domain dialogue. It uses three components—Knowledge Adequacy Evaluator, Lightweight Response Generator, and Asynchronous Knowledge Refinement Agent—to maintain flow while gradually enriching knowledge. On TopiOCQA, it achieves 95.3% latency reduction (23.38s to 1.09s) with response quality comparable to heavyweight baselines (GEval-C 0.613 vs 0.620).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The abstract targets the fundamental latency-quality trade-off in open-domain dialogue systems. Lightweight models offer low latency but shallow reasoning, while tool-augmented approaches (e.g., ReAct) improve factuality but block interaction during retrieval. PMFR aims to resolve this tension via asynchronous knowledge orchestration.

Method: PMFR is a temporal decoupling framework with three coordinated components: (1) Knowledge Adequacy Evaluator for real-time sufficiency assessment, (2) Lightweight Response Generator for immediate user interaction, and (3) Asynchronous Knowledge Refinement Agent for background knowledge enhancement. The architecture uses intelligent triggering to progressively enrich knowledge while maintaining continuous conversational flow.

Result: Evaluation on TopiOCQA shows PMFR outperforms brute-force scaling: latency reduced by 95.3% (from 23.38s to 1.09s) while preserving quality close to heavyweight baselines (GEval-C: 0.613 vs 0.620).

Conclusion: Temporal decoupling resolves the latency-quality contradiction and maintains ongoing dialogue while asynchronously refining knowledge. The results demonstrate substantial latency gains with minimal loss in quality, though the evidence is limited to a single benchmark dataset; broader validation and analysis of potential trade-offs (staleness, consistency) are warranted.

Abstract: The latency-quality tradeoff is a fundamental constraint in open-domain
dialogue AI systems, since comprehensive knowledge access necessitates
prohibitive response delays. Contemporary approaches offer two inadequate
solutions: lightweight instruct models achieve sub-second latency but lack
reasoning depth, while tool-augmented ReAct agents enhance factuality through
external knowledge at the cost of synchronous execution that blocks interaction
during retrieval processes. PMFR is thus proposed, with a temporal decoupling
framework that fundamentally resolves the contradiction through asynchronous
knowledge orchestration. PMFR employs three coordinated components: (1) a
Knowledge Adequacy Evaluator for real-time sufficiency assessment, (2) a
Lightweight Response Generator for immediate user interaction, and (3) an
Asynchronous Knowledge Refinement Agent for background knowledge enhancement.
This architecture maintains continuous conversational flow while progressively
enriching knowledge coverage through intelligent triggering mechanisms.
Evaluation results on TopiOCQA demonstrate PMFR outperforms brute-force
scaling: PMFR achieves 95.3% latency reduction (23.38s -> 1.09s) while
preserving response quality comparable to heavyweight synchronous baselines
(GEval-C: 0.613 vs. 0.620).

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Introduces R-HORIZON to benchmark and enhance long-horizon reasoning in LRMs; reveals current limitations and shows performance gains with RLVR training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current test-time scaling and chain-of-thought approaches improve short-horizon tasks but fail to evaluate or support long-horizon, interdependent reasoning across multiple problems.

Method: Constructs a long-horizon reasoning benchmark with complex, interdependent multi-step tasks; analyzes LRMs to measure effective reasoning length and budget allocation; develops RLVR using R-HORIZON data to train LRMs.

Result: LRMs exhibit significant degradation on long-horizon tasks and limited effective reasoning length; RLVR with R-HORIZON substantially improves multi-horizon performance and also improves standard tasks (e.g., +7.5 on AIME2024).

Conclusion: R-HORIZON provides a scalable, controllable, low-cost framework to evaluate and boost long-horizon reasoning capabilities in LRMs.

Abstract: Recent trends in test-time scaling for reasoning models (e.g., OpenAI o1,
DeepSeek-R1) have led to remarkable improvements through long Chain-of-Thought
(CoT). However, existing benchmarks mainly focus on immediate, single-horizon
tasks, failing to adequately evaluate models' ability to understand and respond
to complex, long-horizon scenarios. To address this incomplete evaluation of
Large Reasoning Models (LRMs), we propose R-HORIZON, a method designed to
stimulate long-horizon reasoning behaviors in LRMs through query composition.
Based on R-HORIZON, we construct a long-horizon reasoning benchmark, comprising
complex multi-step reasoning tasks with interdependent problems that span long
reasoning horizons. Through comprehensive evaluation of LRMs using the
R-HORIZON benchmark, we find that even the most advanced LRMs suffer
significant performance degradation. Our analysis reveals that LRMs exhibit
limited effective reasoning length and struggle to allocate thinking budget
across multiple problems appropriately. Recognizing these limitations, we use
R-HORIZON to construct long-horizon reasoning data for reinforcement learning
with verified rewards (RLVR). Compared to training with single-horizon data,
RLVR with R-HORIZON not only substantially improves performance on the
multi-horizon reasoning tasks, but also promotes accuracy on standard reasoning
tasks, with an increase of 7.5 on AIME2024. These results position R-HORIZON as
a scalable, controllable, and low-cost paradigm for enhancing and evaluating
the long-horizon reasoning capabilities of LRMs.

### [188] [Measuring What Matters: The AI Pluralism Index](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08193)
*Rashid Mushkani*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AIPI is a transparent, evidence-based index that measures AI pluralism across four pillars (participatory governance, inclusivity/diversity, transparency, accountability) using public artifacts, independent evaluations, and explicit handling of unknown evidence, with a reproducible pipeline and public adjudication.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI development and governance are concentrated among a few firms and states, risking narrow interests; current benchmarks focus on capabilities rather than pluralistic governance. There is a need for public, auditable measures of pluralism to empower public agency and inform policymakers and buyers.

Method: Formal measurement model; reproducible pipeline integrating structured web/repository analysis, external assessments, and expert interviews; scoring that distinguishes known evidence from unknown (reporting lower-bound 'evidence' and 'known-only' scores); reliability checks (inter-rater agreement, coverage reporting, cross-index correlations, sensitivity analysis); public artifacts include codebook, scoring scripts, evidence graph, versioned releases, and a public adjudication process.

Result: Pilot provider results reported; AIPI yields verifiable scores across four pillars, with explicit treatment of Unknown evidence to provide both lower-bound and known-only scores; reliability and coverage analyses reported (inter-rater agreement, correlations, sensitivity); open-source pipeline and documentation; AIPI positioned relative to transparency, safety, and governance frameworks.

Conclusion: AIPI aims to steer incentives toward pluralistic AI practices, equipping policymakers, procurers, and the public with comparable evidence to assess and improve governance across AI producers and system families.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence systems increasingly mediate knowledge,
communication, and decision making. Development and governance remain
concentrated within a small set of firms and states, raising concerns that
technologies may encode narrow interests and limit public agency. Capability
benchmarks for language, vision, and coding are common, yet public, auditable
measures of pluralistic governance are rare. We define AI pluralism as the
degree to which affected stakeholders can shape objectives, data practices,
safeguards, and deployment. We present the AI Pluralism Index (AIPI), a
transparent, evidence-based instrument that evaluates producers and system
families across four pillars: participatory governance, inclusivity and
diversity, transparency, and accountability. AIPI codes verifiable practices
from public artifacts and independent evaluations, explicitly handling
"Unknown" evidence to report both lower-bound ("evidence") and known-only
scores with coverage. We formalize the measurement model; implement a
reproducible pipeline that integrates structured web and repository analysis,
external assessments, and expert interviews; and assess reliability with
inter-rater agreement, coverage reporting, cross-index correlations, and
sensitivity analysis. The protocol, codebook, scoring scripts, and evidence
graph are maintained openly with versioned releases and a public adjudication
process. We report pilot provider results and situate AIPI relative to adjacent
transparency, safety, and governance frameworks. The index aims to steer
incentives toward pluralistic practice and to equip policymakers, procurers,
and the public with comparable evidence.

### [189] [The Tournament Tree Method for preference elicitation in Multi-criteria decision-making](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08197)
*Diego García-Zamora,Álvaro Labella,José Rui Figueira*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TTM is a new elicitation framework that uses m-1 comparisons to produce a complete, reciprocal, and consistent pairwise comparison matrix and a global value scale, reducing cognitive load and dimensionality from m(m-1)/2 to m; compatible with Deck of Cards; backed by a web tool.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional pairwise methods (e.g., fuzzy preference relations, Saaty’s multiplicative preference relations) require many comparisons, which increases cognitive burden, risk of inconsistency, and computational complexity in deriving consistent value scales. A more scalable, consistent, and user-friendly elicitation method is needed.

Method: Three-phase process: (i) elicitation via a reduced set of targeted m-1 comparisons; (ii) construction of a consistent reciprocal pairwise comparison matrix; (iii) derivation of a global value scale from the matrix. The approach is designed to guarantee consistency by construction, reduces cognitive effort, and lowers the modeling dimensionality to m parameters. It is compatible with the Deck of Cards method (allowing interval/ratio scales) and is supported by a web-based tool.

Result: From only m-1 comparisons, the method yields a complete, reciprocal, and consistent pairwise comparison matrix and an associated global value scale, while reducing cognitive load and dimensionality. It also maintains compatibility with Deck of Cards scales, and a web-based demonstration tool is available.

Conclusion: TTM presents a practical, theoretically sound alternative to classical pairwise methods, offering guaranteed consistency, reduced cognitive effort, and a compact m-parameter representation. The abstract suggests practical utility, with a web tool for real decision contexts; empirical validation and benchmarking against existing methods would strengthen its support.

Abstract: Pairwise comparison methods, such as Fuzzy Preference Relations and Saaty's
Multiplicative Preference Relations, are widely used to model expert judgments
in multi-criteria decision-making. However, their application is limited by the
high cognitive load required to complete $m(m-1)/2$ comparisons, the risk of
inconsistency, and the computational complexity of deriving consistent value
scales. This paper proposes the Tournament Tree Method (TTM), a novel
elicitation and evaluation framework that overcomes these limitations. The TTM
requires only $m-1$ pairwise comparisons to obtain a complete, reciprocal, and
consistent comparison matrix. The method consists of three phases: (i)
elicitation of expert judgments using a reduced set of targeted comparisons,
(ii) construction of the consistent pairwise comparison matrix, and (iii)
derivation of a global value scale from the resulting matrix. The proposed
approach ensures consistency by design, minimizes cognitive effort, and reduces
the dimensionality of preference modeling from $m(m-1)/2$ to $m$ parameters.
Furthermore, it is compatible with the classical Deck of Cards method, and thus
it can handle interval and ratio scales. We have also developed a web-based
tool that demonstrates its practical applicability in real decision-making
scenarios.

### [190] [DODO: Causal Structure Learning with Budgeted Interventions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08207)
*Matteo Gregorini,Chiara Boldrini,Lorenzo Valerio*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DODO is an active causal discovery method where an agent learns a hidden causal DAG by performing interventions, outperforming purely observational approaches and achieving near-perfect structure recovery in many settings, with notable gains in hard cases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To advance AI by enabling causality awareness: learning the underlying causal mechanisms of the environment can improve understanding, robustness, and generalization beyond correlational patterns.

Method: An agent interacts with a world governed by a hidden causal DAG. Through repeated interventions, it applies causal inference to evaluate the significance of observed changes and reconstruct the DAG, even under noise. The evaluation compares DODO against observational baselines across various resource conditions.

Result: DODO outperforms observational approaches in all but the most limited-resource conditions. It can reconstruct the causal graph with zero errors in many configurations, and in the hardest configuration achieves a +0.25 F1 advantage over the best baseline.

Conclusion: Active causal discovery via interventions is highly effective for learning hidden causal structures, enabling causality-aware AI that can better understand and predict environment dynamics; DODO demonstrates strong performance across resource settings, with robustness in noisy conditions.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence has achieved remarkable advancements in recent years,
yet much of its progress relies on identifying increasingly complex
correlations. Enabling causality awareness in AI has the potential to enhance
its performance by enabling a deeper understanding of the underlying mechanisms
of the environment. In this paper, we introduce DODO, an algorithm defining how
an Agent can autonomously learn the causal structure of its environment through
repeated interventions. We assume a scenario where an Agent interacts with a
world governed by a causal Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG), which dictates the
system's dynamics but remains hidden from the Agent. The Agent's task is to
accurately infer the causal DAG, even in the presence of noise. To achieve
this, the Agent performs interventions, leveraging causal inference techniques
to analyze the statistical significance of observed changes. Results show
better performance for DODO, compared to observational approaches, in all but
the most limited resource conditions. DODO is often able to reconstruct with as
low as zero errors the structure of the causal graph. In the most challenging
configuration, DODO outperforms the best baseline by +0.25 F1 points.

*Yunlong Deng,Boyang Sun,Yan Li,Lingjing Kong,Zeyu Tang,Kun Zhang,Guangyi Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Casts reasoning as a latent-variable selection task and introduces SR^2 to leverage latent feedback for learning dense dependencies, achieving notable gains with smaller models on Sudoku/Maze.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reasoning tasks are hard for LLMs; the latent space is complex and densely structured; leveraging latent variables as feedback may improve the learning of dependencies and task performance.

Method: SR^2 framework with reflective representation learning, dependency self-refinement, and periodic intermediate alignment; integrates estimated latent variables as feedback into the selection mechanism to learn dense latent dependencies.

Result: Reported >10% improvement in reasoning accuracy on Sudoku and Maze with 8× fewer parameters than recent advances.

Conclusion: A causal latent-space view clarifies reasoning challenges and shows that latent-variable feedback can enable efficient learning of dense dependencies, offering a promising direction for future reasoning models.

Abstract: Due to their inherent complexity, reasoning tasks have long been regarded as
rigorous benchmarks for assessing the capabilities of machine learning models,
especially large language models (LLMs). Although humans can solve these tasks
with ease, existing models, even after extensive pre-training and post-training
at scale, still fail to perform reasoning reliably. In this paper, we revisit
reasoning tasks from a causal perspective, seeking to understand their behavior
in latent space and to offer insights for addressing their challenges.
Specifically, we cast reasoning tasks as a selection mechanism, in which
high-level logical concepts function as selection operators on the given
observations, such as, identifying the correct answer in a math problem or
filling the appropriate entry in Sudoku. We emphasize two key properties of
this formulation that shed light on the difficulty of reasoning tasks. First,
the latent space exceeds the observation space in complexity, even when the
correct answer is fully determined by the observed input. Second, the latent
variables, corresponding to logical thought, are densely structured and exhibit
strong dependencies. Building on this formulation, we introduce a framework,
called SR$^2$, that incorporates the estimated latent variables as feedback
into the selection mechanism, thereby facilitating the learning of dense
dependencies among latent representations. The framework consists of three key
modules: reflective representation learning, dependency self-refinement, and
periodic intermediate alignment. Experimentally, we show that our approach
yields significant gains in reasoning accuracy, for example, attaining over
10$\%$ improvement in performance with 8$\times$ fewer parameters on the Sudoku
and Maze tasks over the recent advances.

### [192] [Chain-of-Trigger: An Agentic Backdoor that Paradoxically Enhances Agentic Robustness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08238)
*Jiyang Qiu,Xinbei Ma,Yunqing Xu,Zhuosheng Zhang,Hai Zhao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CoTri is a multi-step backdoor attack for long-horizon LLM-based agents, using an ordered trigger sequence to achieve near-perfect attack success with near-zero false trigger rates. It can even improve benign performance and robustness, and scales to vision-language models, raising stealthy safety risks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess trustworthiness and security of increasingly autonomous LLM-based agents operating over long time horizons. Traditional backdoors focus on single-step control; this work investigates chained, environment-driven triggers that can manipulate decisions across steps, highlighting emerging attack surfaces and the need for defenses.

Method: Introduce Chain-of-Trigger Backdoor (CoTri): an ordered sequence of triggers starting with an initial trigger, with subsequent triggers drawn from the environment to enable multi-step manipulation and deviations from intended tasks. Validate on large language model (LLM)-based agents and vision-language models (VLMs).

Result: CoTri achieves near-perfect attack success rate (ASR) with near-zero false trigger rate (FTR). Training data modeling environmental stochasticity paradoxically improves benign task performance and robustness to distractions. Demonstrates scalability to multimodal agents (VLMs).

Conclusion: CoTri shows that stable, multi-step control can be embedded in agents, increasing stealth and safety risks. The findings underscore the need for defenses against environment-driven, chain-like backdoors and caution in deploying autonomous agents in real-world settings.

Abstract: The rapid deployment of large language model (LLM)-based agents in real-world
applications has raised serious concerns about their trustworthiness. In this
work, we reveal the security and robustness vulnerabilities of these agents
through backdoor attacks. Distinct from traditional backdoors limited to
single-step control, we propose the Chain-of-Trigger Backdoor (CoTri), a
multi-step backdoor attack designed for long-horizon agentic control. CoTri
relies on an ordered sequence. It starts with an initial trigger, and
subsequent ones are drawn from the environment, allowing multi-step
manipulation that diverts the agent from its intended task. Experimental
results show that CoTri achieves a near-perfect attack success rate (ASR) while
maintaining a near-zero false trigger rate (FTR). Due to training data modeling
the stochastic nature of the environment, the implantation of CoTri
paradoxically enhances the agent's performance on benign tasks and even
improves its robustness against environmental distractions. We further validate
CoTri on vision-language models (VLMs), confirming its scalability to
multimodal agents. Our work highlights that CoTri achieves stable, multi-step
control within agents, improving their inherent robustness and task
capabilities, which ultimately makes the attack more stealthy and raises
potential safty risks.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Co-TAP introduces a three-layer protocol (HAI, UAP, MEK) to tackle interoperability, interaction, and knowledge sharing in multi-agent systems by standardizing human-agent interaction, enabling cross-agent interoperability via unified service discovery and protocol conversion, and establishing a Memory-Extraction-Knowledge cognitive loop for learning and shareable knowledge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is fragmentation in multi-agent ecosystems across humans, agents, and data sources. A unified, scalable framework is needed to ensure real-time interaction, seamless interoperability among heterogeneous agents, and accumulative knowledge for collective intelligence.

Method: Propose a layered architecture with three core protocols: (1) HAI (Human-Agent Interaction Protocol) to standardize event-driven user–agent interactions; (2) UAP (Unified Agent Protocol) to enable interoperability across heterogeneous agents through service discovery and protocol conversion; (3) MEK (Memory-Extraction-Knowledge) to define a cognitive chain that learns from experiences and yields shareable knowledge, forming a foundation for collective intelligence.

Result: Conceptual framework and architectural proposal. No empirical validation reported in the abstract; claims of enabling efficient, scalable, and intelligent MAS are grounded in design rather than experimental results.

Conclusion: If realized, Co-TAP provides an engineering foundation and theoretical guidance for next-generation MAS, promoting interoperability, robust interaction, and knowledge sharing to achieve true collective intelligence; practical challenges and evaluation remain to be addressed in future work.

Abstract: This paper proposes Co-TAP (T: Triple, A: Agent, P: Protocol), a three-layer
agent interaction protocol designed to address the challenges faced by
multi-agent systems across the three core dimensions of Interoperability,
Interaction and Collaboration, and Knowledge Sharing. We have designed and
proposed a layered solution composed of three core protocols: the Human-Agent
Interaction Protocol (HAI), the Unified Agent Protocol (UAP), and the
Memory-Extraction-Knowledge Protocol (MEK). HAI focuses on the interaction
layer, standardizing the flow of information between users, interfaces, and
agents by defining a standardized, event-driven communication paradigm. This
ensures the real-time performance, reliability, and synergy of interactions. As
the core of the infrastructure layer, UAP is designed to break down
communication barriers among heterogeneous agents through unified service
discovery and protocol conversion mechanisms, thereby enabling seamless
interconnection and interoperability of the underlying network. MEK, in turn,
operates at the cognitive layer. By establishing a standardized ''Memory (M) -
Extraction (E) - Knowledge (K)'' cognitive chain, it empowers agents with the
ability to learn from individual experiences and form shareable knowledge,
thereby laying the foundation for the realization of true collective
intelligence. We believe this protocol framework will provide a solid
engineering foundation and theoretical guidance for building the next
generation of efficient, scalable, and intelligent multi-agent applications.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ScaleGMNs enable amortized optimization by operating in weight space for single-shot fine-tuning, with a theoretical gauge-freedom result showing smaller scaling symmetry in CNNs than in MLPs; empirical gains in efficiency and generalization; open-source code available.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To accelerate solving related optimization problems by leveraging shared structure across problem instances through symmetry-aware metanetworks; explain observed performance differences across architectures via gauge freedom related to scaling.

Method: Propose Scale Equivariant Graph Metanetworks that operate directly in weight space to allow single-shot fine-tuning; incorporate scale symmetry (gauge) analysis; provide theoretical results on gauge freedom, especially comparing CNNs and MLPs; validate empirically across tasks.

Result: Empirical evidence shows effectiveness of ScaleGMNs in reducing iterative optimization needs; theoretical result indicates gauge freedom from scaling is smaller in CNNs than in MLPs, helping explain architecture-dependent performance differences; code released.

Conclusion: Symmetry-aware metanetworks like ScaleGMNs offer a powerful, efficient, and generalizable approach for amortized optimization; open-source implementation is provided.

Abstract: Amortized optimization accelerates the solution of related optimization
problems by learning mappings that exploit shared structure across problem
instances. We explore the use of Scale Equivariant Graph Metanetworks
(ScaleGMNs) for this purpose. By operating directly in weight space, ScaleGMNs
enable single-shot fine-tuning of existing models, reducing the need for
iterative optimization. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach
empirically and provide a theoretical result: the gauge freedom induced by
scaling symmetries is strictly smaller in convolutional neural networks than in
multi-layer perceptrons. This insight helps explain the performance differences
observed between architectures in both our work and that of Kalogeropoulos et
al. (2024). Overall, our findings underscore the potential of symmetry-aware
metanetworks as a powerful approach for efficient and generalizable neural
network optimization. Open-source code:

*Liwei Kang,Yue Deng,Yao Xiao,Zhanfeng Mo,Wee Sun Lee,Lidong Bing*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Reflections in large language model reasoning are mostly confirmatory and rarely change the initial answer. Training with longer reflection steps improves first-answer accuracy but does not reliably enable correction of wrong answers. The authors propose efficiency methods—question-aware early stopping and dynamic truncation after a candidate answer—that reduce reasoning tokens with modest accuracy impact (up to ~24.5% token reduction and ~2.9% accuracy loss across five math datasets).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand whether reflective rollouts meaningfully contribute to reasoning performance and to improve inference efficiency by reducing unnecessary reflections.

Method: Systematically analyze rollouts from eight reasoning models on five mathematical datasets to characterize reflective behavior (before finalizing outputs). Build supervised fine-tuning datasets with varying amounts of reflection steps; evaluate how training on longer reflections affects first-answer accuracy and the ability to correct wrong answers. Propose and evaluate an early-stopping method and a dynamic truncation strategy that cuts reasoning tokens after plausible candidate answers.

Result: Reflections are predominantly confirmatory and rarely alter the model’s initial answer across models/datasets. Training with more reflection steps mainly improves the correctness of the first answer, not the capacity to correct wrong answers via reflection. Dynamic truncation after a candidate answer reduces reasoning tokens by 24.5% across five mathematical datasets with only a 2.9% drop in accuracy.

Conclusion: Reflections do not substantially enhance error correction. Efficient inference can be achieved via early stopping and post-answer truncation, offering meaningful token savings with limited accuracy loss. Further work should test generalization beyond math and investigate when reflections might aid correction.

Abstract: Large language models have recently demonstrated significant gains in
reasoning ability, often attributed to their capacity to generate longer chains
of thought and engage in reflective reasoning. However, the contribution of
reflections to performance improvement remains unclear. In this paper, we
systematically analyze the rollouts of eight reasoning models on five
mathematical datasets. We focus on reflective behaviours where the model has
already produced an answer but continues reflecting before finalizing its
output. Our analysis reveals that reflections are predominantly confirmatory
and rarely alter the model's initial answer, a pattern consistent across models
and datasets. To understand the role of reflections in training, we construct
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) datasets with varying amounts of reflection steps.
We observe that training models on rollouts with more reflection steps
primarily enhances first-answer correctness rather than the ability to correct
initially wrong answers through reflections. This motivates us to propose a
question-aware early-stopping method that enhances inference-time token
efficiency by stopping the reasoning process once a few plausible candidate
answers are generated, thereby reducing unnecessary reflection steps. Motivated
by this, we further propose to dynamically truncate the reflections after a
candidate answer has appeared during generation, which reduces reasoning tokens
by 24.5% across five mathematical datasets, within a 2.9% drop in accuracy.

*Marius Dragoi,Ioana Pintilie,Florin Gogianu,Florin Brad*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Introduces Cover@tau to replace Pass@k for evaluating RLVR on discrete-output tasks; shows large-k Pass@k can be dominated by chance, not reasoning; Cover@tau enforces a reliability threshold and reveals different model rankings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pass@k is potentially misleading for discrete answer spaces where success can arise from random guessing at large sampling budgets; a reliability-based metric is needed to measure genuine reasoning boundaries.

Method: Define Cover@tau as the fraction of problems where at least a tau proportion of completions are correct; apply this metric to several RLVR models and compare against Pass@k results to assess reasoning boundaries.

Result: Cover@tau-based evaluation leads to different relative rankings than Pass@1; models that rely on random guessing degrade as tau increases, illustrating that Pass@k can overestimate reasoning; demonstrates the utility of Cover@tau for assessing reasoning under reliability constraints.

Conclusion: Cover@tau provides a more robust and interpretable measure of reasoning boundaries in RLVR for discrete-output tasks, prompting reevaluation of conclusions drawn from Pass@k and encouraging adoption of reliability-threshold metrics in evaluation.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a
powerful paradigm to improve Large Language Models on reasoning tasks such as
coding, math or logic. To assess the reasoning boundary (the fraction of
problems a model can solve) researchers often report Pass@k at large sampling
budgets. Recent results reveal a crossover phenomenon: while RLVR models
outperform the base model at small k values, the base model usually outperforms
them when sampling a very large number of completions. This has been
interpreted as evidence that base models have a larger reasoning boundary. We
argue that on tasks with discrete answer spaces, such as math with numeric
outputs, Pass@k at large k reflects the increasingly higher chance of success
in the limit of the number of trials rather than genuine reasoning, and can
therefore be misleading. We propose Cover@tau, which measures the fraction of
problems that a model can solve for which at least a tau proportion of
completions are correct. Unlike Pass@k, Cover@tau captures reasoning under an
explicit reliability threshold: models that rely on random guessing degrade
rapidly as tau increases. We evaluate several RLVR models using Cover@tau-based
metrics and illustrate how the relative rankings of popular algorithms change
compared to Pass@1, offering a different perspective on reasoning boundaries.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Semantic similarity rating (SSR) uses LLM-generated textual responses mapped to Likert scales via embedding similarity to reference statements, yielding human-like distributions and qualitative feedback. It achieves high reliability and realistic distributions, enabling scalable consumer research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address high costs and biases in traditional consumer panels, and limitations of using LLMs for direct numerical ratings. SSR aims to combine scalability of synthetic data with interpretability and realistic response distributions.

Method: Elicit textual responses from LLMs for consumer survey items, then map those responses to Likert distributions by measuring embedding similarity to reference statements in the scale. Validation on a large personal care product dataset (57 surveys, ~9,300 human responses).

Result: SSR attains ~90% of human test-retest reliability, KS similarity > 0.85 indicating close distributional alignment with human data, and yields rich qualitative explanations from synthetic respondents.

Conclusion: SSR enables scalable, interpretable consumer research simulations by preserving traditional survey metrics while leveraging LLMs, potentially alleviating panel biases and expanding data scale without sacrificing metric validity.

Abstract: Consumer research costs companies billions annually yet suffers from panel
biases and limited scale. Large language models (LLMs) offer an alternative by
simulating synthetic consumers, but produce unrealistic response distributions
when asked directly for numerical ratings. We present semantic similarity
rating (SSR), a method that elicits textual responses from LLMs and maps these
to Likert distributions using embedding similarity to reference statements.
Testing on an extensive dataset comprising 57 personal care product surveys
conducted by a leading corporation in that market (9,300 human responses), SSR
achieves 90% of human test-retest reliability while maintaining realistic
response distributions (KS similarity > 0.85). Additionally, these synthetic
respondents provide rich qualitative feedback explaining their ratings. This
framework enables scalable consumer research simulations while preserving
traditional survey metrics and interpretability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs have static parametric knowledge and struggle with knowledge-intensive tasks. Traditional RAG and RL-based search agents face generalization and deployment challenges. A retrieval-focused, interactive reasoning agent with modular design could improve performance and real-world applicability.

Method: Propose QAgent: a unified agentic RAG framework featuring a search agent for adaptive retrieval and interactive reasoning. Trains a multi-step decision process with reinforcement learning to maximize retrieval quality and downstream answer accuracy. Emphasizes a plug-and-play modular search component for use in complex systems. Analyzes end-to-end RL vs retrieval-focused strategies to enhance generalization.

Result: Empirical results indicate QAgent excels at QA tasks and can function as a plug-and-play module suitable for real-world deployment, with improved retrieval quality and potential gains in generalization compared to end-to-end RL baselines.

Conclusion: Focusing on effective retrieval and modular design can enhance generalization and real-world deployability of LLM-based systems. While end-to-end RL has limitations, a retrieval-focused, agentic RAG approach like QAgent offers a practical, adaptable framework.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at natural language tasks but are limited
by their static parametric knowledge, especially in knowledge-intensive task.
Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) mitigates this by integrating external
information. However, (1) traditional RAG struggles with complex query
understanding, and (2) even search agents trained with reinforcement learning
(RL), despite their promise, still face generalization and deployment
challenges. To address these limitations, we propose QAgent, a unified agentic
RAG framework that employs a search agent for adaptive retrieval. This agent
optimizes its understanding of the query through interactive reasoning and
retrieval. To facilitate real-world application, we focus on modular search
agent for query understanding that are plug-and-play in complex systems.
Secifically, the agent follows a multi-step decision process trained with RL to
maximize retrieval quality and support accurate downstream answers. We further
analyze the strengths and weaknesses of end-to-end RL and propose a strategy
that focuses on effective retrieval, thereby enhancing generalization in LLM
applications. Experiments show QAgent excels at QA and serves as a
plug-and-play module for real-world deployment.

### [199] [Revisiting Hallucination Detection with Effective Rank-based Uncertainty](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08389)
*Rui Wang,Zeming Wei,Guanzhang Yue,Meng Sun*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A spectral, effective-rank based method monitors uncertainty in LLMs across layers and multiple outputs to detect hallucinations. No extra modules; interpretable via semantic variation; robust across scenarios; supports a new paradigm for truthfulness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hallucinations hinder the trustworthy deployment of LLMs. Existing uncertainty-driven detectors may be insufficient; there is a need for methods that leverage internal representations and cross-output variations to quantify uncertainty with interpretability and efficiency.

Method: Compute hidden-state representations from multiple model outputs across different layers and induce an effective rank via spectral analysis to quantify uncertainty. Use multi-layer and multi-output representations to capture internal (single-response) and external (across responses) uncertainty. No extra knowledge or modules are required, and the approach emphasizes interpretability through semantic variation in representations.

Result: Empirical evaluations demonstrate effective hallucination detection and robust generalization across diverse scenarios. The method yields interpretable insights into internal reasoning, reflecting semantic variations across layers and outputs and establishing a practical, theoretically grounded approach.

Conclusion: The proposed spectral effective-rank uncertainty measure offers a theoretically grounded, efficient, and interpretable paradigm for hallucination detection in LLMs, contributing to improved truthfulness and deployment trustworthiness.

Abstract: Detecting hallucinations in large language models (LLMs) remains a
fundamental challenge for their trustworthy deployment. Going beyond basic
uncertainty-driven hallucination detection frameworks, we propose a simple yet
powerful method that quantifies uncertainty by measuring the effective rank of
hidden states derived from multiple model outputs and different layers.
Grounded in the spectral analysis of representations, our approach provides
interpretable insights into the model's internal reasoning process through
semantic variations, while requiring no extra knowledge or additional modules,
thus offering a combination of theoretical elegance and practical efficiency.
Meanwhile, we theoretically demonstrate the necessity of quantifying
uncertainty both internally (representations of a single response) and
externally (different responses), providing a justification for using
representations among different layers and responses from LLMs to detect
hallucinations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method effectively
detects hallucinations and generalizes robustly across various scenarios,
contributing to a new paradigm of hallucination detection for LLM truthfulness.

*Bianca-Mihaela Ganescu,Suchir Salhan,Andrew Caines,Paula Buttery*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Lightweight decoder-based multimodal model with token-wise dynamic gating for adaptive fusion of linguistic and visual cues under cognitively-plausible data limits; achieves competitive/superior performance on BLiMP, BLiMP Supplement, EWoK, Winoground, and VQA; gating yields interpretable patterns (content words pull from visual cues; function words from linguistic cues); limitations include information bottleneck from global image embeddings and training instability from dataset split.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of training vision–language models when data is cognitively plausible but severely limited. Seek efficient, interpretable fusion of multimodal information under BabyLM constraints.

Method: A lightweight decoder-based architecture with (1) token-wise dynamic gating for adaptive fusion of linguistic and visual information, (2) feature modulation and channel attention to maximize utility of limited visual data, and (3) auxiliary contrastive objectives for visual grounding. Evaluation on five benchmarks (BLiMP, BLiMP Supplement, EWoK, Winoground, VQA).

Result: The model achieves competitive or superior performance to multimodal baselines across evaluated benchmarks. The dynamic gate discovers interpretable, supervision-free patterns, biasing content words toward visual cues and function words toward linguistic cues. Identified limitations include an information bottleneck from the global image embeddings and training instability due to dataset split.

Conclusion: Dynamic gating is a powerful, interpretable approach for efficient multimodal learning under data constraints. It offers strong performance and transparency, but practical deployment should address embedding bottlenecks and stability concerns under split datasets.

Abstract: Training vision-language models on cognitively-plausible amounts of data
requires rethinking how models integrate multimodal information. Within the
constraints of the Vision track for the BabyLM Challenge 2025, we propose a
lightweight decoder-based architecture with (1) token-wise dynamic gating for
adaptive fusion of linguistic and visual cues, (2) feature modulation and
channel attention to maximise the utility of limited visual information and (3)
auxiliary contrastive objectives for visual grounding. Evaluation on five
benchmarks (BLiMP, BLiMP Supplement, EWoK, Winoground and VQA) shows
competitive or superior performance to multimodal baselines. More notably, our
dynamic gate discovers interpretable patterns without explicit supervision,
favouring visual cues for content words and linguistic cues for function words.
While we identify limitations in the Challenge constraints, such as the
information bottleneck created by global image embeddings and training
instability from the dataset split, our findings establish dynamic gating as a
powerful tool for efficient multimodal learning, offering both interpretability
and performance even under severe constraints.

### [201] [AutoMLGen: Navigating Fine-Grained Optimization for Coding Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08511)
*Shangheng Du,Xiangchao Yan,Dengyang Jiang,Jiakang Yuan,Yusong Hu,Xin Li,Liang He,Bo Zhang,Lei Bai*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AutoMLGen is an LLM-based coding agent that leverages a domain knowledge base and Monte Carlo Graph Search (MCGS) to enhance AutoML/MLE code generation, achieving state-of-the-art results under a 12-hour budget on MLE-Bench.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with fine-grained domain priors and knowledge transfer in Machine Learning Engineering tasks. Existing MLE search methods (linear or tree-like) limit cross-branch knowledge reuse and trajectory sharing, hindering self-evolution and search space diversity.

Method: AutoMLGen integrates a domain knowledge base for high-quality prior guidance and uses Monte Carlo Graph Search to guide exploration. MCGS retains tree-guided exploration but embeds a graph structure in the expansion stage to enable dynamic path reorganization, historical trajectory reuse, and multi-solution fusion. It also uses fine-grained operator sets to improve stability and convergence.

Result: On MLE-Bench, AutoMLGen achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple dimensions, including higher average medal rate and valid submission rate within a 12-hour budget (half the standard runtime). Code is available at the provided GitHub URL.

Conclusion: The approach improves stability and accelerates convergence by enabling self-evolution and collaborative learning through reusable trajectories and diverse search paths, demonstrating strong performance gains for AutoML-era coding tasks.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance in general
programming tasks. However, in Machine Learning Engineering (MLE) scenarios
such as AutoML and Kaggle competitions, achieving high performance depends
heavily on expert intervention and repeated adjustments rather than simply
generating correct code. When applied directly to these tasks, LLMs often lack
fine-grained domain priors, and existing MLE approaches that use linear or
tree-structured searches limit knowledge transfer to adjacent hierarchical
links. As a result, they cannot leverage past full trajectories or share
information across branches, limiting self-evolving ability and search space
diversity. To address these limitations, we introduce AutoMLGen, an LLM-based
coding agent that integrates a domain knowledge base for high-quality prior
guidance and Monte Carlo Graph Search (MCGS) for efficient exploration. MCGS
retains the tree-guided exploration of MCTS while embedding a graph structure
into the expansion stage to enable dynamic path reorganization, historical
trajectory reuse, and multi-solution fusion to support both self-evolution and
collaborative learning. Combined with fine-grained operator sets, this design
improves stability and accelerates convergence. Evaluation on the MLE-Bench
shows that AutoMLGen achieves state-of-the-art performance in numerous
dimensions, such as the average medal rate and the valid submission rate, under
a 12-hour budget (half the standard runtime). The code is available at

### [202] [CaRT: Teaching LLM Agents to Know When They Know Enough](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08517)
*Grace Liu,Yuxiao Qu,Jeff Schneider,Aarti Singh,Aviral Kumar*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CaRT teaches LLMs when to stop information gathering by fine-tuning on counterfactual trajectories and rationale, improving efficiency and task success in interactive domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Strategic information gathering requires knowing when to terminate to avoid overthinking or derailment; existing models lack robust termination policy.

Method: Fine-tune LLMs on counterfactual trajectory pairs (termination vs non-termination) and train them to verbalize the termination rationale; use counterfactuals to teach when to stop.

Result: CaRT improves information-gathering efficiency and task success rate compared with other fine-tuning methods in interactive medical diagnosis and math problem solving.

Conclusion: CaRT provides a principled approach to teach termination in multi-round tasks, enabling better decision timing and performance.

Abstract: Many tasks require learned models to strategically gather relevant
information over multiple rounds of interaction before actually acting on a
task. Strategic information gathering requires models to know not only how to
effectively acquire information, but also when to stop gathering information
and make a decision, in order to avoid overthinking or getting derailed when
acting. In this paper, we formalize this problem and introduce Counterfactuals
and Reasoning for Termination (CaRT), an approach for teaching LLMs when to
stop seeking information. To appropriately learn when to terminate, CaRT
fine-tunes LLMs using counterfactual pairs of trajectories, one where
termination is appropriate and a minimally modified version of the same
trajectory where it is not. It trains the LLM to explain the rationale for the
termination decision in either case via verbal reasoning, and imbues this
capability into the base LLM via fine-tuning. We instantiate CaRT in two
domains: interactive medical diagnosis and math problem solving. In both
domains, we find that CaRT improves the efficiency of information gathering and
task success rate compared to other fine-tuning methods.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: FlowSearch is a multi-agent framework that constructs and evolves a dynamic, structured knowledge flow to guide subtask execution and reasoning. It plans and expands the knowledge flow for parallel exploration and hierarchical task decomposition, while adapting in real time from intermediate feedback, achieving state-of-the-art results on general and scientific benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep research requires broad and deep reasoning across diverse knowledge spaces with multi-step dependencies. Existing agentic systems struggle to manage dynamic, structured reasoning flows at scale.

Method: Introduce FlowSearch, a multi-agent framework that actively constructs and evolves a structured knowledge flow. It enables strategic planning, expansion for parallel exploration and hierarchical task decomposition, and real-time adjustment based on intermediate reasoning outcomes and insights.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on GAIA, HLE, GPQA, and TRQA benchmarks, demonstrating effectiveness in multi-disciplinary research settings; code available at the provided GitHub link.

Conclusion: FlowSearch provides a scalable, adaptive approach to complex reasoning in scientific discovery, showing strong empirical results and potential to advance cross-disciplinary research.

Abstract: Deep research is an inherently challenging task that demands both breadth and
depth of thinking. It involves navigating diverse knowledge spaces and
reasoning over complex, multi-step dependencies, which presents substantial
challenges for agentic systems. To address this, we propose FlowSearch, a
multi-agent framework that actively constructs and evolves a dynamic structured
knowledge flow to drive subtask execution and reasoning. FlowSearch is capable
of strategically planning and expanding the knowledge flow to enable parallel
exploration and hierarchical task decomposition, while also adjusting the
knowledge flow in real time based on feedback from intermediate reasoning
outcomes and insights. FlowSearch achieves state-of-the-art performance on both
general and scientific benchmarks, including GAIA, HLE, GPQA and TRQA,
demonstrating its effectiveness in multi-disciplinary research scenarios and
its potential to advance scientific discovery. The code is available at

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Early experience: agents train on their own interaction data without rewards, using implicit world modeling and self-reflection to improve generalization and bridge imitation with reinforcement learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the limitations of learning from expert demonstrations and the inefficiency of long-horizon RL by leveraging agent-generated interaction data as supervision without rewards.

Method: Two strategies: (1) Implicit world modeling—ground the policy in environment dynamics using collected states; (2) Self-reflection—learn from suboptimal actions to improve reasoning and decision-making. Evaluation across eight diverse environments and multiple model families.

Result: The approaches consistently improve effectiveness and out-of-domain generalization; early experience provides a strong foundation for subsequent RL, and shows promise as a bridge between imitation learning and fully experience-driven agents, especially when rewards are verifiable.

Conclusion: Early experience is a practical and scalable paradigm that enhances learning efficiency, broadens generalization, and serves as a bridge between imitation learning and reinforcement learning.

Abstract: A long-term goal of language agents is to learn and improve through their own
experience, ultimately outperforming humans in complex, real-world tasks.
However, training agents from experience data with reinforcement learning
remains difficult in many environments, which either lack verifiable rewards
(e.g., websites) or require inefficient long-horizon rollouts (e.g., multi-turn
tool use). As a result, most current agents rely on supervised fine-tuning on
expert data, which is challenging to scale and generalizes poorly. This
limitation stems from the nature of expert demonstrations: they capture only a
narrow range of scenarios and expose the agent to limited environment
diversity. We address this limitation with a middle-ground paradigm we call
early experience: interaction data generated by the agent's own actions, where
the resulting future states serve as supervision without reward signals. Within
this paradigm we study two strategies of using such data: (1) Implicit world
modeling, which uses collected states to ground the policy in environment
dynamics; and (2) Self-reflection, where the agent learns from its suboptimal
actions to improve reasoning and decision-making. We evaluate across eight
diverse environments and multiple model families. Our approaches consistently
improve effectiveness and out-of-domain generalization, highlighting the value
of early experience. Moreover, in environments with verifiable rewards, our
results provide promising signals that early experience offers a strong
foundation for subsequent reinforcement learning, positioning it as a practical
bridge between imitation learning and fully experience-driven agents.

### [205] [How to Teach Large Multimodal Models New Skills](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08564)
*Zhen Zhu,Yiming Gong,Yao Xiao,Yaoyao Liu,Derek Hoiem*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Sequential fine-tuning of large multimodal models to acquire new skills while preserving prior abilities. A counting-bias probe links output-token distribution drift to forgetting. Two robust tuning recipes—update only self-attention projections or update only MLP Gate&Up with Down frozen—achieve strong target gains with minimal degradation on held-out tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mitigate catastrophic forgetting when extending large multimodal models with new skills; preserve general abilities while specializing.

Method: Evaluate sequential fine-tuning on five target skills across three model families and track eight held-out benchmarks. Observe a drift in output token distribution linked to forgetting using a counting-bias probe. Propose two lightweight tuning recipes: (i) update only self-attention projection layers; (ii) update only MLP Gate&Up while freezing Down projection. Compare across models/tasks.

Result: Both tuning recipes deliver strong target gains while largely preserving held-out performance. Forgetting on held-out tasks can partially recover at later stages and correlates with the counting-bias drift. Code provided at the linked repository.

Conclusion: Simple, robust fine-tuning strategies with limited parameter updates can expand LMM capabilities without erasing prior abilities, aided by a diagnostic counting-bias probe to monitor distribution drift.

Abstract: How can we teach large multimodal models (LMMs) new skills without erasing
prior abilities? We study sequential fine-tuning on five target skills while
monitoring general ability on eight held-out benchmarks across three model
families. We observe that apparent "forgetting" on held-out tasks after narrow
fine-tuning can partly recover at later stages. We trace this behavior to a
measurable shift in the output token distribution, manifested through a simple
counting-bias probe that co-varies with forgetting. Guided by this picture, we
identify two simple, robust tuning recipes that learn strongly while limiting
drift: (i) updating only the self-attention projection layers, and (ii)
updating only the MLP Gate&Up while freezing the Down projection. Across models
and tasks, these choices deliver strong target gains while largely preserving
held-out performance. Code is available at

*Petar Hristov,Ingrid Hotz,Talha Bin Masood*

Main category: cs.CG

TL;DR: Robust, exact-arithmetic methods for bivariate Jacobi sets and Reeb spaces using symbolic perturbation; automatically evaluates large polynomials; implementations and efficiency tested.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robustness challenges in multifield topologies due to floating-point errors and degeneracies; extend robustness techniques from scalar-field topology to multifield structures (Jacobi sets and Reeb spaces).

Method: Employ exact arithmetic and symbolic perturbation (Simulation of Simplicity) to guarantee correctness in multifield topologies; develop a method to automatically evaluate predicates expressed as large symbolic polynomials; implement and integrate robust algorithms for bivariate Jacobi sets and Reeb spaces; provide implementations and benchmark their efficiency.

Result: Implemented robust algorithms, with exact arithmetic and symbolic perturbation; developed automatic predicate evaluation for complex symbolic polynomials; provided working implementations and conducted efficiency evaluations showing feasibility and performance characteristics.

Conclusion: Exact arithmetic and symbolic perturbation enable robust multifield topologies (Jacobi sets and Reeb spaces); feasibility demonstrated with implemented methods and efficiency studies; acknowledges increase in computational complexity and suggests directions for optimization and broader application.

Abstract: We present theory and practice for robust implementations of bivariate Jacobi
set and Reeb space algorithms. Robustness is a fundamental topic in
computational geometry that deals with the issues of numerical errors and
degenerate cases in algorithm implementations. Computational topology already
uses some robustness techniques for the development of scalar field algorithms,
such as those for computing critical points, merge trees, contour trees, Reeb
graphs, Morse-Smale complexes, and persistent homology. In most cases,
robustness can be ensured with floating-point arithmetic, and degenerate cases
can be resolved with a standard symbolic perturbation technique called
Simulation of Simplicity. However, this becomes much more complex for
topological data structures of multifields, such as Jacobi sets and Reeb
spaces. The geometric predicates used in their computation require exact
arithmetic and a more involved treatment of degenerate cases to ensure
correctness. Neither of these challenges has been fully addressed in the
literature so far. In this paper, we describe how exact arithmetic and symbolic
perturbation schemes can be used to enable robust implementations of bivariate
Jacobi set and Reeb space algorithms. In the process, we develop a method for
automatically evaluating predicates that can be expressed as large symbolic
polynomials, which are difficult to factor appropriately by hand, as is
typically done in the computational geometry literature. We provide
implementations of all proposed approaches and evaluate their efficiency.

TL;DR: The abstract advocates early identification and longitudinal mapping of behavioral and emotional patterns in autistic children to preface skill development, proposing a framework for IT-focused educational aids to support learning and soft skills.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses a gap in understanding nuanced behavioral and emotional patterns in ASD before skill acquisition, aiming to establish a baseline and guide targeted interventions in inclusive education, especially within IT domains with limited opportunities.

Method: Longitudinal monitoring of emotions and behaviors to establish baseline needs; detailed analysis of behavioral trends over time; development of a targeted framework for applications and technical aids designed around identified needs; emphasizes sequential, evidence-based intervention.

Result: Proposes a longitudinal approach to identify patterns and a framework for IT-related educational tools; outlines expected insights into behavioral/emotional patterns and how they can inform tool development and intervention strategies.

Conclusion: Early identification of behavioral patterns and a baseline understanding are pivotal for effective skill development and inclusive learning for autistic children, with a focus on IT education opportunities.

Abstract: Autism Spectrum Disorder significantly influences the communication
abilities, learning processes, behavior, and social interactions of
individuals. Although early intervention and customized educational strategies
are critical to improving outcomes, there is a pivotal gap in understanding and
addressing nuanced behavioral patterns and emotional identification in autistic
children prior to skill development. This extended research delves into the
foundational step of recognizing and mapping these patterns as a prerequisite
to improving learning and soft skills. Using a longitudinal approach to monitor
emotions and behaviors, this study aims to establish a baseline understanding
of the unique needs and challenges faced by autistic students, particularly in
the Information Technology domain, where opportunities are markedly limited.
Through a detailed analysis of behavioral trends over time, we propose a
targeted framework for developing applications and technical aids designed to
meet these identified needs. Our research underscores the importance of a
sequential and evidence-based intervention approach that prioritizes a deep
understanding of each child's behavioral and emotional landscape as the basis
for effective skill development. By shifting the focus toward early
identification of behavioral patterns, we aim to foster a more inclusive and
supportive learning environment that can significantly improve the educational
and developmental trajectory of children with ASD.

*Sixuan Wang,Jiao Yin,Jinli Cao,Mingjian Tang,Yong-Feng Ge*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A modality-aware cooperative co-evolution approach (MACC-MGNAS) for multimodal graph neural architecture search accelerates architecture search and handles modality heterogeneity, achieving strong attack-prediction performance with reduced computation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vulnerability data are heterogeneous and multimodal; multimodal graph neural networks can improve attack-prediction, but designing architectures across modalities is hard. GA-based GNAS often handles a single modality, failing to capture modality heterogeneity.

Method: Propose MACC-MGNAS: a modality-aware cooperative co-evolution framework that divides a global chromosome into modality-specific gene groups managed by a coordinator and evolved by local workers, with reassembly for joint evaluation. Introduce modality-aware dual-track surrogate (MADTS) to speed evaluations and a similarity-based population diversity indicator (SPDI) to balance exploration/exploitation. Applies to VulCE vulnerability dataset.

Result: Achieves F1-score of 81.67% within 3 GPU-hours, outperforming the state-of-the-art by 8.7% F1 and reducing computation cost by 27%.

Conclusion: The modality-aware MACC framework effectively captures modality heterogeneity in multimodal GNN search, accelerates convergence, and improves attack-prediction performance, indicating strong potential for MGNN architecture search on multimodal vulnerability data.

Abstract: Co-exploitation attacks on software vulnerabilities pose severe risks to
enterprises, a threat that can be mitigated by analyzing heterogeneous and
multimodal vulnerability data. Multimodal graph neural networks (MGNNs) are
well-suited to integrate complementary signals across modalities, thereby
improving attack-prediction accuracy. However, designing an effective MGNN
architecture is challenging because it requires coordinating modality-specific
components at each layer, which is infeasible through manual tuning. Genetic
algorithm (GA)-based graph neural architecture search (GNAS) provides a natural
solution, yet existing methods are confined to single modalities and overlook
modality heterogeneity. To address this limitation, we propose a modality-aware
cooperative co-evolutionary algorithm for multimodal graph neural architecture
search, termed MACC-MGNAS. First, we develop a modality-aware cooperative
co-evolution (MACC) framework under a divide-and-conquer paradigm: a
coordinator partitions a global chromosome population into modality-specific
gene groups, local workers evolve them independently, and the coordinator
reassembles chromosomes for joint evaluation. This framework effectively
captures modality heterogeneity ignored by single-modality GNAS. Second, we
introduce a modality-aware dual-track surrogate (MADTS) method to reduce
evaluation cost and accelerate local gene evolution. Third, we design a
similarity-based population diversity indicator (SPDI) strategy to adaptively
balance exploration and exploitation, thereby accelerating convergence and
avoiding local optima. On a standard vulnerabilities co-exploitation (VulCE)
dataset, MACC-MGNAS achieves an F1-score of 81.67% within only 3 GPU-hours,
outperforming the state-of-the-art competitor by 8.7% F1 while reducing
computation cost by 27%.

TL;DR: MultiFair uses dual-level gradient modulation to balance learning across data modalities and demographic groups in multimodal medical classification, improving performance and fairness over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical decision systems need reliable, unbiased diagnoses from diverse data sources. Current multimodal models often underperform due to uneven modality learning and demographic bias, which can reinforce unfair outcomes and degrade overall accuracy.

Method: A training framework called MultiFair that dynamically modulates optimization gradients along two axes—data modalities and demographic groups—adjusting both direction and magnitude to balance learning and fairness during training.

Result: Experiments on two multimodal medical datasets with varying demographics show that MultiFair outperforms state-of-the-art multimodal and fairness methods.

Conclusion: Dual-level gradient modulation effectively mitigates the interplay between modality imbalance and demographic bias, yielding improved accuracy and fairness in multimodal medical classification.

Abstract: Medical decision systems increasingly rely on data from multiple sources to
ensure reliable and unbiased diagnosis. However, existing multimodal learning
models fail to achieve this goal because they often ignore two critical
challenges. First, various data modalities may learn unevenly, thereby
converging to a model biased towards certain modalities. Second, the model may
emphasize learning on certain demographic groups causing unfair performances.
The two aspects can influence each other, as different data modalities may
favor respective groups during optimization, leading to both imbalanced and
unfair multimodal learning. This paper proposes a novel approach called
MultiFair for multimodal medical classification, which addresses these
challenges with a dual-level gradient modulation process. MultiFair dynamically
modulates training gradients regarding the optimization direction and magnitude
at both data modality and group levels. We conduct extensive experiments on two
multimodal medical datasets with different demographic groups. The results show
that MultiFair outperforms state-of-the-art multimodal learning and fairness
learning methods.

*Aditya Chakravarty*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Two state-of-the-art models (GNN-RNN and MMST-ViT) for crop yield forecasting are benchmarked under realistic OOD cross-regional splits on CropNet; GNN-RNN generalizes better and trains much faster, while MMST-ViT struggles out-of-domain; spatial-temporal alignment is key for robust prediction and OOD evaluation is essential.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Assess cross-region generalization of deep learning yield predictors under climate-driven variability; current benchmarks lack realistic OOD testing across regions and years.

Method: Leave-one-cluster-out cross-validation across seven USDA regions on CropNet (over 1,200 counties, 2017-2022); year-ahead prediction; compare GNN-RNN and MMST-ViT; evaluate accuracy (RMSE) and training time; analyze regional transfer dynamics and identify structural dissimilarities.

Result: GNN-RNN shows superior cross-region generalization with positive correlations under geographic shifts; MMST-ViT in-domain good but degrades under OOD; Heartland and Northern Great Plains have RMSE <10 bu/acre for soybean; Prairie Gateway RMSE >20 bu/acre; GNN-RNN training 14 minutes vs MMST-ViT 31.5 hours (135x faster).

Conclusion: Spatial-temporal alignment drives robust generalization; transparent OOD evaluation is needed for equitable climate-aware forecasting; deployment viability favors faster, generalizable models like GNN-RNN; highlights limitations of purely data-centric model scaling.

Abstract: Climate change is increasingly disrupting agricultural systems, making
accurate crop yield forecasting essential for food security. While deep
learning models have shown promise in yield prediction using satellite and
weather data, their ability to generalize across geographic regions and years -
critical for real-world deployment - remains largely untested. We benchmark two
state-of-the-art models, GNN-RNN and MMST-ViT, under realistic
out-of-distribution (OOD) conditions using the large-scale CropNet dataset
spanning 1,200+ U.S. counties from 2017-2022. Through leave-one-cluster-out
cross-validation across seven USDA Farm Resource Regions and year-ahead
prediction scenarios, we identify substantial variability in cross-region
transferability. GNN-RNN demonstrates superior generalization with positive
correlations under geographic shifts, while MMST-ViT performs well in-domain
but degrades sharply under OOD conditions. Regions like Heartland and Northern
Great Plains show stable transfer dynamics (RMSE less than 10 bu/acre for
soybean), whereas Prairie Gateway exhibits persistent underperformance (RMSE
greater than 20 bu/acre) across both models and crops, revealing structural
dissimilarities likely driven by semi-arid climate, irrigation patterns, and
incomplete spectral coverage. Beyond accuracy differences, GNN-RNN achieves
135x faster training than MMST-ViT (14 minutes vs. 31.5 hours), making it more
viable for sustainable deployment. Our findings underscore that
spatial-temporal alignment - not merely model complexity or data scale - is key
to robust generalization, and highlight the need for transparent OOD evaluation
protocols to ensure equitable and reliable climate-aware agricultural
forecasting.

TL;DR: A data-centric approach for CUDA kernel generation: building ConCuR and training KernelCoder with reasoning traces to outperform strong baselines on KernelBench, while showing reasoning length as a difficulty metric.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-quality CUDA kernel data is scarce due to proprietary kernels, hindering supervised fine-tuning of LLMs for kernel generation; a curated dataset and reasoning traces can improve generation performance.

Method: Develop a pipeline to generate and curate high-quality CUDA kernels with reasoning traces; build ConCuR dataset of PyTorch, reasoning, and CUDA kernel pairs; train KernelCoder; evaluate in KernelBench against QwQ-32B and other models including frontier systems.

Result: KernelCoder substantially outperforms QwQ-32B and all open-source kernel-generation-tuned models; it also surpasses frontier models like DeepSeek-V3.1-Think and Claude-4-sonnet. The study also finds that average reasoning length correlates with task difficulty and can serve as a metric for kernel-generation difficulty.

Conclusion: A data generation and curation pipeline with reasoning traces improves kernel-generation models; the results and metrics offer guidance for future data collection and modeling efforts in kernel generation.

Abstract: GPU kernel generation by LLMs has recently experienced rapid development,
leveraging test-time scaling and reinforcement learning techniques. However, a
key challenge for kernel generation is the scarcity of high-quality data, as
most high-quality kernels are proprietary and not open-source. This challenge
prevents us from leveraging supervised fine-tuning to align LLMs to the kernel
generation task. To address this challenge, we develop a pipeline that
generates and curates high-quality CUDA kernels with reasoning traces,
motivated by a critical observation that concise yet informative reasoning
traces result in robust generation of high-performance kernels. Using this
pipeline, we construct our dataset ConCuR and introduce our model KernelCoder,
which is the first model trained on a curated dataset consisting of PyTorch,
reasoning, and CUDA kernel pairs, to our knowledge. In the KernelBench setup,
our model achieves significant improvements over the existing top-performing
model, QwQ-32B, and outperforms all open-source models fine-tuned for kernel
generation, as well as frontier models such as DeepSeek-V3.1-Think and
Claude-4-sonnet. Finally, we show that the average reasoning length can serve
as a metric to assess the difficulty of kernel generation tasks. The
observations, metrics, and our data collection and curation pipeline can help
obtain better data in the kernel generation task in the future.

*Yeskendir Koishekenov,Aldo Lipani,Nicola Cancedda*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ETD trains a base model to iterate over a small subset of reasoning-relevant layers during mid-training, amplifying latent reasoning without changing architecture or data. It yields large gains on reasoning benchmarks and introduces an adaptive-depth option.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Interpretability studies indicate reasoning computations concentrate in a limited range of layers. Targeting those layers during mid-training can boost reasoning efficiency without increasing model size or data requirements.

Method: During mid-training, train the model to repeatedly process a small subset of layers identified as reasoning-relevant. At inference, iterate on these selected layers (recursively) to enhance latent reasoning. The approach preserves architecture, parameters, hyperparameters, and training data. An adaptive-depth strategy is explored to vary computation per input token.

Result: On 17 reasoning benchmarks, ETD yields substantial gains: +28.4% relative accuracy on GSM8K and +36% on MATH with the OLMo-2 1B Base model. Adaptive depth further modulates computation per token and can improve efficiency/accuracy.

Conclusion: Recursive latent reasoning via selective layer iteration is a simple, effective path to stronger LLM reasoning without architectural or data changes, offering practical gains and a flexible computation strategy.

Abstract: Most efforts to improve the reasoning capabilities of large language models
(LLMs) involve either scaling the number of parameters and the size of training
data, or scaling inference computation by letting models generate complex
chains of thought. Motivated by interpretability studies showing that the
crucial computation required for reasoning tasks is concentrated in a limited
range of layers, we introduce Encode-Think-Decode (ETD), a method that enhances
the reasoning capabilities of a base model by training it to iterate over a
small subset of reasoning-relevant layers during the mid-training stage. ETD
amplifies latent reasoning while preserving the original architecture,
parameter count, hyperparameters, and training data composition. When iterating
on the selected layers at inference time, ETD models yield substantial gains on
17 reasoning benchmarks, including +28.4% relative accuracy improvement on
GSM8K and +36% on MATH with the OLMo-2 1B Base model. We also explore an
adaptive depth strategy that adjusts the computation per input token. Our
results show that recursive latent reasoning offers a simple and effective path
to stronger LLM reasoning.

*Nathan Boyer,Dorian Baudry,Patrick Rebeschini*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A new Best-of-Both-Worlds algorithm for linear contextual bandits with paid observations, achieving minimax-optimal Theta(T^{2/3}) regret in adversarial settings and poly-logarithmic regret in (corrupted) stochastic regimes, via FTRL with Matrix Geometric Resampling; it is computationally efficient.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address learning with costly observations in contextual bandits, requiring robustness to adversarial environments and strong performance in stochastic settings, while keeping computational efficiency.

Method: Extend Follow-the-Regularized-Leader (FTRL) with estimators enhanced by Matrix Geometric Resampling; construct a Best-of-Both-Worlds (BOBW) algorithm for this hard problem, leveraging the framework from BOBWhardproblems and tailoring analysis to the paid-observation setting.

Result: The proposed BOBW algorithm attains minimax-optimal regret Theta(T^{2/3}) in adversarial contexts and poly-logarithmic regret in corrupted stochastic regimes, with computational efficiency.

Conclusion: The work extends BOBW methods to the paid-observations linear contextual bandit setting, delivering robust performance across regimes and maintaining computational practicality.

Abstract: We study the problem of linear contextual bandits with paid observations,
where at each round the learner selects an action in order to minimize its loss
in a given context, and can then decide to pay a fixed cost to observe the loss
of any arm. Building on the Follow-the-Regularized-Leader framework with
efficient estimators via Matrix Geometric Resampling, we introduce a
computationally efficient Best-of-Both-Worlds (BOBW) algorithm for this
problem. We show that it achieves the minimax-optimal regret of
$\Theta(T^{2/3})$ in adversarial settings, while guaranteeing poly-logarithmic
regret in (corrupted) stochastic regimes. Our approach builds on the framework
from \cite{BOBWhardproblems} to design BOBW algorithms for ``hard problem'',
using analysis techniques tailored for the setting that we consider.

### [214] [Learning to Route LLMs from Bandit Feedback: One Policy, Many Trade-offs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07429)
*Wang Wei,Tiankai Yang,Hongjie Chen,Yue Zhao,Franck Dernoncourt,Ryan A. Rossi,Hoda Eldardiry*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: BaRP is a contextual bandit-based router that learns under partial feedback to select LLMs for each prompt, enabling test-time preference-driven trade-offs between accuracy and cost; it outperforms offline routers and even the largest LLM in experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deployment requires online decision making under partial feedback and varying user preferences for accuracy vs. cost; offline routers assume full-information labels which are unavailable in practice. A method that trains under bandit feedback and supports tunable preferences is needed.

Method: BaRP frames routing as a contextual bandit over prompt features and a user preference vector. It trains by simulating online feedback with partial observations, and supports preference-tunable inference at test time without retraining, enabling adaptation to each prompt and cost-accuracy trade-offs.

Result: In experiments, BaRP consistently outperforms strong offline routers by at least 12.46% and outperforms the largest LLM by at least 2.45%, with robust generalization to unseen tasks.

Conclusion: BaRP closes the gap between deployment feedback and training, enabling adaptive, cost-aware LLM routing that can be tuned for different preferences at test time without retraining.

Abstract: Efficient use of large language models (LLMs) is critical for deployment at
scale: without adaptive routing, systems either overpay for strong models or
risk poor performance from weaker ones. Selecting the right LLM for each query
is fundamentally an online decision problem: models differ in strengths, prices
fluctuate, and users value accuracy and cost differently. Yet most routers are
trained offline with labels for all candidate models, an assumption that breaks
in deployment, where only the outcome of the chosen model is observed. We
bridge this gap with BaRP, a Bandit-feedback Routing with Preferences approach
that trains under the same partial-feedback restriction as deployment, while
supporting preference-tunable inference: operators can dial the
performance/cost trade-off at test time without retraining. Framed as a
contextual bandit over prompt features and a user preference vector, our method
simulates an online feedback setting during training and adapts its routing
decisions to each new prompt, rather than depending on full-information offline
supervision. Comprehensive experiments show that our method consistently
outperforms strong offline routers by at least 12.46% and the largest LLM by at
least 2.45%, and generalizes robustly for unseen tasks.

*Ankur Naskar,Gugan Thoppe,Utsav Negi,Vijay Gupta*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A parameter-free Federated Temporal Difference (FTD) learning method with two-timescale updates and Polyak-Ruppert averaging achieves the optimal convergence rate rac{1}{NT} for Markovian data in both average-reward and discounted RL, enabling FL with heterogeneous environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Federated learning can accelerate reinforcement learning by distributing exploration and training across agents, but attaining the best convergence rate under Markovian data typically requires knowledge of unknown problem parameters, creating a gap for parameter-free methods in heterogeneous FL.

Method: Two-timescale Federated Temporal Difference (FTD) learning with Polyak-Ruppert averaging; designed to be parameter-free (no dependence on unknown problem constants); handles both average-reward and discounted RL with Markovian data.

Result: Proves the optimal rac{1}{NT} convergence rate in both average-reward and discounted settings for Markovian data; robust to heterogeneity across agents; results extend to single-agent settings as well.

Conclusion: The proposed parameter-free FTD approach closes the gap for FL in RL with Markovian data and heterogeneous environments, offering novel contributions even in the single-agent case.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) can dramatically speed up reinforcement learning by
distributing exploration and training across multiple agents. It can guarantee
an optimal convergence rate that scales linearly in the number of agents, i.e.,
a rate of $\tilde{O}(1/(NT)),$ where $T$ is the iteration index and $N$ is the
number of agents. However, when the training samples arise from a Markov chain,
existing results on TD learning achieving this rate require the algorithm to
depend on unknown problem parameters. We close this gap by proposing a
two-timescale Federated Temporal Difference (FTD) learning with Polyak-Ruppert
averaging. Our method provably attains the optimal $\tilde{O}(1/NT)$ rate in
both average-reward and discounted settings--offering a parameter-free FTD
approach for Markovian data. Although our results are novel even in the
single-agent setting, they apply to the more realistic and challenging scenario
of FL with heterogeneous environments.

### [216] [MoGU: Mixture-of-Gaussians with Uncertainty-based Gating for Time Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07459)
*Yoli Shavit,Jacob Goldberger*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MoGU is a probabilistic MoE for regression/time-series that treats each expert as a Gaussian and uses uncertainty-based gating to combine them, enabling direct mean-variance forecasts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard MoEs yield point estimates with input-based gates and lack calibrated uncertainty in forecasts. A probabilistic, uncertainty-aware MoE can provide both predictions and reliable uncertainty in time-series forecasting.

Method: Each expert outputs a Gaussian (mean and variance). The gating mechanism uses the experts' estimated variances to weight their contributions, replacing traditional input-based gating. Training optimizes likelihood/regression objectives so that the final output is a Gaussian with aggregated uncertainty.

Result: MoGU outperforms single experts and traditional MoEs on diverse time-series benchmarks and delivers well-calibrated uncertainties that correlate with forecasting errors.

Conclusion: MoGU offers a reliable, interpretable probabilistic forecast for regression/time-series tasks, with code available at the provided GitHub repository.

Abstract: We introduce Mixture-of-Gaussians with Uncertainty-based Gating (MoGU), a
novel Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework designed for regression tasks and
applied to time series forecasting. Unlike conventional MoEs that provide only
point estimates, MoGU models each expert's output as a Gaussian distribution.
This allows it to directly quantify both the forecast (the mean) and its
inherent uncertainty (variance). MoGU's core innovation is its
uncertainty-based gating mechanism, which replaces the traditional input-based
gating network by using each expert's estimated variance to determine its
contribution to the final prediction. Evaluated across diverse time series
forecasting benchmarks, MoGU consistently outperforms single-expert models and
traditional MoE setups. It also provides well-quantified, informative
uncertainties that directly correlate with prediction errors, enhancing
forecast reliability. Our code is available from:

*Alex Kipnis,Marcel Binz,Eric Schulz*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Metabeta is a transformer-based neural posterior estimator for Bayesian mixed-effects regression that amortizes inference via pre-training on simulated data, achieving MCMC-like accuracy at a fraction of the usual computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hierarchical data with multiple observations per group is common. Bayesian methods quantify uncertainty but are analytically intractable and computationally expensive with MCMC. Neural posterior estimation shifts computation to pre-training, enabling fast inference on new data.

Method: Introduce metabeta, a transformer-based neural network trained on simulated datasets with known ground-truth parameters to perform Bayesian mixed-effects regression. Evaluate on both simulated and real data and compare performance and computation time to MCMC-based parameter estimation.

Result: Metabeta achieves stable and comparable parameter estimation performance to MCMC while requiring a fraction of the computational time.

Conclusion: Neural posterior estimation with metabeta provides faster, scalable Bayesian inference for mixed-effects regression without sacrificing accuracy relative to traditional MCMC methods.

Abstract: Hierarchical data with multiple observations per group is ubiquitous in
empirical sciences and is often analyzed using mixed-effects regression. In
such models, Bayesian inference gives an estimate of uncertainty but is
analytically intractable and requires costly approximation using Markov Chain
Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. Neural posterior estimation shifts the bulk of
computation from inference time to pre-training time, amortizing over simulated
datasets with known ground truth targets. We propose metabeta, a
transformer-based neural network model for Bayesian mixed-effects regression.
Using simulated and real data, we show that it reaches stable and comparable
performance to MCMC-based parameter estimation at a fraction of the usually
required time.

### [218] [Surrogate Modeling for the Design of Optimal Lattice Structures using Tensor Completion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07474)
*Shaan Pakala,Aldair E. Gongora,Brian Giera,Evangelos E. Papalexakis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Tensor completion as a surrogate model improves design of lattice-structure materials under biased sampling, outperforming GP and XGBoost (≈5% higher R^2) and performing on par with uniformly random sampling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Designing materials with target mechanical properties is hard because the design space grows exponentially with variables and data are often biased toward easily synthesized samples; a robust surrogate is needed for non-uniformly sampled data.

Method: Propose tensor completion as the surrogate model; compare against Gaussian Process and XGBoost under biased sampling; empirical evaluation on optimal lattice-structure design for mechanical performance.

Result: Tensor completion yields about 5% higher R^2 than GP/XGBoost with biased sampling; its performance is comparable to models trained on uniformly random sampling.

Conclusion: Tensor completion is an effective surrogate for materials design under non-uniform data collection, enabling faster optimization and resilience to sampling bias.

Abstract: When designing new materials, it is often necessary to design a material with
specific desired properties. Unfortunately, as new design variables are added,
the search space grows exponentially, which makes synthesizing and validating
the properties of each material very impractical and time-consuming. In this
work, we focus on the design of optimal lattice structures with regard to
mechanical performance. Computational approaches, including the use of machine
learning (ML) methods, have shown improved success in accelerating materials
design. However, these ML methods are still lacking in scenarios when training
data (i.e. experimentally validated materials) come from a non-uniformly random
sampling across the design space. For example, an experimentalist might
synthesize and validate certain materials more frequently because of
convenience. For this reason, we suggest the use of tensor completion as a
surrogate model to accelerate the design of materials in these atypical
supervised learning scenarios. In our experiments, we show that tensor
completion is superior to classic ML methods such as Gaussian Process and
XGBoost with biased sampling of the search space, with around 5\% increased
$R^2$. Furthermore, tensor completion still gives comparable performance with a
uniformly random sampling of the entire search space.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A transformer-based GWAS framework (HEMERA) for lung cancer risk using raw SNP data; achieves very high AUC and offers explainability via Layer-wise Integrated Gradients, but external validation and bias concerns remain.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the need for genetic risk biomarkers in lung cancer and create an explainable, covariate-free model using GWAS SNP data.

Method: Explainable transformer deep learning on raw genotype data (SNPs), additive positional encodings, neural genotype embeddings, refined variant filtering; post hoc explainability with Layer-wise Integrated Gradients.

Result: Reported AUC > 99% on 27,254 MVP participants; SNP-level attributions align with known LC risk loci.

Conclusion: Supports transparent, hypothesis-generating models for personalized LC risk assessment, but validation and generalizability concerns pending.

Abstract: Lung cancer (LC) is the third most common cancer and the leading cause of
cancer deaths in the US. Although smoking is the primary risk factor, the
occurrence of LC in never-smokers and familial aggregation studies highlight a
genetic component. Genetic biomarkers identified through genome-wide
association studies (GWAS) are promising tools for assessing LC risk. We
introduce HEMERA (Human-Explainable Transformer Model for Estimating Lung
Cancer Risk using GWAS Data), a new framework that applies explainable
transformer-based deep learning to GWAS data of single nucleotide polymorphisms
(SNPs) for predicting LC risk. Unlike prior approaches, HEMERA directly
processes raw genotype data without clinical covariates, introducing additive
positional encodings, neural genotype embeddings, and refined variant
filtering. A post hoc explainability module based on Layer-wise Integrated
Gradients enables attribution of model predictions to specific SNPs, aligning
strongly with known LC risk loci. Trained on data from 27,254 Million Veteran
Program participants, HEMERA achieved >99% AUC (area under receiver
characteristics) score. These findings support transparent,
hypothesis-generating models for personalized LC risk assessment and early
intervention.

TL;DR: RL-based task offloading for IoWT using Q-learning to optimize energy vs. latency; models offloading as MDP; evaluated via ns-3 simulations; analyzes parameter impact on performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Wearables have limited energy and computation; evolving, latency-critical edge-offloaded applications require efficient utilization of nearby edge resources to enhance user experience.

Method: Formulate offloading as a Markov Decision Process and apply Q-learning so wearables learn optimal offloading without prior knowledge. Evaluate through extensive ns-3 simulations across applications/configurations; study how main Q-learning parameters affect performance metrics.

Result: Demonstrates trade-offs between energy consumption and task completion time; higher task offloading percentages and better latency/energy metrics depending on parameter settings; shows learning-based approach adapts to configurations.

Conclusion: RL-based offloading is a viable approach for IoWT; MDP+Q-learning enables adaptive, parameter-sensitive decisions without prior knowledge; system performance depends on parameter choices and network/configuration factors.

Abstract: Over the years, significant contributions have been made by the research and
industrial sectors to improve wearable devices towards the Internet of Wearable
Things (IoWT) paradigm. However, wearables are still facing several challenges.
Many stem from the limited battery power and insufficient computation resources
available on wearable devices. On the other hand, with the popularity of smart
wearables, there is a consistent increase in the development of new
computationally intensive and latency-critical applications. In such a context,
task offloading allows wearables to leverage the resources available on nearby
edge devices to enhance the overall user experience. This paper proposes a
framework for Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based task offloading in the IoWT. We
formulate the task offloading process considering the tradeoff between energy
consumption and task accomplishment time. Moreover, we model the task
offloading problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and utilize the
Q-learning technique to enable the wearable device to make optimal task
offloading decisions without prior knowledge. We evaluate the performance of
the proposed framework through extensive simulations for various applications
and system configurations conducted in the ns-3 network simulator. We also show
how varying the main system parameters of the Q-learning algorithm affects the
overall performance in terms of average task accomplishment time, average
energy consumption, and percentage of tasks offloaded.

*Shuangyi Chen,Ashish Khisti*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SurpMark is a reference-based detector for machine-generated text that uses discretized token surprisal dynamics and a generalized Jensen-Shannon gap to detect generation under black-box constraints; it achieves strong empirical performance and is supported by asymptotic normality theory and principled discretization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Under practical constraints, black-box detectors face mismatch between the scoring model and the source model, and per-input contrastive generation is costly. A robust, reference-based detector that does not rely on exact model knowledge is needed.

Method: Quantize token surprisals into discrete states; estimate a state-transition matrix for the test passage; compute a generalized Jensen-Shannon gap between the test transitions and two fixed references (human vs. machine) built from historical corpora.

Result: SurpMark matches or surpasses baselines across multiple datasets, source models, and scenarios; experiments corroborate the statistic’s asymptotic normality and show that the discretization ablation is effective.

Conclusion: The paper provides a principled discretization criterion and an asymptotically normal decision statistic for robust black-box machine-generated text detection, with practical effectiveness across diverse settings.

Abstract: We study black-box detection of machine-generated text under practical
constraints: the scoring model (proxy LM) may mismatch the unknown source
model, and per-input contrastive generation is costly. We propose SurpMark, a
reference-based detector that summarizes a passage by the dynamics of its token
surprisals. SurpMark quantizes surprisals into interpretable states, estimates
a state-transition matrix for the test text, and scores it via a generalized
Jensen-Shannon (GJS) gap between the test transitions and two fixed references
(human vs. machine) built once from historical corpora. We prove a principled
discretization criterion and establish the asymptotic normality of the decision
statistic. Empirically, across multiple datasets, source models, and scenarios,
SurpMark consistently matches or surpasses baselines; our experiments
corroborate the statistic's asymptotic normality, and ablations validate the
effectiveness of the proposed discretization.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PEAR introduces a benchmark for planner-executor LLM-based MAS to jointly assess task utility and system vulnerability, showing planner weaknesses and planner-targeted attacks are especially harmful, and highlighting robustnessTrade-offs and defense opportunities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need for a holistic understanding of MAS vulnerabilities beyond isolated attack studies. A unified benchmark can evaluate both performance (utility) and resilience (vulnerability) across MAS designs.

Method: Propose PEAR benchmark focusing on the planner-executor MAS architecture. It is designed to be compatible with various MAS implementations. The evaluation uses systematic perturbations/attacks to probe both task performance and robustness, including ablations on planner vs executor components and memory modules, to reveal interactions between components and defenses.

Result: Key findings: (1) a weak planner degrades clean task performance more than a weak executor; (2) a memory module is essential for the planner, but memory in the executor does not impact clean task performance; (3) there is a trade-off between task performance and robustness; (4) attacks targeting the planner are particularly effective at misleading the system.

Conclusion: The work provides actionable insights for strengthening MAS robustness and establishes a foundation for principled defenses in multi-agent settings, via a benchmark that captures both utility and vulnerability in planner-executor MAS.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) have emerged as a
powerful paradigm for tackling complex, multi-step tasks across diverse
domains. However, despite their impressive capabilities, MAS remain susceptible
to adversarial manipulation. Existing studies typically examine isolated attack
surfaces or specific scenarios, leaving a lack of holistic understanding of MAS
vulnerabilities. To bridge this gap, we introduce PEAR, a benchmark for
systematically evaluating both the utility and vulnerability of
planner-executor MAS. While compatible with various MAS architectures, our
benchmark focuses on the planner-executor structure, which is a practical and
widely adopted design. Through extensive experiments, we find that (1) a weak
planner degrades overall clean task performance more severely than a weak
executor; (2) while a memory module is essential for the planner, having a
memory module for the executor does not impact the clean task performance; (3)
there exists a trade-off between task performance and robustness; and (4)
attacks targeting the planner are particularly effective at misleading the
system. These findings offer actionable insights for enhancing the robustness
of MAS and lay the groundwork for principled defenses in multi-agent settings.

TL;DR: The paper provides a theoretical and convergence analysis of multimodal co-training under limited labels, introducing a new generalization bound that separately accounts for unlabeled data, inter-view agreement, and conditional view independence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve data efficiency and robustness when labeled data is scarce and distribution shifts occur, by leveraging unlabeled multimodal data and cross-view agreement.

Method: Theoretical derivations: conditions for improvements from unlabeled data and cross-modal agreement; a convergence analysis of iterative co-training; a novel generalization bound decomposing contributions from unlabeled data, agreement, and independence.

Result: Under stated conditions, co-training reduces classification errors and yields better generalization; the bound clarifies how each component contributes; provides guidance for deploying multimodal co-training in dynamic environments.

Conclusion: Multimodal co-training is a principled, data-efficient approach with practical benefits for robust AI in real-world settings; the work connects to established co-training principles and extends them to multimodal contexts.

Abstract: This paper explores a multimodal co-training framework designed to enhance
model generalization in situations where labeled data is limited and
distribution shifts occur. We thoroughly examine the theoretical foundations of
this framework, deriving conditions under which the use of unlabeled data and
the promotion of agreement between classifiers for different modalities lead to
significant improvements in generalization. We also present a convergence
analysis that confirms the effectiveness of iterative co-training in reducing
classification errors. In addition, we establish a novel generalization bound
that, for the first time in a multimodal co-training context, decomposes and
quantifies the distinct advantages gained from leveraging unlabeled multimodal
data, promoting inter-view agreement, and maintaining conditional view
independence. Our findings highlight the practical benefits of multimodal
co-training as a structured approach to developing data-efficient and robust AI
systems that can effectively generalize in dynamic, real-world environments.
The theoretical foundations are examined in dialogue with, and in advance of,
established co-training principles.

*Qinghua Liu,Sam Heshmati,Zheda Mai,Zubin Abraham,John Paparrizos,Liu Ren*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A vision-augmented multimodal LLM framework (MLLM4TS) analyzes multivariate time series by rendering channels as a single composite image and aligning visual patches with time segments, enabling improved classification, anomaly detection, and forecasting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Time-series data have complex temporal and cross-channel dependencies; bridging numerical data with language models via visuals can improve understanding and generalization.

Method: Introduce MLLM4TS with a dedicated vision branch; render channels as horizontally stacked color-coded line plots in one image to capture cross-channel spatial relations; apply temporal-aware visual patch alignment to map patches to time segments; fuse fine-grained numerical data with global visual context for multimodal analysis.

Result: Experiments on standard benchmarks show effectiveness in predictive (classification) and generative tasks (anomaly detection, forecasting), suggesting robustness and generalizability of the approach.

Conclusion: Integrating visual modalities with pretrained LLMs unlocks robust, generalizable time-series analysis; MLLM4TS demonstrates the viability of a unified multimodal framework for time-series tasks.

Abstract: Effective analysis of time series data presents significant challenges due to
the complex temporal dependencies and cross-channel interactions in
multivariate data. Inspired by the way human analysts visually inspect time
series to uncover hidden patterns, we ask: can incorporating visual
representations enhance automated time-series analysis? Recent advances in
multimodal large language models have demonstrated impressive generalization
and visual understanding capability, yet their application to time series
remains constrained by the modality gap between continuous numerical data and
discrete natural language. To bridge this gap, we introduce MLLM4TS, a novel
framework that leverages multimodal large language models for general
time-series analysis by integrating a dedicated vision branch. Each time-series
channel is rendered as a horizontally stacked color-coded line plot in one
composite image to capture spatial dependencies across channels, and a
temporal-aware visual patch alignment strategy then aligns visual patches with
their corresponding time segments. MLLM4TS fuses fine-grained temporal details
from the numerical data with global contextual information derived from the
visual representation, providing a unified foundation for multimodal
time-series analysis. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate
the effectiveness of MLLM4TS across both predictive tasks (e.g.,
classification) and generative tasks (e.g., anomaly detection and forecasting).
These results underscore the potential of integrating visual modalities with
pretrained language models to achieve robust and generalizable time-series
analysis.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automated sleep staging to reduce manual annotation burden and to capture transient/oscillatory patterns in EEG. Time-frequency analysis with wavelets can provide robust, interpretable features across sleep bands.

Method: Compute continuous wavelet transform (CWT) to generate time-frequency maps from EEG, extract wavelet-based features, and classify using an ensemble learning method. Evaluation on the Sleep-EDF Expanded Database (sleep-cassette) with reporting of accuracy and macro F1.

Result: Overall accuracy of 88.37% and macro-averaged F1 score of 73.15. The approach outperforms conventional machine learning methods and is comparable or superior to recent deep learning approaches.

Conclusion: Wavelet-based representation with ensemble learning provides robust, interpretable, and clinically applicable sleep stage classification, showing strong potential as an automated alternative or complement to existing methods.

Abstract: Accurate classification of sleep stages is crucial for the diagnosis and
management of sleep disorders. Conventional approaches for sleep scoring rely
on manual annotation or features extracted from EEG signals in the time or
frequency domain. This study proposes a novel framework for automated sleep
stage scoring using time-frequency analysis based on the wavelet transform. The
Sleep-EDF Expanded Database (sleep-cassette recordings) was used for
evaluation. The continuous wavelet transform (CWT) generated time-frequency
maps that capture both transient and oscillatory patterns across frequency
bands relevant to sleep staging. Experimental results demonstrate that the
proposed wavelet-based representation, combined with ensemble learning,
achieves an overall accuracy of 88.37 percent and a macro-averaged F1 score of
73.15, outperforming conventional machine learning methods and exhibiting
comparable or superior performance to recent deep learning approaches. These
findings highlight the potential of wavelet analysis for robust, interpretable,
and clinically applicable sleep stage classification.

### [226] [Estimating Fair Graphs from Graph-Stationary Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07536)
*Madeline Navarro,Andrei Buciulea,Samuel Rey,Antonio G. Marques,Santiago Segarra*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes FairSpecTemp, an optimization-based framework to estimate fair graphs from graph-stationary nodal data, with two variants for bias control, plus spectral bias metrics and strong performance bounds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Edges in real graphs bias connections between groups; fairness in graph tasks is challenged; need methods to recover fair graphs from observations.

Method: FairSpecTemp uses graph-stationary models; two variants: (i) direct bias constraints via commutativity properties of stationarity; (ii) spectral-bias constraint to implicitly promote fairness; introduces spectral-domain bias metrics; provides theoretical high-probability bounds.

Result: Provides conditional tradeoff between fairness and accuracy; shows accuracy need not be sacrificed to recover fair graphs; validated on synthetic and real-world datasets; demonstrates advantages of both variants.

Conclusion: FairSpecTemp enables fair graph estimation from stationary signals with flexible bias control; spectral metrics enable evaluation; practical for reducing unfair connections while preserving performance.

Abstract: We estimate fair graphs from graph-stationary nodal observations such that
connections are not biased with respect to sensitive attributes. Edges in
real-world graphs often exhibit preferences for connecting certain pairs of
groups. Biased connections can not only exacerbate but even induce unfair
treatment for downstream graph-based tasks. We therefore consider group and
individual fairness for graphs corresponding to group- and node-level
definitions, respectively. To evaluate the fairness of a given graph, we
provide multiple bias metrics, including novel measurements in the spectral
domain. Furthermore, we propose Fair Spectral Templates (FairSpecTemp), an
optimization-based method with two variants for estimating fair graphs from
stationary graph signals, a general model for graph data subsuming many
existing ones. One variant of FairSpecTemp exploits commutativity properties of
graph stationarity while directly constraining bias, while the other implicitly
encourages fair estimates by restricting bias in the graph spectrum and is thus
more flexible. Our methods enjoy high probability performance bounds, yielding
a conditional tradeoff between fairness and accuracy. In particular, our
analysis reveals that accuracy need not be sacrificed to recover fair graphs.
We evaluate FairSpecTemp on synthetic and real-world data sets to illustrate
its effectiveness and highlight the advantages of both variants of
FairSpecTemp.

### [227] [Targeted Digital Twin via Flow Map Learning and Its Application to Fluid Dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07549)
*Qifan Chen,Zhongshu Xu,Jinjin Zhang,Dongbin Xiu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A data-driven framework builds a targeted digital twin (tDT) for quantities of interest (QoIs) using memory-based flow map learning (FML), trained offline from full DT trajectories, enabling fast online predictions of long-term QoI dynamics without full DT simulations; demonstrated on 2D CFD flow past a cylinder where the QoIs are hydrodynamic cylinder forces.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reduce computational cost and enable fast, long-horizon predictions of specific QoIs in complex dynamical systems by avoiding repeated simulations of the full model, while still maintaining accuracy for the QoIs of interest.

Method: 1) Generate short trajectory bursts by executing the full digital twin (DT) offline. 2) Learn a memory-based flow map (FML) that maps past QoI states to future QoI states, capturing dynamics via short-term memory. 3) Construct a compact tDT that evolves QoIs without requiring the underlying flow field. 4) Use the learned tDT online to predict long-term QoI dynamics efficiently.

Result: The resulting tDTs accurately predict long-term QoI dynamics (hydrodynamic forces on a cylinder) while bypassing full flow simulations, achieving substantial computational savings and preserving key dynamical behavior.

Conclusion: Memory-based FML can produce compact, offline-trained tDTs that reliably forecast QoI dynamics over long horizons, offering substantial speedups for QoI-focused simulations and providing a practical approach for building targeted digital twins.

Abstract: We present a numerical framework for constructing a targeted digital twin
(tDT) that directly models the dynamics of quantities of interest (QoIs) in a
full digital twin (DT). The proposed approach employs memory-based flow map
learning (FML) to develop a data-driven model of the QoIs using short bursts of
trajectory data generated through repeated executions of the full DT. This
renders the construction of the FML-based tDT an entirely offline computational
process. During online simulation, the learned tDT can efficiently predict and
analyze the long-term dynamics of the QoIs without requiring simulations of the
full DT system, thereby achieving substantial computational savings. After
introducing the general numerical procedure, we demonstrate the construction
and predictive capability of the tDT in a computational fluid dynamics (CFD)
example: two-dimensional incompressible flow past a cylinder. The QoIs in this
problem are the hydrodynamic forces exerted on the cylinder. The resulting tDTs
are compact dynamical systems that evolve these forces without explicit
knowledge of the underlying flow field. Numerical results show that the tDTs
yield accurate long-term predictions of the forces while entirely bypassing
full flow simulations.

### [228] [Phase Diagram of Dropout for Two-Layer Neural Networks in the Mean-Field Regime](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07554)
*Lénaïc Chizat,Pierre Marion,Yerkin Yesbay*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Large-width gradient descent with dropout on two-layer neural networks reveals a five-phase regime depending on dropout rate, learning rate, and width; the traditional regularization penalty of dropout only appears at impractically small learning rates, while at larger learning rates dropout behaves as a random thinning of gradients, described by a mean-field jump process.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To theoretically understand dropout's role in large neural networks by analyzing the large-width, mean-field regime; bridge empirical benefits with rigorous asymptotics and characterize how dropout interacts with learning rate and width.

Method: Analyze gradient descent with dropout in the large-width limit for two-layer networks with mean-field initialization; derive a five-phase nondegenerate phase diagram as functions of dropout rate, learning rate, and width; prove convergence to mean-field jump processes and provide path-space and distribution-space descriptions in certain phases using mean-field particle system and stochastic process tools.

Result: Five distinct nondegenerate phases identified depending on dropout rate, learning rate, and width. The regularization (penalty) effect of dropout persists only for learning rates of order 1/width; for larger learning rates, dropout acts as random thinning (a 'random geometry' technique). In the large-width limit, the dynamics converge to a mean-field jump process with neuron update times governed by independent Poisson or Bernoulli clocks; in some phases, both path-space and distribution-space descriptions are obtained.

Conclusion: This work lays a rigorous foundation for understanding dropout in large-scale networks, clarifying when dropout behaves as a regularizer versus a thinning mechanism, and providing detailed asymptotic descriptions (path and distribution) across multiple regimes that guide future theoretical and practical exploration.

Abstract: Dropout is a standard training technique for neural networks that consists of
randomly deactivating units at each step of their gradient-based training. It
is known to improve performance in many settings, including in the large-scale
training of language or vision models. As a first step towards understanding
the role of dropout in large neural networks, we study the large-width
asymptotics of gradient descent with dropout on two-layer neural networks with
the mean-field initialization scale. We obtain a rich asymptotic phase diagram
that exhibits five distinct nondegenerate phases depending on the relative
magnitudes of the dropout rate, the learning rate, and the width. Notably, we
find that the well-studied "penalty" effect of dropout only persists in the
limit with impractically small learning rates of order $O(1/\text{width})$. For
larger learning rates, this effect disappears and in the limit, dropout is
equivalent to a "random geometry" technique, where the gradients are thinned
randomly after the forward and backward pass have been computed. In this
asymptotic regime, the limit is described by a mean-field jump process where
the neurons' update times follow independent Poisson or Bernoulli clocks
(depending on whether the learning rate vanishes or not). For some of the
phases, we obtain a description of the limit dynamics both in path-space and in
distribution-space. The convergence proofs involve a mix of tools from
mean-field particle systems and stochastic processes. Together, our results lay
the groundwork for a renewed theoretical understanding of dropout in
large-scale neural networks.

TL;DR: BERTopic on lmsys-chat-1m uncovers 29 topics in multilingual LLM evaluation data and links topics to user preferences to inform model fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reveal thematic patterns in multilingual LLM evaluations and understand how topic context influences model preference.

Method: Preprocess multilingual turns; balance dialogue turns; apply BERTopic; analyze topic-model preferences; visualize inter-topic maps and model-topic matrices.

Result: 29 coherent topics discovered; clear associations between topics and model preferences; insights for targeted fine-tuning.

Conclusion: Topic-aware optimization can improve real-world LLM performance and user satisfaction; guidance for domain-specific tuning.

Abstract: This study applies BERTopic, a transformer-based topic modeling technique, to
the lmsys-chat-1m dataset, a multilingual conversational corpus built from
head-to-head evaluations of large language models (LLMs). Each user prompt is
paired with two anonymized LLM responses and a human preference label, used to
assess user evaluation of competing model outputs. The main objective is
uncovering thematic patterns in these conversations and examining their
relation to user preferences, particularly if certain LLMs are consistently
preferred within specific topics. A robust preprocessing pipeline was designed
for multilingual variation, balancing dialogue turns, and cleaning noisy or
redacted data. BERTopic extracted over 29 coherent topics including artificial
intelligence, programming, ethics, and cloud infrastructure. We analysed
relationships between topics and model preferences to identify trends in
model-topic alignment. Visualization techniques included inter-topic distance
maps, topic probability distributions, and model-versus-topic matrices. Our
findings inform domain-specific fine-tuning and optimization strategies for
improving real-world LLM performance and user satisfaction.

Method: Integrates energy-based models, Mixture Density Networks (MDNs), and adversarial training. Utilizes a modified InfoNCE loss and an energy-enforced MDN loss to promote diverse, accurate predictions and stabilize training.

Result: Experiments on synthetic and robotic benchmarks show superior performance and efficiency of EBGAN-MDN compared to baselines in multi-modal tasks.

Conclusion: EBGAN-MDN offers an effective and scalable framework for multi-modal learning tasks, particularly in robotics, by mitigating mode averaging and mode collapse while maintaining accuracy.

Abstract: Multi-modal behavior cloning faces significant challenges due to mode
averaging and mode collapse, where traditional models fail to capture diverse

these challenges. Experiments on synthetic and robotic benchmarks demonstrate

TL;DR: LOTUS uses Optimal Transport to compare unlabeled datasets and recommends a single, unified pipeline for unsupervised tasks like outlier detection and clustering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Model selection in unsupervised learning remains challenging, especially across diverse datasets. The authors hypothesize that datasets with similar underlying distributions should be solvable by similar pipelines, enabling a data-driven, cross-dataset model selection strategy.

Method: Compute Optimal Transport distances between unlabeled tabular datasets to quantify distributional similarity. Use this similarity to recommend a single, unified pipeline for two downstream unsupervised tasks (outlier detection and clustering). Validate against strong baselines on benchmark datasets.

Result: LOTUS achieves competitive or superior performance against strong baselines and demonstrates promise as a first step toward model selection for multiple unsupervised ML tasks.

Conclusion: A simple and effective approach that leverages distributional similarity via Optimal Transport to guide model selection for multiple unsupervised tasks; potential for broad applicability and extension to additional tasks.

Abstract: In this work, we present LOTUS (Learning to Learn with Optimal Transport for
Unsupervised Scenarios), a simple yet effective method to perform model
selection for multiple unsupervised machine learning(ML) tasks such as outlier
detection and clustering. Our intuition behind this work is that a machine
learning pipeline will perform well in a new dataset if it previously worked
well on datasets with a similar underlying data distribution. We use Optimal
Transport distances to find this similarity between unlabeled tabular datasets
and recommend machine learning pipelines with one unified single method on two
downstream unsupervised tasks: outlier detection and clustering. We present the
effectiveness of our approach with experiments against strong baselines and
show that LOTUS is a very promising first step toward model selection for
multiple unsupervised ML tasks.

*Ryan T. Tymkow,Benjamin D. Schnapp,Mojtaba Valipour,Ali Ghodshi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A diffusion-based approach for symbolic regression that models discrete token diffusion to generate all equation tokens simultaneously, matching or surpassing Transformer autoregressive methods like SymbolicGPT on a common dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome left-to-right token generation limitations of autoregressive models in neural-symbolic regression and explore a non-autoregressive generation paradigm.

Method: Introduce Symbolic Diffusion, a D3PM-based discrete state-space diffusion model that generates all tokens at once; uses discrete diffusion over symbolic tokens; compares to SymbolicGPT with equivalent encoder/transformer architecture on the SymbolicGPT bivariate dataset.

Result: Achieves comparable performance and, on some metrics, improvements over autoregressive SymbolicGPT-style models with similar architectures.

Conclusion: Discrete diffusion is a viable alternative for neural-symbolic regression, enabling simultaneous token generation and potentially enabling new research directions.

Abstract: Symbolic regression refers to the task of finding a closed-form mathematical
expression to fit a set of data points. Genetic programming based techniques
are the most common algorithms used to tackle this problem, but recently,
neural-network based approaches have gained popularity. Most of the leading
neural-network based models used for symbolic regression utilize
transformer-based autoregressive models to generate an equation conditioned on
encoded input points. However, autoregressive generation is limited to
generating tokens left-to-right, and future generated tokens are conditioned
only on previously generated tokens. Motivated by the desire to generate all
tokens simultaneously to produce improved closed-form equations, we propose
Symbolic Diffusion, a D3PM based discrete state-space diffusion model which
simultaneously generates all tokens of the equation at once using discrete
token diffusion. Using the bivariate dataset developed for SymbolicGPT, we
compared our diffusion-based generation approach to an autoregressive model
based on SymbolicGPT, using equivalent encoder and transformer architectures.
We demonstrate that our novel approach of using diffusion-based generation for
symbolic regression can offer comparable and, by some metrics, improved
performance over autoregressive generation in models using similar underlying
architectures, opening new research opportunities in neural-network based
symbolic regression.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A comparative review of liquid neural networks (LNNs) and traditional RNNs (including LSTMs/GRUs) across accuracy, memory efficiency, and generalization, highlighting LNNs' potential for noisy/non-stationary data and OOD generalization, while noting RNNs' ecosystem advantages; calls for scalable LNNs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To clarify the relative strengths and weaknesses of LNNs vs. conventional RNN architectures, synthesize core principles, models, and challenges, and identify productive directions for future research.

Method: Systematic literature review of existing studies on LNNs and RNNs, comparing them along dimensions of accuracy, memory efficiency, and generalization; analysis of core principles, mathematical models, characteristics, and practical challenges in sequential data processing; synthesis of findings and gaps.

Result: LNNs demonstrate potential in handling noisy, non-stationary data and improving OOD generalization; some LNN variants offer better parameter efficiency and computational speed; RNNs remain dominant due to maturity and ecosystem; common shortcomings and future research directions identified, with emphasis on scaling LNNs to broader, more complex scenarios.

Conclusion: Advocate for advancing the scalability and practical deployment of LNNs, alongside continued refinement of training methods, hardware support, and integration with existing RNN-based pipelines; balanced assessment of when LNNs are advantageous.

Abstract: This review aims to conduct a comparative analysis of liquid neural networks
(LNNs) and traditional recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and their variants,
such as long short-term memory networks (LSTMs) and gated recurrent units
(GRUs). The core dimensions of the analysis include model accuracy, memory
efficiency, and generalization ability. By systematically reviewing existing
research, this paper explores the basic principles, mathematical models, key
characteristics, and inherent challenges of these neural network architectures
in processing sequential data. Research findings reveal that LNN, as an
emerging, biologically inspired, continuous-time dynamic neural network,
demonstrates significant potential in handling noisy, non-stationary data, and
achieving out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization. Additionally, some LNN
variants outperform traditional RNN in terms of parameter efficiency and
computational speed. However, RNN remains a cornerstone in sequence modeling
due to its mature ecosystem and successful applications across various tasks.
This review identifies the commonalities and differences between LNNs and RNNs,
summarizes their respective shortcomings and challenges, and points out

*Zhongqi Yue,Weishi Wang,Yundaichuan Zhan,Juncheng Li,Daniel Dahlmeier,Fredrik D. Johansson*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces Expanded Action space (ExpA) and EARL with counterfactual policy optimization to decouple environment interactions from language in LLMs, enabling external environments to be controlled by dedicated actions; demonstrates improved performance on multi-turn tasks and calculator-based tasks, and achieves perfect Sort-4 accuracy on partially observed sorting with self-discovered efficient algorithms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce the overhead of forcing LLMs to generate and parse textual commands for external tools by internalizing control in an Expanded Action space, thereby separating reasoning from environment interaction and enabling more efficient exploration.

Method: Define ExpA, an action space beyond vocabulary. The model can initiate routing to an external environment, perform environment-specific actions, receive feedback, and optionally route back to language. Propose EARL (Expanded Action Reinforcement Learning) with counterfactual policy optimization to encourage exploration of ExpA across tasks, including calculator-based multitask learning and partially observed sorting. Experimental setups compare ExpA+EARL to vocabulary-constrained baselines.

Result: EARL outperforms strong baselines with vocabulary-only actions on multi-turn tasks; shows robustness across calculator-based multitask learning; achieves perfect Sort-4 accuracy in partially observed sorting and self-discovery of an efficient algorithm competitive with classical designs.

Conclusion: ExpA and EARL provide a viable framework to decouple language reasoning from environment interactions, improving exploration and performance in LLM-based agents. While promising, further work is needed to study scalability, generalization, and safety across more diverse environments.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are powerful reasoners in natural language, but
their actions are typically confined to outputting vocabulary tokens. As a
result, interactions with external environments -- such as symbolic operators
or simulators -- must be expressed through text in predefined formats, parsed,
and routed to external interfaces. This overloads the model's language with
both reasoning and control duties, and requires a hand-crafted parser, external
to the LLM. To address this, we decouple environment interactions from language
by internalizing them in an Expanded Action space (ExpA), beyond the
vocabulary. The model starts reasoning in the default language environment, but
may trigger routing actions and switch to an external environment at any time.
From there, the model can only invoke environment-specific actions, receive
feedback from the environment, and potentially route back to language as a
result. To promote effective exploration of the expanded action space and new
environments, we introduce ExpA Reinforcement Learning (EARL) with
counterfactual policy optimization. On tasks requiring multi-turn interactions
and contingent planning, EARL outperforms strong baselines with
vocabulary-constrained actions. It performs robustly across calculator-based
multi-task learning and, in the partially observed sorting problem, achieves
perfect Sort-4 accuracy while self-discovering an efficient algorithm
competitive with classical designs.

TL;DR: TGM is a unified, open-source library for ML on temporal graphs that unifies CTDG and DTDG, enabling fast, flexible experiments and new research directions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Temporal graphs are under-supported; existing TG libraries are architecture-specific and split between continuous- and discrete-time methods, hindering comparisons and transfers of ideas. A unified, efficient, flexible framework is needed.

Method: Introduce Temporal Graph Modelling (TGM), a research-oriented library that unifies CTDG and DTDG, supports dynamic node features, time-granularity conversions, and native handling of link-, node-, and graph-level tasks, with emphasis on cross-model/research-friendly design and performance.

Result: Empirical results show TGM achieving ~7.8x speedup across models/datasets/tasks compared to DyGLib and ~175x speedup for graph discretization relative to existing implementations, unlocking new research possibilities like dynamic graph property prediction and time-driven training.

Conclusion: TGM accelerates ML on temporal graphs and enables new research directions by providing a unified, efficient, and extensible framework for CTDG and DTDG; the project is open-source at GitHub.

Abstract: Well-designed open-source software drives progress in Machine Learning (ML)
research. While static graph ML enjoys mature frameworks like PyTorch Geometric
and DGL, ML for temporal graphs (TG), networks that evolve over time, lacks
comparable infrastructure. Existing TG libraries are often tailored to specific
architectures, hindering support for diverse models in this rapidly evolving
field. Additionally, the divide between continuous- and discrete-time dynamic
graph methods (CTDG and DTDG) limits direct comparisons and idea transfer. To
address these gaps, we introduce Temporal Graph Modelling (TGM), a
research-oriented library for ML on temporal graphs, the first to unify CTDG
and DTDG approaches. TGM offers first-class support for dynamic node features,
time-granularity conversions, and native handling of link-, node-, and
graph-level tasks. Empirically, TGM achieves an average 7.8x speedup across
multiple models, datasets, and tasks compared to the widely used DyGLib, and an
average 175x speedup on graph discretization relative to available
implementations. Beyond efficiency, we show in our experiments how TGM unlocks
entirely new research possibilities by enabling dynamic graph property
prediction and time-driven training paradigms, opening the door to questions
previously impractical to study. TGM is available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Unsupervised iSHM for broken-rail detection using an Attention-Focused Transformer evaluated on an incremental synthetic data benchmark; transformer-based methods excel but are sensitive to high-frequency noise; the proposed model matches state-of-the-art accuracy with faster inference, highlighting noise robustness as a key bottleneck.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Detect small, transient rail anomalies (2–10 cm) using onboard sensors without abundant labeled data; address complex vehicle dynamics and noise; create a benchmark to evaluate robustness to speed variations, multi-channel inputs, and realistic noise.

Method: Introduce an incremental synthetic data benchmark to systematically test robustness. Compare several unsupervised models and propose an Attention-Focused Transformer trained by reconstruction. Anomaly scoring derives mainly from deviations in learned attention weights for efficiency.

Result: Transformer-based models generally outperform others; all models are vulnerable to high-frequency, localized noise. The proposed Attention-Focused Transformer achieves comparable accuracy to the state-of-the-art with better inference speed, indicating practical efficiency but persistent noise sensitivity.

Conclusion: Noise robustness remains a critical bottleneck for practical onboard iSHM. The attention-based approach is promising for efficient anomaly detection, and the benchmark provides a valuable framework for developing more robust models in future work.

Abstract: Indirect structural health monitoring (iSHM) for broken rail detection using
onboard sensors presents a cost-effective paradigm for railway track
assessment, yet reliably detecting small, transient anomalies (2-10 cm) remains
a significant challenge due to complex vehicle dynamics, signal noise, and the
scarcity of labeled data limiting supervised approaches. This study addresses
these issues through unsupervised deep learning. We introduce an incremental
synthetic data benchmark designed to systematically evaluate model robustness
against progressively complex challenges like speed variations, multi-channel
inputs, and realistic noise patterns encountered in iSHM. Using this benchmark,
we evaluate several established unsupervised models alongside our proposed
Attention-Focused Transformer. Our model employs a self-attention mechanism,
trained via reconstruction but innovatively deriving anomaly scores primarily
from deviations in learned attention weights, aiming for both effectiveness and
computational efficiency. Benchmarking results reveal that while
transformer-based models generally outperform others, all tested models exhibit
significant vulnerability to high-frequency localized noise, identifying this
as a critical bottleneck for practical deployment. Notably, our proposed model
achieves accuracy comparable to the state-of-the-art solution while
demonstrating better inference speed. This highlights the crucial need for
enhanced noise robustness in future iSHM models and positions our more
efficient attention-based approach as a promising foundation for developing
practical onboard anomaly detection systems.

*Muhammad Usman,Yugyung Lee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A Gaussian-based dynamic GNN (DGTEN) for trust evaluation that propagates epistemic uncertainty, uses advanced temporal encoding and ODE residuals, and incorporates attack defenses, achieving strong MCC gains on Bitcoin trust networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dynamic trust in large, evolving graphs requires calibrated confidence and resilience to manipulation; existing models struggle with changing relationships and adversarial attacks.

Method: Represent nodes and edges as Gaussian distributions to propagate semantic signals and epistemic uncertainty; use hybrid Absolute-Gaussian-Hourglass (HAGH) positional encoding with Kolmogorov-Arnold network-based unbiased multi-head attention; apply an ODE-based residual learning module to model abrupt shifts and smooth trends; employ robust adaptive ensemble coefficient analysis with complementary cosine and Jaccard similarity to prune/down-weight suspicious interactions and defend against reputation laundering and on/off attacks.

Result: On Bitcoin-Alpha (single timeslot) MCC improved by 10.77% over the best dynamic baseline; cold-start MCC gain of 16.41% (largest across tasks/datasets); under adversarial on/off attacks, MCC up to 11.63% higher than baseline.

Conclusion: DGTEN provides a unified, uncertainty-aware dynamic trust evaluation framework with built-in defenses that yields strong empirical gains on real-world trust networks.

Abstract: Dynamic trust evaluation in large, rapidly evolving graphs requires models
that can capture changing relationships, express calibrated confidence, and
resist adversarial manipulation. DGTEN (Deep Gaussian-based Trust Evaluation
Network) introduces a unified graph framework that achieves all three by
combining uncertainty-aware message passing, expressive temporal modeling, and
built-in defenses against trust-targeted attacks. It represents nodes and edges
as Gaussian distributions so that both semantic signals and epistemic
uncertainty propagate through the graph neural network, enabling risk-aware
trust decisions rather than overconfident guesses. To model how trust evolves,
it employs hybrid Absolute-Gaussian-Hourglass (HAGH) positional encoding with
Kolmogorov-Arnold network-based unbiased multi-head attention, followed by an
ordinary differential equation (ODE)-based residual learning module to jointly
capture abrupt shifts and smooth trends. Robust adaptive ensemble coefficient
analysis prunes or down-weights suspicious interactions using complementary
cosine and Jaccard similarity measures, mitigating reputation laundering,
sabotage, and on/off attacks. On two signed Bitcoin trust networks, DGTEN
delivers significant improvements: in single-timeslot prediction on
Bitcoin-Alpha, it improves MCC by 10.77% over the best dynamic baseline; in the
cold-start scenario, it achieves a 16.41% MCC gain - the largest across all
tasks and datasets. Under adversarial on/off attacks, it surpasses the baseline
by up to 11.63% MCC. These results validate the effectiveness of the unified
DGTEN framework.

Method: Proposes a taxonomy of twelve unlearning methods grouped into three families (divergence-driven optimization, representation misalignment, rejection-based targeted unlearning). Re-evaluates evaluation metrics on the WMDP benchmark, introduces Open-QA metrics to capture generative performance, and analyzes UE (unlearning effectiveness), UT (utility retention), and Rob (robustness). Investigates DPS across in-domain relearning vs out-of-domain fine-tuning to reveal robustness nuances.

Result: Shows MCQ-based evaluations can overstate success; Open-QA metrics reveal a more nuanced UE-UT landscape. Finds that robustness is locale-sensitive, with vulnerabilities differing between in-domain relearning and out-of-domain finetuning. Provides a fuller, more actionable assessment framework and empirical guidance for future unlearning method design.

Conclusion: Advocates a full-stack revision of LLM unlearning research, emphasizing richer evaluation, clearer taxonomies, and targeted guidance to design and fairly assess future unlearning approaches.

Abstract: Machine unlearning for large language models (LLMs) aims to remove undesired
data, knowledge, and behaviors (e.g., for safety, privacy, or copyright) while
preserving useful model capabilities. Despite rapid progress over the past two
years, research in LLM unlearning remains fragmented, with limited clarity on
what constitutes effective unlearning and how it should be rigorously
evaluated. In this work, we present a principled taxonomy of twelve recent
stateful unlearning methods, grouped into three methodological families:
divergence-driven optimization, representation misalignment, and
rejection-based targeted unlearning. Building on this taxonomy, we revisit the
evaluation of unlearning effectiveness (UE), utility retention (UT), and
robustness (Rob), focusing on the WMDP benchmark. Our analysis shows that
current evaluations, dominated by multiple-choice question (MCQ) accuracy,
offer only a narrow perspective, often overstating success while overlooking
the model's actual generation behavior. To address this gap, we introduce open
question-answering (Open-QA) metrics that better capture generative performance
and reveal the inherent UE-UT tradeoff across method families. Furthermore, we
demonstrate that robustness requires finer-grained analysis: for example,
vulnerabilities differ substantially between in-domain relearning and
out-of-domain fine-tuning, even though both fall under model-level attacks.
Through this study, we hope to deliver a full-stack revisit of LLM unlearning
and actionable guidance for designing and evaluating future methods.

Abstract: This study advocates for employing clustering techniques to classify vacation
rental properties active during the Covid pandemic to identify inherent
patterns and behaviours. The dataset, a collaboration between the ESRC funded
Consumer Data Research Centre (CDRC) and AirDNA, encompasses data for over a
million properties and hosts. Utilising K-means and K-medoids clustering
techniques, we identify homogenous groups and their common characteristics. Our

### [240] [Design-Based Bandits Under Network Interference: Trade-Off Between Regret and Statistical Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07646)
*Zichen Wang,Haoyang Hong,Chuanhao Li,Haoxuan Li,Zhiheng Zhang,Huazheng Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: First Pareto frontier for regret vs inference accuracy in adversarial MABNI; introduces an anytime-valid confidence sequence and the EXP3-N-CS algorithm to balance the trade-off.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MABNI creates interdependence where actions affect others' rewards. Focusing solely on regret can harm inference accuracy for sub-optimal arms, a problem amplified in networked/adversarial settings. A theoretical and algorithmic framework is needed to balance regret with reliable inference.

Method: Theoretical derivation of a Pareto frontier characterizing the trade-off in adversarial (design-based) MABNI; development of an anytime-valid asymptotic confidence sequence; proposal of the EXP3-N-CS algorithm designed to navigate the regret–inference trade-off in this setting.

Result: Characterizes the trade-off via a Pareto frontier; introduces an anytime-valid confidence sequence; presents the EXP3-N-CS algorithm tailored to MABNI.

Conclusion: Provides a framework to balance regret minimization and inference accuracy in adversarial MABNI, enabling principled decision-making about exploration versus inference quality; lays groundwork for empirical validation and extensions to broader networked/adversarial settings.

Abstract: In multi-armed bandits with network interference (MABNI), the action taken by
one node can influence the rewards of others, creating complex interdependence.
While existing research on MABNI largely concentrates on minimizing regret, it
often overlooks the crucial concern that an excessive emphasis on the optimal
arm can undermine the inference accuracy for sub-optimal arms. Although initial
efforts have been made to address this trade-off in single-unit scenarios,
these challenges have become more pronounced in the context of MABNI. In this
paper, we establish, for the first time, a theoretical Pareto frontier
characterizing the trade-off between regret minimization and inference accuracy
in adversarial (design-based) MABNI. We further introduce an anytime-valid
asymptotic confidence sequence along with a corresponding algorithm,
$\texttt{EXP3-N-CS}$, specifically designed to balance the trade-off between
regret minimization and inference accuracy in this setting.

### [241] [Continual Learning for Adaptive AI Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07648)
*Md Hasibul Amin,Tamzid Tanvi Alam*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces inter-cluster separation (ICS) as a regularization term to mitigate forgetting in continual learning; shows gains on 5-task Split CIFAR-10 with ResNet-18, but long-term retention degrades as more tasks are added.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overfitting and catastrophic forgetting hinder continual learning; need a regularization mechanism that preserves past knowledge while learning new tasks by encouraging separation in the model's internal representations.

Method: Add ICS regularization to the loss, penalizing outputs far from centroids of clusters from previous tasks; tune the weighting hyperparameter; evaluate on 5-task Split CIFAR-10 with ResNet-18.

Result: ICS helps maintain performance on initial tasks, reducing forgetting, but shows limitations in long-term knowledge retention with increasing task count.

Conclusion: ICS is a promising regularization approach for continual learning in the studied setting, but scalability to many tasks remains challenging; further research needed to balance stability and plasticity.

Abstract: Continual learning the ability of a neural network to learn multiple
sequential tasks without losing previously acquired knowledge remains a
significant obstacle to developing truly adaptive artificial intelligence. Deep
learning models have achieved remarkable results in various applications, but
overfitting remains a common issue. Regularization techniques can help prevent
overfitting by adding constraints to the model's parameters. To prevent
catastrophic forgetting, in this paper we introduce a novel regularization
technique based on inter-cluster separation (ICS) in the loss function, which
penalizes the model for producing outputs that are far away from the centroids
of the clusters formed by the data from previous tasks. We also performed
hyperparameter tuning to find the optimal weighting of the proposed
regularization term. This ensures clearer separation between tasks in the
neural network's internal representation, reducing overlap and mitigating
forgetting. Using the standard 5-task Split CIFAR-10 benchmark and a ResNet-18
architecture, we demonstrate ICS's effectiveness in maintaining strong
performance on initial tasks. However, our results also highlight limitations
in long-term knowledge retention, particularly when the number of tasks
increases. This underscores the complexity and trade-offs inherent in continual
learning and points toward avenues for further research.

### [242] [DEAS: DEtached value learning with Action Sequence for Scalable Offline RL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07730)
*Changyeon Kim,Haeone Lee,Younggyo Seo,Kimin Lee,Yuke Zhu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DEAS leverages action sequences in offline RL to reduce horizon and control value overestimation via detached value learning; achieves strong results on OGBench and robotics tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Offline RL faces long-horizon planning challenges; temporally extended actions via options/semi-Markov Q-learning can improve value learning; still suffers from overestimation when using sequences.

Method: DEAS uses action sequences as extended actions, interprets with options framework; semi-Markov Q-learning; detaches value learning to stay close to in-distribution high-return actions; evaluated on OGBench and Vision-Language-Action models for RoboCasa.

Result: Outperforms baselines on complex long-horizon tasks; improves performance in RoboCasa Kitchen sims and real-world manipulation tasks when combined with large-scale VLA models.

Conclusion: Detached value learning with action sequences is effective for offline RL with long horizons and can generalize to robotics and VLA settings, reducing planning horizon and mitigating overestimation.

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) presents an attractive paradigm for
training intelligent agents without expensive online interactions. However,
current approaches still struggle with complex, long-horizon sequential
decision making. In this work, we introduce DEtached value learning with Action
Sequence (DEAS), a simple yet effective offline RL framework that leverages
action sequences for value learning. These temporally extended actions provide
richer information than single-step actions and can be interpreted through the
options framework via semi-Markov decision process Q-learning, enabling
reduction of the effective planning horizon by considering longer sequences at
once. However, directly adopting such sequences in actor-critic algorithms
introduces excessive value overestimation, which we address through detached
value learning that steers value estimates toward in-distribution actions that
achieve high return in the offline dataset. We demonstrate that DEAS
consistently outperforms baselines on complex, long-horizon tasks from OGBench
and can be applied to enhance the performance of large-scale
Vision-Language-Action models that predict action sequences, significantly
boosting performance in both RoboCasa Kitchen simulation tasks and real-world
manipulation tasks.

### [243] [Value Flows](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07650)
*Perry Dong,Chongyi Zheng,Chelsea Finn,Dorsa Sadigh,Benjamin Eysenbach*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Value Flows uses flow-based models to estimate full return distributions in distributional RL, introducing a flow-matching objective and a flow-derivative ODE to quantify return uncertainty and guide prioritized learning; shows ~1.3x gain in success rates across 37 state-based and 25 image-based tasks in offline and online-to-online settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of categorical/quantile distributional RL by modeling the entire return distribution with flexible flow-based densities, enabling fine-grained uncertainty estimates for better exploration, risk-aware decisions, and targeted learning.

Method: Train flexible flow models that satisfy the distributional Bellman equation via a flow-matching objective. Use a flow-derivative ODE to compute return uncertainty from the learned density paths. Leverage uncertainty to prioritize learning on transitions with high uncertainty. Evaluate in offline and online-to-online settings across 37 state-based and 25 image-based benchmarks, comparing against prior distributional RL methods.

Result: Value Flows achieves an average 1.3x improvement in success rates over baselines on a diverse set of tasks. Demonstrates effective estimation of full return distributions and actionable uncertainty for learning prioritization.

Conclusion: Flow-based return distribution modeling with an accompanying uncertainty measure is a promising direction for distributional RL, offering improved performance and more informed training signals compared to traditional categorical/quantile approaches.

Abstract: While most reinforcement learning methods today flatten the distribution of
future returns to a single scalar value, distributional RL methods exploit the
return distribution to provide stronger learning signals and to enable
applications in exploration and safe RL. While the predominant method for
estimating the return distribution is by modeling it as a categorical
distribution over discrete bins or estimating a finite number of quantiles,
such approaches leave unanswered questions about the fine-grained structure of
the return distribution and about how to distinguish states with high return
uncertainty for decision-making. The key idea in this paper is to use modern,
flexible flow-based models to estimate the full future return distributions and
identify those states with high return variance. We do so by formulating a new
flow-matching objective that generates probability density paths satisfying the
distributional Bellman equation. Building upon the learned flow models, we
estimate the return uncertainty of distinct states using a new flow derivative
ODE. We additionally use this uncertainty information to prioritize learning a
more accurate return estimation on certain transitions. We compare our method
(Value Flows) with prior methods in the offline and online-to-online settings.
Experiments on $37$ state-based and $25$ image-based benchmark tasks
demonstrate that Value Flows achieves a $1.3\times$ improvement on average in
success rates. Website: https://pd-perry.github.io/value-flows Code:

changes and data distributions shift over time. This paper presents HYDRA-EI, a
hybrid ensemble incremental learning framework. It uses several stages of
feature processing and combines multiple models. The framework builds
relational, cross, and frequency-based features. It uses graph attention,
automatic cross-feature creation, and transformations from the frequency
domain. HYDRA-EI updates weekly using new data and adjusts the model weights
with a simple performance-based method. It works without frequent manual
changes or fixed retraining. HYDRA-EI improves model stability and
generalization, which makes it useful for long-term credit risk tasks.

### [245] [FedQS: Optimizing Gradient and Model Aggregation for Semi-Asynchronous Federated Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07664)
*Yunbo Li,Jiaping Gui,Zhihang Deng,Fanchao Meng,Yue Wu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FedQS is a novel framework for semi-asynchronous federated learning that reconciles gradient-based and model-based aggregation by classifying clients into four types and adaptively optimizing their local training, yielding high accuracy, low loss, and fast convergence across CV, NLP, and real-world tasks, outperforming baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In SAFL, gradient aggregation offers fast convergence and accuracy but with high fluctuations, while model aggregation provides stability at the cost of slower convergence and lower accuracy. A unified approach is needed to handle client heterogeneity and trade-offs between aggregation strategies.

Method: Introduce a divide-and-conquer strategy that classifies clients into four types based on data distribution and computational resources, and adaptively tunes local training for each type. Provide theoretical analysis of disparities between gradient- and model-based SAFL, and validate via extensive experiments across vision, language, and real-world tasks with public code.

Result: FedQS achieves the highest accuracy and lowest loss, with convergence speed among the fastest, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines across CV, NLP, and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: This work bridges the gap between gradient- and model-based aggregation in SAFL, offering a unified, stable, accurate, and efficient FL framework with practical applicability and publicly available code.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across multiple
parties without sharing raw data, with semi-asynchronous FL (SAFL) emerging as
a balanced approach between synchronous and asynchronous FL. However, SAFL
faces significant challenges in optimizing both gradient-based (e.g., FedSGD)
and model-based (e.g., FedAvg) aggregation strategies, which exhibit distinct
trade-offs in accuracy, convergence speed, and stability. While gradient
aggregation achieves faster convergence and higher accuracy, it suffers from
pronounced fluctuations, whereas model aggregation offers greater stability but
slower convergence and suboptimal accuracy. This paper presents FedQS, the
first framework to theoretically analyze and address these disparities in SAFL.
FedQS introduces a divide-and-conquer strategy to handle client heterogeneity
by classifying clients into four distinct types and adaptively optimizing their
local training based on data distribution characteristics and available
computational resources. Extensive experiments on computer vision, natural
language processing, and real-world tasks demonstrate that FedQS achieves the
highest accuracy, attains the lowest loss, and ranks among the fastest in
convergence speed, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines. Our work bridges
the gap between aggregation strategies in SAFL, offering a unified solution for
stable, accurate, and efficient federated learning. The code and datasets are
available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/FedQS-EDD6.

*Yuhan Sun,Zhiwei Huang,Wanqing Cui,Shaopan Xiong,Yazhi Guo,Meiguang Jin,Junfeng Ma*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Two-stage optimization yields sub-second, cost-efficient AI avatars for livestream e-commerce: a 670B teacher distilled to a 30B MoE via Rejection Sampling Fine-Tuning, then compressed with GRPO RL to shorten reasoning; achieved substantial gains in correctness, helpfulness, and GMV on Taobao Live.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In AI-powered livestreams, high-latency LRMs hinder real-time interaction; need fast, efficient models that still reason well enough to guide commerce.

Method: Stage 1: distill a 670B teacher into a lightweight 30B Mixture-of-Experts (3B active) using Rejection Sampling Fine-Tuning (RFT). Stage 2: apply reinforcement learning with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to compress the model's reasoning path via a multi-objective reward (correctness, helpfulness, brevity).

Result: 30-fold reduction in computational cost, enabling sub-second latency. On Taobao Live, improvements: response correctness +3.3%, helpfulness +21.8%; hundreds of thousands of viewers tested; statistically significant GMV uplift.

Conclusion: LiveThinking demonstrates a practical, scalable approach to deploy responsive AI avatars in live shopping, balancing reasoning quality and latency to improve user experience and commercial performance.

Abstract: In AI-powered e-commerce livestreaming, digital avatars require real-time
responses to drive engagement, a task for which high-latency Large Reasoning
Models (LRMs) are ill-suited. We introduce LiveThinking, a practical two-stage
optimization framework to bridge this gap. First, we address computational cost
by distilling a 670B teacher LRM into a lightweight 30B Mixture-of-Experts
(MoE) model (3B active) using Rejection Sampling Fine-Tuning (RFT). This
reduces deployment overhead but preserves the teacher's verbose reasoning,
causing latency. To solve this, our second stage employs reinforcement learning
with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to compress the model's
reasoning path, guided by a multi-objective reward function balancing
correctness, helpfulness, and brevity. LiveThinking achieves a 30-fold
reduction in computational cost, enabling sub-second latency. In real-world
application on Taobao Live, it improved response correctness by 3.3% and
helpfulness by 21.8%. Tested by hundreds of thousands of viewers, our system
led to a statistically significant increase in Gross Merchandise Volume (GMV),
demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing user experience and commercial
performance in live, interactive settings.

*Krzysztof Choromanski,Avinava Dubey,Arijit Sehanobish,Isaac Reid*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GRFs++ introduces refined Graph Random Features to efficiently and accurately approximate graph kernels by stitching together short random walks to emulate longer walks, enabling parallel computation and flexible walk-length distributions without bias.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Regular Graph Random Features (GRFs) struggle to model long-range node relationships and rely on long sequential random walks, which is inefficient. There is a need for an accurate, scalable kernel approximation on graphs that can capture distant interactions without costly sampling.

Method: GRFs++ use walk-stitching: concatenate multiple shorter random walks to simulate longer walks while preserving unbiasedness; shift from sequential long-walk sampling to parallel computation of short walks and matrix-matrix multiplication; generalize walk-length termination from fixed Bernoulli stopping to broader distributions over walk lengths.

Result: The approach yields improved approximation quality and efficiency for graph kernels, capturing longer-range relations with less computational cost; empirical evaluations and theoretical analysis support the claims.

Conclusion: GRFs++ provide a scalable, accurate graph-kernel approximation framework that extends GRFs with walk-stitching and flexible termination strategies, enhancing performance over baselines and enabling broader use of graph random features.

Abstract: We propose refined GRFs (GRFs++), a new class of Graph Random Features (GRFs)
for efficient and accurate computations involving kernels defined on the nodes
of a graph. GRFs++ resolve some of the long-standing limitations of regular
GRFs, including difficulty modeling relationships between more distant nodes.
They reduce dependence on sampling long graph random walks via a novel
walk-stitching technique, concatenating several shorter walks without breaking
unbiasedness. By applying these techniques, GRFs++ inherit the approximation
quality provided by longer walks but with greater efficiency, trading
sequential, inefficient sampling of a long walk for parallel computation of
short walks and matrix-matrix multiplication. Furthermore, GRFs++ extend the
simplistic GRFs walk termination mechanism (Bernoulli schemes with fixed
halting probabilities) to a broader class of strategies, applying general
distributions on the walks' lengths. This improves the approximation accuracy
of graph kernels, without incurring extra computational cost. We provide
empirical evaluations to showcase all our claims and complement our results
with theoretical analysis.

### [248] [GeoGen: A Two-stage Coarse-to-Fine Framework for Fine-grained Synthetic Location-based Social Network Trajectory Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07735)
*Rongchao Xu,Kunlin Cai,Lin Jiang,Dahai Yu,Zhiqing Hong,Yuan Tian,Guang Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GeoGen is a two-stage framework for large-scale synthetic LBSN trajectory generation. It first learns latent continuous movement sequences via a sparsity-aware spatio-temporal diffusion model, then refines coarse sequences into fine trajectories with a Transformer-based Coarse2FineNet, achieving state-of-the-art fidelity and utility (e.g., 69% distance and 55% radius gains on FS-TKY).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LBSN check-in data are valuable for applications but are hard to obtain due to high collection costs and privacy concerns. Synthetic data offers privacy-preserving data with preserved characteristics, but LBSN trajectories are challenging because they are spatially discrete, temporally irregular, and exhibit complex spatio-temporal patterns due to sparse activity and variable human mobility.

Method: Stage 1: Reconstruct spatially continuous, temporally regular latent movement sequences from real LBSN trajectories and train a Sparsity-aware Spatio-temporal Diffusion model (S^2TDiff) with an efficient denoising network. Stage 2: Use Coarse2FineNet, a Transformer-based Seq2Seq with dynamic context fusion in the encoder and a multi-task hybrid-head decoder, to generate fine-grained LBSN trajectories from coarse latent sequences by modeling semantic relevance and behavioral uncertainty.

Result: Experiments on four real-world datasets show GeoGen surpasses state-of-the-art models in both fidelity and utility; for example, on the FS-TKY dataset it achieves approximately 69% improvement in distance and 55% in radius metrics.

Conclusion: GeoGen presents an effective two-stage coarse-to-fine approach for privacy-preserving, large-scale synthetic LBSN trajectory generation that handles spatial-temporal irregularities and uncertainty, enabling better privacy-protecting data with strong fidelity and utility.

Abstract: Location-Based Social Network (LBSN) check-in trajectory data are important
for many practical applications, like POI recommendation, advertising, and
pandemic intervention. However, the high collection costs and ever-increasing
privacy concerns prevent us from accessing large-scale LBSN trajectory data.
The recent advances in synthetic data generation provide us with a new
opportunity to achieve this, which utilizes generative AI to generate synthetic
data that preserves the characteristics of real data while ensuring privacy
protection. However, generating synthetic LBSN check-in trajectories remains
challenging due to their spatially discrete, temporally irregular nature and
the complex spatio-temporal patterns caused by sparse activities and uncertain
human mobility. To address this challenge, we propose GeoGen, a two-stage
coarse-to-fine framework for large-scale LBSN check-in trajectory generation.
In the first stage, we reconstruct spatially continuous, temporally regular
latent movement sequences from the original LBSN check-in trajectories and then
design a Sparsity-aware Spatio-temporal Diffusion model (S$^2$TDiff) with an
efficient denosing network to learn their underlying behavioral patterns. In
the second stage, we design Coarse2FineNet, a Transformer-based Seq2Seq
architecture equipped with a dynamic context fusion mechanism in the encoder
and a multi-task hybrid-head decoder, which generates fine-grained LBSN
trajectories based on coarse-grained latent movement sequences by modeling
semantic relevance and behavioral uncertainty. Extensive experiments on four
real-world datasets show that GeoGen excels state-of-the-art models for both
fidelity and utility evaluation, e.g., it increases over 69% and 55% in
distance and radius metrics on the FS-TKY dataset.

### [249] [MeSH: Memory-as-State-Highways for Recursive Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07739)
*Chengting Yu,Xiaobo Shu,Yadao Wang,Yizhen Zhang,Haoyi Wu,Jiaang Li,Rujiao Long,Ziheng Chen,Yuchi Xu,Wenbo Su,Bo Zheng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MeSH externalizes state management into a dedicated memory buffer and uses lightweight routers to diversify computation across iterations in recursive transformers, addressing core bottlenecks of undifferentiated computation and information overload. This yields stronger recursive models that can outperform larger non-recursive baselines at scale with fewer parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recursive transformers improve parameter efficiency but under matched compute lag behind non-recursive models. The bottlenecks are undifferentiated computation (uniform patterns across iterations) and information overload (co-mingling long-lived and transient information in one hidden state).

Method: Introduce Memory-as-State-Highways (MeSH): a memory buffer for explicit state management plus lightweight routers that route computation across iterations. Probing visualizations show induced functional specialization across iterations. Evaluate on the Pythia suite (160M–1.4B params), comparing recursive baselines, MeSH-enabled recursion, and large non-recursive models.

Result: MeSH-enhanced recursive transformers consistently outperform recursive baselines and, at 1.4B scale, even surpass the larger non-recursive counterpart, achieving an average downstream accuracy gain of +1.06% with ~33% fewer non-embedding parameters.

Conclusion: MeSH provides a scalable and principled architecture for building stronger recursive models by externalizing state and diversifying iterative computation, validated by visualization-supported specialization and improved performance on large-scale benchmarks.

Abstract: Recursive transformers reuse parameters and iterate over hidden states
multiple times, decoupling compute depth from parameter depth. However, under
matched compute, recursive models with fewer parameters often lag behind
non-recursive counterparts. By probing hidden states, we trace this performance
gap to two primary bottlenecks: undifferentiated computation, where the core is
forced to adopt a similar computational pattern at every iteration, and
information overload, where long-lived and transient information must coexist
in a single hidden state. To address the issues, we introduce a
Memory-as-State-Highways (MeSH) scheme, which externalizes state management
into an explicit memory buffer and employs lightweight routers to dynamically
diversify computation across iterations. Probing visualizations confirm that
MeSH successfully resolves the pathologies by inducing functional
specialization across iterations. On the Pythia suite (160M-1.4B),
MeSH-enhanced recursive transformers consistently improve over recursive
baselines and outperforms its larger non-recursive counterpart at the 1.4B
scale, improving average downstream accuracy by +1.06% with 33% fewer
non-embedding parameters. Our analysis establishes MeSH as a scalable and
principled architecture for building stronger recursive models.

*Noah Bergam,Szymon Snoeck,Nakul Verma*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: t-SNE embeddings do not reliably reveal input data structure: the strength of clusters and the extremity of outliers cannot be inferred from the embedding, and these failure modes occur in practice.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: to challenge the widely held belief that t-SNE visualizations faithfully reflect the structure of the input data, particularly regarding clustering and outliers.

Method: theoretical proofs showing the disconnect between input clustering strength/outlier extremity and the t-SNE embedding, complemented by empirical demonstrations on real data highlighting common failure modes.

Result: the paper demonstrates that both clustering strength and outlier extremity are not inferable from the t-SNE visualization, and that these failure modes are prevalent in practice.

Conclusion: interpretations of t-SNE plots should be made with caution; embedding alone is insufficient to assess input data structure—supporting analyses or alternative methods are recommended.

Abstract: Central to the widespread use of t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding
(t-SNE) is the conviction that it produces visualizations whose structure
roughly matches that of the input. To the contrary, we prove that (1) the
strength of the input clustering, and (2) the extremity of outlier points,
cannot be reliably inferred from the t-SNE output. We demonstrate the
prevalence of these failure modes in practice as well.

### [251] [FedBook: A Unified Federated Graph Foundation Codebook with Intra-domain and Inter-domain Knowledge Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07755)
*Zhengyu Wu,Yinlin Zhu,Xunkai Li,Ziang Qiu,Rong-Hua Li,Guoren Wang,Chenghu Zhou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FedBook introduces a unified federated graph foundation codebook for multi-domain graphs that balances intra-domain coherence and inter-domain diversity through a two-phase training process (Intra-domain Collaboration and Inter-domain Integration), showing strong gains over 21 baselines across 8 benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Centralized graph foundation models require access to multi-domain graphs, which is often infeasible due to privacy and institutional constraints. FedGFMs aim to enable robust cross-domain generalization under privacy-preserving federated settings by learning a global codebook that preserves domain-specific coherence while maintaining cross-domain diversity.

Method: FedBook performs federated pre-training in two phases. (1) Intra-domain Collaboration refines low-frequency tokens by referencing more reliable high-frequency tokens across clients to enhance domain-specific coherence. (2) Inter-domain Integration aggregates client codebooks by weighting contributions according to their semantic distinctiveness, preserving cross-domain diversity in the global GFM.

Result: Empirical evaluation on 8 benchmarks across multiple domains and tasks shows FedBook consistently outperforms 21 baselines, including isolated supervised learning, FL/FGL, federated adaptations of centralized GFMs, and FedGFM techniques.

Conclusion: FedBook provides a unified federated codebook for graph foundation models that achieves strong intra-domain coherence and inter-domain diversity, enabling effective privacy-preserving cross-domain graph learning and outperforms existing federated and centralized baselines.

Abstract: Foundation models have shown remarkable cross-domain generalization in
language and vision, inspiring the development of graph foundation models
(GFMs). However, existing GFMs typically assume centralized access to
multi-domain graphs, which is often infeasible due to privacy and institutional
constraints. Federated Graph Foundation Models (FedGFMs) address this
limitation, but their effectiveness fundamentally hinges on constructing a
robust global codebook that achieves intra-domain coherence by consolidating
mutually reinforcing semantics within each domain, while also maintaining
inter-domain diversity by retaining heterogeneous knowledge across domains. To
this end, we propose FedBook, a unified federated graph foundation codebook
that systematically aggregates clients' local codebooks during server-side
federated pre-training. FedBook follows a two-phase process: (1) Intra-domain
Collaboration, where low-frequency tokens are refined by referencing more
semantically reliable high-frequency tokens across clients to enhance
domain-specific coherence; and (2) Inter-domain Integration, where client
contributions are weighted by the semantic distinctiveness of their codebooks
during the aggregation of the global GFM, thereby preserving cross-domain
diversity. Extensive experiments on 8 benchmarks across multiple domains and
tasks demonstrate that FedBook consistently outperforms 21 baselines, including
isolated supervised learning, FL/FGL, federated adaptations of centralized
GFMs, and FedGFM techniques.

### [252] [Rényi Sharpness: A Novel Sharpness that Strongly Correlates with Generalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07758)
*Qiaozhe Zhang,Jun Sun,Ruijie Zhang,Yingzhuang Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces Renyi sharpness, a negative Renyi entropy of the loss Hessian, to better measure sharpness and generalization; shows strong correlation with generalization and proposes RSAM, a Renyi sharpness-aware regularizer that outperforms SAM by up to ~2.5% test accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many existing sharpness measures poorly correlate with generalization. The authors argue that, for a fixed loss value, having uniform Hessian eigenvalues (equal contributions) is favorable. They use Renyi entropy to capture the spread of Hessian eigenvalues, and exploit reparametrization invariance and weight perturbation tricks to relate sharpness to generalization.

Method: Define Renyi sharpness as the negative Renyi entropy of the loss Hessian. Establish generalization bounds leveraging reparametrization invariance and translating data discrepancy to weight perturbation. Propose RSAM, a training regularizer based on Renyi sharpness (with a variant).

Result: Empirically, Renyi sharpness correlates strongly with generalization (Kendall rank). RSAM outperforms existing sharpness-aware minimization methods, achieving test accuracy gains up to nearly 2.5% over classical SAM.

Conclusion: Renyi sharpness provides a robust, invariant measure of landscape sharpness that aligns with generalization, and RSAM offers a practical regularizer that enhances performance beyond prior sharpness-aware methods.

Abstract: Sharpness (of the loss minima) is a common measure to investigate the
generalization of neural networks. Intuitively speaking, the flatter the
landscape near the minima is, the better generalization might be.
Unfortunately, the correlation between many existing sharpness measures and the
generalization is usually not strong, sometimes even weak. To close the gap
between the intuition and the reality, we propose a novel sharpness measure,
i.e., \textit{R\'enyi sharpness}, which is defined as the negative R\'enyi
entropy (a generalization of the classical Shannon entropy) of the loss
Hessian. The main ideas are as follows: 1) we realize that \textit{uniform}
(identical) eigenvalues of the loss Hessian is most desirable (while keeping
the sum constant) to achieve good generalization; 2) we employ the
\textit{R\'enyi entropy} to concisely characterize the extent of the spread of
the eigenvalues of loss Hessian. Normally, the larger the spread, the smaller
the (R\'enyi) entropy. To rigorously establish the relationship between
generalization and (R\'enyi) sharpness, we provide several generalization
bounds in terms of R\'enyi sharpness, by taking advantage of the
reparametrization invariance property of R\'enyi sharpness, as well as the
trick of translating the data discrepancy to the weight perturbation.
Furthermore, extensive experiments are conducted to verify the strong
correlation (in specific, Kendall rank correlation) between the R\'enyi
sharpness and generalization. Moreover, we propose to use a variant of R\'enyi
Sharpness as regularizer during training, i.e., R\'enyi Sharpness Aware
Minimization (RSAM), which turns out to outperform all existing sharpness-aware
minimization methods. It is worthy noting that the test accuracy gain of our
proposed RSAM method could be as high as nearly 2.5\%, compared against the
classical SAM method.

### [253] [A Unified Multi-Task Learning Framework for Generative Auto-Bidding with Validation-Aligned Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07760)
*Yiqin Lv,Zhiyu Mou,Miao Xu,Jinghao Chen,Qi Wang,Yixiu Mao,Yun Qu,Rongquan Bai,Chuan Yu,Jian Xu,Bo Zheng,Xiangyang Ji*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Adaptive, validation-aligned multi-task optimization (VAMO) for online bidding, weighting tasks by gradient alignment with a held-out validation gradient; adds a periodic temporal module and a generative auto-bidding backbone for cross-task seasonal transfer; provides convergence and alignment theory and shows strong empirical gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Heterogeneous advertiser requirements create many related bidding tasks that are costly to optimize independently and data-inefficient; existing multi-task strategies often rely on training dynamics and fail to align with deployment objectives in volatile bidding environments.

Method: Compute per-task training gradients and a held-out validation gradient; adapt task weights to maximize alignment with the validation gradient; incorporate a periodicity-aware temporal module; couple with a generative auto-bidding backbone to enable cross-task transfer of seasonal patterns.

Result: Theoretical guarantees (convergence, alignment analysis); empirical results on simulated and large-scale real-world systems showing significant improvements over baselines.

Conclusion: VAMO improves data efficiency and deployment-aligned optimization in multi-task online bidding, handling seasonal structure via the temporal module and transfer via the generative backbone, with robust performance in volatile environments.

Abstract: In online advertising, heterogeneous advertiser requirements give rise to
numerous customized bidding tasks that are typically optimized independently,
resulting in extensive computation and limited data efficiency. Multi-task
learning offers a principled framework to train these tasks jointly through
shared representations. However, existing multi-task optimization strategies
are primarily guided by training dynamics and often generalize poorly in
volatile bidding environments. To this end, we present Validation-Aligned
Multi-task Optimization (VAMO), which adaptively assigns task weights based on
the alignment between per-task training gradients and a held-out validation
gradient, thereby steering updates toward validation improvement and better
matching deployment objectives. We further equip the framework with a
periodicity-aware temporal module and couple it with an advanced generative
auto-bidding backbone to enhance cross-task transfer of seasonal structure and
strengthen bidding performance. Meanwhile, we provide theoretical insights into
the proposed method, e.g., convergence guarantee and alignment analysis.
Extensive experiments on both simulated and large-scale real-world advertising
systems consistently demonstrate significant improvements over typical
baselines, illuminating the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

*Linping Qu,Shenghui Song,Chi-Ying Tsui*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Layer-wise adaptive modulation in wireless FL assigns modulation levels per DNN layer based on layer importance to reduce communication latency; achieves up to 73.9% latency reduction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In FL, transmitting high-dimensional DNN parameters over bandwidth-limited channels causes significant communication latency; exploiting layer importance can reduce data rate requirements.

Method: Proposes an automatic scheme to determine optimal modulation levels for each DNN layer, diverging from equal modulation across layers, to minimize latency while preserving essential information.

Result: Experiments show latency savings up to 73.9% compared with existing schemes.

Conclusion: Layer-wise adaptive modulation effectively reduces communication latency in wireless FL and highlights the value of considering layer importance in modulation design.

Abstract: In wireless federated learning (FL), the clients need to transmit the
high-dimensional deep neural network (DNN) parameters through bandwidth-limited
channels, which causes the communication latency issue. In this paper, we
propose a layer-wise adaptive modulation scheme to save the communication
latency. Unlike existing works which assign the same modulation level for all
DNN layers, we consider the layers' importance which provides more freedom to
save the latency. The proposed scheme can automatically decide the optimal
modulation levels for different DNN layers. Experimental results show that the
proposed scheme can save up to 73.9% of communication latency compared with the
existing schemes.

*Seth Minor,Bret D. Elderd,Benjamin Van Allen,David M. Bortz,Vanja Dukic*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A data-driven framework learns dispersal dynamics of lepidopteran larvae from sparse data using weak-form equation learning and kernel density estimation, demonstrated on fall armyworm movement in simulated crops.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Insect dispersal under infection, predation, and anisotropic environments is stochastic and data are sparse; learning governing Fokker-Planck-type dynamics from limited observations can improve outbreak forecasting and pest management.

Method: Extend weak-form equation learning (WSINDy) with kernel density estimation to infer effective stochastic dynamics from sparse position data; apply to Spodoptera frugiperda movement in simulated agricultural conditions with varying plant resources and infection status.

Result: Demonstrates the utility of the approach on a sparse dataset, producing interpretable models that capture how environmental factors and infection influence larval movement; validates feasibility of learning dispersal dynamics from highly sparse data.

Conclusion: Weak-form learning with KDE and WSINDy is a viable approach for modeling lepidopteran larval dispersal from limited data, with potential impact on forecasting outbreaks and informing pest-management strategies.

Abstract: Insect species subject to infection, predation, and anisotropic environmental
conditions may exhibit preferential movement patterns. Given the innate
stochasticity of exogenous factors driving these patterns over short
timescales, individual insect trajectories typically obey overdamped stochastic
dynamics. In practice, data-driven modeling approaches designed to learn the
underlying Fokker-Planck equations from observed insect distributions serve as
ideal tools for understanding and predicting such behavior. Understanding
dispersal dynamics of crop and silvicultural pests can lead to a better
forecasting of outbreak intensity and location, which can result in better pest
management. In this work, we extend weak-form equation learning techniques,
coupled with kernel density estimation, to learn effective models for
lepidopteran larval population movement from highly sparse experimental data.
Galerkin methods such as the Weak form Sparse Identification of Nonlinear
Dynamics (WSINDy) algorithm have recently proven useful for learning governing
equations in several scientific contexts. We demonstrate the utility of the
method on a sparse dataset of position measurements of fall armyworms
(Spodoptera frugiperda) obtained in simulated agricultural conditions with
varied plant resources and infection status.

*Majid Jaberi-Douraki,Hossein Sholehrasa,Xuan Xu,Remya Ampadi Ramachandran*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HySim-LLM — a principled framework for robust, interpretable adaptation of LLMs to structured biomedical data (PK tables) using embedding-weighted fine-tuning and manifold-aware denoising, underpinned by two theory guarantees: similarity-weighted generalization under embedding divergence and manifold-based denoising for noisy/off-manifold samples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The extraction and standardization of pharmacokinetic (PK) information from scientific literature face heterogeneity, noise, and domain shift, limiting the reliability of data-driven models. A robust, interpretable LLM adaptation framework is needed for structured biomedical data.

Method: A unified mathematical framework that combines embedding-weighted fine-tuning and manifold-aware denoising. It includes two theoretical results: (1) a similarity-weighted generalization bound under embedding divergence and (2) a manifold-based denoising guarantee that bounds loss from noisy or off-manifold samples.

Result: The paper provides two theoretical guarantees that form a principled foundation for fine-tuning LLMs in structured biomedical settings and outlines a mathematically grounded pathway toward reliable, interpretable LLM adaptation for data-intensive biomedical domains.

Conclusion: HySim-LLM offers a mathematically grounded pathway for reliable, interpretable LLM adaptation to structured biomedical data (e.g., PK tables), addressing heterogeneity and noise and supporting robust data-driven modeling in biomedical research.

Abstract: The extraction and standardization of pharmacokinetic (PK) information from
scientific literature remain significant challenges in computational
pharmacology, which limits the reliability of data-driven models in drug
development. Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in
text understanding and reasoning, yet their adaptation to structured biomedical
data, such as PK tables, remains constrained by heterogeneity, noise, and
domain shift. To address these limitations, we propose HySim-LLM, a unified
mathematical and computational framework that integrates embedding-weighted
fine-tuning and manifold-aware denoising to enhance the robustness and
interpretability of LLMs. We establish two theoretical results: (1) a
similarity-weighted generalization bound that quantifies adaptation performance
under embedding divergence, and (2) a manifold-based denoising guarantee that
bounds loss contributions from noisy or off-manifold samples. These theorems
provide a principled foundation for fine-tuning LLMs in structured biomedical
settings. The framework offers a mathematically grounded pathway toward
reliable and interpretable LLM adaptation for biomedical and data-intensive
scientific domains.

### [257] [SIMU: Selective Influence Machine Unlearning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07822)
*Anu Agarwal,Mihir Pamnani,Dilek Hakkani-Tur*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Selective Influence Machine Unlearning (SIMU): a two-step, neuron-targeted second-order unlearning method that forgets targeted information while preserving the model's prior knowledge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Safety: forgetting sensitive/unwanted information in LLMs without degrading general capabilities; existing unlearning methods often trade off forgetting efficacy for knowledge retention.

Method: Two-step approach: identify critical neurons encoding the forget-set and update only these neurons using second-order optimization, constraining updates to the targeted subset to minimize impact on overall knowledge.

Result: Unlearning efficacy comparable to existing second-order methods, with substantially better retention of original knowledge and overall utility compared to current approaches.

Conclusion: SIMU provides a targeted, efficient solution to the forgetting-utility trade-off by focusing updates on responsible neuronal subsets, enhancing safe and effective unlearning.

Abstract: The undesired memorization of sensitive information by Large Language Models
(LLMs) has emphasized the need for safety mechanisms that can regulate model
behavior. This has led to the development of machine unlearning techniques that
enable models to precisely forget sensitive and unwanted information. For
machine unlearning, first-order and second-order optimizer-based methods have
shown significant progress in enabling LLMs to forget targeted information.
However, in doing so, these approaches often compromise the model's original
capabilities, resulting in unlearned models that struggle to retain their prior
knowledge and overall utility. To address this, we propose Selective Influence
Machine Unlearning (SIMU), a two-step framework that enhances second-order
optimizer-based unlearning by selectively updating only the critical neurons
responsible for encoding the forget-set. By constraining updates to these
targeted neurons, SIMU achieves comparable unlearning efficacy while
substantially outperforming current methods in retaining the model's original
knowledge.

### [258] [MetaDefense: Defending Finetuning-based Jailbreak Attack Before and During Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07835)
*Weisen Jiang,Sinno Jialin Pan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces MetaDefense, a two-stage defense against finetuning-based jailbreaks in LLMs, using pre-generation and mid-generation checks to detect harmful content early and prevent leakage, robust to seen/unseen templates while preserving benign performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current defenses fail to generalize to harmful queries disguised by unseen templates. Although LLM embeddings can separate disguised harmful queries, existing defenses often rely on generation-time checks and do not robustly handle unseen attack templates.

Method: A two-stage approach: (i) pre-generation defense that predicts harmfulness of queries before response generation; (ii) mid-generation defense that monitors partial responses to stop further harmful content. The LLM is trained to predict harmfulness of both queries and partial outputs using specialized prompts, enabling early termination of interactions.

Result: Empirical evaluation across multiple LLMs (LLaMA-2-7B, Qwen-2.5-3B-Instruct, LLaMA-3.2-3B-Instruct) shows MetaDefense outperforms existing defenses, achieving robust defense against harmful queries with seen and unseen attack templates, while maintaining competitive performance on benign tasks.

Conclusion: MetaDefense provides a robust, generalizable defense against finetuning-based jailbreaks in LLMs; code released for replication and further study.

Abstract: This paper introduces MetaDefense, a novel framework for defending against
finetuning-based jailbreak attacks in large language models (LLMs). We observe
that existing defense mechanisms fail to generalize to harmful queries
disguised by unseen attack templates, despite LLMs being capable of
distinguishing disguised harmful queries in the embedding space. Based on these
insights, we propose a two-stage defense approach: (i) pre-generation defense
that detects harmful queries before response generation begins, and (ii)
mid-generation defense that monitors partial responses during generation to
prevent outputting more harmful content. Our MetaDefense trains the LLM to
predict the harmfulness of both queries and partial responses using specialized
prompts, enabling early termination of potentially harmful interactions.
Extensive experiments across multiple LLM architectures (LLaMA-2-7B,
Qwen-2.5-3B-Instruct, and LLaMA-3.2-3B-Instruct) demonstrate that MetaDefense
significantly outperforms existing defense mechanisms, achieving robust defense
against harmful queries with seen and unseen attack templates while maintaining
competitive performance on benign tasks. Code is available at

### [259] [Self-Improving LLM Agents at Test-Time](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07841)
*Emre Can Acikgoz,Cheng Qian,Heng Ji,Dilek Hakkani-Tür,Gokhan Tur*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Test-time self-improvement (TT-SI) enhances LM performance by self-identifying uncertain samples, generating similar examples, and fine-tuning on them at test time; TT-D uses a stronger model for distillation. TT-SI achieves ~5.48 percentage points average accuracy gain with far fewer training samples (68x) across benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce data collection costs and avoid redundant training data while achieving better generalization, by enabling LMs to improve themselves on difficult cases at inference time.

Method: Identify uncertain samples (self-awareness) from the model, perform self-data augmentation by generating similar examples from those samples, and perform test-time fine-tuning (self-improvement) using the new data. Compare TT-SI (self-generated data) with TT-D (distillation from a stronger model generating similar data).

Result: Across agent benchmarks, TT-SI yields +5.48% absolute accuracy gain on average, surpassing standard learning methods, with 68x fewer training samples.

Conclusion: Test-time self-improvement is a promising new paradigm for building more capable agents with self-evolution capabilities; TT-SI demonstrates practical data efficiency and performance gains, suggesting broader applicability and directions for future work.

Abstract: One paradigm of language model (LM) fine-tuning relies on creating large
training datasets, under the assumption that high quantity and diversity will
enable models to generalize to novel tasks after post-training. In practice,
gathering large sets of data is inefficient, and training on them is
prohibitively expensive; worse, there is no guarantee that the resulting model
will handle complex scenarios or generalize better. Moreover, existing
techniques rarely assess whether a training sample provides novel information
or is redundant with the knowledge already acquired by the model, resulting in
unnecessary costs. In this work, we explore a new test-time self-improvement
method to create more effective and generalizable agentic LMs on-the-fly. The
proposed algorithm can be summarized in three steps: (i) first it identifies
the samples that model struggles with (self-awareness), (ii) then generates
similar examples from detected uncertain samples (self-data augmentation), and
(iii) uses these newly generated samples at test-time fine-tuning
(self-improvement). We study two variants of this approach: Test-Time
Self-Improvement (TT-SI), where the same model generates additional training
examples from its own uncertain cases and then learns from them, and contrast
this approach with Test-Time Distillation (TT-D), where a stronger model
generates similar examples for uncertain cases, enabling student to adapt using
distilled supervision. Empirical evaluations across different agent benchmarks
demonstrate that TT-SI improves the performance with +5.48% absolute accuracy
gain on average across all benchmarks and surpasses other standard learning
methods, yet using 68x less training samples. Our findings highlight the
promise of TT-SI, demonstrating the potential of self-improvement algorithms at
test-time as a new paradigm for building more capable agents toward
self-evolution.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MA-GAD: a meta-learning based graph-level anomaly detection framework with graph compression and a bias network, enabling rapid adaptation under few-shot conditions and achieving state-of-the-art results on real-world biochemical datasets for graph- and subgraph-level anomaly detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Graph-level anomaly detection demands labeled data which is scarce; existing GNN-based methods degrade under limited supervision and are vulnerable to noise in few-shot settings. There is a need for data-efficient, robust methods that can quickly adapt to new graphs while preserving essential structure.

Method: Introduce MA-GAD, combining (1) a graph compression module to reduce noise and preserve key information; (2) meta-learning to learn a transferable initialization from similar networks for rapid adaptation to new tasks with few samples; (3) a bias network to enhance separation between anomalous and normal nodes. Evaluated on four real-world biochemical datasets for graph- and subgraph-level anomaly detection.

Result: MA-GAD outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in graph-level anomaly detection under few-shot conditions and proves effective for both graph-level and subgraph anomaly detection on real datasets.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates that combining graph compression, meta-learning for fast adaptation, and a bias mechanism yields robust, data-efficient graph anomaly detection suitable for real-world biochemical data and limited labeled scenarios.

Abstract: Graph-level anomaly detection aims to identify anomalous graphs or subgraphs
within graph datasets, playing a vital role in various fields such as fraud
detection, review classification, and biochemistry. While Graph Neural Networks
(GNNs) have made significant progress in this domain, existing methods rely
heavily on large amounts of labeled data, which is often unavailable in
real-world scenarios. Additionally, few-shot anomaly detection methods based on
GNNs are prone to noise interference, resulting in poor embedding quality and
reduced model robustness. To address these challenges, we propose a novel
meta-learning-based graph-level anomaly detection framework (MA-GAD),
incorporating a graph compression module that reduces the graph size,
mitigating noise interference while retaining essential node information. We
also leverage meta-learning to extract meta-anomaly information from similar
networks, enabling the learning of an initialization model that can rapidly
adapt to new tasks with limited samples. This improves the anomaly detection
performance on target graphs, and a bias network is used to enhance the
distinction between anomalous and normal nodes. Our experimental results, based
on four real-world biochemical datasets, demonstrate that MA-GAD outperforms
existing state-of-the-art methods in graph-level anomaly detection under
few-shot conditions. Experiments on both graph anomaly and subgraph anomaly
detection tasks validate the framework's effectiveness on real-world datasets.

Method: A review paper that surveys existing literature on SEM noise sources, SNR metrics, measurement/estimation methods, and SNR improvement techniques; compares approaches; discusses applications, advantages, and limitations.

Result: A consolidated framework and comparative assessment of SEM SNR approaches; identification of gaps and future research directions; practical guidance for researchers on selecting techniques.

Conclusion: The paper provides a comprehensive understanding of SEM SNR optimization and encourages ongoing research in both hardware and algorithmic strategies to improve SEM imaging quality.

Abstract: Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) is critical in nanotechnology, materials
science, and biological imaging due to its high spatial resolution and depth of
focus. Signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is an essential parameter in SEM because it
directly impacts the quality and interpretability of the images. SEM is widely
used in various scientific disciplines, but its utility can be compromised by
noise, which degrades image clarity. This review explores multiple aspects of
the SEM imaging process, from the principal operation of SEM, sources of noise
in SEM, methods for SNR measurement and estimations, to various aspects that
affect the SNR measurement and approaches to enhance SNR, both from a hardware
and software standpoint. We review traditional and emerging techniques,
focusing on their applications, advantages, and limitations. The paper aims to
provide a comprehensive understanding of SNR optimization in SEM for
researchers and practitioners and to encourage further research in the field.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AO-GPRLLSR is a ML-driven SEM denoising pipeline that uses LSR-based SNR estimation and Optimizable Gaussian Process Regression for NV estimation to guide an NV-aware Wiener filter, achieving reduced MSE.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SEM images are degraded by noise; accurate SNR and NV estimation enable better denoising. Integrating ML-based NV estimates with SNR estimation aims to create a robust, adaptive filtering pipeline for SEM.

Method: Evaluate five SNR estimators (NN, FOL, NN+FOL, NLLSR, LSR); find LSR superior. Test SVM and Gaussian Process Regression with LSR; use Optimizable GPR to estimate NV. Build AO-GPRLLSR pipeline that provides NV to an NV-guided Wiener filter, and assess denoising performance via MSE.

Result: AO-GPRLLSR yields accurate NV estimation and improved SNR assessment, leading to lower MSE after Wiener filtering compared to alternatives.

Conclusion: The proposed adaptive ML-driven NV/SNR estimation with an NV-guided Wiener filter provides improved SEM image denoising; success hinges on reliable SNR estimation and the ability of Optimizable GPR to model NV, with potential extensions to other imaging modalities and computational considerations.

Abstract: Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) images often suffer from noise
contamination, which degrades image quality and affects further analysis. This
research presents a complete approach to estimate their Signal-to-Noise Ratio
(SNR) and noise variance (NV), and enhance image quality using NV-guided Wiener
filter. The main idea of this study is to use a good SNR estimation technique
and infuse a machine learning model to estimate NV of the SEM image, which then
guides the wiener filter to remove the noise, providing a more robust and
accurate SEM image filtering pipeline. First, we investigate five different SNR
estimation techniques, namely Nearest Neighbourhood (NN) method, First-Order
Linear Interpolation (FOL) method, Nearest Neighbourhood with First-Order
Linear Interpolation (NN+FOL) method, Non-Linear Least Squares Regression
(NLLSR) method, and Linear Least Squares Regression (LSR) method. It is shown
that LSR method to perform better than the rest. Then, Support Vector Machines
(SVM) and Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) are tested by pairing it with LSR.
In this test, the Optimizable GPR model shows the highest accuracy and it
stands as the most effective solution for NV estimation. Combining these
results lead to the proposed Adaptive Optimizable Gaussian Process Regression
Linear Least Squares Regression (AO-GPRLLSR) Filtering pipeline. The AO-GPRLLSR
method generated an estimated noise variance which served as input to NV-guided
Wiener filter for improving the quality of SEM images. The proposed method is
shown to achieve notable success in estimating SNR and NV of SEM images and
leads to lower Mean Squared Error (MSE) after the filtering process.

*Chongmyung Kwon,Yujin Kim,Seoeun Park,Yunji Lee,Charmgil Hong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MMM uses ELF-based 3D electron-density maps combined with a bipartite graph encoder to predict drug–drug interactions, showing statistically significant improvements over baselines (e.g., SafeDrug) on MIMIC-III data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GNN-based drug representations in DDI prediction rely on simplified discrete forms and may miss molecular binding affinity and reactivity. Incorporating 3D quantum-chemical information like ELF maps can capture global electronic properties and local substructure interactions to improve safety in combinatorial prescribing.

Method: The framework MMM integrates ELF-derived 3D electron density maps with a bipartite graph encoder. It encodes global electronic properties via ELF maps and local substructure interactions via the bipartite graph, learning complementary drug representations. Evaluation uses the MIMIC-III dataset (250 drugs, 442 substructures), comparing MMM against baselines and SafeDrug, with statistical tests performed on F1, Jaccard, and DDI rate.

Result: MMM achieved statistically significant improvements over the baselines in key metrics: F1-score (p = 0.0387), Jaccard similarity (p = 0.0112), and DDI rate (p = 0.0386). The ELF-based 3D representations enhanced prediction accuracy and supported safer combinatorial drug prescribing in clinical practice.

Conclusion: ELF-based 3D representations are a promising direction for DDI prediction, offering improved accuracy and safety in clinical decision support when combined with local substructure modeling.

Abstract: Drug recommendation is an essential task in machine learning-based clinical
decision support systems. However, the risk of drug-drug interactions (DDI)
between co-prescribed medications remains a significant challenge. Previous
studies have used graph neural networks (GNNs) to represent drug structures.
Regardless, their simplified discrete forms cannot fully capture the molecular
binding affinity and reactivity. Therefore, we propose Multimodal DDI
Prediction with Molecular Electron Localization Function (ELF) Maps (MMM), a
novel framework that integrates three-dimensional (3D) quantum-chemical
information into drug representation learning. It generates 3D electron density
maps using the ELF. To capture both therapeutic relevance and interaction
risks, MMM combines ELF-derived features that encode global electronic
properties with a bipartite graph encoder that models local substructure
interactions. This design enables learning complementary characteristics of
drug molecules. We evaluate MMM in the MIMIC-III dataset (250 drugs, 442
substructures), comparing it with several baseline models. In particular, a
comparison with the GNN-based SafeDrug model demonstrates statistically
significant improvements in the F1-score (p = 0.0387), Jaccard (p = 0.0112),
and the DDI rate (p = 0.0386). These results demonstrate the potential of
ELF-based 3D representations to enhance prediction accuracy and support safer
combinatorial drug prescribing in clinical practice.

Motivation: To optimize user satisfaction across multiple objective signals by learning user- or context-specific weightings for diverse feedback signals, enabling adaptive, personalized ranking.

Method: 1) Feature Center and Prerank Model for candidate generation; 2) Multi-Task Learning (MTL) to predict various user feedback signals; 3) Multi-Task Fusion (MTF) with the proposed GRADE framework to learn personalized weights (w1,...,wn); 4) apply weights to compute final scores and create a blended ranking via the Blended Ranking Model; 5) deliver results to users.

Result: Proposes a cohesive architecture that can adaptively blend multiple signals through personalized weights, enabling a blended ranking that reflects individual user preferences and multiple objectives.

Conclusion: The GRADE-driven MTF module integrates with the ranking pipeline to produce a personalized, multi-objective ranking by weighting diverse signals, potentially improving user satisfaction and relevance through a learned, dynamic combination of objectives.

Abstract: Overall architecture of the personalized multi-objective ranking system. It
comprises: (1) a Feature Center and Prerank Model for initial feature
processing and candidate generation; (2) a Multi-Task Learning (MTL) model
predicting various user feedback signals; (3) a Multi-Task Fusion (MTF) module
(our proposed GRADE framework) that learns personalized weights ($w_1, \dots,
w_n$); these weights are then applied to calculate final scores and sorted to
generate a blended ranking by the Blended Ranking Model, which ultimately
delivers results to users.

### [265] [SketchGuard: Scaling Byzantine-Robust Decentralized Federated Learning via Sketch-Based Screening](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07922)
*Murtaza Rangwala,Farag Azzedin,Richard O. Sinnott,Rajkumar Buyya*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SketchGuard enables robust decentralized federated learning by screening neighbors with Count Sketch sketches of model updates, drastically reducing communication and computation while preserving Byzantine resilience; it provides convergence guarantees and strong empirical results at web scale.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Decentralized Federated Learning (DFL) is vulnerable to Byzantine attacks, and existing similarity-based neighbor screening requires exchanging full high-dimensional models among many neighbors, causing prohibitive communication and computation costs for web-scale deployment.

Method: Introduce SketchGuard, a framework that decouples Byzantine filtering from aggregation by compressing d-dimensional models into k-dimensional Count Sketches for similarity screening. Only full models are fetched from accepted neighbors, achieving reduced per-round communication complexity O(k|N_i| + d|S_i|) with |S_i| ≤ |N_i|. Provide convergence guarantees in strongly convex and non-convex settings, showing Count Sketch compression preserves resilience with a (1+O(ε)) degradation factor in the effective threshold parameter.

Result: Theoretical convergence guarantees in both strongly convex and non-convex regimes, with resilient behavior under Byzantine attacks; empirical results across multiple datasets, network topologies, and attack scenarios showing identical robustness to state-of-the-art methods, while reducing computation time by up to 82% and communication overhead by 50-70%, with benefits scaling with model dimensionality and connectivity.

Conclusion: SketchGuard demonstrates that sketch-based compression can be a fundamental enabler for robust DFL at web scale, maintaining Byzantine resilience while greatly reducing communication and computation costs.

Abstract: Decentralized Federated Learning (DFL) enables privacy-preserving
collaborative training without centralized servers, but remains vulnerable to
Byzantine attacks where malicious clients submit corrupted model updates.
Existing Byzantine-robust DFL defenses rely on similarity-based neighbor
screening that requires every client to exchange and compare complete
high-dimensional model vectors with all neighbors in each training round,
creating prohibitive communication and computational costs that prevent
deployment at web scale. We propose SketchGuard, a general framework that
decouples Byzantine filtering from model aggregation through sketch-based
neighbor screening. SketchGuard compresses $d$-dimensional models to
$k$-dimensional sketches ($k \ll d$) using Count Sketch for similarity
comparisons, then selectively fetches full models only from accepted neighbors,
reducing per-round communication complexity from $O(d|N_i|)$ to $O(k|N_i| +
d|S_i|)$, where $|N_i|$ is the neighbor count and $|S_i| \le |N_i|$ is the
accepted neighbor count. We establish rigorous convergence guarantees in both
strongly convex and non-convex settings, proving that Count Sketch compression
preserves Byzantine resilience with controlled degradation bounds where
approximation errors introduce only a $(1+O(\epsilon))$ factor in the effective
threshold parameter. Comprehensive experiments across multiple datasets,
network topologies, and attack scenarios demonstrate that SketchGuard maintains
identical robustness to state-of-the-art methods while reducing computation
time by up to 82% and communication overhead by 50-70% depending on filtering
effectiveness, with benefits scaling multiplicatively with model dimensionality
and network connectivity. These results establish the viability of sketch-based
compression as a fundamental enabler of robust DFL at web scale.

*Yongqi Ding,Lin Zuo,Mengmeng Jing,Kunshan Yang,Pei He,Tonglan Xie*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Self-distillation for SNNs by treating each timestep as a submodel; introduces Strong2Weak and Weak2Strong schemes with flexible implementations to improve accuracy and robustness without large teacher models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SNNs offer low power but underperform compared to ANNs; existing distillation relies on large teachers or adds overhead. A self-distillation approach leveraging temporal dynamics could close performance gaps efficiently.

Method: Decompose SNN into per-timestep submodels; assess output confidence to identify strong/weak instances; implement two schemes: Strong2Weak where strong acts as teacher to weaker counterparts, and Weak2Strong where weak acts as teacher to distill the strong; support ensemble, simultaneous, and cascade distillations.

Result: Self-distillation improves discriminability and overall performance of SNNs; also improves adversarial robustness due to stability gained from self-distillation.

Conclusion: Temporal self-distillation leverages SNN dynamics to train high-performance, robust SNNs efficiently, providing a scalable framework for efficient SNN training.

Abstract: Brain-inspired spiking neural networks (SNNs) promise to be a low-power
alternative to computationally intensive artificial neural networks (ANNs),
although performance gaps persist. Recent studies have improved the performance
of SNNs through knowledge distillation, but rely on large teacher models or
introduce additional training overhead. In this paper, we show that SNNs can be
naturally deconstructed into multiple submodels for efficient
self-distillation. We treat each timestep instance of the SNN as a submodel and
evaluate its output confidence, thus efficiently identifying the strong and the
weak. Based on this strong and weak relationship, we propose two efficient
self-distillation schemes: (1) \textbf{Strong2Weak}: During training, the
stronger "teacher" guides the weaker "student", effectively improving overall
performance. (2) \textbf{Weak2Strong}: The weak serve as the "teacher",
distilling the strong in reverse with underlying dark knowledge, again yielding
significant performance gains. For both distillation schemes, we offer flexible
implementations such as ensemble, simultaneous, and cascade distillation.
Experiments show that our method effectively improves the discriminability and
overall performance of the SNN, while its adversarial robustness is also
enhanced, benefiting from the stability brought by self-distillation. This
ingeniously exploits the temporal properties of SNNs and provides insight into
how to efficiently train high-performance SNNs.

### [267] [Some theoretical improvements on the tightness of PAC-Bayes risk certificates for neural networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07935)
*Diego García-Pérez,Emilio Parrado-Hernández,John Shawe-Taylor*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Four theoretical advances to improve PAC-Bayes risk certificates for neural networks: new KL bounds for Bernoulli distributions; implicit differentiation to embed certificates into training; a method to optimize bounds for non-differentiable losses; empirical validation on MNIST and CIFAR-10, including the first non-vacuous CIFAR-10 bounds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PAC-Bayes risk certificates offer principled generalization guarantees but remain difficult to tighten and incorporate into training. There is a need for tighter, reusable bounds across empirical risk ranges, optimization-friendly formulations, and handling non-differentiable losses to achieve non-vacuous guarantees on challenging datasets like CIFAR-10.

Method: 1) Derive two bounds on the KL divergence between Bernoulli distributions to obtain the tightest explicit risk bounds across different empirical risk regimes. 2) Develop an efficient implicit-differentiation-based methodology to integrate PAC-Bayesian risk certificates into the loss/objective used to train the network. 3) Propose a method to optimize bounds on non-differentiable objectives (e.g., 0-1 loss).

Result: Provides tighter explicit generalization bounds for varying empirical risk levels, a training-time optimization framework that includes PAC-Bayesian certificates, and a technique to handle non-differentiable objectives. Empirically, it yields the first non-vacuous generalization bounds on CIFAR-10 for neural networks and validates the approach on MNIST and CIFAR-10.

Conclusion: The work enhances the practicality and tightness of PAC-Bayes risk certificates for neural networks, enabling training-integrated risk guarantees and achieving non-vacuous CIFAR-10 bounds, supported by empirical results on standard benchmarks.

Abstract: This paper presents four theoretical contributions that improve the usability
of risk certificates for neural networks based on PAC-Bayes bounds. First, two
bounds on the KL divergence between Bernoulli distributions enable the
derivation of the tightest explicit bounds on the true risk of classifiers
across different ranges of empirical risk. The paper next focuses on the
formalization of an efficient methodology based on implicit differentiation
that enables the introduction of the optimization of PAC-Bayesian risk
certificates inside the loss/objective function used to fit the network/model.
The last contribution is a method to optimize bounds on non-differentiable
objectives such as the 0-1 loss. These theoretical contributions are
complemented with an empirical evaluation on the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets.
In fact, this paper presents the first non-vacuous generalization bounds on
CIFAR-10 for neural networks.

### [268] [DISCO: Diversifying Sample Condensation for Efficient Model Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07959)
*Alexander Rubinstein,Benjamin Raible,Martin Gubri,Seong Joon Oh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DISCO is a new, simple sample selection method for evaluating ML models that prioritizes maximizing disagreement among model responses over clustering-based diversity. It greedily selects top-k samples with the greatest inter-model disagreements to predict final test performance, aiming to reduce evaluation cost while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluation of modern ML models is prohibitively expensive (thousands of GPU hours). Anchor-subset approaches relying on clustering are complex and sensitive to design choices. There's a need for cheaper, inclusive evaluation; focusing on diversity of model responses rather than data diversity can yield better predictive power with simpler methods.

Method: DISCO (Diversifying Sample Condensation) selects the top-k samples that maximize inter-model disagreement. It uses greedy, sample-wise statistics rather than global clustering to choose samples, based on the idea that inter-model disagreement provides an information-theoretically optimal rule for such selection.

Result: DISCO achieves state-of-the-art predictive performance across several benchmarks (MMLU, Hellaswag, Winogrande, ARC), outperforming prior methods. It is simpler conceptually and provides empirical gains in predicting final test performance. Code is publicly available.

Conclusion: Promoting diversity in model responses, rather than diversity of data via clustering, suffices for effective evaluation subset selection. DISCO offers a cost-effective, simple, and general approach to predict model accuracy on full test sets, with strong empirical results and broad applicability.

Abstract: Evaluating modern machine learning models has become prohibitively expensive.
Benchmarks such as LMMs-Eval and HELM demand thousands of GPU hours per model.
Costly evaluation reduces inclusivity, slows the cycle of innovation, and
worsens environmental impact. The typical approach follows two steps. First,
select an anchor subset of data. Second, train a mapping from the accuracy on
this subset to the final test result. The drawback is that anchor selection
depends on clustering, which can be complex and sensitive to design choices. We
argue that promoting diversity among samples is not essential; what matters is
to select samples that $\textit{maximise diversity in model responses}$. Our
method, $\textbf{Diversifying Sample Condensation (DISCO)}$, selects the top-k
samples with the greatest model disagreements. This uses greedy, sample-wise
statistics rather than global clustering. The approach is conceptually simpler.
From a theoretical view, inter-model disagreement provides an
information-theoretically optimal rule for such greedy selection.
$\textbf{DISCO}$ shows empirical gains over prior methods, achieving
state-of-the-art results in performance prediction across MMLU, Hellaswag,
Winogrande, and ARC. Code is available here:

### [269] [PRESCRIBE: Predicting Single-Cell Responses with Bayesian Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07964)
*Jiabei Cheng,Changxi Chi,Jingbo Zhou,Hongyi Xin,Jun Xia*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PRESCRIBE uses a multivariate deep evidential regression framework to jointly model epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty in unseen gene perturbations, producing confidence scores that correlate with accuracy and enable filtering; yields >3% accuracy gains over baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Unseen gene perturbations in single-cell data create epistemic uncertainty; data noise causes aleatoric uncertainty; reliable predictions require quantifying both sources.

Method: PRESCRIBE: a multivariate deep evidential regression model that jointly estimates epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty and outputs a per-prediction confidence score.

Result: Confidence scores strongly correlate with empirical accuracy; enables filtering of low-trust predictions; empirical results show steady accuracy improvements >3% over comparable baselines.

Conclusion: Uncertainty-aware perturbation prediction improves reliability and performance; Bayesian evidential approach is practical for single-cell perturbation tasks.

Abstract: In single-cell perturbation prediction, a central task is to forecast the
effects of perturbing a gene unseen in the training data. The efficacy of such
predictions depends on two factors: (1) the similarity of the target gene to
those covered in the training data, which informs model (epistemic)
uncertainty, and (2) the quality of the corresponding training data, which
reflects data (aleatoric) uncertainty. Both factors are critical for
determining the reliability of a prediction, particularly as gene perturbation
is an inherently stochastic biochemical process. In this paper, we propose
PRESCRIBE (PREdicting Single-Cell Response wIth Bayesian Estimation), a
multivariate deep evidential regression framework designed to measure both
sources of uncertainty jointly. Our analysis demonstrates that PRESCRIBE
effectively estimates a confidence score for each prediction, which strongly
correlates with its empirical accuracy. This capability enables the filtering
of untrustworthy results, and in our experiments, it achieves steady accuracy
improvements of over 3% compared to comparable baselines.

### [270] [Climate Surrogates for Scalable Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning: A Case Study with CICERO-SCM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07971)
*Oskar Bohn Lassen,Serio Angelo Maria Agriesti,Filipe Rodrigues,Francisco Camara Pereira*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A multi-agent RL framework uses a fast, high-fidelity climate surrogate to model multi-gas dynamics, enabling scalable policy learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To capture combined greenhouse-gas effects on global temperature in RL settings without prohibitive compute.

Method: Integrate a pretrained RNN surrogate of CICERO-SCM into the environment loop; train on 20,000 multi-gas emission pathways; applicable in MARL; show convergence and assessment methodology.

Result: Surrogate achieves ~0.0004 K global-mean temp RMSE; ~1000x faster one-step inference; >100x faster end-to-end training; MARL policies with surrogate converge to those with the full simulator; methodology to compare when simulator unavailable.

Conclusion: Surrogate-enabled MARL bypasses computational bottlenecks, enabling large-scale multi-agent experiments with multi-gas dynamics and high-fidelity climate response, while preserving policy fidelity.

Abstract: Climate policy studies require models that capture the combined effects of
multiple greenhouse gases on global temperature, but these models are
computationally expensive and difficult to embed in reinforcement learning. We
present a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework that integrates a
high-fidelity, highly efficient climate surrogate directly in the environment
loop, enabling regional agents to learn climate policies under multi-gas
dynamics. As a proof of concept, we introduce a recurrent neural network
architecture pretrained on ($20{,}000$) multi-gas emission pathways to
surrogate the climate model CICERO-SCM. The surrogate model attains
near-simulator accuracy with global-mean temperature RMSE $\approx 0.0004
\mathrm{K}$ and approximately $1000\times$ faster one-step inference. When
substituted for the original simulator in a climate-policy MARL setting, it
accelerates end-to-end training by $>\!100\times$. We show that the surrogate
and simulator converge to the same optimal policies and propose a methodology
to assess this property in cases where using the simulator is intractable. Our
work allows to bypass the core computational bottleneck without sacrificing
policy fidelity, enabling large-scale multi-agent experiments across
alternative climate-policy regimes with multi-gas dynamics and high-fidelity
climate response.

*Qinglun Li,Yingqi Liu,Miao Zhang,Xiaochun Cao,Quanjun Yin,Li Shen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Multi-Gossip Steps (MGS) speed up optimization and tighten generalization bounds, but cannot fully close the gap to centralized training; performance depends on learning rate, data heterogeneity, node count, per-node samples, and topology; CIFAR experiments support theory.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ask why MGS helps decentralized training and whether it can completely match centralized SGD, addressing theoretical gaps in non-convex settings without bounded gradients.

Method: Stability-based generalization analysis deriving upper bounds on generalization error and excess error for MGS; non-convex setting without bounded gradients; derive exponential decay of optimization error, analyze gap to centralized SGD, and quantify dependence on learning rate, heterogeneity, number of nodes, local data, and communication topology; provide unified theoretical framework and CIFAR experiments.

Result: MGS reduces optimization error bound at an exponential rate, exponentially tightening the generalization bound and enabling better convergence; a non-negligible gap to centralized mini-batch SGD remains even as MGS grows, with rates shown as O(T^{cβ/(cβ+1)}/(nm)) for centralized and O(T^{2cβ/(2cβ+2)}/(n m^{1/(2cβ+2)}) for decentralized; first unified analysis under non-convex settings without bounded gradients; empirical validation on CIFAR supports the theory.

Conclusion: MGS is effective for accelerating optimization and improving generalization bounds but cannot fully bridge the gap to centralized training; provides theoretical and empirical insights into how learning rate, data heterogeneity, node count, per-node samples, and topology shape generalization under MGS.

Abstract: Decentralized training removes the centralized server, making it a
communication-efficient approach that can significantly improve training
efficiency, but it often suffers from degraded performance compared to
centralized training. Multi-Gossip Steps (MGS) serve as a simple yet effective
bridge between decentralized and centralized training, significantly reducing
experiment performance gaps. However, the theoretical reasons for its
effectiveness and whether this gap can be fully eliminated by MGS remain open
questions. In this paper, we derive upper bounds on the generalization error
and excess error of MGS using stability analysis, systematically answering
these two key questions. 1). Optimization Error Reduction: MGS reduces the
optimization error bound at an exponential rate, thereby exponentially
tightening the generalization error bound and enabling convergence to better
solutions. 2). Gap to Centralization: Even as MGS approaches infinity, a
non-negligible gap in generalization error remains compared to centralized
mini-batch SGD ($\mathcal{O}(T^{\frac{c\beta}{c\beta +1}}/{n m})$ in
centralized and $\mathcal{O}(T^{\frac{2c\beta}{2c\beta +2}}/{n
m^{\frac{1}{2c\beta +2}}})$ in decentralized). Furthermore, we provide the
first unified analysis of how factors like learning rate, data heterogeneity,
node count, per-node sample size, and communication topology impact the
generalization of MGS under non-convex settings without the bounded gradients
assumption, filling a critical theoretical gap in decentralized training.
Finally, promising experiments on CIFAR datasets support our theoretical
findings.

### [272] [Fewer Weights, More Problems: A Practical Attack on LLM Pruning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07985)
*Kazuki Egashira,Robin Staab,Thibaud Gloaguen,Mark Vero,Martin Vechev*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper reveals a new security risk in LLM pruning: an attacker can craft a model that looks harmless but becomes malicious after pruning by exploiting a proxy metric predicting pruning likelihood. This leads to high attack success across pruning methods, exposing deployment-time vulnerabilities in model compression.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Security implications of model pruning are underexplored. As pruning is used to reduce footprint in LLMs during deployment, attackers may manipulate pruned vs. unpruned behavior, creating a critical, under-addressed risk in real-world pipelines.

Method: The attacker computes a proxy metric estimating per-parameter pruning likelihood, injects malicious behavior into parameters unlikely to be pruned, then repairs the model using parameters likely to be pruned to cancel the injection. The attack is evaluated on five models using pruning methods (Magnitude, Wanda, SparseGPT) within the vLLM ecosystem, across various attack scenarios.

Result: The attack remains highly effective across pruning methods, achieving up to 95.7% jailbreak success, 98.7% benign instruction refusal, and 99.5% targeted content injection.

Conclusion: Demonstrates a deployment-time security gap in model compression. Calls for stronger security considerations and defenses against pruning-time manipulation in LLM deployment pipelines.

Abstract: Model pruning, i.e., removing a subset of model weights, has become a
prominent approach to reducing the memory footprint of large language models
(LLMs) during inference. Notably, popular inference engines, such as vLLM,
enable users to conveniently prune downloaded models before they are deployed.
While the utility and efficiency of pruning methods have improved
significantly, the security implications of pruning remain underexplored. In
this work, for the first time, we show that modern LLM pruning methods can be
maliciously exploited. In particular, an adversary can construct a model that
appears benign yet, once pruned, exhibits malicious behaviors. Our method is
based on the idea that the adversary can compute a proxy metric that estimates
how likely each parameter is to be pruned. With this information, the adversary
can first inject a malicious behavior into those parameters that are unlikely
to be pruned. Then, they can repair the model by using parameters that are
likely to be pruned, effectively canceling out the injected behavior in the
unpruned model. We demonstrate the severity of our attack through extensive
evaluation on five models; after any of the pruning in vLLM are applied
(Magnitude, Wanda, and SparseGPT), it consistently exhibits strong malicious
behaviors in a diverse set of attack scenarios (success rates of up to $95.7\%$
for jailbreak, $98.7\%$ for benign instruction refusal, and $99.5\%$ for
targeted content injection). Our results reveal a critical deployment-time
security gap and underscore the urgent need for stronger security awareness in
model compression.

*Md. Saiful Bari Siddiqui,Md Mohaiminul Islam,Md. Golam Rabiul Alam*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Dynamic weighting of subset models in Divide2Conquer based on validation performance and uncertainty improves generalization and reduces overfitting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overfitting in deep learning arises from outliers, noise, and limited data; standard D2C aggregates subset models equally, potentially underutilizing better-generalizing subsets.

Method: DUA-D2C extends D2C by dynamically weighting subset models during aggregation using their validation accuracy and prediction uncertainty, allowing the central model to emphasize more generalizable and confident edge models.

Result: Empirical evaluations on benchmark datasets across domains show significant generalization improvements; analyses include decision boundaries and loss curves; the approach is compatible with other regularization methods; code is publicly available.

Conclusion: DUA-D2C offers a theoretically grounded, effective mechanism to combat overfitting via smarter aggregation, complementing regularization and improving cross-domain generalization.

Abstract: Overfitting remains a significant challenge in deep learning, often arising
from data outliers, noise, and limited training data. To address this, the
Divide2Conquer (D2C) method was previously proposed, which partitions training
data into multiple subsets and trains identical models independently on each.
This strategy enables learning more consistent patterns while minimizing the
influence of individual outliers and noise. However, D2C's standard aggregation
typically treats all subset models equally or based on fixed heuristics (like
data size), potentially underutilizing information about their varying
generalization capabilities. Building upon this foundation, we introduce
Dynamic Uncertainty-Aware Divide2Conquer (DUA-D2C), an advanced technique that
refines the aggregation process. DUA-D2C dynamically weights the contributions
of subset models based on their performance on a shared validation set,
considering both accuracy and prediction uncertainty. This intelligent
aggregation allows the central model to preferentially learn from subsets
yielding more generalizable and confident edge models, thereby more effectively
combating overfitting. Empirical evaluations on benchmark datasets spanning
multiple domains demonstrate that DUA-D2C significantly improves
generalization. Our analysis includes evaluations of decision boundaries, loss
curves, and other performance metrics, highlighting the effectiveness of
DUA-D2C. This study demonstrates that DUA-D2C improves generalization
performance even when applied on top of other regularization methods,
establishing it as a theoretically grounded and effective approach to combating
overfitting in modern deep learning. Our codes are publicly available at:

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Recycle pretrained checkpoints by growth (depth via interpositional layer copying; width via expert duplication with noise) and continued training to improve efficiency. Demonstrated on Mixture-of-Experts models up to 70B parameters with >1T tokens, achieving about a 10.7 percentage-point accuracy gain over training from scratch under the same extra compute.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reduce wasted compute by leveraging sunk cost in existing checkpoints, enabling economical reuse of previously trained models to reach higher performance without starting from scratch.

Method: Orthogonal growth for converged Mixture-of-Experts: depth growth via interpositional layer copying; width growth via expert duplication with injected noise; analyze optimal timing across sequences of checkpoints through large-scale scaling experiments.

Result: Final accuracy correlates positively with the amount of sunk cost; scalable to 70B parameters and >1T tokens, yielding ~10.66% accuracy gain vs training from scratch under the same additional compute budget.

Conclusion: Checkpoint recycling via orthogonal growth offers a practical foundation for economical pretraining of large language models.

Abstract: The rapidly increasing computational cost of pretraining Large Language
Models necessitates more efficient approaches. Numerous computational costs
have been invested in existing well-trained checkpoints, but many of them
remain underutilized due to engineering constraints or limited model capacity.
To efficiently reuse this "sunk" cost, we propose to recycle pretrained
checkpoints by expanding their parameter counts and continuing training. We
propose orthogonal growth method well-suited for converged Mixture-of-Experts
model: interpositional layer copying for depth growth and expert duplication
with injected noise for width growth. To determine the optimal timing for such
growth across checkpoints sequences, we perform comprehensive scaling
experiments revealing that the final accuracy has a strong positive correlation
with the amount of sunk cost, indicating that greater prior investment leads to
better performance. We scale our approach to models with 70B parameters and
over 1T training tokens, achieving 10.66% accuracy gain over training from
scratch under the same additional compute budget. Our checkpoint recycling
approach establishes a foundation for economically efficient large language
model pretraining.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A nested evolving set process framework accelerates Personalized PageRank (PPR) computation by solving a few localized linear systems; achieves an ε-approximation with time near-linear in graph size under certain regimes, resolving a known open conjecture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Speed up PPR computation on large graphs while providing provable time bounds and resolving an open conjecture about the complexity.

Method: Introduce nested evolving set processes and localized inexact proximal point iterations to solve simplified linear systems at each stage; derive upper bounds on time complexity and the number of linear systems needed; show near-graph-size-independent performance under certain conditions.

Result: Derived complexity bounds: time to ε-approximation is min{Ō(R^2/ε^2), Ō(m)}; with Õ(1/√α) linear systems needed, giving overall Õ(R^2/(√α ε^2)) when 1/ε^2 ≪ m; empirical results on real graphs show rapid convergence in early stages; resolves an open conjecture in the literature.

Conclusion: The framework provides an efficient, scalable method for approximating PPR with reduced dependence on graph size, validated by experiments, and opens avenues for further practical refinement.

Abstract: This work proposes a novel framework based on nested evolving set processes
to accelerate Personalized PageRank (PPR) computation. At each stage of the
process, we employ a localized inexact proximal point iteration to solve a
simplified linear system. We show that the time complexity of such localized
methods is upper bounded by $\min\{\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(R^2/\epsilon^2),
\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(m)\}$ to obtain an $\epsilon$-approximation of the PPR
vector, where $m$ denotes the number of edges in the graph and $R$ is a
constant defined via nested evolving set processes. Furthermore, the algorithms
induced by our framework require solving only
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(1/\sqrt{\alpha})$ such linear systems, where $\alpha$ is
the damping factor. When $1/\epsilon^2\ll m$, this implies the existence of an
algorithm that computes an $\ epsilon $-approximation of the PPR vector with an
overall time complexity of $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}\left(R^2 /
(\sqrt{\alpha}\epsilon^2)\right)$, independent of the underlying graph size.
Our result resolves an open conjecture from existing literature. Experimental
results on real-world graphs validate the efficiency of our methods,
demonstrating significant convergence in the early stages.

TL;DR: HMM-based framework to recover calibration-free radio maps by jointly modeling MIMO channel propagation and user trajectory; achieves 0.65 m indoor localization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reduce costly calibration of radio maps by inferring the data-collection trajectory from channel data rather than relying on location-labeled CSI datasets.

Method: An HMM framework that conditionally models the MIMO channel propagation (power, delay, angle) with LOS/NLOS-specific models, while representing the user trajectory as a Gaussian-Markov process; jointly optimizes channel parameters, mobility model, and LOS/NLOS classification. Validation on simulated MIMO-OFDM with a multi-antenna ULA.

Result: Achieves average indoor localization accuracy of 0.65 meters across LOS and NLOS regions; the resulting radio map yields lower localization error than conventional supervised methods such as KNN, SVM, and DNN.

Conclusion: Demonstrates feasibility of calibration-free radio map construction by jointly modeling channel propagation and trajectory with an HMM, offering reduced calibration costs and improved localization in indoor environments.

Abstract: Radio maps are essential for enhancing wireless communications and
localization. However, existing methods for constructing radio maps typically
require costly calibration processes to collect location-labeled channel state
information (CSI) datasets. This paper aims to recover the data collection
trajectory directly from the channel propagation sequence, eliminating the need
for location calibration. The key idea is to employ a hidden Markov model
(HMM)-based framework to conditionally model the channel propagation matrix,
while simultaneously modeling the location correlation in the trajectory. The
primary challenges involve modeling the complex relationship between channel
propagation in multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) networks and geographical
locations, and addressing both line-of-sight (LOS) and non-line-of-sight (NLOS)
indoor conditions. In this paper, we propose an HMM-based framework that
jointly characterizes the conditional propagation model and the evolution of
the user trajectory. Specifically, the channel propagation in MIMO networks is
modeled separately in terms of power, delay, and angle, with distinct models
for LOS and NLOS conditions. The user trajectory is modeled using a
Gaussian-Markov model. The parameters for channel propagation, the mobility
model, and LOS/NLOS classification are optimized simultaneously. Experimental
validation using simulated MIMO-Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiplexing
(OFDM) networks with a multi-antenna uniform linear arrays (ULA) configuration
demonstrates that the proposed method achieves an average localization accuracy
of 0.65 meters in an indoor environment, covering both LOS and NLOS regions.
Moreover, the constructed radio map enables localization with a reduced error
compared to conventional supervised methods, such as k-nearest neighbors (KNN),
support vector machine (SVM), and deep neural network (DNN).

### [278] [Backdoor Vectors: a Task Arithmetic View on Backdoor Attacks and Defenses](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08016)
*Stanisław Pawlak,Jan Dubiński,Daniel Marczak,Bartłomiej Twardowski*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A vector-based framework for backdoors in model merging: define Backdoor Vector (BV) as weight-differences between backdoored and clean fine-tuned models, introduce Sparse BV (SBV) to merge multiple attacks, and Injection BV Subtraction (IBVS) as a lightweight defense, with SBV-based attacks and IBVS defense claimed to be effective and novel.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address security risks in model merging by providing a formal, transferable framework to analyze backdoor attacks and to propose methods for both enhancing attack effectiveness (SBV) and defending against backdoors (IBVS).

Method: 1) Define Backdoor Vector (BV) as the weight difference between a fine-tuned backdoored model and a fine-tuned clean model. 2) Use BV to study attack similarity and transferability. 3) Propose Sparse Backdoor Vector (SBV) to combine multiple attacks into a single one. 4) Identify inherent triggers as core vulnerability. 5) Propose Injection BV Subtraction (IBVS) as an assumption-free defense against backdoors in model merging.

Result: SBV reportedly surpasses prior backdoor attacks and is the first method to leverage merging to enhance backdoor effectiveness; IBVS provides a lightweight, general defense that remains effective even when the backdoor threat is unknown.

Conclusion: The paper introduces a BV-based framework for analyzing backdoors in model merging, demonstrates that SBV can create more potent merged backdoors, and offers IBVS as a broad defense, suggesting merging-based backdoors are a significant threat while providing a practical countermeasure.

Abstract: Model merging (MM) recently emerged as an effective method for combining
large deep learning models. However, it poses significant security risks.
Recent research shows that it is highly susceptible to backdoor attacks, which
introduce a hidden trigger into a single fine-tuned model instance that allows
the adversary to control the output of the final merged model at inference
time. In this work, we propose a simple framework for understanding backdoor
attacks by treating the attack itself as a task vector. $Backdoor\ Vector\
(BV)$ is calculated as the difference between the weights of a fine-tuned
backdoored model and fine-tuned clean model. BVs reveal new insights into
attacks understanding and a more effective framework to measure their
similarity and transferability. Furthermore, we propose a novel method that
enhances backdoor resilience through merging dubbed $Sparse\ Backdoor\ Vector\
(SBV)$ that combines multiple attacks into a single one. We identify the core
vulnerability behind backdoor threats in MM: $inherent\ triggers$ that exploit
adversarial weaknesses in the base model. To counter this, we propose
$Injection\ BV\ Subtraction\ (IBVS)$ - an assumption-free defense against
backdoors in MM. Our results show that SBVs surpass prior attacks and is the
first method to leverage merging to improve backdoor effectiveness. At the same
time, IBVS provides a lightweight, general defense that remains effective even
when the backdoor threat is entirely unknown.

### [279] [Do We Really Need Permutations? Impact of Width Expansion on Linear Mode Connectivity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08023)
*Akira Ito,Masanori Yamada,Daiki Chijiwa,Atsutoshi Kumagai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Widening neural networks can enable linear mode connectivity (LMC) without permutation, if softmax temperature is calibrated; LEWC explains why by showing the merged model behaves like an ensemble of the originals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenge the belief that LMC requires permutation space enlargement and many parameters; show that width, with proper calibration, can induce LMC and offer a theoretical mechanism for this phenomenon.

Method: Empirical study: widen models without performing parameter permutations, apply softmax temperature calibration, and analyze the resulting merged models via layerwise exponentially weighted connectivity (LEWC). Compare merged outputs to ensembles and examine intermediate-layer representations to connect theory with observed LMC.

Result: Widened models with temperature calibration achieve LMC even without permutations; the LEWC framework demonstrates that the merged model output equals an ensemble of the original models, increasing the likelihood of LMC; width contributes to nonlinear and linear mode connectivity.

Conclusion: Width expansion plus temperature calibration suffices to attain LMC, challenging the necessity of permutation search; LEWC provides a plausible explanation by linking merged model outputs to an ensemble, thereby facilitating linear connectivity between independently trained models.

Abstract: Recently, Ainsworth et al. empirically demonstrated that, given two
independently trained models, applying a parameter permutation that preserves
the input-output behavior allows the two models to be connected by a low-loss
linear path. When such a path exists, the models are said to achieve linear
mode connectivity (LMC). Prior studies, including Ainsworth et al., have
reported that achieving LMC requires not only an appropriate permutation search
but also sufficiently wide models (e.g., a 32 $\times$ width multiplier for
ResNet-20). This is broadly believed to be because increasing the model width
ensures a large enough space of candidate permutations, increasing the chance
of finding one that yields LMC. In this work, we empirically demonstrate that,
even without any permutations, simply widening the models is sufficient for
achieving LMC when using a suitable softmax temperature calibration. We further
explain why this phenomenon arises by analyzing intermediate layer outputs.
Specifically, we introduce layerwise exponentially weighted connectivity
(LEWC), which states that the output of each layer of the merged model can be
represented as an exponentially weighted sum of the outputs of the
corresponding layers of the original models. Consequently the merged model's
output matches that of an ensemble of the original models, which facilitates
LMC. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to show that widening
the model not only facilitates nonlinear mode connectivity, as suggested in
prior research, but also significantly increases the possibility of achieving
linear mode connectivity.

### [280] [From Tokens to Layers: Redefining Stall-Free Scheduling for LLM Serving with Layered Prefill](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08055)
*Gunjun Lee,Jiwon Kim,Jaiyoung Park,Younjoo Lee,Jung Ho Ahn*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Layered prefill reorients scheduling from token-level to layer-group-level, interleaving prefill and decode across contiguous transformer layer groups to maintain stall-free decoding while reducing MoE weight reloads and memory bandwidth. It improves TTFT, latency, and energy versus chunked prefill.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Chunked prefill adds redundant MoE weight loads and high memory traffic in production LLMs; need to sustain stall-free decoding without paying excess energy and bandwidth costs.

Method: Partition the transformer into contiguous layer groups (vertical partitioning). Interleave prefill and decode at the layer-group level rather than token-level, thereby eliminating token-based MoE weight reloads; evaluate against chunked prefill on MoE-enabled LLMs; measure TTFT, TBT, end-to-end latency, bandwidth, and energy.

Result: Reduces off-chip bandwidth demand; TTFT reduced up to 70%, End-to-End latency down to 41%, per-token energy down to 22%; consistent improvement on TTFT–TBT Pareto frontier; lowers expert-load traffic and energy while preserving stall-free decoding.

Conclusion: Shifting scheduling axis to layers enables a more energy-efficient LLM serving regime in co-located environments, offering a practical and scalable improvement over chunked prefill in MoE contexts.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) inference in production must meet stringent
service-level objectives for both time-to-first-token (TTFT) and
time-between-token (TBT) while maximizing throughput under fixed compute,
memory, and interconnect budgets. Modern serving systems adopt stall-free
scheduling techniques such as chunked prefill, which splits long prompt
processing along the token dimension and interleaves prefill with ongoing
decode iterations. While effective at stabilizing TBT, chunked prefill incurs
substantial overhead in Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models: redundant expert
weight loads increase memory traffic by up to 39% and inflate energy
consumption. We propose layered prefill, a new scheduling paradigm that treats
transformer layer groups as the primary scheduling unit. By vertically
partitioning the model into contiguous layer groups and interleaving prefill
and decode across the groups, layered prefill sustains stall-free decoding
while eliminating chunk-induced MoE weight reloads. It reduces off-chip
bandwidth demand, lowering TTFT by up to 70%, End-to-End latency by 41% and
per-token energy by up to 22%. Evaluations show that layered prefill
consistently improves the TTFT--TBT Pareto frontier over chunked prefill,
reducing expert-load traffic and energy cost while maintaining stall-free
decoding. Overall, shifting the scheduling axis from tokens to layers unlocks a
new operating regime for high-efficiency, energy-aware LLM serving in
co-located environments.

*Timon Klein,Piotr Minakowski,Sebastian Sager*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces Subject-Conditioned Layer: a drop-in adaptive layer for EEG models that splits weights into shared and subject-specific low-rank corrections, improving cross-subject robustness and enabling scalable foundation models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Subject-specific distribution shifts hinder EEG foundation models; need robust adaptation that preserves generalization while personalizing.

Method: Proposes a Subject-Conditioned Layer that replaces standard layers; weights are decomposed into a shared subject-invariant component plus a lightweight, low-rank, per-subject correction, enabling easy integration into existing architectures.

Result: Empirically outperforms a subject-agnostic model and the average of individually trained subject-specific models, indicating better cross-subject performance with a scalable approach.

Conclusion: Offers a practical and scalable path toward cross-subject EEG foundation models by explicitly separating general knowledge from personalized adaptation.

Abstract: Subject-specific distribution shifts represent an important obstacle to the
development of foundation models for EEG decoding. To address this, we propose
Subject-Conditioned Layer,, an adaptive layer designed as a drop-in replacement
for standard linear or convolutional layers in any neural network architecture.
Our layer captures subject-specific variability by decomposing its weights into
a shared, subject-invariant component and a lightweight, low-rank correction
unique to each subject. This explicit separation of general knowledge from
personalized adaptation allows existing models to become robust to subject
shifts. Empirically, models equipped with our layer outperform both a
shared-weight-only model (subject-agnostic model) and the average of
individually trained subject-specific models. Consequently, the
Subject-Conditioned Layer, offers a practical and scalable path towards
building effective cross-subject foundation models for EEG.

*Daniel Jarne Ornia,Joel Dyer,Nicholas Bishop,Anisoara Calinescu,Michael Wooldridge*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A framework for integrating expert data into Bayesian multi-armed bandits in offline and simultaneous settings; shows pretraining tightens regret via mutual information; introduces an information-directed rule to select data sources; provides trust-inference strategies to guard against ineffective or compromised experts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As AI agents operate alongside human experts or prior agents, there is a need to understand how to optimally use expert-provided outcomes that differ in structure from the learner’s own experiences, and to quantify when such data is valuable.

Method: Formalizes how expert data updates the learner’s posterior in Bayesian bandits, derives information-theoretic regret bounds showing pretraining reduces regret via mutual information between expert data and the optimal action, proposes an information-directed rule that at each step selects the data source maximizing one-step information gain about the optimal action, and develops strategies for inferring when to trust the expert and when not to.

Result: Pretraining on expert outcomes tightens regret bounds by a term tied to the mutual information between the expert data and the optimal action. The proposed information-directed rule improves learning by prioritizing data sources with the highest one-step information gain. The work also offers practical strategies to detect and cope with ineffective or compromised experts, safeguarding the learner.

Conclusion: The framework quantifies the value of expert data and yields practical, information-theoretic algorithms for intelligent data-source selection, enabling agents to learn when to learn from others and how to guard against poor or malicious experts.

Abstract: Complex learning agents are increasingly deployed alongside existing experts,
such as human operators or previously trained agents. However, it remains
unclear how should learners optimally incorporate certain forms of expert data,
which may differ in structure from the learner's own action-outcome
experiences. We study this problem in the context of Bayesian multi-armed
bandits, considering: (i) offline settings, where the learner receives a
dataset of outcomes from the expert's optimal policy before interaction, and
(ii) simultaneous settings, where the learner must choose at each step whether
to update its beliefs based on its own experience, or based on the outcome
simultaneously achieved by an expert. We formalize how expert data influences
the learner's posterior, and prove that pretraining on expert outcomes tightens
information-theoretic regret bounds by the mutual information between the
expert data and the optimal action. For the simultaneous setting, we propose an
information-directed rule where the learner processes the data source that
maximizes their one-step information gain about the optimal action. Finally, we
propose strategies for how the learner can infer when to trust the expert and
when not to, safeguarding the learner for the cases where the expert is
ineffective or compromised. By quantifying the value of expert data, our
framework provides practical, information-theoretic algorithms for agents to
intelligently decide when to learn from others.

### [283] [Approximate Domain Unlearning for Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08132)
*Kodai Kawamura,Yuta Goto,Rintaro Yanagi,Hirokatsu Kataoka,Go Irie*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces Approximate Domain Unlearning (ADU) for pre-trained Vision-Language Models to reduce recognition of images from a specified domain (e.g., illustration) while preserving accuracy for other domains (e.g., real), addressing entangled domain features with a disentanglement-based, instance-aware approach; experiments show superiority over VLM tuning baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current unlearning focuses on removing entire object classes, but domain leakage and safety concerns require finer-grained control. VLMs generalize across domains, causing domain distributions to be entangled in feature space; naive penalties fail to forget a domain without harming others.

Method: Proposes explicit disentanglement of domain distributions in feature space and adaptive, instance-specific modeling to guide unlearning, enabling selective degradation of target-domain recognition while preserving non-target domains.

Result: Extensive experiments show that ADU outperforms baselines based on VLM tuning, enabling practical and fine-grained unlearning in VLMs.

Conclusion: ADU provides a practical framework for approximate domain unlearning in Vision-Language Models, enabling safer, more efficient deployment by forgetting domain-specific cues without sacrificing performance on other domains; lays groundwork for domain-aware privacy and robustness in VLMs.

Abstract: Pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) exhibit strong generalization
capabilities, enabling them to recognize a wide range of objects across diverse
domains without additional training. However, they often retain irrelevant
information beyond the requirements of specific downstream tasks, raising
concerns about computational efficiency and potential information leakage. This
has motivated growing interest in approximate unlearning, which aims to
selectively remove unnecessary knowledge while preserving overall model
performance. Existing approaches to approximate unlearning have primarily
focused on class unlearning, where a VLM is retrained to fail to recognize
specified object classes while maintaining accuracy for others. However, merely
forgetting object classes is often insufficient in practical applications. For
instance, an autonomous driving system should accurately recognize real cars
while avoiding misrecognition of illustrated cars depicted in roadside
advertisements as real cars, which could be hazardous. In this paper, we
introduce Approximate Domain Unlearning (ADU), a novel problem setting that
requires reducing recognition accuracy for images from specified domains (e.g.,
illustration) while preserving accuracy for other domains (e.g., real). ADU
presents new technical challenges: due to the strong domain generalization
capability of pre-trained VLMs, domain distributions are highly entangled in
the feature space, making naive approaches based on penalizing target domains
ineffective. To tackle this limitation, we propose a novel approach that
explicitly disentangles domain distributions and adaptively captures
instance-specific domain information. Extensive experiments show that our
approach outperforms baselines built upon VLM tuning techniques, paving the way
for practical and fine-grained unlearning in VLMs. Code:

*Chen Wang,Zhaochun Li,Jionghao Bai,Yuzhi Zhang,Shisheng Cui,Zhou Zhao,Yue Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AEPO stabilizes and controls entropy in reinforcement finetuning by using REINFORCE on temperature-adjusted distributions, replacing entropy bonuses; it prevents entropy collapse, reveals a non-monotonic relation between entropy and performance, and generalizes RFT to use target distributions as regularizers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) exhibits entropy collapse, where exploration vanishes and policies converge prematurely. Existing entropy-regularized methods either bias results or cause instability, leaving entropy control and its link to performance unclear.

Method: Replace entropy bonuses with REINFORCE policy gradient on temperature-adjusted distributions and stabilize entropy via temperature regulation. Integrates three regularization perspectives: policy gradient regularization, distribution regularization, and REINFORCE regularization, enabling precise entropy control without distorting optimization.

Result: AEPO stabilizes entropy at arbitrary target levels, eliminating collapse observed in GRPO; it uncovers a non-monotonic relationship between entropy and performance, where increasing entropy improves performance up to a point and then degrades it; it generalizes beyond entropy to a broader RFT paradigm where superior target distributions serve as REINFORCE regularizers.

Conclusion: Entropy can be precisely managed without harming optimization, clarifying the connection between entropy, exploration, and reasoning in reinforcement finetuning. The approach offers a broader framework for RFT by leveraging target distributions as regularizers and suggests avenues for exploring performance-entropy trade-offs in practice.

Abstract: Reinforcement finetuning (RFT) is essential for enhancing the reasoning
capabilities of large language models (LLM), yet the widely adopted Group
Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) suffers from entropy collapse, where
entropy monotonically decreases, exploration vanishes, and policies converge
prematurely. Existing entropy-regularized methods only partially alleviate this
issue while introducing bias and instability, leaving entropy control
unresolved and the connection between entropy, exploration, and performance
unclear. We propose Arbitrary Entropy Policy Optimization (AEPO), which
eliminates entropy collapse by replacing entropy bonuses with REINFORCE policy
gradient on temperature-adjusted distributions and stabilizing entropy through
temperature regulation. AEPO integrates three key designs: policy gradient as
regularization, distribution as regularization, and REINFORCE as
regularization, enabling precise entropy control without distorting
optimization. Experiments demonstrate three major contributions: AEPO (1)
stabilizes entropy at arbitrary target levels, effectively removing collapse in
GRPO; (2) reveals a non-monotonic relation where performance first improves
then declines with increasing entropy, clarifying the link between entropy,
exploration, and reasoning; and (3) generalizes beyond entropy, providing a
broader RFT paradigm where superior target distributions can serve as REINFORCE
regularizers.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Entropy-based confidence enables early stopping to cut compute by 25-50% with preserved accuracy in reasoning LMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reduce token usage and latency in reasoning tasks by exploiting a confidence signal derived from token-level logprobs; investigate entropy calibration as an emergent property of post-training optimization.

Method: Compute Shannon entropy from token-level logprobs as a stopping criterion; determine an entropy threshold per model from a few examples; apply early stopping during reasoning; compare across models including Llama 3.3 70B.

Result: Achieves 25-50% computational savings with maintained task accuracy; entropy threshold varies by model but can be set in one shot using a few examples; emergent confidence awareness in advanced reasoning models enables token savings.

Conclusion: Confidence mechanisms via entropy are a distinguishing feature of modern post-trained reasoning systems, enabling efficient token use without sacrificing accuracy and highlighting a gap with standard instruction-tuned/pre-trained models.

Abstract: We introduce a simple, yet novel entropy-based framework to drive token
efficiency in large language models during reasoning tasks. Our approach uses
Shannon entropy from token-level logprobs as a confidence signal to enable
early stopping, achieving 25-50% computational savings while maintaining task
accuracy. Crucially, we demonstrate that entropy-based confidence calibration
represents an emergent property of advanced post-training optimization present
in modern reasoning models but notably absent in standard instruction-tuned and
pre-trained models (Llama 3.3 70B). We show that the entropy threshold to stop
reasoning varies from model to model but can be calculated easily in one shot
using only a few examples from existing reasoning datasets. Our results
indicate that advanced reasoning models often know that they've gotten a
correct answer early on, and that this emergent confidence awareness can be
exploited to save tokens and reduce latency. The framework demonstrates
consistent performance across reasoning-optimized model families with 25-50%
computational cost reduction while preserving accuracy, revealing that
confidence mechanisms represent a distinguishing characteristic of modern
post-trained reasoning systems versus their predecessors.

*Larissa Reichart,Cem Ata Baykara,Ali Burak Ünal,Mete Akgün,Harlin Lee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GALA is a scalable federated unsupervised multi-source domain adaptation (UMDA) framework that uses inter-group discrepancy minimization to approximate full pairwise domain alignment without quadratic cost and a temperature-controlled centroid-based weighting to prioritize sources by alignment with the target, enabling robust, parallelizable training over many heterogeneous sources; evaluated on a new 18-domain Digit-18 benchmark, it achieves competitive or state-of-the-art results and outperforms prior methods in diverse, hard-to-converge multi-source settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: UMDA seeks to generalize from labeled multiple source domains to an unlabeled target domain while preserving privacy by not sharing raw data. Existing methods struggle to scale as the number of sources grows, incurring high computation, communication, or instability when dealing with many heterogeneous domains.

Method: Introduce two key components: (1) inter-group discrepancy minimization that approximates full pairwise domain alignment with reduced (non-quadratic) computation to scale to many sources, and (2) a temperature-controlled, centroid-based weighting scheme that dynamically emphasizes sources with better alignment to the target. The approach is federated, enabling parallel training across sources.

Result: Empirical evaluation shows GALA achieves competitive or state-of-the-art performance on standard UMDA benchmarks and significantly outperforms prior methods in diverse, large-scale multi-source scenarios where others fail to converge. A new Digit-18 benchmark with 18 digit datasets captures high domain diversity, enabling evaluation under challenging shifts.

Conclusion: GALA delivers a scalable, robust UMDA framework that remains effective as the number of heterogeneous sources grows, supported by a dynamic source weighting scheme and efficient alignment objective, and validated on a new challenging benchmark.

Abstract: Unsupervised multi-source domain adaptation (UMDA) aims to learn models that
generalize to an unlabeled target domain by leveraging labeled data from
multiple, diverse source domains. While distributed UMDA methods address
privacy constraints by avoiding raw data sharing, existing approaches typically
assume a small number of sources and fail to scale effectively. Increasing the
number of heterogeneous domains often makes existing methods impractical,
leading to high computational overhead or unstable performance. We propose
GALA, a scalable and robust federated UMDA framework that introduces two key
components: (1) a novel inter-group discrepancy minimization objective that
efficiently approximates full pairwise domain alignment without quadratic
computation; and (2) a temperature-controlled, centroid-based weighting
strategy that dynamically prioritizes source domains based on alignment with
the target. Together, these components enable stable and parallelizable
training across large numbers of heterogeneous sources. To evaluate performance
in high-diversity scenarios, we introduce Digit-18, a new benchmark comprising
18 digit datasets with varied synthetic and real-world domain shifts. Extensive
experiments show that GALA consistently achieves competitive or
state-of-the-art results on standard benchmarks and significantly outperforms
prior methods in diverse multi-source settings where others fail to converge.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A fair, end-to-end comparison of sub-6 GHz and mmWave Wi-Fi for passive gait-based person identification using COTS hardware; mmWave at 10 Hz achieves 91.2% accuracy on 20 individuals with background subtraction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Explore whether mmWave Wi-Fi offers tangible advantages over sub-6 GHz for passive person identification, leveraging higher spatial resolution to improve gait-based recognition.

Method: Collect synchronized sub-6 GHz and mmWave Wi-Fi signals in an indoor environment using commercial off-the-shelf devices. Apply identical training pipelines and model configurations across bands. Use end-to-end deep learning with background subtraction to remove static clutter, evaluating performance at low sampling rates (10 Hz).

Result: mmWave Wi-Fi achieves high identification accuracy (91.2%) on 20 individuals at 10 Hz when background subtraction is applied, demonstrating strong feasibility for gait-based identification at low sampling rates.

Conclusion: mmWave Wi-Fi can offer superior spatial resolution that benefits passive person identification, and a fair, unified evaluation framework confirms its strong performance at low sampling rates; future work could expand environment diversity and robustness analyses.

Abstract: Person identification plays a vital role in enabling intelligent,
personalized, and secure human-computer interaction. Recent research has
demonstrated the feasibility of leveraging Wi-Fi signals for passive person
identification using a person's unique gait pattern. Although most existing
work focuses on sub-6 GHz frequencies, the emergence of mmWave offers new
opportunities through its finer spatial resolution, though its comparative
advantages for person identification remain unexplored. This work presents the
first comparative study between sub-6 GHz and mmWave Wi-Fi signals for person
identification with commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) Wi-Fi, using a novel
dataset of synchronized measurements from the two frequency bands in an indoor
environment. To ensure a fair comparison, we apply identical training pipelines
and model configurations across both frequency bands. Leveraging end-to-end
deep learning, we show that even at low sampling rates (10 Hz), mmWave Wi-Fi
signals can achieve high identification accuracy (91.2% on 20 individuals) when
combined with effective background subtraction.

*Xiang Zhang,Jiaqi Wei,Zijie Qiu,Sheng Xu,Zhi Jin,ZhiQiang Gao,Nanqing Dong,Siqi Sun*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A hybrid AR-NAR framework for biological sequence generation that leverages a shared encoder, a non-autoregressive bidirectional decoder, and an autoregressive decoder with cross-attention to bidirectional features, trained with importance annealing and gradient blocking, achieving state-of-the-art results on nine-species de novo peptide sequencing with code released.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autoregressive models in biological sequence tasks are constrained by unidirectional dependencies, limiting global context capture; non-autoregressive models offer bidirectional context but struggle with generative coherence and scalability. A hybrid approach aims to harness bidirectional context to improve AR generation without sacrificing sequence coherence or scalability.

Method: Shared input encoder feeds two decoders: a non-autoregressive (NAR) decoder that learns latent bidirectional features, and an autoregressive (AR) decoder that generates sequences by leveraging these bidirectional features. A novel cross-decoder attention module lets the AR decoder iteratively query and integrate bidirectional features. Training uses importance annealing to balance objectives and cross-decoder gradient blocking to stabilize learning.

Result: On a demanding nine-species de novo peptide sequencing benchmark, the proposed model substantially surpasses both AR and NAR baselines, achieving better performance while maintaining AR stability and leveraging NAR contextual awareness.

Conclusion: The work demonstrates that augmenting AR models with bidirectional information through a dedicated cross-decoder framework yields robust, superior performance in complex biological sequence generation, signaling a new architectural paradigm for hybrid AR–NAR modeling; code is publicly available.

Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) models, common in sequence generation, are limited in
many biological tasks such as de novo peptide sequencing and protein modeling
by their unidirectional nature, failing to capture crucial global bidirectional
token dependencies. Non-Autoregressive (NAR) models offer holistic,
bidirectional representations but face challenges with generative coherence and
scalability. To transcend this, we propose a hybrid framework enhancing AR
generation by dynamically integrating rich contextual information from
non-autoregressive mechanisms. Our approach couples a shared input encoder with
two decoders: a non-autoregressive one learning latent bidirectional biological
features, and an AR decoder synthesizing the biological sequence by leveraging
these bidirectional features. A novel cross-decoder attention module enables
the AR decoder to iteratively query and integrate these bidirectional features,
enriching its predictions. This synergy is cultivated via a tailored training
strategy with importance annealing for balanced objectives and cross-decoder
gradient blocking for stable, focused learning. Evaluations on a demanding
nine-species benchmark of de novo peptide sequencing show that our model
substantially surpasses AR and NAR baselines. It uniquely harmonizes AR
stability with NAR contextual awareness, delivering robust, superior
performance on diverse downstream data. This research advances biological
sequence modeling techniques and contributes a novel architectural paradigm for
augmenting AR models with enhanced bidirectional understanding for complex
sequence generation. Code is available at https://github.com/BEAM-Labs/denovo.

TL;DR: A new plug-and-play module called MORE (Model Rebalancing) rebalances the model's parameter space with a low-rank component, guided by a tailored loss and sinusoidal reweighting to improve long-tailed recognition without increasing model complexity or inference cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long-tailed distributions hinder generalization, especially for tail classes, across multi-class and multi-label recognition and downstream fine-tuning of foundation models; there is a need to rethink how model capacity is allocated under imbalance.

Method: Introduce a low-rank parameter component to mediate parameter space allocation, guided by a tailored loss and a sinusoidal reweighting schedule, while keeping overall model complexity and inference cost unchanged; acts as a plug-and-play module.

Result: Extensive experiments on diverse long-tailed benchmarks across multi-class and multi-label tasks show significant generalization gains, particularly for tail classes, and the method complements existing imbalance mitigation techniques.

Conclusion: MORE provides a robust, low-overhead way to rebalance model capacity for long-tailed settings, functioning as a versatile plug-and-play module that boosts tail-class performance without extra cost.

Abstract: Long-tailed recognition is ubiquitous and challenging in deep learning and
even in the downstream finetuning of foundation models, since the skew class
distribution generally prevents the model generalization to the tail classes.
Despite the promise of previous methods from the perspectives of data
augmentation, loss rebalancing and decoupled training etc., consistent
improvement in the broad scenarios like multi-label long-tailed recognition is
difficult. In this study, we dive into the essential model capacity impact
under long-tailed context, and propose a novel framework, Model Rebalancing
(MORE), which mitigates imbalance by directly rebalancing the model's parameter
space. Specifically, MORE introduces a low-rank parameter component to mediate
the parameter space allocation guided by a tailored loss and sinusoidal
reweighting schedule, but without increasing the overall model complexity or
inference costs. Extensive experiments on diverse long-tailed benchmarks,
spanning multi-class and multi-label tasks, demonstrate that MORE significantly
improves generalization, particularly for tail classes, and effectively
complements existing imbalance mitigation methods. These results highlight
MORE's potential as a robust plug-and-play module in long-tailed settings.

### [290] [Dual-granularity Sinkhorn Distillation for Enhanced Learning from Long-tailed Noisy Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08179)
*Feng Hong,Yu Huang,Zihua Zhao,Zhihan Zhou,Jiangchao Yao,Dongsheng Li,Ya Zhang,Yanfeng Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes Dual-granularity Sinkhorn Distillation (D-SINK): a framework that combines two single-purpose auxiliary models—one for imbalance and one for label noise—via optimal-transport-based distillation to align sample-level predictions and class distributions, improving robustness on long-tailed noisy data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world datasets often suffer simultaneously from class imbalance (distributional) and label noise (sample-level). Existing methods address these issues separately, but combining them is hard due to conflicting optimization signals and the difficulty of distinguishing clean tail samples from noisy data. Leveraging two weak, single-purpose auxiliaries could provide complementary robustness without mutual conflict.

Method: Introduce D-SINK, which distills knowledge from two auxiliary models: an imbalance-robust model and a noise-robust model. It uses an optimal-transport–optimized surrogate label allocation to align the target model’s sample-level predictions with the noise-robust auxiliary, and to align class distributions with the imbalance-robust auxiliary. The integration is done via a dual-granularity Sinkhorn distillation objective.

Result: Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets show that D-SINK significantly improves robustness and achieves strong empirical performance in learning from long-tailed noisy data, outperforming baselines and validating the complementary strengths of the two weak auxiliaries.

Conclusion: The results support the central claim that combining weak, single-purpose models through optimal-transport-based distillation can robustly handle co-occurring imbalance and label-noise challenges, offering a practical and effective direction for real-world long-tailed noisy data.

Abstract: Real-world datasets for deep learning frequently suffer from the co-occurring
challenges of class imbalance and label noise, hindering model performance.
While methods exist for each issue, effectively combining them is non-trivial,
as distinguishing genuine tail samples from noisy data proves difficult, often
leading to conflicting optimization strategies. This paper presents a novel
perspective: instead of primarily developing new complex techniques from
scratch, we explore synergistically leveraging well-established, individually
'weak' auxiliary models - specialized for tackling either class imbalance or
label noise but not both. This view is motivated by the insight that class
imbalance (a distributional-level concern) and label noise (a sample-level
concern) operate at different granularities, suggesting that robustness
mechanisms for each can in principle offer complementary strengths without
conflict. We propose Dual-granularity Sinkhorn Distillation (D-SINK), a novel
framework that enhances dual robustness by distilling and integrating
complementary insights from such 'weak', single-purpose auxiliary models.
Specifically, D-SINK uses an optimal transport-optimized surrogate label
allocation to align the target model's sample-level predictions with a
noise-robust auxiliary and its class distributions with an imbalance-robust
one. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that D-SINK
significantly improves robustness and achieves strong empirical performance in
learning from long-tailed noisy data.

*Justus Viga,Penelope Mueck,Alexander Löser,Torben Weis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: New FuelCast dataset released with three ships, a standardized benchmark for tabular and time-series regression, and a study of in-context learning using TabPFN for ship fuel consumption. Environmental features and temporal context improve predictions; TabPFN performs competitively, highlighting foundation models' promise for tabular ship data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: address the lack of standardized, high-quality datasets and benchmarks for ship fuel consumption modeling, enabling fair model comparison and facilitating onboard data-driven forecasting.

Method: release the FuelCast dataset (operational/environmental data from three ships); define standardized benchmark suites for tabular regression and time-series regression; evaluate multiple models including TabPFN with in-context learning on the dataset; compare against baselines (e.g., polynomial models relying on speed) and assess the impact of environmental features and temporal context.

Result: environmental conditions consistently improve prediction accuracy over speed-only baselines; TabPFN slightly outperforms other techniques; incorporating temporal context improves accuracy; dataset and benchmark enable fair comparisons and onboard prediction feasibility.

Conclusion: onboard data-driven fuel prediction is feasible; foundation models with in-context learning show promise for tabular ship fuel prediction; the released dataset and benchmark will facilitate reproducible, fair comparisons and further research.

Abstract: In the shipping industry, fuel consumption and emissions are critical factors
due to their significant impact on economic efficiency and environmental
sustainability. Accurate prediction of ship fuel consumption is essential for
further optimization of maritime operations. However, heterogeneous
methodologies and limited high-quality datasets hinder direct comparison of
modeling approaches. This paper makes three key contributions: (1) we introduce
and release a new dataset
(https://huggingface.co/datasets/krohnedigital/FuelCast) comprising operational
and environmental data from three ships; (2) we define a standardized benchmark
covering tabular regression and time-series regression (3) we investigate the
application of in-context learning for ship consumption modeling using the
TabPFN foundation model - a first in this domain to our knowledge. Our results
demonstrate strong performance across all evaluated models, supporting the
feasibility of onboard, data-driven fuel prediction. Models incorporating
environmental conditions consistently outperform simple polynomial baselines
relying solely on vessel speed. TabPFN slightly outperforms other techniques,
highlighting the potential of foundation models with in-context learning
capabilities for tabular prediction. Furthermore, including temporal context
improves accuracy.

### [292] [Expressive Value Learning for Scalable Offline Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08218)
*Nicolas Espinosa-Dice,Kiante Brantley,Wen Sun*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: EVOR is a scalable offline RL method that combines expressive value functions with flow matching, enabling rejection-sampling-based policy extraction at inference without distillation or BPTT. It achieves better performance than baselines on diverse offline tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robotics demands scalable offline RL due to costly real-world interactions and large, diverse datasets; current approaches rely on backpropagation through time (BPTT) or policy distillation, which hinder scalability. The work aims to enable scalable offline RL without distillation or BPTT by leveraging expressive value learning.

Method: Train an optimal, regularized Q-function via flow matching to learn an expressive value function. Use inference-time rejection sampling against this expressive value function to extract policies without retraining, avoiding BPTT and distillation.

Result: Empirically, EVOR outperforms baselines across a diverse set of offline RL tasks, demonstrating the benefit of integrating expressive value learning into offline RL.

Conclusion: Integrating expressive value learning into offline RL enables scalable, non-distillation policy extraction and improved performance, addressing key scalability bottlenecks in offline RL for robotics.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) is a powerful paradigm for learning to make
sequences of decisions. However, RL has yet to be fully leveraged in robotics,
principally due to its lack of scalability. Offline RL offers a promising
avenue by training agents on large, diverse datasets, avoiding the costly
real-world interactions of online RL. Scaling offline RL to increasingly
complex datasets requires expressive generative models such as diffusion and
flow matching. However, existing methods typically depend on either
backpropagation through time (BPTT), which is computationally prohibitive, or
policy distillation, which introduces compounding errors and limits scalability
to larger base policies. In this paper, we consider the question of how to
develop a scalable offline RL approach without relying on distillation or
backpropagation through time. We introduce Expressive Value Learning for
Offline Reinforcement Learning (EVOR): a scalable offline RL approach that
integrates both expressive policies and expressive value functions. EVOR learns
an optimal, regularized Q-function via flow matching during training. At
inference-time, EVOR performs inference-time policy extraction via rejection
sampling against the expressive value function, enabling efficient
optimization, regularization, and compute-scalable search without retraining.
Empirically, we show that EVOR outperforms baselines on a diverse set of
offline RL tasks, demonstrating the benefit of integrating expressive value
learning into offline RL.

### [293] [Post-hoc Stochastic Concept Bottleneck Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08219)
*Wiktor Jan Hoffmann,Sonia Laguna,Moritz Vandenhirtz,Emanuele Palumbo,Julia E. Vogt*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PSCBMs provide a lightweight post-hoc way to capture concept dependencies in pre-trained CBMs by adding a small covariance-prediction module that models a multivariate normal distribution over concepts, without retraining the backbone. Two training strategies are proposed. They match or improve concept/target accuracy and excel under interventions, with much lower cost than full retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CBMs can benefit from modeling dependencies among concepts, but doing so usually requires retraining the whole model, which is infeasible when data or compute is limited. A post-hoc approach aims to leverage concept dependencies without retraining the backbone.

Method: Introduce Post-hoc Stochastic Concept Bottleneck Models (PSCBMs) that augment any pre-trained CBM with a multivariate normal distribution over concepts via a small covariance-prediction module, without retraining the backbone. Two training strategies are proposed to learn the covariance structure.

Result: On real-world data, PSCBMs consistently match or improve both concept accuracy and target accuracy compared to standard CBMs at test time. They leverage concept dependencies to perform much better under interventions, while remaining far more efficient than retraining a stochastic model from scratch.

Conclusion: PSCBMs offer a practical, efficient way to inject concept dependency modeling into CBMs post-hoc, preserving interpretability and significantly improving robustness to interventions without incurring the cost of full retraining.

Abstract: Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) are interpretable models that predict the
target variable through high-level human-understandable concepts, allowing
users to intervene on mispredicted concepts to adjust the final output. While
recent work has shown that modeling dependencies between concepts can improve
CBM performance, especially under interventions, such approaches typically
require retraining the entire model, which may be infeasible when access to the
original data or compute is limited. In this paper, we introduce Post-hoc
Stochastic Concept Bottleneck Models (PSCBMs), a lightweight method that
augments any pre-trained CBM with a multivariate normal distribution over
concepts by adding only a small covariance-prediction module, without
retraining the backbone model. We propose two training strategies and show on
real-world data that PSCBMs consistently match or improve both concept and
target accuracy over standard CBMs at test time. Furthermore, we show that due
to the modeling of concept dependencies, PSCBMs perform much better than CBMs
under interventions, while remaining far more efficient than retraining a
similar stochastic model from scratch.

*Michal Koren,Or Peretz,Tai Dinh,Philip S. Yu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Uncertainty-Aware MDP (UAMDP) integrates Bayesian forecasting, posterior-sampling RL, and CVaR-constrained planning to enable risk-aware, uncertainty-driven sequential decision-making with regret guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In volatile, high-stakes settings, uncertainty about latent dynamics and structural shifts can degrade performance. There is a need for principled uncertainty management and risk-aware control in sequential decision making.

Method: A unified loop that updates beliefs over latent dynamics via Bayesian forecasting, samples futures with Thompson sampling, and optimizes policies under a CVaR constraint. The framework yields regret bounds converging to the Bayes-optimal benchmark under standard regularity conditions.

Result: Regret bounds converge to Bayes-optimal. Empirical evaluation in high-frequency equity trading and retail inventory control shows substantial forecasting gains (RMSE ↓ up to 25%, sMAPE ↓ 32%) and improved economic performance (Sharpe ↑ from 1.54 to 1.74; drawdown halved) relative to strong deep-learning baselines.

Conclusion: Integrating calibrated probabilistic modeling, uncertainty-aligned exploration, and risk-aware control yields a robust, generalizable approach to safer and more profitable sequential decision-making.

Abstract: Sequential decisions in volatile, high-stakes settings require more than
maximizing expected return; they require principled uncertainty management.
This paper presents the Uncertainty-Aware Markov Decision Process (UAMDP), a
unified framework that couples Bayesian forecasting, posterior-sampling
reinforcement learning, and planning under a conditional value-at-risk (CVaR)
constraint. In a closed loop, the agent updates its beliefs over latent
dynamics, samples plausible futures via Thompson sampling, and optimizes
policies subject to preset risk tolerances. We establish regret bounds that
converge to the Bayes-optimal benchmark under standard regularity conditions.
We evaluate UAMDP in two domains-high-frequency equity trading and retail
inventory control-both marked by structural uncertainty and economic
volatility. Relative to strong deep learning baselines, UAMDP improves
long-horizon forecasting accuracy (RMSE decreases by up to 25\% and sMAPE by
32\%), and these gains translate into economic performance: the trading Sharpe
ratio rises from 1.54 to 1.74 while maximum drawdown is roughly halved. These
results show that integrating calibrated probabilistic modeling, exploration
aligned with posterior uncertainty, and risk-aware control yields a robust,
generalizable approach to safer and more profitable sequential decision-making.

### [295] [Enhancing Reasoning for Diffusion LLMs via Distribution Matching Policy Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08233)
*Yuchen Zhu,Wei Guo,Jaemoo Choi,Petr Molodyk,Bo Yuan,Molei Tao,Yongxin Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DMPO is a reinforcement-learning fine-tuning method for diffusion-based LLMs that aligns the model's policy with a reward-tilted optimal distribution via cross-entropy, addressing small-batch training with a weight baseline subtraction; achieves notable reasoning accuracy gains without supervised fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reinforcement learning is crucial for diffusion LLMs to reach competitive reasoning performance with autoregressive LLMs, but existing RL methods aren’t tailored to the diffusion-based setting; a principled, theoretically grounded approach is needed to leverage reward signals for dLLMs.

Method: DMPO optimizes by matching the diffusion LLM's policy distribution to a reward-tilted optimal distribution using cross-entropy, effectively performing distribution matching. It introduces a weight baseline subtraction technique to stabilize learning under small batch sizes and does not rely on supervised fine-tuning.

Result: DMPO achieves superior performance on multiple reasoning benchmarks, with accuracy improvements up to 42.9% over the previous SOTA baselines and 55.8% over the base model.

Conclusion: The distribution matching framework is effective for enhancing reasoning in diffusion LLMs, and DMPO provides a principled, theoretically grounded RL fine-tuning approach with practical gains and available code.

Abstract: Diffusion large language models (dLLMs) are promising alternatives to
autoregressive large language models (AR-LLMs), as they potentially allow
higher inference throughput. Reinforcement learning (RL) is a crucial component
for dLLMs to achieve comparable performance with AR-LLMs on important tasks,
such as reasoning. However, RL algorithms that are well-suited for dLLMs'
unique characteristics have yet to be developed. This paper proposes
Distribution Matching Policy Optimization (DMPO), a principled and
theoretically grounded RL fine-tuning method specifically designed to enhance
the reasoning capabilities of dLLMs by matching the dLLM policy distribution to
the optimal, reward-tilted one through cross-entropy optimization. We identify
a key challenge in the implementation with a small training batch size and
propose several effective solutions through a novel weight baseline subtraction
technique. DMPO exhibits superior performance on multiple reasoning benchmarks
without supervised fine-tuning, with an accuracy improvement of up to $42.9\%$
over previously SOTA baselines and $55.8\%$ over the base model, underscoring
the effectiveness of the distribution matching framework. Our code is available

### [296] [The Hidden Bias: A Study on Explicit and Implicit Political Stereotypes in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08236)
*Konrad Löhr,Shuzhou Yuan,Michael Färber*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Eight LLMs show a left-leaning bias on the Political Compass Test; explicit and implicit stereotypes vary by model, with language-based implicit stereotypes stronger; alignment between implicit and explicit biases suggests some transparency but raises concerns about political information spread.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As LLMs influence information dissemination and decision-making, understanding political bias is essential to prevent undue influence on public opinion and democratic processes.

Method: Apply the two-dimensional Political Compass Test (PCT) to eight LLMs to assess base political leanings; use persona prompting with PCT to elicit explicit social stereotypes; use multilingual versions of PCT to uncover implicit stereotypes.

Result: Findings show a consistent left-leaning alignment across models; stereotype patterns differ by model; implicit stereotypes triggered by language variation are more pronounced than explicit ones; in most models, implicit and explicit stereotypes align to some degree.

Conclusion: The study highlights the complex interplay of political bias and stereotypes in LLMs, with implications for transparency, governance, and mitigation of bias in AI-assisted information dissemination; multilingual prompts reveal hidden biases and warrant further research.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly integral to information
dissemination and decision-making processes. Given their growing societal
influence, understanding potential biases, particularly within the political
domain, is crucial to prevent undue influence on public opinion and democratic
processes. This work investigates political bias and stereotype propagation
across eight prominent LLMs using the two-dimensional Political Compass Test
(PCT). Initially, the PCT is employed to assess the inherent political leanings
of these models. Subsequently, persona prompting with the PCT is used to
explore explicit stereotypes across various social dimensions. In a final step,
implicit stereotypes are uncovered by evaluating models with multilingual
versions of the PCT. Key findings reveal a consistent left-leaning political
alignment across all investigated models. Furthermore, while the nature and
extent of stereotypes vary considerably between models, implicit stereotypes
elicited through language variation are more pronounced than those identified
via explicit persona prompting. Interestingly, for most models, implicit and
explicit stereotypes show a notable alignment, suggesting a degree of
transparency or "awareness" regarding their inherent biases. This study
underscores the complex interplay of political bias and stereotypes in LLMs.

*Marta Emili Garcia Segura,Stephen Hailes,Mirco Musolesi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ShapeLLM enables LLM-based agents to influence others' learning dynamics, guiding opponents to exploitable equilibria in competitive games and improving coordination in cooperative games.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As LLM agents operate in multi-agent environments, understanding whether interaction alone can shape others' behavior is crucial. Existing opponent-shaping (OS) methods do not readily translate to transformer-based models due to derivative/architectural constraints, creating a gap for LLMs.

Method: Introduce ShapeLLM, a transformer-friendly, model-free OS adaptation. Evaluate across Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma, Matching Pennies, Chicken (competitive) and Iterated Stag Hunt and cooperative Prisoner's Dilemma (cooperative). Analyze whether LLMs influence co-players' learning dynamics and welfare.

Result: LLM agents can steer opponents toward exploitable equilibria in competitive settings and foster coordination to improve collective welfare in cooperative settings; demonstrates bidirectional shaping (agents shape others and are shaped by others).

Conclusion: Opponent shaping is a key dimension of multi-agent LLM research. ShapeLLM demonstrates feasibility and motivates further work on scalability, robustness, and generalization of OS in LLM-based agents.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being deployed as autonomous
agents in real-world environments. As these deployments scale, multi-agent
interactions become inevitable, making it essential to understand strategic
behavior in such systems. A central open question is whether LLM agents, like
reinforcement learning agents, can shape the learning dynamics and influence
the behavior of others through interaction alone. In this paper, we present the
first investigation of opponent shaping (OS) with LLM-based agents. Existing OS
algorithms cannot be directly applied to LLMs, as they require higher-order
derivatives, face scalability constraints, or depend on architectural
components that are absent in transformers. To address this gap, we introduce
ShapeLLM, an adaptation of model-free OS methods tailored for transformer-based
agents. Using ShapeLLM, we examine whether LLM agents can influence co-players'
learning dynamics across diverse game-theoretic environments. We demonstrate
that LLM agents can successfully guide opponents toward exploitable equilibria
in competitive games (Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma, Matching Pennies, and
Chicken) and promote coordination and improve collective welfare in cooperative
games (Iterated Stag Hunt and a cooperative version of the Prisoner's Dilemma).
Our findings show that LLM agents can both shape and be shaped through
interaction, establishing opponent shaping as a key dimension of multi-agent
LLM research.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Mix- and MoE-DPO extends Direct Preference Optimization with soft mixtures and mixture-of-experts, trained via variational inference to learn specialized expert policies from heterogeneous preference data, enabling multi-task and user-specific alignment with scalable parameter sharing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) uses a single monolithic model which limits expressivity across tasks and diverse preference distributions; there is a need for flexible, scalable architectures to capture distinct preference modes.

Method: Introduce a latent variable over expert assignments and optimize a variational ELBO using stochastic variational inference. Supports both shared base architectures with expert heads and fully independent experts. Employs input-dependent soft gating to route inputs to experts, enabling context-specific mixtures.

Result: Demonstrates generalization through universal function approximation via mixtures, reward/policy specialization per expert, and contextual alignment to user preferences. Validated across model sizes and multi-preference datasets, showing scalability and effectiveness over standard DPO.

Conclusion: Mix- and MoE-DPO offer a flexible, scalable framework for preference-based LLM alignment that can specialize policies to different preference modes and user contexts, with practical trade-offs between efficiency and specialization.

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has recently emerged as a simple and
effective alternative to reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) for
aligning large language models (LLMs) with user preferences. However, existing
DPO formulations rely on a single monolithic model, which limits their
expressivity in multi-task settings and their adaptability to heterogeneous or
diverse preference distributions. In this work, we propose Mix- and MoE-DPO, a
framework that extends DPO with both soft mixture models and mixture-of-experts
(MoE) architectures, using a stochastic variational inference approach. Our
method introduces a latent-variable model over expert assignments and optimizes
a variational evidence lower bound (ELBO), enabling stable and efficient
learning of specialized expert policies from preference data. Mix- and MoE-DPO
provides three key advantages over standard DPO: (i) generalization via
universal function approximation through mixtures; (ii) reward and policy
specialization through expert components tailored to distinct preference modes;
and (iii) contextual alignment through input-dependent soft gating that enables
user-specific mixture policies. Our framework supports both shared base
architectures with expert-specific policy heads and fully independent expert
models, allowing flexible trade-offs between parameter efficiency and
specialization. We validate our approach on a variety of model sizes and
multi-preference datasets, demonstrating that Mix- and MoE-DPO offers a
powerful and scalable method for preference-based LLM alignment.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Flow-based identifiability framework for multivariate counterfactuals from observational data, yielding a unique monotone, rank-preserving counterfactual transport map via dynamic optimal transport; validated on synthetic ground-truth and real-image data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses Pearl's requirement that counterfactuals be identifiable to justify causal claims, tackling the identifiability gap in existing high-dimensional counterfactual inference methods.

Method: Develops continuous-time flow matching in non-Markovian settings under standard criteria; derives conditions for a unique, monotone and rank-preserving counterfactual transport map using tools from dynamic optimal transport; includes theoretical development and empirical validation.

Result:  characterizes conditions for identifiability of the counterfactual transport; proves the existence of a unique monotone rank-preserving map under those conditions; demonstrates consistent inference and improved axiomatic counterfactual soundness on real images and controlled ground-truth experiments.

Conclusion: Presents a foundational framework for identifiable multivariate counterfactuals via flow-based transport, enabling more credible causal claims in high-dimensional observational data; supported by theoretical guarantees and empirical validation.

Abstract: We address the open question of counterfactual identification for
high-dimensional multivariate outcomes from observational data. Pearl (2000)
argues that counterfactuals must be identifiable (i.e., recoverable from the
observed data distribution) to justify causal claims. A recent line of work on
counterfactual inference shows promising results but lacks identification,
undermining the causal validity of its estimates. To address this, we establish
a foundation for multivariate counterfactual identification using
continuous-time flows, including non-Markovian settings under standard
criteria. We characterise the conditions under which flow matching yields a
unique, monotone and rank-preserving counterfactual transport map with tools
from dynamic optimal transport, ensuring consistent inference. Building on
this, we validate the theory in controlled scenarios with counterfactual
ground-truth and demonstrate improvements in axiomatic counterfactual soundness
on real images.

*Tsuyoshi Okita*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A physics-informed generative framework for time-series that enforces physical constraints via a hierarchical, operator-guided approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional time-series generation often neglects domain-specific physical constraints, leading to statistically plausible but physically inconsistent data. There is a need to embed physics into generative models to improve both realism and validity.

Method: A hierarchical framework that encodes conservation, dynamics, boundary, and empirical relations as time-dependent constraints. It combines Fourier Neural Operators (FNOs) to learn physical operators with Conditional Flow Matching (CFM) for probabilistic generation, and uses FNO-guided corrections to enforce physics during generation.

Result: On harmonic oscillators, human activity recognition, and lithium-ion battery degradation, the method achieved 16.3% higher generation quality, 46% fewer physics violations, and 18.5% improved predictive accuracy over baselines.

Conclusion: Embedding physics-based inductive bias into generative models can substantially improve the statistical and physical consistency of generated time-series, enabling more reliable simulations and analyses across varied domains.

Abstract: Conventional time-series generation often ignores domain-specific physical
constraints, limiting statistical and physical consistency. We propose a
hierarchical framework that embeds the inherent hierarchy of physical
laws-conservation, dynamics, boundary, and empirical relations-directly into
deep generative models, introducing a new paradigm of physics-informed
inductive bias. Our method combines Fourier Neural Operators (FNOs) for
learning physical operators with Conditional Flow Matching (CFM) for
probabilistic generation, integrated via time-dependent hierarchical
constraints and FNO-guided corrections. Experiments on harmonic oscillators,
human activity recognition, and lithium-ion battery degradation show 16.3%
higher generation quality, 46% fewer physics violations, and 18.5% improved
predictive accuracy over baselines.

TL;DR: Adaptive Random Forests for dynamic feature adaptation in 6G network control, with Drift-Aware Feature Importance to manage explainability costs; shows stable predictions and up to 2x runtime savings across three datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI in 6G network control must cope with non-stationary conditions due to multi-vendor deployments, hardware upgrades, and evolving service requirements, while providing explainability.

Method: Iterative training of Adaptive Random Forests (ARFs) to adapt to new features; introduction of Drift-Aware Feature Importance (DAFI) that uses a distributional drift detector to trigger expensive feature-importance computations only when needed; evaluation on three datasets.

Result: ARFs yield stable predictions with accuracy improving as more features are added; DAFI reduces FI runtime up to 2x and yields more consistent feature importance values.

Conclusion: ARFs combined with DAFI form a promising, flexible, and explainable AI framework for 6G network control, with potential for broader adoption pending further validation and deployment considerations.

Abstract: As AI becomes a native component of 6G network control, AI models must adapt
to continuously changing conditions, including the introduction of new features
and measurements driven by multi-vendor deployments, hardware upgrades, and
evolving service requirements. To address this growing need for flexible
learning in non-stationary environments, this vision paper highlights Adaptive
Random Forests (ARFs) as a reliable solution for dynamic feature adaptation in
communication network scenarios. We show that iterative training of ARFs can
effectively lead to stable predictions, with accuracy improving over time as
more features are added. In addition, we highlight the importance of
explainability in AI-driven networks, proposing Drift-Aware Feature Importance
(DAFI) as an efficient XAI feature importance (FI) method. DAFI uses a
distributional drift detector to signal when to apply computationally intensive
FI methods instead of lighter alternatives. Our tests on 3 different datasets
indicate that our approach reduces runtime by up to 2 times, while producing
more consistent feature importance values. Together, ARFs and DAFI provide a
promising framework to build flexible AI methods adapted to 6G network
use-cases.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RPEL offers a decentralized, server-free robust collaborative learning method using pull-based epidemic communication, achieving O(n log n) messages with high-probability convergence and robustness against adversaries, and competitive accuracy to all-to-all in large networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional collaborative machine learning either relies on a central server or incurs high communication costs; robust learning in adversarial environments is needed in decentralized settings.

Method: Robust Pull-based Epidemic Learning (RPEL): a fully decentralized protocol where nodes pull model parameters from small random subsets of nodes in an epidemic-style fashion, yielding O(n log n) communication and convergence guarantees with high probability.

Result: Empirical results show RPEL maintains robustness against adversaries, achieves accuracy competitive with all-to-all communication, and scales efficiently to large networks.

Conclusion: RPEL provides a scalable, server-free framework for robust collaborative learning with favorable communication complexity and probabilistic convergence guarantees, suitable for large distributed systems.

Abstract: Collaborative machine learning is challenged by training-time adversarial
behaviors. Existing approaches to tolerate such behaviors either rely on a
central server or induce high communication costs. We propose Robust Pull-based
Epidemic Learning (RPEL), a novel, scalable collaborative approach to ensure
robust learning despite adversaries. RPEL does not rely on any central server
and, unlike traditional methods, where communication costs grow in
$\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ with the number of nodes $n$, RPEL employs a pull-based
epidemic-based communication strategy that scales in $\mathcal{O}(n \log n)$.
By pulling model parameters from small random subsets of nodes, RPEL
significantly lowers the number of required messages without compromising
convergence guarantees, which hold with high probability. Empirical results
demonstrate that RPEL maintains robustness in adversarial settings, competes
with all-to-all communication accuracy, and scales efficiently across large
networks.

*Andrea Pugnana,Giovanni De Toni,Cesare Barbera,Roberto Pellungrini,Bruno Lepri,Andrea Passerini*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LtA extends Learning to Defer by enabling structured, interactive expert input beyond single predictions, introducing a two-part model (base and enriched) with an optimal query strategy; two training regimes (sequential and joint) and surrogate losses with realizable-consistency guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome LtD's limitation of treating humans and ML models as mutually exclusive decision-makers by enabling the model to decide not only what to predict but when and how to consult expert input, thereby enhancing human–AI collaboration.

Method: Proposes a two-part architecture: a standard ML model and an enriched model trained with expert feedback. Determines an optimal strategy for when to query the enriched model. Two practical implementations are provided: (1) sequential approach—train the models in stages; (2) joint approach—train them simultaneously with surrogate losses that come with realizable-consistency guarantees.

Result: Experiments on synthetic and real expert data show that LtA offers a more flexible and powerful framework for human–AI collaboration compared to prior approaches like LtD.

Conclusion: LtA provides a robust foundation for flexible human–AI collaboration by integrating expert input in both the decision process and model training, with proven strategies and guarantees in the joint setting.

Abstract: Developing decision-support systems that complement human performance in
classification tasks remains an open challenge. A popular approach, Learning to
Defer (LtD), allows a Machine Learning (ML) model to pass difficult cases to a
human expert. However, LtD treats humans and ML models as mutually exclusive
decision-makers, restricting the expert contribution to mere predictions. To
address this limitation, we propose Learning to Ask (LtA), a new framework that
handles both when and how to incorporate expert input in an ML model. LtA is
based on a two-part architecture: a standard ML model and an enriched model
trained with additional expert human feedback, with a formally optimal strategy
for selecting when to query the enriched model. We provide two practical
implementations of LtA: a sequential approach, which trains the models in
stages, and a joint approach, which optimises them simultaneously. For the
latter, we design surrogate losses with realisable-consistency guarantees. Our
experiments with synthetic and real expert data demonstrate that LtA provides a
more flexible and powerful foundation for effective human-AI collaboration.

### [304] [Learning What's Missing: Attention Dispersion and EMA Stabilization in Length Generalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08341)
*Pál Zsámboki,Benjamin Levi,David Ansel Josef Smith,Mitansh Kagalwala,Arlington Kell,Samuel Liechty,Cong Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proves tight embedding/value-dimension bounds for single-layer attention-only transformers in a set-complement task and shows length generalization hinges on balanced logit displacement at short lengths; identifies two training-time obstacles—softmax compression of logit displacements and noisy updates—and proposes dropout and EMA as remedies, validated by random-hyperparameter searches and by an Othello GPT-1 style model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address how transformers generalize to longer sequences, with a focus on board-game style reasoning. The set-complement task serves as a tractable benchmark to reveal mechanistic limits and training-time factors that govern long-horizon generalization.

Method: Theoretical analysis establishing tight bounds on embedding and value dimensions for single-layer attention-only transformers. Establishes that balanced logit displacement at lengths 1 and 2 implies longer-sequence generalization (with reduced precision). Provides a mechanistic reading of why generalization degrades as more tokens are attended. Investigates training dynamics and proposes dropout to counter softmax compression and Exponential Moving Average (EMA) to stabilize updates. Validates hypotheses via random hyperparameter searches on the set-complement task and tests EMA/dropout on OthelloGPT (a GPT-1 style model trained on random Othello moves).

Result: Two main theoretical statements are proven: (1) tight bounds on embedding and value dimensions for single-layer attention-only transformers; (2) if such a model achieves balanced logit displacement at lengths 1 and 2, it will generalize to longer sequences, albeit with reduced precision. Mechanistic explanations show softmax compression erodes output separation as attended context grows, and training updates become noisier when many next tokens are possible. Dropout is hypothesized to counter the first effect and EMA to counter the second; random-hyperparameter searches validate both mechanisms. In experiments with OthelloGPT, EMA again improves length generalization in a more complex setting.

Conclusion: Length generalization in transformers is constrained by softmax compression and noisy updates. Training-time remedies—dropout and EMA—can mitigate these effects, with EMA shown to improve length generalization in both simple and more complex (Othello) settings, underscoring a path toward robust long-horizon reasoning in transformer models.

Abstract: We study length generalization in transformers through the set complement
task, where a model must predict a uniform distribution over tokens absent from
an input sequence -- an ability central to board-game style reasoning. Our main
theoretical result establishes two statements. First, we prove tight bounds on
embedding and value dimensions for single-layer attention-only transformers.
Second, we show that if such a model achieves balanced logit displacement at
lengths 1 and 2, then it must generalize to longer sequences, though with
reduced precision. A mechanistic reading of the proof explains this limitation:
as more tokens are attended to, softmax compresses logit displacements, eroding
separation between valid and invalid outputs. Training dynamics also suggest a
second obstacle: when many next tokens are possible, updates become noisy. We
hypothesize that dropout can counteract the first effect and Exponential Moving
Average (EMA) the second. We validate these hypotheses through random
hyperparameter search on the set complement task, which confirms both
mechanisms. We then test OthelloGPT, a GPT-1 style model trained on random
Othello moves, and find that EMA again improves length generalization in this
more complex setting.

*Daniel Jason Tan,Jiayang Chen,Dilruk Perera,Kay Choong See,Mengling Feng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DeepEN applies offline RL to personalize enteral nutrition in critically ill ICU patients, learning 4-hourly caloric, protein, and fluid policies from MIMIC-IV data using a clinically informed state space and a conservative, safe Q-learning objective. It achieves mortality reduction and better nutritional biomarkers compared with clinician- and guideline-based policies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in personalized nutrition for critically ill patients and improve outcomes while ensuring safety, by learning from historical data without risking live trials.

Method: Offline reinforcement learning with a dueling double deep Q-network augmented by Conservative Q-learning regularization. A clinically informed state space models patient physiology; actions are 4-hourly calories, protein, and fluid decisions; reward balances short-term physiology/nutrition goals with long-term survival; trained on 11,000+ ICU patients from MIMIC-IV; evaluated against clinician-derived and guideline policies using multiple metrics.

Result: DeepEN outperforms baseline policies, achieving a 3.7 percentage-point reduction in estimated mortality (18.8% vs 22.5%), along with improvements in key nutritional biomarkers, and demonstrates alignment with high-value clinician actions while avoiding unsafe deviations.

Conclusion: The study shows the potential of safe, data-driven personalization of enteral nutrition therapy to improve critical-care outcomes beyond guideline- or heuristic-based approaches; however, prospective validation and careful clinical integration are needed.

Abstract: We introduce DeepEN, a deep reinforcement learning (RL) framework for
personalized enteral nutrition (EN) in critically ill patients. Trained offline
on over 11,000 ICU patients from the MIMIC-IV database, DeepEN generates
4-hourly recommendations for caloric, protein, and fluid intake tailored to
each patient's evolving physiology. The model integrates a curated, clinically
informed state space with a custom reward function that balances short-term
physiological and nutrition-related goals with long-term survival outcomes.
Using a dueling double deep Q-network with conservative Q-learning
regularization, DeepEN learns clinically realistic policies that align with
high-value clinician actions while discouraging unsafe deviations. Across
various qualitative and quantitative metrics, DeepEN outperforms
clinician-derived and guideline-based policies, achieving a 3.7 $\pm$ 0.17
percentage-point reduction in estimated mortality (18.8% vs 22.5%) and
improvements in key nutritional biomarkers. These findings highlight the
potential of safe, data-driven personalization of EN therapy to improve
outcomes beyond traditional guideline- or heuristic-based approaches.

*Viacheslav Meshchaninov,Egor Shibaev,Artem Makoian,Ivan Klimov,Danil Sheshenya,Andrei Malinin,Nikita Balagansky,Daniil Gavrilov,Aibek Alanov,Dmitry Vetrov*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces a star-shaped sampling paradigm for pre-trained masked diffusion models, enabling error correction with a lightweight fine-tuning of a single layer and a learnable re-masking scheduler, achieving notable quality/efficiency gains especially with few sampling steps, validated on text and code generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sampling in pre-trained masked diffusion models is often irreversible and inefficient at low-step regimes, limiting practical usage. There is a need for a method that enables error correction, preserves information during generation, and can be applied with minimal fine-tuning.

Method: Reformulate generation into a star-shaped paradigm that inherently allows error correction. Add a learnable re-masking scheduler to identify and revise likely errors. Fine-tune a single layer to adapt the model. Conduct ablations and comprehensive experiments on text and code generation to compare with existing methods.

Result: Significant improvements in sample quality and efficiency at low step counts. The approach outperforms or matches existing diffusion sampling methods across examined scenarios and task types, with demonstrated robustness across ablations.

Conclusion: Star-shaped sampling with a learnable re-masking scheduler enables effective error correction in pre-trained masked diffusion models with minimal fine-tuning, offering practical gains in quality and speed for text and code generation and potential applicability to other domains.

Abstract: The performance of pre-trained masked diffusion models is often constrained
by their sampling procedure, which makes decisions irreversible and struggles
in low-step generation regimes. We introduce a novel sampling algorithm that
works with pre-trained models and, after a lightweight fine-tuning of a single
layer, significantly improves sample quality and efficiency. Our method
reformulates the generation process using a star-shaped paradigm, which
inherently allows for error correction. To make this process effective, we
augment it with a learnable re-masking scheduler that intelligently identifies
and revises likely errors. This approach yields a substantial quality boost,
particularly when using a small number of sampling steps. We extensively ablate
key components of our approach and show its usability in different scenarios.
In comprehensive experiments on text, and code generation, our sampling
algorithm outperforms or matches existing methods.

*Fernanda Famá,Roberto Pereira,Charalampos Kalalas,Paolo Dini,Lorena Qendro,Fahim Kawsar,Mohammad Malekzadeh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A benchmarking study evaluating energy, data efficiency, and memory of four contrastive learning (CL) frameworks—SimCLR, MoCo, SimSiam, and Barlow Twins—for edge/fog deployment. SimCLR is found to be the most energy-efficient across data regimes, challenging its perceived computational cost. The study also assesses lightweight architectures paired with CL and proposes a benchmarking strategy to guide resource-aware deployment and future optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Contrastive learning offers strong self-supervised representations but is often resource-intensive, hindering deployment on edge/fog devices. There is a need for practical benchmarks that evaluate energy, data efficiency, and memory under constrained conditions.

Method: Systematic benchmarking with energy profiling under reduced training data conditions, evaluating four CL frameworks (SimCLR, MoCo, SimSiam, Barlow Twins). The study also extends to lightweight neural architectures to assess performance-energy trade-offs in edge/fog scenarios.

Result: SimCLR demonstrated the lowest energy consumption across various data regimes, contrary to expectations about its computational cost. Energy profiles vary by framework and data regime. The study provides practical insights and a benchmarking strategy for resource-constrained deployment.

Conclusion: The work offers guidance on deploying CL in edge/fog settings and highlights SimCLR as a surprisingly energy-efficient option among the evaluated frameworks. It also emphasizes the importance of considering data regime and model-lightweighting, and it suggests directions for future optimization of CL for resource-limited environments.

Abstract: While contrastive learning (CL) shows considerable promise in self-supervised
representation learning, its deployment on resource-constrained devices remains
largely underexplored. The substantial computational demands required for
training conventional CL frameworks pose a set of challenges, particularly in
terms of energy consumption, data availability, and memory usage. We conduct an
evaluation of four widely used CL frameworks: SimCLR, MoCo, SimSiam, and Barlow
Twins. We focus on the practical feasibility of these CL frameworks for edge
and fog deployment, and introduce a systematic benchmarking strategy that
includes energy profiling and reduced training data conditions. Our findings
reveal that SimCLR, contrary to its perceived computational cost, demonstrates
the lowest energy consumption across various data regimes. Finally, we also
extend our analysis by evaluating lightweight neural architectures when paired
with CL frameworks. Our study aims to provide insights into the resource
implications of deploying CL in edge/fog environments with limited processing
capabilities and opens several research directions for its future optimization.

*Jacob Trauger,Tyson Trauger,Ambuj Tewari*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A theoretical characterization of learnability for forgiving 0-1 loss in multiclass with finite labels via a Generalized Natarajan Dimension; ties set-valued feedback to the Natarajan Dimension and claims finiteness of this generalized dimension exactly captures learnability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extend multiclass learnability theory to forgiving losses and set-valued feedback by introducing a new dimension based on Natarajan's dimension.

Method: Define a Generalized Natarajan Dimension (GND) and prove an if-and-only-if: a hypothesis class is learnable under forgiving 0-1 loss in finite-label multiclass if and only if GND is finite; relate set-valued feedback to Natarajan dimension to characterize set learning.

Result: Characterization: finite GND ⇔ learnability; and the learnability of set learning problems is governed by the Natarajan Dimension.

Conclusion: The work positions the Natarajan Dimension as the core metric for learnability in set-valued feedback scenarios and provides a tight, dimension-based criterion for forgiving multiclass 0-1 loss.

Abstract: In this paper we will give a characterization of the learnability of
forgiving 0-1 loss functions in the finite label multiclass setting. To do
this, we create a new combinatorial dimension that is based off of the
Natarajan Dimension \citep{natarajan1989learning} and we show that a hypothesis
class is learnable in our setting if and only if this Generalized Natarajan
Dimension is finite. We also show a connection to learning with set-valued
feedback. Through our results we show that the learnability of a set learning
problem is characterized by the Natarajan Dimension.

### [309] [FlyLoRA: Boosting Task Decoupling and Parameter Efficiency via Implicit Rank-Wise Mixture-of-Experts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08396)
*Heming Zou,Yunliang Zang,Wutong Xu,Yao Zhu,Xiangyang Ji*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FlyLoRA is a novel implicit MoE-based LoRA that uses rank-wise expert activation and a frozen sparse random projection to unify routing with down-projection, eliminating explicit routers. It aims to mitigate intra-task interference and inter-task interference, achieving consistent gains across diverse tasks with biological inspiration (fly olfactory circuit).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LoRA-based parameter-efficient fine-tuning struggles with parameter interference, and existing MoE-LoRA variants incur extra router parameters and fail to address inter-task interference in multi-task settings. The paper seeks a biologically inspired, efficient solution that improves both intra- and inter-task decoupling.

Method: Introduce rank-wise expert activation in the up-projection and an implicit router via a frozen sparse random projection matrix that replaces the dense trainable router. The router is implicit, unifying expert routing and down-projection, thus removing explicit router overhead and leveraging orthogonality of random projections to reduce inter-task interference.

Result: Extensive experiments across four domains—general knowledge understanding, scientific question answering, mathematical reasoning, and code generation—show consistent performance improvements over existing methods (LoRA and MoE-based variants).

Conclusion: FlyLoRA demonstrates that biological-inspired, implicit MoE-based LoRA designs can achieve better intra-task decorrelation and computational efficiency while mitigating inter-task interference, offering a promising direction for parameter-efficient fine-tuning.

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) is a widely used parameter-efficient fine-tuning
method for foundation models, but it suffers from parameter interference,
resulting in suboptimal performance. Although Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)-based
LoRA variants show promise in mitigating intra-task correlations in single-task
instruction tuning, they introduce additional router parameters and remain
ineffective in multi-task model merging where inter-task interference arises.
Inspired by the fly olfactory circuit, we propose FlyLoRA, an implicit
MoE-based LoRA variant that introduces: (1) rank-wise expert activation in the
up-projection matrix, and (2) an implicit router that unifies expert routing
and down-projection, where a frozen sparse random projection matrix replaces
the traditional dense trainable version. This design resolves the trade-off
between intra-task decorrelation and computational efficiency by eliminating
the need for an explicit router, while inherently mitigating inter-task
interference due to the orthogonality property of random matrices. Extensive
experiments across four domains -- general knowledge understanding, scientific
question answering, mathematical reasoning, and code generation -- demonstrate
consistent performance improvements over existing methods. Beyond empirical
gains, FlyLoRA highlights how biological structures can inspire innovations in
AI technologies. Code is available at https://github.com/gfyddha/FlyLoRA.

### [310] [Biology-driven assessment of deep learning super-resolution imaging of the porosity network in dentin](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08407)
*Lauren Anderson,Lucas Chatelain,Nicolas Tremblay,Kathryn Grandfield,David Rousseau,Aurélien Gourrier*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DL super-resolution (SR) on confocal images of dental porosity can speed acquisitions, but generic IQA metrics poorly align with biology; a biology-driven evaluation using segmentation and graph connectivity better reveals SR performance and model differences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Visualize sub-microscopic porosity in dentin to understand the mechanosensory system; high-resolution confocal imaging is limited by small field-of-view; a faster, post-processing SR approach is desirable, but evaluation must reflect the relevant biological structure.

Method: Applied four SR models to paired high/low-resolution confocal images: supervised RCAN, pix2pix, FSRCNN; unsupervised CycleGAN; tested at downsampling factors x2, x4, x8. Evaluated with a broad set of IQA metrics that conflicted with perception. Then conducted a biology-driven assessment: segment porosity networks based on relevant scales/morphology, analyze connected components, and assess 3D porosity connectivity through graph analysis to gauge SR performance.

Result: IQA metrics gave inconsistent results and often contradicted visual perception. The biology-driven assessments (segmentation and graph-based connectivity) provided clearer insights, showing model differences in preserving weak intensity features and nonlinearities, which generic IQA metrics failed to capture.

Conclusion: Generic image quality metrics are insufficient for evaluating SR in specialized biological structures like dental porosity. A biology-driven evaluation—segmentation of the porosity network and connectivity/graph analysis—yields more mechanistic, reliable interpretation and should guide SR model selection and development to preserve critical connectivity and weak signals.

Abstract: The mechanosensory system of teeth is currently believed to partly rely on
Odontoblast cells stimulation by fluid flow through a porosity network
extending through dentin. Visualizing the smallest sub-microscopic porosity
vessels therefore requires the highest achievable resolution from confocal
fluorescence microscopy, the current gold standard. This considerably limits
the extent of the field of view to very small sample regions. To overcome this
limitation, we tested different deep learning (DL) super-resolution (SR) models
to allow faster experimental acquisitions of lower resolution images and
restore optimal image quality by post-processing. Three supervised 2D SR models
(RCAN, pix2pix, FSRCNN) and one unsupervised (CycleGAN) were applied to a
unique set of experimentally paired high- and low-resolution confocal images
acquired with different sampling schemes, resulting in a pixel size increase of
x2, x4, x8. Model performance was quantified using a broad set of similarity
and distribution-based image quality assessment (IQA) metrics, which yielded
inconsistent results that mostly contradicted our visual perception. This
raises the question of the relevance of such generic metrics to efficiently
target the specific structure of dental porosity. To resolve this conflicting
information, the generated SR images were segmented taking into account the
specific scales and morphology of the porosity network and analysed by
comparing connected components. Additionally, the capacity of the SR models to
preserve 3D porosity connectivity throughout the confocal image stacks was
evaluated using graph analysis. This biology-driven assessment allowed a far
better mechanistic interpretation of SR performance, highlighting differences
in model sensitivity to weak intensity features and the impact of non-linearity
in image generation, which explains the failure of standard IQA metrics.

### [311] [Prompts Generalize with Low Data: Non-vacuous Generalization Bounds for Optimizing Prompts with More Informative Priors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08413)
*David Madras,Joshua Safyan,Qiuyi,Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Perplexity-based priors improve data-scarce prompt optimization by yielding non-vacuous generalization bounds and improving empirical performance, addressing the limitations of PAC-Bayes in discrete prompt spaces.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prompt engineering often succeeds even with limited task-specific data, while existing PAC-Bayes bounds for discrete prompt spaces become vacuous in data-scarce regimes. A data-distribution-dependent perplexity prior may steer search toward naturally fitting prompts and explain generalization.

Method: Derive novel generalization bounds that incorporate perplexity as a prior over prompts; analyze how perplexity regularization tightens these bounds by constraining exploration; empirically evaluate both the bounds and the practical benefits of perplexity regularization.

Result: The proposed bounds are non-vacuous in data-scarce settings, and perplexity regularization improves prompt generalization; empirical experiments validate the theoretical claims.

Conclusion: Perplexity-based priors offer a principled explanation for successful prompt optimization under data scarcity and provide a practical method to improve generalization by guiding the search toward naturally suitable prompts.

Abstract: Many prompt engineering techniques have been successful in practice, even
when optimizing over a large prompt space with with a small amount of
task-specific data. Recent work has partially explained this success by showing
generalization bounds which apply PAC-Bayes theory to the discrete prompt
space, but they are non-vacuous only in data-rich scenarios. We argue that such
widespread success can be more fully explained through more carefully
considering data- or distribution-dependent perplexity, which acts as an
effective prior and steers the optimization towards prompts that are more
``natural'' for the task at hand. We derive novel generalization bounds that
are non-vacuous for data-scarce prompt optimization via more useful priors,
formally analyzing how perplexity regularization tightens these bounds by
limiting exploration. Empirically, we explore both the bounds' effectiveness
and the practical benefits of perplexity regularization in improving prompt
generalization.

### [312] [Reinforcing Diffusion Models by Direct Group Preference Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08425)
*Yihong Luo,Tianyang Hu,Jing Tang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DGPO is an online RL method for diffusion models that learns from group-level, within-group preferences to train without policy gradients, enabling deterministic ODE samplers, leading to ~20x faster training and improved in-domain and out-of-domain rewards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Group Relative Preference Optimization (GRPO) requires stochastic policies, which clash with the most efficient, deterministic diffusion samplers (ODEs). To achieve faster, cost-effective training, a method that eliminates policy gradients and leverages group-wise preferences is needed.

Method: Direct Group Preference Optimization (DGPO) directly optimizes from group-level preferences, using relative information within groups. It discards policy-gradient objectives and the need for stochastic policies, enabling the use of deterministic ODE samplers and faster online learning for diffusion models.

Result: DGPO trains about 20x faster than current state-of-the-art methods and achieves superior performance on both in-domain and out-of-domain reward metrics.

Conclusion: DGPO reconciles RL with diffusion models by abandoning policy gradients in favor of group-wise preferences, unlocking efficient deterministic samplers and significantly faster training while improving reward performance; code is available at the provided GitHub link.

Abstract: While reinforcement learning methods such as Group Relative Preference
Optimization (GRPO) have significantly enhanced Large Language Models, adapting
them to diffusion models remains challenging. In particular, GRPO demands a
stochastic policy, yet the most cost-effective diffusion samplers are based on
deterministic ODEs. Recent work addresses this issue by using inefficient
SDE-based samplers to induce stochasticity, but this reliance on model-agnostic
Gaussian noise leads to slow convergence. To resolve this conflict, we propose
Direct Group Preference Optimization (DGPO), a new online RL algorithm that
dispenses with the policy-gradient framework entirely. DGPO learns directly
from group-level preferences, which utilize relative information of samples
within groups. This design eliminates the need for inefficient stochastic
policies, unlocking the use of efficient deterministic ODE samplers and faster
training. Extensive results show that DGPO trains around 20 times faster than
existing state-of-the-art methods and achieves superior performance on both
in-domain and out-of-domain reward metrics. Code is available at

*Stella C. Dong,James R. Finlay*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ClauseLens uses clause-grounded RA-CMDP to produce transparent, regulation-compliant treaty quotes with clause-backed explanations, improving risk metrics in a simulated environment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Regulatory demands require auditable, interpretable pricing in reinsurance; current quoting methods are opaque and hard to audit, risking non-compliance.

Method: Formulates quoting as a Risk-Aware Constrained Markov Decision Process. Retrieves statutory and policy clauses from legal/underwriting corpora, embeds them into observations to constrain actions and generate clause-grounded natural language explanations. Evaluated in a multi-agent treaty simulator calibrated to industry data.

Result: Solvency violations reduced by 51%; tail risk (CVaR_0.10) improved by 27.9%; clause-grounded explanation accuracy 88.2% with retrieval precision 87.4% and recall 91.1%.

Conclusion: Embedding legal context into both decision and explanation pathways yields interpretable, auditable, and regulation-aligned quoting behavior compatible with Solvency II, NAIC RBC, and EU AI Act.

Abstract: Reinsurance treaty pricing must satisfy stringent regulatory standards, yet
current quoting practices remain opaque and difficult to audit. We introduce
ClauseLens, a clause-grounded reinforcement learning framework that produces
transparent, regulation-compliant, and risk-aware treaty quotes.
  ClauseLens models the quoting task as a Risk-Aware Constrained Markov
Decision Process (RA-CMDP). Statutory and policy clauses are retrieved from
legal and underwriting corpora, embedded into the agent's observations, and
used both to constrain feasible actions and to generate clause-grounded natural
language justifications.
  Evaluated in a multi-agent treaty simulator calibrated to industry data,
ClauseLens reduces solvency violations by 51%, improves tail-risk performance
by 27.9% (CVaR_0.10), and achieves 88.2% accuracy in clause-grounded
explanations with retrieval precision of 87.4% and recall of 91.1%.
  These findings demonstrate that embedding legal context into both decision
and explanation pathways yields interpretable, auditable, and
regulation-aligned quoting behavior consistent with Solvency II, NAIC RBC, and
the EU AI Act.

TL;DR: Trains a learned router (xRouter) to dynamically decide between answering directly and invoking external models, optimizing cost-performance via cost-aware reinforcement learning in a tool-calling framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reduce cost in LLM deployments while maintaining performance; static escalation rules and keywords underutilize the spectrum and fail to adapt across task types.

Method: End-to-end reinforcement learning with a cost-aware reward; router can directly answer or call external models; includes full RL pipeline (reward, cost accounting) and deployment/evaluation.

Result: Demonstrates favorable cost-performance trade-offs across benchmarks; substantial cost reductions at comparable task completion rates; offers insights into what improves learned routing and challenges in training small open models.

Conclusion: Open implementation and findings advance practical, cost-aware LLM orchestration and motivate further work on trainability and sophisticated orchestration in diverse models.

Abstract: Modern LLM deployments confront a widening cost-performance spectrum: premium
models deliver strong reasoning but are expensive, while lightweight models are
economical yet brittle on complex tasks. Static escalation rules and keyword
heuristics under-utilize this spectrum and fail to adapt across task types. We
present xRouter, a tool-calling-based routing system in which a learned router
can either answer directly or invoke one or more external models. The router is
trained end-to-end with reinforcement learning using an explicit, cost-aware
reward that encodes cost-performance trade-offs, eliminating the need for
hand-engineered routing rules. Our implementation encompasses the full
reinforcement learning framework, including reward and cost accounting, as well
as the deployment and evaluation pipelines. Across diverse benchmarks, xRouter
achieves strong cost-performance trade-offs (e.g., substantial cost reductions
at comparable task completion rates), and provides empirical insights into what
reliably helps learned routing and what does not, ranging from model
trainability to the difficulty of eliciting sophisticated orchestration
behaviors in small open models. We hope these findings and our open
implementation will serve as a practical substrate for advancing learned,
cost-aware LLM orchestration.

Abstract: Foundation models for time series analysis (TSA) have attracted significant
attention. However, challenges such as training data scarcity and imbalance
continue to hinder their development. Inspired by complex dynamic system
theories, we design a series-symbol data generation mechanism, enabling the
unrestricted creation of high-quality time series data paired with
corresponding symbolic expressions. To leverage series-symbol data pairs with
strong correlations, we develop \texttt{SymTime}, a pre-trained foundation
model for enhancing time series representation using symbolic information.
\texttt{SymTime} demonstrates competitive performance across five major TSA
tasks when fine-tunes with downstream tasks, rivaling foundation models
pre-trained on real-world datasets. This approach underscores the potential of
series-symbol data generation and pretraining mechanisms in overcoming data
scarcity and enhancing task performance. The code is available at

### [316] [gLSTM: Mitigating Over-Squashing by Increasing Storage Capacity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08450)
*Hugh Blayney,Álvaro Arroyo,Xiaowen Dong,Michael M. Bronstein*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Re-examines over-squashing in GNNs through the lens of node representation storage capacity, introduces a capacity-focused synthetic task, and designs a memory-inspired GNN (drawing on associative memories, fast weight programmers, and xLSTM) that improves information storage/retrieval and performs well on synthetic and real-world graph benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Over-squashing compresses information from large receptive fields into small fixed-size vectors, creating an information bottleneck. Existing evaluation tasks may not capture a model's true storage/retrieval capacity for node representations. The authors aim to formalize capacity, critique current measures, and develop architectures that mitigate bottlenecks.

Method: Define model storage/retrieval capacity for nodes, critique existing over-squashing tasks, introduce a new capacity-oriented synthetic task to reveal bottlenecks, and develop a novel GNN architecture inspired by associative memories, fast weight programmers, and the xLSTM to enlarge storage/retrieval capacity.

Result: The proposed architecture demonstrates improved capacity on the new synthetic task and achieves strong performance across a range of real-world graph benchmarks, indicating better information persistence and retrieval within node representations.

Conclusion: Capacity-aware design and memory-inspired mechanisms can alleviate over-squashing in GNNs, enabling richer, more persistent node representations. The work connects information bottlenecks with practical performance and suggests fertile directions for integrating memory-model ideas into graph learning.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) leverage the graph structure to transmit
information between nodes, typically through the message-passing mechanism.
While these models have found a wide variety of applications, they are known to
suffer from over-squashing, where information from a large receptive field of
node representations is collapsed into a single fixed sized vector, resulting
in an information bottleneck. In this paper, we re-examine the over-squashing
phenomenon through the lens of model storage and retrieval capacity, which we
define as the amount of information that can be stored in a node's
representation for later use. We study some of the limitations of existing
tasks used to measure over-squashing and introduce a new synthetic task to
demonstrate that an information bottleneck can saturate this capacity.
Furthermore, we adapt ideas from the sequence modeling literature on
associative memories, fast weight programmers, and the xLSTM model to develop a
novel GNN architecture with improved capacity. We demonstrate strong
performance of this architecture both on our capacity synthetic task, as well
as a range of real-world graph benchmarks.

*Ankur Mali,Lawrence Hall,Jake Williams,Gordon Richards*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A rigorous nine-dimensional signature framework classifies activation functions, linking stability, expressivity, and kernel conditioning; validated on eight activations with principled design insights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Activation functions critically shape neural network behavior but current comparisons rely on heuristics. A rigorous, quantitative taxonomy is needed to ensure stability and kernel conditioning across architectures.

Method: Define a nine-dimensional integral signature S_sigma(phi) incorporating Gaussian propagation statistics (m1, g1, g2, m2, eta), asymptotic slopes (alpha_plus, alpha_minus), and regularity measures (TV(phi'), C(phi)). Prove well-posedness, affine reparameterization, and closure under bounded slope variation; derive Lyapunov stability results with explicit descent constants; analyze variance stability via (m2', g2) in a kernel setting with dimension-free Hessian bounds; connect smoothness to bounded variation of phi'; apply framework to eight activations (ReLU, leaky-ReLU, tanh, sigmoid, Swish, GELU, Mish, TeLU) and classify into saturating, linear-growth, and smooth families; validate predictions with Gauss-Hermite and Monte Carlo experiments.

Result: Obtained a sharp taxonomy separating activations by growth and smoothness regimes, with provable stability and kernel-conditioning guarantees. Identified variance-stability regions and dimension-free Hessian bounds, and confirmed predictions via numerical experiments.

Conclusion: The nine-dimensional signature framework provides principled, provable guidance for activation choice, enabling stability and kernel conditioning considerations beyond heuristic comparisons.

Abstract: Activation functions govern the expressivity and stability of neural
networks, yet existing comparisons remain largely heuristic. We propose a
rigorous framework for their classification via a nine-dimensional integral
signature S_sigma(phi), combining Gaussian propagation statistics (m1, g1, g2,
m2, eta), asymptotic slopes (alpha_plus, alpha_minus), and regularity measures
(TV(phi'), C(phi)). This taxonomy establishes well-posedness, affine
reparameterization laws with bias, and closure under bounded slope variation.
Dynamical analysis yields Lyapunov theorems with explicit descent constants and
identifies variance stability regions through (m2', g2). From a kernel
perspective, we derive dimension-free Hessian bounds and connect smoothness to
bounded variation of phi'. Applying the framework, we classify eight standard
activations (ReLU, leaky-ReLU, tanh, sigmoid, Swish, GELU, Mish, TeLU), proving
sharp distinctions between saturating, linear-growth, and smooth families.
Numerical Gauss-Hermite and Monte Carlo validation confirms theoretical
predictions. Our framework provides principled design guidance, moving
activation choice from trial-and-error to provable stability and kernel
conditioning.

### [318] [SummDiff: Generative Modeling of Video Summarization with Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08458)
*Kwanseok Kim,Jaehoon Hahm,Sumin Kim,Jinhwan Sul,Byunghak Kim,Joonseok Lee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces SummDiff, a diffusion-based conditional video summarization model that generates multiple plausible summaries to capture subjective preferences, achieving SOTA and introducing knapsack-based evaluation metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Video summarization is subjective; averaging across raters ignores diversity of good summaries. A model should learn the distribution of acceptable summaries and reflect varying human perspectives.

Method: Frame the task as conditional generation using diffusion models. SummDiff generates multiple candidate summaries conditioned on the input video, adapting to visual context and enabling diverse outputs. Includes analysis via novel knapsack-based metrics.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks. Produces summaries that align with individual annotator preferences and provides multiple plausible summaries. Introduces knapsack-based evaluation metrics for last-step summary generation.

Conclusion: A new formulation of video summarization as conditional generation with diffusion enables modeling subjective distributions of summaries. SummDiff demonstrates strong performance and offers new evaluation insights through knapsack metrics.

Abstract: Video summarization is a task of shortening a video by choosing a subset of
frames while preserving its essential moments. Despite the innate subjectivity
of the task, previous works have deterministically regressed to an averaged
frame score over multiple raters, ignoring the inherent subjectivity of what
constitutes a good summary. We propose a novel problem formulation by framing
video summarization as a conditional generation task, allowing a model to learn
the distribution of good summaries and to generate multiple plausible summaries
that better reflect varying human perspectives. Adopting diffusion models for
the first time in video summarization, our proposed method, SummDiff,
dynamically adapts to visual contexts and generates multiple candidate
summaries conditioned on the input video. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that SummDiff not only achieves the state-of-the-art performance on various
benchmarks but also produces summaries that closely align with individual
annotator preferences. Moreover, we provide a deeper insight with novel metrics
from an analysis of the knapsack, which is an important last step of generating
summaries but has been overlooked in evaluation.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ICC extends in-context learning to unsupervised clustering by using LLM attention to capture relationships, enabling zero-shot clustering on text-encoded numeric data and text-conditioned image clustering; improved with Next Token Prediction fine-tuning; competitive with spectral clustering on some tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the reliance on predefined similarity measures in traditional clustering and leverage the flexible, relational modeling capabilities of large language models (LLMs) for clustering across diverse data modalities and distributions.

Method: Introduce In-Context Clustering (ICC). Evaluate zero-shot clustering using LLM attention on text-encoded numeric data; explore spectral clustering using attention matrices; enhance clustering via fine-tuning with Next Token Prediction (NTP) loss on numeric and image data; demonstrate text-conditioned image clustering via prompting.

Result: LLM attention matrices reveal salient cluster patterns; spectral clustering with attention matrices is surprisingly competitive; NTP fine-tuning improves clustering performance on numeric and image data; the approach enables text-conditioned image clustering and broad unsupervised clustering across domains.

Conclusion: ICC demonstrates that LLMs can serve as flexible, multi-modal unsupervised clustering engines, extending in-context learning to clustering tasks and offering a versatile alternative to traditional clustering schemes; code is released for broader adoption.

Abstract: We propose In-Context Clustering (ICC), a flexible LLM-based procedure for
clustering data from diverse distributions. Unlike traditional clustering
algorithms constrained by predefined similarity measures, ICC flexibly captures
complex relationships among inputs through an attention mechanism. We show that
pretrained LLMs exhibit impressive zero-shot clustering capabilities on
text-encoded numeric data, with attention matrices showing salient cluster
patterns. Spectral clustering using attention matrices offers surprisingly
competitive performance. We further enhance the clustering capabilities of LLMs
on numeric and image data through fine-tuning using the Next Token Prediction
(NTP) loss. Moreover, the flexibility of LLM prompting enables text-conditioned
image clustering, a capability that classical clustering methods lack. Our work
extends in-context learning to an unsupervised setting, showcasing the
effectiveness and flexibility of LLMs for clustering. Our code is available at

*Sharut Gupta,Shobhita Sundaram,Chenyu Wang,Stefanie Jegelka,Phillip Isola*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: UML uses unpaired data from multiple modalities to train a single shared-model that alternates across modalities; modality-agnostic training yields more informative representations under linear assumptions and improves unimodal downstream tasks, with a project page for details.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Paired multimodal datasets are scarce and expensive. The work proposes leveraging abundant unpaired multimodal data to learn richer representations by assuming modalities are projections of a shared latent reality and training a single model across modalities without explicit pairing.

Method: Train a single, modality-agnostic model that alternates processing inputs from different modalities while sharing parameters. Uses unpaired auxiliary data from text, audio, or images to learn representations. Theoretically shows that, under linear data-generating assumptions, unpaired data can yield representations more informative about the data-generating process than unimodal training.

Result: Empirically, incorporating unpaired auxiliary data consistently improves downstream performance on diverse unimodal targets such as image and audio tasks.

Conclusion: Demonstrates the potential of unpaired multimodal data to enhance representation learning and validates the UML approach; suggests future exploration of additional modalities and theoretical understanding.

Abstract: Traditional multimodal learners find unified representations for tasks like
visual question answering, but rely heavily on paired datasets. However, an
overlooked yet potentially powerful question is: can one leverage auxiliary
unpaired multimodal data to directly enhance representation learning in a
target modality? We introduce UML: Unpaired Multimodal Learner, a
modality-agnostic training paradigm in which a single model alternately
processes inputs from different modalities while sharing parameters across
them. This design exploits the assumption that different modalities are
projections of a shared underlying reality, allowing the model to benefit from
cross-modal structure without requiring explicit pairs. Theoretically, under
linear data-generating assumptions, we show that unpaired auxiliary data can
yield representations strictly more informative about the data-generating
process than unimodal training. Empirically, we show that using unpaired data
from auxiliary modalities -- such as text, audio, or images -- consistently
improves downstream performance across diverse unimodal targets such as image
and audio. Our project page: https://unpaired-multimodal.github.io/

*Yuanjun Dai,Keqiang He,An Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DYNAMIX uses PPO to adapt batch size in distributed ML with a multi-dimensional state, achieving accuracy gains and faster training, scalable and transferable across models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Static, heuristic batch size selection fails under heterogeneous, dynamic environments; a model-free, adaptive approach is needed to improve efficiency and accuracy.

Method: Formulates batch size optimization as a sequential decision problem; employs PPO; uses state consisting of network metrics, resource utilization, and training efficiency indicators; integrates with existing distributed training frameworks; does not rely on explicit system modeling.

Result: Improves final model accuracy by up to 6.3%; reduces total training time by up to 46%; maintains strong performance as cluster scales to 32 nodes; learned policies generalize across related model architectures.

Conclusion: RL-based adaptive batch sizing can robustly enhance performance and efficiency in heterogeneous distributed settings and transfer across models, removing the need for explicit system models.

Abstract: Existing batch size selection approaches in distributed machine learning rely
on static allocation or simplistic heuristics that fail to adapt to
heterogeneous, dynamic computing environments. We present DYNAMIX, a
reinforcement learning framework that formulates batch size optimization as a
sequential decision-making problem using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO).
Our approach employs a multi-dimensional state representation encompassing
network-level metrics, system-level resource utilization, and training
statistical efficiency indicators to enable informed decision-making across
diverse computational resources. Our approach eliminates the need for explicit
system modeling while integrating seamlessly with existing distributed training
frameworks. Through evaluations across diverse workloads, hardware
configurations, and network conditions, DYNAMIX achieves up to 6.3% improvement
in the final model accuracy and 46% reduction in the total training time. Our
scalability experiments demonstrate that DYNAMIX maintains the best performance
as cluster size increases to 32 nodes, while policy transfer experiments show
that learned policies generalize effectively across related model
architectures.

*Yash Jhaveri,Harley Wiltzer,Patrick Shafto,Marc G. Bellemare,David Meger*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A theoretical framework for RL policy optimization with vanishing entropy regularization and temperature decoupling, yielding an interpretable, diversity-preserving optimal policy and convergence guarantees for value functions and return distributions; includes an algorithm to estimate the return distribution under this policy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RL methods often optimize for expected return but offer little insight into which policies are learned or how they behave. There is a need for interpretable, diverse policies and convergence guarantees for policy-derived quantities.

Method: Introduce vanishing entropy regularization and a temperature decoupling gambit; derive convergence to a particular optimal policy; show that as the temperature goes to zero, the policy becomes diversity-preserving (e.g., uniform over optimal actions); develop an algorithm to estimate the return distribution for the interpretable policy.

Result: Proves convergence of policy, value functions, and return distributions; in a key case, the policy samples all optimal actions uniformly; provides an algorithm to estimate the return distribution to arbitrary accuracy.

Conclusion: Temperature decoupling provides an interpretable, diversity-preserving optimal policy with convergence guarantees; offers practical means to estimate return distributions for such policies.

Abstract: In the pursuit of finding an optimal policy, reinforcement learning (RL)
methods generally ignore the properties of learned policies apart from their
expected return. Thus, even when successful, it is difficult to characterize
which policies will be learned and what they will do. In this work, we present
a theoretical framework for policy optimization that guarantees convergence to
a particular optimal policy, via vanishing entropy regularization and a
temperature decoupling gambit. Our approach realizes an interpretable,
diversity-preserving optimal policy as the regularization temperature vanishes
and ensures the convergence of policy derived objects--value functions and
return distributions. In a particular instance of our method, for example, the
realized policy samples all optimal actions uniformly. Leveraging our
temperature decoupling gambit, we present an algorithm that estimates, to
arbitrary accuracy, the return distribution associated to its interpretable,
diversity-preserving optimal policy.

### [323] [On the optimization dynamics of RLVR: Gradient gap and step size thresholds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08539)
*Joe Suk,Yaqi Duan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces Gradient Gap theory for RLVR, proving convergence conditions and a critical step-size threshold; explains stability via length normalization and how response length and success rate affect learning; validated by simulations and Qwen2.5-7B GRPO experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Provide a principled understanding of why RL with verifiable rewards (RLVR) works, identify factors that govern stability and performance, and explain phenomena not captured by prior empirical results.

Method: Theoretical analysis at both the full-response trajectory and token levels; define Gradient Gap as the key quantity guiding improvements; derive convergence conditions and a sharp, magnitude-based step-size threshold; analyze how step size should scale with response length and success rate; examine effects of length normalization; validate predictions through controlled bandit simulations and LLM experiments including training Qwen2.5-7B with GRPO.

Result: Convergence occurs only when the update direction aligns with the Gradient Gap; a sharp step-size threshold exists determining learning stability, with the critical size depending on response length and success rate; length normalization improves stability; with a fixed learning rate, the maximum achievable success rate may stagnate strictly below 100%; empirical results in simulations and real LLM training support the theory.

Conclusion: The work provides a principled theoretical foundation for RLVR, yielding concrete guidance for hyperparameter choices (notably step size and normalization) and clarifying why observed performance hinges on gradient-aligned updates and length normalization; these insights elucidate stability issues and inform future development of RLVR methods.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), which uses simple
binary feedback to post-train large language models, has shown significant
empirical success. However, a principled understanding of why it works has been
lacking. This paper builds a theoretical foundation for RLVR by analyzing its
training process at both the full-response (trajectory) and token levels.
Central to our analysis is a quantity called the Gradient Gap, which formalizes
the direction of improvement from low-reward to high-reward regions of the
response space. We prove that convergence critically depends on aligning the
update direction with this Gradient Gap. Moreover, we derive a sharp step-size
threshold based on the magnitude of the Gradient Gap: below it, learning
converges, whereas above it, performance collapses. Our theory further predicts
how the critical step size must scale with response length and the success
rate, thereby explaining why practical heuristics such as length normalization
improve stability and showing that, with a fixed learning rate, the success
rate can stagnate strictly below $100\%$. We validate these predictions through
controlled bandit simulations and LLM experiments, including training
Qwen2.5-7B with GRPO.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ERA introduces a sampling-entropy constraint by applying tailor-made activations to model outputs, yielding cross-domain gains with minimal overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Entropy control in probabilistic outputs can stabilize generation, improve robustness, and boost performance without heavy architectural changes, applicable across LLMs, reinforcement learning, and vision.

Method: Apply specially designed output activations that constrain the sampling entropy above a predefined threshold; integrate with existing models to shape the output distribution while incurring low computational cost (<7% overhead).

Result: LLMs: AIME 2025 score for Qwen2.5-Math-7B up by 37.4%; Continuous control RL: >30% performance improvement over SAC on HumanoidBench; Image classification: ImageNet Top-1 accuracy on ResNet-50 up by 0.69%.

Conclusion: Output activation is a powerful, lightweight tool for entropy control, enabling simpler, more robust algorithms with cross-domain applicability.

Abstract: We propose ERA, a new paradigm that constrains the sampling entropy above
given thresholds by applying specially designed activations to the outputs of
models. Our approach demonstrates broad effectiveness across different domains:
1) for large language models(LLMs), boosting the AIME 2025 score for
Qwen2.5-Math-7B by 37.4%; 2) for continuous control reinforcement learning
agents, improving performance by more than 30% over strong baselines such as
SAC on the challenging HumanoidBench; 3) for image classification, enhancing
ImageNet top-1 accuracy by 0.69% for ResNet-50. These gains are achieved with a
computational overhead of less than 7%. Our work validates output activation as
a powerful tool for entropy control, opening a new direction for designing
simpler and more robust algorithms.

*Kevin Rojas,Jiahe Lin,Kashif Rasul,Anderson Schneider,Yuriy Nevmyvaka,Molei Tao,Wei Deng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GDPO introduces Group Diffusion Policy Optimization, a variance-reduced RL fine-tuning method for diffusion language models using ELBO with semi-deterministic Monte Carlo, outperforming diffu-GRPO on math, reasoning, and coding benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RL fine-tuning of diffusion language models is challenging because likelihood is intractable. Token-level one-step unmasking is biased; ELBO provides a principled sequence-level objective, but cost of likelihood evaluation is prohibitive. There is a need for variance-reduced, practical ELBO estimators for DLMs.

Method: Decompose ELBO variance sources and reduce them with fast, deterministic integral approximations along key dimensions using semi-deterministic Monte Carlo schemes. Introduce Group Diffusion Policy Optimization (GDPO), a reinforcement learning algorithm for DLMs that employs these variance-reduction techniques to achieve a lower-variance ELBO estimator under limited compute budgets.

Result: Empirically, GDPO yields consistent gains over pretrained checkpoints and outperforms diffu-GRPO on the majority of math, reasoning, and coding benchmarks.

Conclusion: GDPO provides a practical, lower-variance ELBO-based RL fine-tuning method for diffusion language models, improving performance on challenging math, reasoning, and coding tasks and validating the viability of variance-reduction in ELBO-based RL for DLMs.

Abstract: Diffusion language models (DLMs) enable parallel, order-agnostic generation
with iterative refinement, offering a flexible alternative to autoregressive
large language models (LLMs). However, adapting reinforcement learning (RL)
fine-tuning to DLMs remains an open challenge because of the intractable
likelihood. Pioneering work such as diffu-GRPO estimated token-level
likelihoods via one-step unmasking. While computationally efficient, this
approach is severely biased. A more principled foundation lies in
sequence-level likelihoods, where the evidence lower bound (ELBO) serves as a
surrogate. Yet, despite this clean mathematical connection, ELBO-based methods
have seen limited adoption due to the prohibitive cost of likelihood
evaluation. In this work, we revisit ELBO estimation and disentangle its
sources of variance. This decomposition motivates reducing variance through
fast, deterministic integral approximations along a few pivotal dimensions.
Building on this insight, we introduce \textbf{Group Diffusion Policy
Optimization (GDPO)}, a new RL algorithm tailored for DLMs. GDPO leverages
simple yet effective Semi-deterministic Monte Carlo schemes to mitigate the
variance explosion of ELBO estimators under vanilla double Monte Carlo
sampling, yielding a provably lower-variance estimator under tight evaluation
budgets. Empirically, GDPO achieves consistent gains over pretrained
checkpoints and outperforms diffu-GRPO, one of the state-of-the-art baselines,
on the majority of math, reasoning, and coding benchmarks.

### [326] [Who Said Neural Networks Aren't Linear?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08570)
*Nimrod Berman,Assaf Hallak,Assaf Shocher*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces Linearizer to reinterpret nonlinear networks through induced vector spaces, enabling linear-algebra tools and simplifying diffusion model training and generative tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Linearity is defined with respect to a pair of vector spaces. By constructing new vector spaces around invertible networks, one can apply classical linear algebra to nonlinear mappings, enabling tools like SVD, pseudo-inverse, and projections, with potential practical benefits for generative modeling and modular style transfer.

Method: Define f(x) = g_y^{-1}(A g_x(x)) by sandwiching a linear operator A between two invertible neural networks g_x and g_y. This induces x and y vector spaces with addition and scalar multiplication defined via g_x and g_y. The architecture is called a Linearizer. Moreover, the composition of two Linearizers sharing a neural network is itself a Linearizer.

Result: The framework makes linear algebra applicable to nonlinear mappings; the composition of Linearizers preserves linearizability; training diffusion models with this architecture collapses hundreds of sampling steps into a single step; enforcing idempotency f(f(x))=f(x) yields a globally projective generative model and enables modular style transfer.

Conclusion: This work reframes neural networks through a linear-algebraic lens by constructing task-specific vector spaces, enabling classical techniques and efficient architectures for generative modeling and beyond; it opens avenues for applying linear tools to nonlinear mappings and for composing such Linearizers in modular architectures.

Abstract: Neural networks are famously nonlinear. However, linearity is defined
relative to a pair of vector spaces, $f$$:$$X$$\to$$Y$. Is it possible to
identify a pair of non-standard vector spaces for which a conventionally
nonlinear function is, in fact, linear? This paper introduces a method that
makes such vector spaces explicit by construction. We find that if we sandwich
a linear operator $A$ between two invertible neural networks, $f(x)=g_y^{-1}(A
g_x(x))$, then the corresponding vector spaces $X$ and $Y$ are induced by newly
defined addition and scaling actions derived from $g_x$ and $g_y$. We term this
kind of architecture a Linearizer. This framework makes the entire arsenal of
linear algebra, including SVD, pseudo-inverse, orthogonal projection and more,
applicable to nonlinear mappings. Furthermore, we show that the composition of
two Linearizers that share a neural network is also a Linearizer. We leverage
this property and demonstrate that training diffusion models using our
architecture makes the hundreds of sampling steps collapse into a single step.
We further utilize our framework to enforce idempotency (i.e. $f(f(x))=f(x)$)
on networks leading to a globally projective generative model and to
demonstrate modular style transfer.
