A common practical approach is to\naugment the RL policy with a safety filter that overrides unsafe actions to\nprevent failures during both training and deployment. However, safety filtering\nis often perceived as sacrificing performance and hindering the learning\nprocess. We show that this perceived safety-performance tradeoff is not\ninherent and prove, for the first time, that enforcing safety with a\nsufficiently permissive safety filter does not degrade asymptotic performance.\nWe formalize RL safety with a safety-critical Markov decision process (SC-MDP),\nwhich requires categorical, rather than high-probability, avoidance of\ncatastrophic failure states. Additionally, we define an associated filtered MDP\nin which all actions result in safe effects, thanks to a safety filter that is\nconsidered to be a part of the environment. Our main theorem establishes that\n(i) learning in the filtered MDP is safe categorically, (ii) standard RL\nconvergence carries over to the filtered MDP, and (iii) any policy that is\noptimal in the filtered MDP-when executed through the same filter-achieves the\nsame asymptotic return as the best safe policy in the SC-MDP, yielding a\ncomplete separation between safety enforcement and performance optimization.
