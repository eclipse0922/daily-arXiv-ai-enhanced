Conclusion: The workshop seeks to push state-of-the-art in novelty handling for autonomous driving, inspiring the development of robust, generalizable perception and control systems through shared benchmarks, challenges, and cross-disciplinary dialogue for ICCV 2025.

Abstract: As the computer vision community advances autonomous driving algorithms,
integrating vision-based insights with sensor data remains essential for
improving perception, decision making, planning, prediction, simulation, and
control. Yet we must ask: Why don't we have entirely safe self-driving cars
yet? A key part of the answer lies in addressing novel scenarios, one of the
most critical barriers to real-world deployment. Our 2COOOL workshop provides a
dedicated forum for researchers and industry experts to push the state of the
art in novelty handling, including out-of-distribution hazard detection,
vision-language models for hazard understanding, new benchmarking and
methodologies, and safe autonomous driving practices. The 2nd Workshop on the
Challenge of Out-of-Label Hazards in Autonomous Driving (2COOOL) will be held
at the International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV) 2025 in Honolulu,
Hawaii, on October 19, 2025. We aim to inspire the development of new
algorithms and systems for hazard avoidance, drawing on ideas from anomaly
detection, open-set recognition, open-vocabulary modeling, domain adaptation,
and related fields. Building on the success of its inaugural edition at the
Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV) 2025, the workshop
will feature a mix of academic and industry participation.

*Alireza Golkarieh,Kiana Kiashemshaki,Sajjad Rezvani Boroujeni*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Hybrid CNN feature extraction with a Random Forest classifier yields the best accuracy (85.4%) for classifying four dental conditions on panoramic X-rays; pre-trained models are competitive (VGG16 ~82.3%).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhance automatic classification of dental conditions in panoramic radiographs by leveraging CNN-derived features with traditional classifiers to improve discrimination of morphologically similar conditions, while evaluating standard CNN baselines and transfer learning.

Method: Dataset of 1,512 radiographs with 11,137 expert-verified annotations across four conditions (fillings, cavities, implants, impacted teeth). After preprocessing and class balancing, evaluated three approaches: (1) a custom CNN baseline, (2) hybrid models combining CNN feature extraction with traditional classifiers (e.g., Random Forest), and (3) fine-tuned pre-trained architectures (VGG16, Xception, ResNet50). Used 5-fold cross-validation with accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 as metrics.

Result: Hybrid CNN-Random Forest achieved the highest accuracy at 85.4%, outperforming the custom CNN baseline (74.3%). Among pre-trained models, VGG16 performed best at 82.3%, followed by Xception and ResNet50. Hybrid models improved discrimination of morphologically similar conditions and offered efficient, reliable performance.

Conclusion: Combining CNN-based feature extraction with ensemble classifiers provides a practical path toward automated dental diagnostic support. The approach shows promise but highlights the need for larger datasets and further clinical validation to ensure robustness and generalizability.

Abstract: This study investigates deep learning methods for automated classification of
dental conditions in panoramic X-ray images. A dataset of 1,512 radiographs
with 11,137 expert-verified annotations across four conditions fillings,
cavities, implants, and impacted teeth was used. After preprocessing and class
balancing, three approaches were evaluated: a custom convolutional neural
network (CNN), hybrid models combining CNN feature extraction with traditional
classifiers, and fine-tuned pre-trained architectures. Experiments employed 5
fold cross validation with accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score as
evaluation metrics. The hybrid CNN Random Forest model achieved the highest
performance with 85.4% accuracy, surpassing the custom CNN baseline of 74.3%.
Among pre-trained models, VGG16 performed best at 82.3% accuracy, followed by
Xception and ResNet50. Results show that hybrid models improve discrimination
of morphologically similar conditions and provide efficient, reliable
performance. These findings suggest that combining CNN-based feature extraction
with ensemble classifiers offers a practical path toward automated dental
diagnostic support, while also highlighting the need for larger datasets and
further clinical validation.

### [3] [Q-Align: Alleviating Attention Leakage in Zero-Shot Appearance Transfer via Query-Query Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21090)
*Namu Kim,Wonbin Kweon,Minsoo Kim,Hwanjo Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Q-Align addresses attention leakage in zero-shot appearance transfer by shifting from Query-Key to Query-Query alignment, combined with key-value rearrangement and attention refinement to improve semantic mapping and appearance fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Zero-shot appearance transfer with large-scale generative models suffers from attention leakage due to Query-Key alignment, leading to poor semantic mapping across images.

Method: Propose Q-Align with three components: (1) Query-Query alignment for richer spatial semantic mapping; (2) Key-Value rearrangement to realign feature correspondences; (3) Attention refinement using rearranged keys/values to preserve semantic consistency during transfer.

Result: Experimental evaluations show Q-Align outperforms state-of-the-art methods in appearance fidelity while maintaining competitive structural preservation, validated by extensive experiments and analysis.

Conclusion: Q-Align effectively mitigates attention leakage, improves cross-image semantic alignment, and enhances appearance transfer fidelity without sacrificing structure preservation.

Abstract: We observe that zero-shot appearance transfer with large-scale image
generation models faces a significant challenge: Attention Leakage. This
challenge arises when the semantic mapping between two images is captured by
the Query-Key alignment. To tackle this issue, we introduce Q-Align, utilizing
Query-Query alignment to mitigate attention leakage and improve the semantic
alignment in zero-shot appearance transfer. Q-Align incorporates three core
contributions: (1) Query-Query alignment, facilitating the sophisticated
spatial semantic mapping between two images; (2) Key-Value rearrangement,
enhancing feature correspondence through realignment; and (3) Attention
refinement using rearranged keys and values to maintain semantic consistency.
We validate the effectiveness of Q-Align through extensive experiments and
analysis, and Q-Align outperforms state-of-the-art methods in appearance
fidelity while maintaining competitive structure preservation.

### [4] [ERTACache: Error Rectification and Timesteps Adjustment for Efficient Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21091)
*Xurui Peng,Hong Liu,Chenqian Yan,Rui Ma,Fangmin Chen,Xing Wang,Zhihua Wu,Songwei Liu,Mingbao Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ERTACache presents a principled caching framework for diffusion models that decomposes cache-induced errors into feature shift and step amplification, uses offline residual profiling and a trajectory-aware correction to enable aggressive cache reuse, achieving up to 2x speedups with preserved or improved quality on image and video benchmarks including Wan2.1.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models have high inference cost due to iterative sampling. Naive caching reduces computation but degrades quality. A principled approach is needed to manage cache reuse without sacrificing fidelity.

Method: 1) Offline residual profiling to identify reusable steps. 2) Trajectory-aware correction coefficient to adapt integration intervals. 3) Closed-form residual linearization model to approximate cache-induced errors. 4) Dynamic spacing of integration steps and selective caching during sampling. 5) Evaluation across image and video benchmarks, including Wan2.1.

Result: Up to 2x faster inference with preserved or improved visual quality. On Wan2.1 video diffusion, achieves 2x acceleration with minimal VBench degradation while maintaining fidelity.

Conclusion: ERTACache enables accurate and efficient diffusion sampling under aggressive cache reuse by jointly correcting feature shift and step amplification errors, validated by extensive experiments and availability of code.

Abstract: Diffusion models suffer from substantial computational overhead due to their
inherently iterative inference process. While feature caching offers a
promising acceleration strategy by reusing intermediate outputs across
timesteps, naive reuse often incurs noticeable quality degradation. In this
work, we formally analyze the cumulative error introduced by caching and
decompose it into two principal components: feature shift error, caused by
inaccuracies in cached outputs, and step amplification error, which arises from
error propagation under fixed timestep schedules. To address these issues, we
propose ERTACache, a principled caching framework that jointly rectifies both
error types. Our method employs an offline residual profiling stage to identify
reusable steps, dynamically adjusts integration intervals via a
trajectory-aware correction coefficient, and analytically approximates
cache-induced errors through a closed-form residual linearization model.
Together, these components enable accurate and efficient sampling under
aggressive cache reuse. Extensive experiments across standard image and video
generation benchmarks show that ERTACache achieves up to 2x inference speedup
while consistently preserving or even improving visual quality. Notably, on the
state-of-the-art Wan2.1 video diffusion model, ERTACache delivers 2x
acceleration with minimal VBench degradation, effectively maintaining baseline
fidelity while significantly improving efficiency. The code is available at
https://github.com/bytedance/ERTACache.

### [5] [Video-LLMs with Temporal Visual Screening](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21094)
*Zheyu Fan,Jiateng Liu,Yuji Zhang,Zihan Wang,Yi R.,Fung,Manling Li,Heng Ji*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Temporal Visual Screening (TVS) is a modular front-end task that pre-processes video QA/instruction-tuning data by focusing on salient segments, rewriting queries to direct, consistent forms, and maintaining answer invariance. It improves training and inference performance in video-language understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Humans perform temporal screening to focus on salient moments, while Video-LLMs suffer from sparse frame sampling and weak inter-frame reasoning supervision. TVS aims to alleviate this by offloading cognitive load and aligning queries with critical visual information to enhance temporal semantics.

Method: TVS is a modular front-end adapter integrated into both training and inference pipelines. It (1) retains focus-critical video segments, (2) synchronously reconstructs queries to their most direct form while preserving answer consistency, and (3) maintains invariance/consistency for any possible answer. It uses a benchmark for TVS and introduces ReSimplifyIt as a baseline.

Result: ReSimplifyIt outperforms prior approaches on video trimming by 0.47 in F1 score and delivers competitive query rewriting. Across experiments, TVS yields relative gains of 7.33% during training and 34.6% during inference, demonstrating effective improvement in temporal information screening for video-language understanding.

Conclusion: Temporal Visual Screening is an effective, modular front-end approach that improves video-language understanding by optimally distributing reasoning burden, focusing on salient temporal segments, and rewriting queries for direct comprehension, with measurable gains in both training and inference.

Abstract: Humans naturally perform temporal screening by dragging the progress bar and
focusing on salient temporal segments, but current Video Large Language Models
(Video-LLMs) struggle to capture fine-grained temporal semantics due to sparse
frame sampling and insufficient inter-frame reasoning supervision during their
training. To address this, Inspired by well-established cognitive science
principles, we propose Temporal Visual Screening (TVS), a new task that
universally pre-processes video question answering and instruction tuning data
by: (1) retaining focus-critical video segments, (2) synchronously
reconstructing queries to their most direct form while preserving answer
consistency, and (3) keeping the invariance and consistency for any possible
answer. TVS is formulated as a modular front-end adapter task that can be
seamlessly integrated into both Video Instruction Tuning (training) and Video
Question Answering (inference) pipelines. TVS optimizes distribution of
reasoning burden and cognitive load; during training, it aligns queries with
focus-critical visual information; at inference, it enables query-aware segment
focus and streamlined query representations. In particular, we curate the first
benchmark for TVS and propose ReSimplifyIt, a baseline outperforming prior
approaches on seemingly similar tasks by 0.47 in F-1 score on video trimming
while achieving competitive query rewriting performance. Experiments
demonstrate that incorporating TVS yields relative gains of 7.33% (training)
and 34.6% (inference), demonstrating the effectiveness of temporal information
screening for improving video-language understanding.

### [6] [ROBUST-MIPS: A Combined Skeletal Pose and Instance Segmentation Dataset for Laparoscopic Surgical Instruments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21096)
*Zhe Han,Charlie Budd,Gongyu Zhang,Huanyu Tian,Christos Bergeles,Tom Vercauteren*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Pose annotations offer an efficient alternative for localizing surgical tools; ROBUST-MIPS provides a joint pose and segmentation dataset plus benchmarks to accelerate data growth and method comparison.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Annotating surgical tools for localization is data-hungry. Dense segmentation labels are costly; skeletal pose annotations can retain semantic richness while easing labeling, enabling faster expansion of annotated data.

Method: Extend the existing ROBUST-MIS dataset by adding skeletal tool pose annotations and tool instance segmentation labels to create ROBUST-MIPS; provide annotation software; release benchmark models; run baseline pose-estimation methods on the dataset for evaluation and enable head-to-head comparisons between pose and segmentation tasks.

Result: Demonstrates that pose-based localization yields high-quality results on established pose-estimation baselines; the enriched dataset allows joint study of pose and segmentation and enables direct comparisons across annotation styles; benchmark models and annotation tools are released to ease adoption.

Conclusion: Pose annotations are a viable, efficient approach for surgical tool localization. The ROBUST-MIPS dataset and accompanying tools are expected to accelerate data acquisition, promote multi-task learning, and facilitate broader adoption of learning-based surgical tool localization.

Abstract: Localisation of surgical tools constitutes a foundational building block for
computer-assisted interventional technologies. Works in this field typically
focus on training deep learning models to perform segmentation tasks.
Performance of learning-based approaches is limited by the availability of
diverse annotated data. We argue that skeletal pose annotations are a more
efficient annotation approach for surgical tools, striking a balance between
richness of semantic information and ease of annotation, thus allowing for
accelerated growth of available annotated data. To encourage adoption of this
annotation style, we present, ROBUST-MIPS, a combined tool pose and tool
instance segmentation dataset derived from the existing ROBUST-MIS dataset. Our
enriched dataset facilitates the joint study of these two annotation styles and
allow head-to-head comparison on various downstream tasks. To demonstrate the
adequacy of pose annotations for surgical tool localisation, we set up a simple
benchmark using popular pose estimation methods and observe high-quality
results. To ease adoption, together with the dataset, we release our benchmark
models and custom tool pose annotation software.

### [7] [Safe-Control: A Safety Patch for Mitigating Unsafe Content in Text-to-Image Generation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21099)
*Xiangtao Meng,Yingkai Dong,Ning Yu,Li Wang,Zheng Li,Shanqing Guo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Safe-Control is a plug-and-play safety patch for text-to-image (T2I) models that injects safety signals into locked diffusion models, enabling flexible safety patches that can be merged into a single update. It demonstrates strong, model-agnostic safety improvements across six models while preserving benign image quality, outperforming seven state-of-the-art safety methods (reducing unsafe content to ~7% vs ~20% on challenging prompts and attacks).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a rising risk of unsafe content generation by T2I models despite existing safety measures. Current defenses either fail under distribution shifts or require heavy model-specific adjustments. A flexible, patch-like, model-agnostic safety solution is needed to adapt to evolving safety requirements with minimal impact on model performance.

Method: Introduce Safe-Control as a plug-and-play patch that injects safety control signals into the locked T2I model’s denoising process. Supports multiple safety patches that can be merged into a single patch. Designed to be compatible with other T2I models sharing similar denoising architectures. Data-driven strategies and safety-aware conditions guide the patch to suppress unsafe generations while preserving benign outputs.

Result: Extensive evaluations across six public T2I models show Safe-Control significantly reduces unsafe content generation while maintaining image quality and text alignment for benign content. It outperforms seven state-of-the-art safety mechanisms (external and internal) under unsafe prompts and adversarial attacks, achieving about 7% unsafe generation compared to ~20% for baselines.

Conclusion: Safe-Control offers a flexible, patch-like, model-agnostic safety solution for T2I models that can be updated to address evolving safety needs. It provides robust reduction of unsafe content across multiple models with minimal trade-offs in output quality and alignment, outperforming existing safety defenses.

Abstract: Despite the advancements in Text-to-Image (T2I) generation models, their
potential for misuse or even abuse raises serious safety concerns. Model
developers have made tremendous efforts to introduce safety mechanisms that can
address these concerns in T2I models. However, the existing safety mechanisms,
whether external or internal, either remain susceptible to evasion under
distribution shifts or require extensive model-specific adjustments. To address
these limitations, we introduce Safe-Control, an innovative plug-and-play
safety patch designed to mitigate unsafe content generation in T2I models.
Using data-driven strategies and safety-aware conditions, Safe-Control injects
safety control signals into the locked T2I model, acting as an update in a
patch-like manner. Model developers can also construct various safety patches
to meet the evolving safety requirements, which can be flexibly merged into a
single, unified patch. Its plug-and-play design further ensures adaptability,
making it compatible with other T2I models of similar denoising architecture.
We conduct extensive evaluations on six diverse and public T2I models.
Empirical results highlight that Safe-Control is effective in reducing unsafe
content generation across six diverse T2I models with similar generative
architectures, yet it successfully maintains the quality and text alignment of
benign images. Compared to seven state-of-the-art safety mechanisms, including
both external and internal defenses, Safe-Control significantly outperforms all
baselines in reducing unsafe content generation. For example, it reduces the
probability of unsafe content generation to 7%, compared to approximately 20%
for most baseline methods, under both unsafe prompts and the latest adversarial
attacks.

### [8] [GENNAV: Polygon Mask Generation for Generalized Referring Navigable Regions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21102)
*Kei Katsumata,Yui Iioka,Naoki Hosomi,Teruhisa Misu,Kentaro Yamada,Komei Sugiura*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GENNAV jointly predicts the existence and segmentation of stuff-type target regions from NL instructions and a front-camera image, introduces the GRiN-Drive benchmark with no-target, single-target, and multi-target samples, and demonstrates state-of-the-art performance including zero-shot transfer in real-world driving.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The task requires locating target regions described in natural language within driving imagery, including stuff-type regions with ambiguous boundaries. Existing methods struggle with absence, multiplicity, and accurate segmentation, motivating a model that can predict existence and produce multiple segmentation masks.

Method: GENNAV predicts target existence and generates segmentation masks for multiple stuff-type target regions. It is evaluated on GRiN-Drive, a benchmark with no-target, single-target, and multi-target samples, and validated in real-world driving across four cars in five urban areas to test zero-shot transfer.

Result: GENNAV outperforms baseline methods on standard metrics in GRiN-Drive and demonstrates robust zero-shot transfer in diverse real-world urban environments.

Conclusion: GENNAV provides effective joint existence prediction and segmentation for stuff-type targets from NL and vision, introduces GRiN-Drive as a new benchmark, and shows strong generalization across unseen cities and devices.

Abstract: We focus on the task of identifying the location of target regions from a
natural language instruction and a front camera image captured by a mobility.
This task is challenging because it requires both existence prediction and
segmentation, particularly for stuff-type target regions with ambiguous
boundaries. Existing methods often underperform in handling stuff-type target
regions, in addition to absent or multiple targets. To overcome these
limitations, we propose GENNAV, which predicts target existence and generates
segmentation masks for multiple stuff-type target regions. To evaluate GENNAV,
we constructed a novel benchmark called GRiN-Drive, which includes three
distinct types of samples: no-target, single-target, and multi-target. GENNAV
achieved superior performance over baseline methods on standard evaluation
metrics. Furthermore, we conducted real-world experiments with four automobiles
operated in five geographically distinct urban areas to validate its zero-shot
transfer performance. In these experiments, GENNAV outperformed baseline
methods and demonstrated its robustness across diverse real-world environments.

### [9] [R-4B: Incentivizing General-Purpose Auto-Thinking Capability in MLLMs via Bi-Mode Annealing and Reinforce Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21113)
*Jie Jiang,Qi Yang,Bolin Ni,Shiming Xiang,Han Hu,Houwen Peng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: R-4B is an auto-thinking multimodal LLM that adaptively decides when to think, using bi-mode annealing and Bi-mode Policy Optimization to balance accuracy and efficiency; it achieves state-of-the-art on 25 benchmarks with lower compute.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reasoning steps are unnecessary for simple problems and add unnecessary computation; there is a need for an MLLM that can decide when to think to improve efficiency.

Method: Two-phase training. Phase 1 trains on a dataset containing both thinking and non-thinking samples across topics to teach the model when to apply reasoning. Phase 2 uses an improved GRPO framework where the policy must generate responses from both thinking and non-thinking modes for each input, aided by bi-mode annealing and Bi-mode Policy Optimization (BPO).

Result: R-4B attains state-of-the-art performance across 25 benchmarks, outperforms Qwen2.5-VL-7B in most tasks, and reaches performance comparable to larger thinking models like Kimi-VL-A3B-Thinking-2506 (16B) on reasoning-heavy tasks, with lower computational cost.

Conclusion: Adaptive thinking enables efficient yet accurate MLLMs. The bi-mode strategy and policy optimization effectively control when reasoning is invoked, reducing unnecessary computation while preserving or enhancing performance.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) equipped with step-by-step thinking
capabilities have demonstrated remarkable performance on complex reasoning
problems. However, this thinking process is redundant for simple problems
solvable without complex reasoning. To address this inefficiency, we propose
R-4B, an auto-thinking MLLM, which can adaptively decide when to think based on
problem complexity. The central idea of R-4B is to empower the model with both
thinking and non-thinking capabilities using bi-mode annealing, and apply
Bi-mode Policy Optimization~(BPO) to improve the model's accuracy in
determining whether to activate the thinking process. Specifically, we first
train the model on a carefully curated dataset spanning various topics, which
contains samples from both thinking and non-thinking modes. Then it undergoes a
second phase of training under an improved GRPO framework, where the policy
model is forced to generate responses from both modes for each input query.
Experimental results show that R-4B achieves state-of-the-art performance
across 25 challenging benchmarks. It outperforms Qwen2.5-VL-7B in most tasks
and achieves performance comparable to larger models such as
Kimi-VL-A3B-Thinking-2506 (16B) on reasoning-intensive benchmarks with lower
computational cost.

### [10] [HiddenObject: Modality-Agnostic Fusion for Multimodal Hidden Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21135)
*Harris Song,Tuan-Anh Vu,Sanjith Menon,Sriram Narasimhan,M. Khalid Jawed*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HiddenObject presents a multimodal RGB-thermal-depth detection framework using Mamba-based fusion to robustly detect obscured or camouflaged objects, achieving competitive or state-of-the-art results and showing the value of multimodal fusion over unimodal/naive approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Occlusion, camouflage, and lighting variations hamper RGB-only detection. Multimodal fusion can exploit complementary cues from other modalities to achieve robust detection in challenging environments. The paper also notes limitations of current unimodal and naive fusion strategies.

Method: HiddenObject fuses RGB, thermal, and depth data via a Mamba-based fusion mechanism that identifies modality-specific features and integrates them into a unified representation, enabling robust detection of obscured or camouflaged targets across challenging scenarios.

Result: Evaluated on multiple benchmark datasets, showing state-of-the-art or competitive performance compared to existing methods. The work underscores the effectiveness of the fusion design and reveals limitations in unimodal and naive fusion approaches.

Conclusion: Mamba-based fusion architectures can significantly advance multimodal object detection, especially under visually degraded or complex conditions.

Abstract: Detecting hidden or partially concealed objects remains a fundamental
challenge in multimodal environments, where factors like occlusion, camouflage,
and lighting variations significantly hinder performance. Traditional RGB-based
detection methods often fail under such adverse conditions, motivating the need
for more robust, modality-agnostic approaches. In this work, we present
HiddenObject, a fusion framework that integrates RGB, thermal, and depth data
using a Mamba-based fusion mechanism. Our method captures complementary signals
across modalities, enabling enhanced detection of obscured or camouflaged
targets. Specifically, the proposed approach identifies modality-specific
features and fuses them in a unified representation that generalizes well
across challenging scenarios. We validate HiddenObject across multiple
benchmark datasets, demonstrating state-of-the-art or competitive performance
compared to existing methods. These results highlight the efficacy of our
fusion design and expose key limitations in current unimodal and na\"ive fusion
strategies. More broadly, our findings suggest that Mamba-based fusion
architectures can significantly advance the field of multimodal object
detection, especially under visually degraded or complex conditions.

### [11] [RadGS-Reg: Registering Spine CT with Biplanar X-rays via Joint 3D Radiative Gaussians Reconstruction and 3D/3D Registration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21154)
*Ao Shen,Xueming Fu,Junfeng Jiang,Qiang Zeng,Ye Tang,Zhengming Chen,Luming Nong,Feng Wang,S. Kevin Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RadGS-Reg tackles vertebral CT/X-ray registration by joint 3D Radiative Gaussians reconstruction and 3D/3D registration, using Counterfactual Attention Learning to focus on vertebrae in noisy biplanar X-rays, plus patient-specific pre-training bridging simulated-to-real data with vertebral shape priors; achieves state-of-the-art results on in-house data; code on GitHub.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CT/X-ray registration demands high accuracy and real-time performance; traditional render-and-compare approaches lose spatial information and suffer from domain gaps; dense-view 3D reconstruction requires many views and is sensitive to noise; there is a need for robust vertebral-level registration under limited views and simulated-to-real gaps.

Method: RadGS-Reg framework combines 3D Radiative Gaussians reconstruction with 3D/3D registration. A biplanar X-ray vertebral RadGS reconstruction module uses Counterfactual Attention Learning to focus on vertebral regions in noisy X-rays. A patient-specific pre-training strategy progressively adapts the model from simulated to real data while learning vertebral shape priors.

Result: Experiments on in-house datasets show state-of-the-art performance for both 3D reconstruction and 3D/3D registration, surpassing existing methods.

Conclusion: RadGS-Reg addresses limitations of render-and-compare and dense-view methods, delivering robust vertebral-level CT/X-ray registration with noise robustness and domain adaptation; code available at the provided GitHub link.

Abstract: Computed Tomography (CT)/X-ray registration in image-guided navigation
remains challenging because of its stringent requirements for high accuracy and
real-time performance. Traditional "render and compare" methods, relying on
iterative projection and comparison, suffer from spatial information loss and
domain gap. 3D reconstruction from biplanar X-rays supplements spatial and
shape information for 2D/3D registration, but current methods are limited by
dense-view requirements and struggles with noisy X-rays. To address these
limitations, we introduce RadGS-Reg, a novel framework for vertebral-level
CT/X-ray registration through joint 3D Radiative Gaussians (RadGS)
reconstruction and 3D/3D registration. Specifically, our biplanar X-rays
vertebral RadGS reconstruction module explores learning-based RadGS
reconstruction method with a Counterfactual Attention Learning (CAL) mechanism,
focusing on vertebral regions in noisy X-rays. Additionally, a patient-specific
pre-training strategy progressively adapts the RadGS-Reg from simulated to real
data while simultaneously learning vertebral shape prior knowledge. Experiments
on in-house datasets demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance for both
tasks, surpassing existing methods. The code is available at:

### [12] [SYNBUILD-3D: A large, multi-modal, and semantically rich synthetic dataset of 3D building models at Level of Detail 4](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21169)
*Kevin Mayer,Alex Vesel,Xinyi Zhao,Martin Fischer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SYNBUILD-3D is a large-scale tri-modal synthetic dataset of 6.2M LoD4 residential buildings, with wireframe graphs, floor plan images, and roof point clouds, enabling semantic–geometric training for automated 3D building generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the lack of large, annotated public datasets for semantically rich 3D buildings; synthetic data offers scalable labels and diversity; tri-modal data supports cross-modal learning and semantic consistency.

Method: Dataset construction of over 6.2 million synthetic residential buildings at LoD4. Three modalities: (I) semantically enriched 3D wireframe graph at LoD4; (II) floor plan images; (III) LiDAR-like roof point cloud. Semantic annotations (rooms, doors, windows) derived from floor plans. Public release of dataset and code at GitHub. Potential for enforcing semantic–geometric consistency in future generative models.

Result: Release and description of SYNBUILD-3D, a large-scale, tri-modal synthetic dataset; no explicit empirical results reported in the abstract beyond dataset availability and intended uses.

Conclusion: The dataset enables development of generative AI for 3D buildings at LoD4 with predefined floor plans and roof geometries, supporting semantic-geometric consistency; public availability is expected to spur further research and tool development.

Abstract: 3D building models are critical for applications in architecture, energy
simulation, and navigation. Yet, generating accurate and semantically rich 3D
buildings automatically remains a major challenge due to the lack of
large-scale annotated datasets in the public domain. Inspired by the success of
synthetic data in computer vision, we introduce SYNBUILD-3D, a large, diverse,
and multi-modal dataset of over 6.2 million synthetic 3D residential buildings
at Level of Detail (LoD) 4. In the dataset, each building is represented
through three distinct modalities: a semantically enriched 3D wireframe graph
at LoD 4 (Modality I), the corresponding floor plan images (Modality II), and a
LiDAR-like roof point cloud (Modality III). The semantic annotations for each
building wireframe are derived from the corresponding floor plan images and
include information on rooms, doors, and windows. Through its tri-modal nature,
future work can use SYNBUILD-3D to develop novel generative AI algorithms that
automate the creation of 3D building models at LoD 4, subject to predefined
floor plan layouts and roof geometries, while enforcing semantic-geometric
consistency. Dataset and code samples are publicly available at

### [13] [Radially Distorted Homographies, Revisited](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21190)
*Mårten Wadenbäck,Marcus Valtonen Örnhag,Johan Edstedt*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Unified fast minimal solvers for radially distorted homographies covering all three radial distortion configurations; faster than prior state-of-the-art with comparable accuracy; validated on benchmarks including fisheye cameras; source code to be released.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Radial lens distortion complicates homography estimation between images; joint estimation of homography and radial distortion is necessary for accurate geometric reconstruction; existing methods treat three configurations separately and may be slow; a unified approach aims to be faster and stable.

Method: Develops a unified framework for radially distorted homographies that yields fast, stable, and accurate minimal solvers for all three cases; derives algebraic solutions and implements efficient algorithms; compares against state-of-the-art on standard benchmarks including fisheye imagery.

Result: Solvers are faster than existing state-of-the-art while maintaining similar accuracy; perform well across all three distortion configurations; validated on widely used benchmarks; potential practical release of source code.

Conclusion: A single unified solver framework effectively handles radial distortion in homography estimation across all configurations, offering speed and stability advantages with practical impact for vision tasks involving lens distortion.

Abstract: Homographies are among the most prevalent transformations occurring in
geometric computer vision and projective geometry, and homography estimation is
consequently a crucial step in a wide assortment of computer vision tasks. When
working with real images, which are often afflicted with geometric distortions
caused by the camera lens, it may be necessary to determine both the homography
and the lens distortion-particularly the radial component, called radial
distortion-simultaneously to obtain anything resembling useful estimates. When
considering a homography with radial distortion between two images, there are
three conceptually distinct configurations for the radial distortion; (i)
distortion in only one image, (ii) identical distortion in the two images, and
(iii) independent distortion in the two images. While these cases have been
addressed separately in the past, the present paper provides a novel and
unified approach to solve all three cases. We demonstrate how the proposed
approach can be used to construct new fast, stable, and accurate minimal
solvers for radially distorted homographies. In all three cases, our proposed
solvers are faster than the existing state-of-the-art solvers while maintaining
similar accuracy. The solvers are tested on well-established benchmarks
including images taken with fisheye cameras. The source code for our solvers
will be made available in the event our paper is accepted for publication.

*Zhenghao He,Sanchit Sinha,Guangzhi Xiong,Aidong Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GCAV unifies cross-layer concept activation vectors into a single, semantically consistent global activation vector via contrastive alignment and attention-based fusion, improving stability and robustness of concept attributions (via TCAV/TGCAV).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CAVs computed per layer often vary and conflict across layers, making cross-layer interpretation unreliable; a globally consistent representation is needed.

Method: Apply contrastive learning to align concept representations across layers; use an attention-based fusion mechanism to construct a globally integrated CAV (GCAV); introduce Testing with Global Concept Activation Vectors (TGCAV) to apply TCAV on GCAV-based representations; evaluate on multiple networks.

Result: Reduces variance of TCAV scores across layers, preserves concept relevance, improves localization, and enhances robustness to adversarial perturbations; demonstrates effective cross-layer integration.

Conclusion: GCAV provides a coherent cross-layer interpretation framework with more stable, comprehensive concept attributions; code available at the provided GitHub link.

Abstract: Concept Activation Vectors (CAVs) provide a powerful approach for
interpreting deep neural networks by quantifying their sensitivity to
human-defined concepts. However, when computed independently at different
layers, CAVs often exhibit inconsistencies, making cross-layer comparisons
unreliable. To address this issue, we propose the Global Concept Activation
Vector (GCAV), a novel framework that unifies CAVs into a single, semantically
consistent representation. Our method leverages contrastive learning to align
concept representations across layers and employs an attention-based fusion
mechanism to construct a globally integrated CAV. By doing so, our method
significantly reduces the variance in TCAV scores while preserving concept
relevance, ensuring more stable and reliable concept attributions. To evaluate
the effectiveness of GCAV, we introduce Testing with Global Concept Activation
Vectors (TGCAV) as a method to apply TCAV to GCAV-based representations. We
conduct extensive experiments on multiple deep neural networks, demonstrating
that our method effectively mitigates concept inconsistency across layers,
enhances concept localization, and improves robustness against adversarial
perturbations. By integrating cross-layer information into a coherent
framework, our method offers a more comprehensive and interpretable
understanding of how deep learning models encode human-defined concepts. Code
and models are available at https://github.com/Zhenghao-He/GCAV.

### [15] [Generalizable Object Re-Identification via Visual In-Context Prompting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21222)
*Zhizhong Huang,Xiaoming Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A prompt-based framework (VICP) enables unseen-category ReID by using LLM-derived semantic prompts to guide a vision model, achieving better generalization without retraining; introduces ShopID10K dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current ReID models are domain-specific and require costly labeled data; self-supervised methods struggle to capture identity-sensitive features needed for ReID. The goal is to generalize to unseen categories without parameter adaptation by leveraging in-context prompts.

Method: VICP uses LLMs to infer semantic identity rules from few-shot positive/negative pairs via task-specific prompts. These rules guide a vision foundation model (e.g., DINO) through dynamic visual prompts to extract ID-discriminative features. The approach aligns LLM-derived concepts with the VFM's priors, enabling cross-category generalization without retraining.

Result: Empirical evaluation on ShopID10K (10K objects with multi-view, cross-domain testing) and other ReID benchmarks show that VICP yields clear improvements over baselines on unseen categories.

Conclusion: VICP eliminates the need for dataset-specific retraining and demonstrates a promising path for identity-based recognition via cross-modal prompting. The authors provide code at the given repository.

Abstract: Current object re-identification (ReID) methods train domain-specific models
(e.g., for persons or vehicles), which lack generalization and demand costly
labeled data for new categories. While self-supervised learning reduces
annotation needs by learning instance-wise invariance, it struggles to capture
\textit{identity-sensitive} features critical for ReID. This paper proposes
Visual In-Context Prompting~(VICP), a novel framework where models trained on
seen categories can directly generalize to unseen novel categories using only
\textit{in-context examples} as prompts, without requiring parameter
adaptation. VICP synergizes LLMs and vision foundation models~(VFM): LLMs infer
semantic identity rules from few-shot positive/negative pairs through
task-specific prompting, which then guides a VFM (\eg, DINO) to extract
ID-discriminative features via \textit{dynamic visual prompts}. By aligning
LLM-derived semantic concepts with the VFM's pre-trained prior, VICP enables
generalization to novel categories, eliminating the need for dataset-specific
retraining. To support evaluation, we introduce ShopID10K, a dataset of 10K
object instances from e-commerce platforms, featuring multi-view images and
cross-domain testing. Experiments on ShopID10K and diverse ReID benchmarks
demonstrate that VICP outperforms baselines by a clear margin on unseen
categories. Code is available at https://github.com/Hzzone/VICP.

### [16] [Lightweight MRI-Based Automated Segmentation of Pancreatic Cancer with Auto3DSeg](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21227)
*Keshav Jha,William Sharp,Dominic LaBella*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SegResNet within Auto3DSeg evaluated for two MRI-based pancreatic tumor segmentation tasks in the 2025 PANTHER Challenge; modest accuracy due to small datasets and sequence variability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate pancreatic tumor delineation is critical for diagnosis and treatment, but automated segmentation is hindered by anatomical variability and limited data; the study assesses SegResNet performance under constrained data.

Method: 5-fold cross-validation with STAPLE ensembling; ROI-focused approach. Task 1: 91 T1-weighted arterial contrast-enhanced MRI with pancreas and tumor labels. Task 2: 50 T2-weighted MR-Linac with labels. Metrics: DSC, 5mm DSC, HD95, MASD, RMSE.

Result: Task 1: DSC 0.56, 5mm DSC 0.73, HD95 41.1 mm, MASD 26.0 mm, RMSE 5164 mm. Task 2: DSC 0.33, 5mm DSC 0.50, HD95 20.1 mm, MASD 7.2 mm, RMSE 17203 mm.

Conclusion: MRI-based pancreatic tumor segmentation remains challenging with small datasets and sequence variability; SegResNet shows limited but non-trivial potential; emphasizes need for larger, standardized MRI datasets to improve robustness and clinical utility.

Abstract: Accurate delineation of pancreatic tumors is critical for diagnosis,
treatment planning, and outcome assessment, yet automated segmentation remains
challenging due to anatomical variability and limited dataset availability. In
this study, SegResNet models, as part of the Auto3DSeg architecture, were
trained and evaluated on two MRI-based pancreatic tumor segmentation tasks as
part of the 2025 PANTHER Challenge. Algorithm methodology included 5-fold
cross-validation with STAPLE ensembling after focusing on an anatomically
relevant region-of-interest. The Pancreatic Tumor Segmentation on Diagnostic
MRI task 1 training set included 91 T1-weighted arterial contrast-enhanced MRI
with expert annotated pancreas and tumor labels. The Pancreatic Tumor
Segmentation on MR-Linac task 2 training set used 50 T2-weighted MR-Linac cases
with expert annotated pancreas and tumor labels. Algorithm-automated
segmentation performance of pancreatic tumor was assessed using Dice Similarity
Coefficient (DSC), 5 mm DSC, 95th percentile Hausdorff Distance (HD95), Mean
Average Surface Distance (MASD), and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). For Task 1,
the algorithm achieved a DSC of 0.56, 5 mm DSC of 0.73, HD95 of 41.1 mm, MASD
of 26.0 mm, and RMSE of 5164 mm. For Task 2, performance decreased, with a DSC
of 0.33, 5 mm DSC of 0.50, HD95 of 20.1 mm, MASD of 7.2 mm, and RMSE of 17,203
mm. These findings illustrate the challenges of MRI-based pancreatic tumor
segmentation with small datasets, highlighting variability introduced by
different MRI sequences. Despite modest performance, the results demonstrate
potential for automated delineation and emphasize the need for larger,
standardized MRI datasets to improve model robustness and clinical utility.

### [17] [Reverse Imaging for Wide-spectrum Generalization of Cardiac MRI Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21254)
*Yidong Zhao,Peter Kellman,Hui Xue,Tongyun Yang,Yi Zhang,Yuchi Han,Orlando Simonetti,Qian Tao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduces Reverse Imaging, a physics-driven augmentation and domain adaptation method for cardiac MRI. By inferring underlying spin properties (T1, T2) from images using a diffusion-based spin prior learned from mSASHA maps, it enables synthesis of novel sequences and improves segmentation generalization across diverse imaging protocols.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pretrained cardiac MRI segmentation models fail to generalize across imaging sequences due to large contrast variations driven by protocol changes. Since all MRI contrasts are governed by intrinsic spin properties, leveraging these as latent variables can enable robust domain adaptation.

Method: Formulates an ill-posed nonlinear inverse problem to infer spin properties from observed MR images, regularized by a learned prior over spin maps. A diffusion model is trained on mSASHA T1/T2 maps to provide the spin-prior. The method reconstructs approximate spin properties from images, enabling synthesis of arbitrary, novel sequences for data augmentation and domain adaptation, thereby improving segmentation across protocols.

Result: Demonstrates highly accurate segmentation across vastly different image contrasts and imaging protocols, achieving broad generalization of cardiac MRI segmentation.

Conclusion: A physics-informed, interpretable approach that uses spin-property priors to synthesize diverse MRI contrasts, enabling robust cross-protocol segmentation performance and addressing the generalization gap in cardiac MRI segmentation.

Abstract: Pretrained segmentation models for cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
struggle to generalize across different imaging sequences due to significant
variations in image contrast. These variations arise from changes in imaging
protocols, yet the same fundamental spin properties, including proton density,
T1, and T2 values, govern all acquired images. With this core principle, we
introduce Reverse Imaging, a novel physics-driven method for cardiac MRI data
augmentation and domain adaptation to fundamentally solve the generalization
problem. Our method reversely infers the underlying spin properties from
observed cardiac MRI images, by solving ill-posed nonlinear inverse problems
regularized by the prior distribution of spin properties. We acquire this "spin
prior" by learning a generative diffusion model from the multiparametric
SAturation-recovery single-SHot acquisition sequence (mSASHA) dataset, which
offers joint cardiac T1 and T2 maps. Our method enables approximate but
meaningful spin-property estimates from MR images, which provide an
interpretable "latent variable" that lead to highly flexible image synthesis of
arbitrary novel sequences. We show that Reverse Imaging enables highly accurate
segmentation across vastly different image contrasts and imaging protocols,
realizing wide-spectrum generalization of cardiac MRI segmentation.

### [18] [PHD: Personalized 3D Human Body Fitting with Point Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21257)
*Hsuan-I Ho,Chen Guo,Po-Chen Wu,Ivan Shugurov,Chengcheng Tang,Abhay Mittal,Sizhe An,Manuel Kaufmann,Linguang Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PHD introduces a user-shape conditioned 3D pose prior to personalize and improve 3D human mesh recovery (HMR) from video by decoupling shape calibration from pose fitting. It uses a Point Diffusion Transformer to impose a learnt 3D pose prior via distillation sampling, enabling better 3D accuracy and pelvis-aligned/pelvis-absolute pose accuracy with data-efficient synthetic training, and can be plugged into existing estimators.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional HMR methods are user-agnostic and rely heavily on 2D constraints for pose refinement, which can degrade true 3D accuracy and ignore person-specific body shape and pose plausibility. There is a need for a method that jointly accounts for body shape while fitting 3D poses, especially in video sequences.

Method: 1) Calibrate user-specific body shape first. 2) Learn a shape-conditioned 3D pose prior using a Point Diffusion Transformer. 3) Use a Distillation Sampling loss to guide pose fitting with the prior. 4) Train data-efficiently using synthetic data. 5) Provide a plug-and-play module that can be integrated with existing 3D pose estimators.

Result: The proposed pipeline improves pelvis-aligned pose accuracy and absolute pose accuracy by incorporating a 3D pose prior conditioned on body shape, reducing reliance on 2D constraints, and enabling more robust pose estimation from video. It is data-efficient and configurable as a modular component.

Conclusion: Personalizing 3D pose fitting via a shape-conditioned 3D pose prior can substantially improve 3D HMR performance, offering a data-efficient, plug-in solution that mitigates 2D constraint drawbacks and better respects true 3D body geometry.

Abstract: We introduce PHD, a novel approach for personalized 3D human mesh recovery
(HMR) and body fitting that leverages user-specific shape information to
improve pose estimation accuracy from videos. Traditional HMR methods are
designed to be user-agnostic and optimized for generalization. While these
methods often refine poses using constraints derived from the 2D image to
improve alignment, this process compromises 3D accuracy by failing to jointly
account for person-specific body shapes and the plausibility of 3D poses. In
contrast, our pipeline decouples this process by first calibrating the user's
body shape and then employing a personalized pose fitting process conditioned
on that shape. To achieve this, we develop a body shape-conditioned 3D pose
prior, implemented as a Point Diffusion Transformer, which iteratively guides
the pose fitting via a Point Distillation Sampling loss. This learned 3D pose
prior effectively mitigates errors arising from an over-reliance on 2D
constraints. Consequently, our approach improves not only pelvis-aligned pose
accuracy but also absolute pose accuracy -- an important metric often
overlooked by prior work. Furthermore, our method is highly data-efficient,
requiring only synthetic data for training, and serves as a versatile
plug-and-play module that can be seamlessly integrated with existing 3D pose
estimators to enhance their performance. Project page:

### [19] [Efficient Diffusion-Based 3D Human Pose Estimation with Hierarchical Temporal Pruning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21363)
*Yuquan Bi,Hongsong Wang,Xinli Shi,Zhipeng Gui,Jie Gui,Yuan Yan Tang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Efficient diffusion-based 3D human pose estimation via Hierarchical Temporal Pruning (HTP) that reduces compute while maintaining state-of-the-art accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models offer high-quality 3D pose generation but are computationally expensive due to iterative sampling and multi-hypothesis requirements; pruning redundant pose tokens across time and semantics can cut cost without sacrificing motion dynamics.

Method: A three-stage hierarchical pruning pipeline: (1) Temporal Correlation-Enhanced Pruning (TCEP) identifies essential frames via adaptive temporal graphs based on inter-frame motion; (2) Sparse-Focused Temporal MHSA (SFT MHSA) reduces attention computation by focusing on motion-relevant, sparse frame tokens; (3) Mask-Guided Pose Token Pruner (MGPTP) clusters pose tokens semantically and retains only the most informative ones.

Result: On Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP, HTP reduces training MACs by 38.5%, inference MACs by 56.8%, and speeds up inference by 81.1% on average, while achieving state-of-the-art performance compared with prior diffusion-based methods.

Conclusion: Hierarchical temporal pruning enables substantial compute reductions in diffusion-based 3D pose estimation without compromising performance, advancing practical scalability of diffusion models for 3D human pose tasks.

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated strong capabilities in generating
high-fidelity 3D human poses, yet their iterative nature and multi-hypothesis
requirements incur substantial computational cost. In this paper, we propose an
Efficient Diffusion-Based 3D Human Pose Estimation framework with a
Hierarchical Temporal Pruning (HTP) strategy, which dynamically prunes
redundant pose tokens across both frame and semantic levels while preserving
critical motion dynamics. HTP operates in a staged, top-down manner: (1)
Temporal Correlation-Enhanced Pruning (TCEP) identifies essential frames by
analyzing inter-frame motion correlations through adaptive temporal graph
construction; (2) Sparse-Focused Temporal MHSA (SFT MHSA) leverages the
resulting frame-level sparsity to reduce attention computation, focusing on
motion-relevant tokens; and (3) Mask-Guided Pose Token Pruner (MGPTP) performs
fine-grained semantic pruning via clustering, retaining only the most
informative pose tokens. Experiments on Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP show that
HTP reduces training MACs by 38.5\%, inference MACs by 56.8\%, and improves
inference speed by an average of 81.1\% compared to prior diffusion-based
methods, while achieving state-of-the-art performance.

*Ziwei Liao,Mohamed Sayed,Steven L. Waslander,Sara Vicente,Daniyar Turmukhambetov,Michael Firman*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Single-image 3D completion for Gaussian splat representations using a latent diffusion model, trained in a self-supervised latent space (VAR), to produce faithful and diverse reconstructions that include occluded surfaces for 360-degree renderings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Gaussian splatting struggles with occlusions and unobserved regions due to reliance on dense views; regression-based single-mode outputs cause blur, implausibility, and failure to capture multiple plausible explanations.

Method: A generative framework that learns a distribution of 3D Gaussian-splat scenes conditioned on a single image. Introduces a Variational AutoReconstructor (VAR) to learn a latent space from 2D images in a self-supervised manner, over which a diffusion model is trained. Inference samples from this latent space to reconstruct complete 3D scenes including occluded parts.

Result: Produces faithful reconstructions and diverse samples, with the ability to complete occluded surfaces, enabling high-quality 360-degree renderings.

Conclusion: Shifts from single-mode regression to a generative, multi-modal formulation that leverages self-supervised latent learning and diffusion sampling to complete unseen surfaces and improve 3D scene reconstruction from limited views.

Abstract: Gaussian splatting typically requires dense observations of the scene and can
fail to reconstruct occluded and unobserved areas. We propose a latent
diffusion model to reconstruct a complete 3D scene with Gaussian splats,
including the occluded parts, from only a single image during inference.
Completing the unobserved surfaces of a scene is challenging due to the
ambiguity of the plausible surfaces. Conventional methods use a
regression-based formulation to predict a single "mode" for occluded and
out-of-frustum surfaces, leading to blurriness, implausibility, and failure to
capture multiple possible explanations. Thus, they often address this problem
partially, focusing either on objects isolated from the background,
reconstructing only visible surfaces, or failing to extrapolate far from the
input views. In contrast, we propose a generative formulation to learn a
distribution of 3D representations of Gaussian splats conditioned on a single
input image. To address the lack of ground-truth training data, we propose a
Variational AutoReconstructor to learn a latent space only from 2D images in a
self-supervised manner, over which a diffusion model is trained. Our method
generates faithful reconstructions and diverse samples with the ability to
complete the occluded surfaces for high-quality 360-degree renderings.

*Qingran Miao,Haixia Wang,Haohao Sun,Yilong Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Print2Volume creates realistic synthetic 3D OCT fingerprints from 2D images, enabling pre-training that dramatically improves recognition accuracy (EER 15.62% to 2.50%).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: OCT fingerprint data are scarce due to high acquisition costs and time, hindering data-hungry deep learning. Synthetic data could alleviate dataset scarcity and improve model performance.

Method: A three-stage pipeline: (1) 2D style transfer to convert a 2D binary fingerprint into a grayscale image resembling Z-direction mean-projected OCT scans; (2) a 3D Structure Expansion Network to extrapolate the 2D image into a plausible 3D anatomical volume; (3) an OCT Realism Refiner using a 3D GAN to render realistic textures, speckle noise, and imaging characteristics. Generated a synthetic dataset of 420k samples. Pre-train recognition models on synthetic data and fine-tune on a small real-world dataset.

Result: The synthetic data are of high quality and substantially improve recognition performance, achieving a large reduction in EER on the ZJUT-EIFD benchmark when transferring from synthetic pre-training to real fine-tuning.

Conclusion: Synthetic OCT-based fingerprint generation via Print2Volume effectively mitigates data scarcity and markedly boosts cross-domain recognition performance, demonstrating the value of synthetic data for OCT biometrics.

Abstract: Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) enables the acquisition of
high-resolution, three-dimensional fingerprint data, capturing rich subsurface
structures for robust biometric recognition. However, the high cost and
time-consuming nature of OCT data acquisition have led to a scarcity of
large-scale public datasets, significantly hindering the development of
advanced algorithms, particularly data-hungry deep learning models. To address
this critical bottleneck, this paper introduces Print2Volume, a novel framework
for generating realistic, synthetic OCT-based 3D fingerprints from 2D
fingerprint image. Our framework operates in three sequential stages: (1) a 2D
style transfer module that converts a binary fingerprint into a grayscale
images mimicking the style of a Z-direction mean-projected OCT scan; (2) a 3D
Structure Expansion Network that extrapolates the 2D im-age into a plausible 3D
anatomical volume; and (3) an OCT Realism Refiner, based on a 3D GAN, that
renders the structural volume with authentic textures, speckle noise, and other
imaging characteristics. Using Print2Volume, we generated a large-scale
synthetic dataset of 420,000 samples. Quantitative experiments demonstrate the
high quality of our synthetic data and its significant impact on recognition
performance. By pre-training a recognition model on our synthetic data and
fine-tuning it on a small real-world dataset, we achieved a remarkable
reduction in the Equal Error Rate (EER) from 15.62% to 2.50% on the ZJUT-EIFD
benchmark, proving the effectiveness of our approach in overcoming data
scarcity.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GLENDA is a first-of-its-kind image dataset of gynecologic laparoscopy with region-based endometriosis annotations, aimed at enabling computer vision and ML to assist post-surgical analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual analysis of laparoscopic videos is tedious and time-consuming; there is a scarcity of labeled medical data for ML; endometriosis is a common condition that benefits from automated analysis and documentation.

Method: Creation of the GLENDA dataset from gynecologic laparoscopy videos with region-based annotations of endometriosis, produced in collaboration with leading medical experts to ensure labeling quality and clinical relevance.

Result: A publicly available, expert-annotated image dataset (GLENDA) for endometriosis in gynecologic laparoscopy, claimed to be the first of its kind and intended to facilitate CV/ML research and education.

Conclusion: Providing GLENDA addresses data scarcity and supports development of computer vision tools for post-surgical planning, case documentation, and education in gynecologic laparoscopy.

Abstract: Gynecologic laparoscopy as a type of minimally invasive surgery (MIS) is
performed via a live feed of a patient's abdomen surveying the insertion and
handling of various instruments for conducting treatment. Adopting this kind of
surgical intervention not only facilitates a great variety of treatments, the
possibility of recording said video streams is as well essential for numerous
post-surgical activities, such as treatment planning, case documentation and
education. Nonetheless, the process of manually analyzing surgical recordings,
as it is carried out in current practice, usually proves tediously
time-consuming. In order to improve upon this situation, more sophisticated
computer vision as well as machine learning approaches are actively developed.
Since most of such approaches heavily rely on sample data, which especially in
the medical field is only sparsely available, with this work we publish the
Gynecologic Laparoscopy ENdometriosis DAtaset (GLENDA) - an image dataset
containing region-based annotations of a common medical condition named
endometriosis, i.e. the dislocation of uterine-like tissue. The dataset is the
first of its kind and it has been created in collaboration with leading medical
experts in the field.

*Sabrina Kletz,Klaus Schoeffmann,Jenny Benois-Pineau,Heinrich Husslein*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Region-based FCN enables instrument segmentation and recognition in laparoscopic gynecology videos; segmentation is effective with limited training data, but identifying the exact instrument type remains challenging due to similarity among tools.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automatic content indexing for medical endoscopy videos requires reliable detection and identification of surgical instruments to enable search and analytics in video archives.

Method: Apply a region-based fully convolutional network for instance-aware segmentation and recognition. Evaluate binary instrument segmentation (instrument vs. background) and multi-class instrument recognition on laparoscopic gynecology footage using a relatively small training set.

Result: The model localizes and segments instrument regions with high accuracy, but determining the specific instrument type is difficult because instruments are visually very similar.

Conclusion: Instrument segmentation is feasible with limited data; however robust instrument-type recognition remains a challenge, suggesting a need for better discriminative features or additional cues.

Abstract: Recorded videos from surgeries have become an increasingly important
information source for the field of medical endoscopy, since the recorded
footage shows every single detail of the surgery. However, while video
recording is straightforward these days, automatic content indexing - the basis
for content-based search in a medical video archive - is still a great
challenge due to the very special video content. In this work, we investigate
segmentation and recognition of surgical instruments in videos recorded from
laparoscopic gynecology. More precisely, we evaluate the achievable performance
of segmenting surgical instruments from their background by using a
region-based fully convolutional network for instance-aware (1) instrument
segmentation as well as (2) instrument recognition. While the first part
addresses only binary segmentation of instances (i.e., distinguishing between
instrument or background) we also investigate multi-class instrument
recognition (i.e., identifying the type of instrument). Our evaluation results
show that even with a moderately low number of training examples, we are able
to localize and segment instrument regions with a pretty high accuracy.
However, the results also reveal that determining the particular instrument is
still very challenging, due to the inherently high similarity of surgical
instruments.

TL;DR: SatDINO is a DINO-based self-supervised pretraining framework for satellite imagery; it outperforms MAE-based SOTA methods and offers modular enhancements (GSD encoding and adaptive view sampling) with open-source code.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Remote sensing has abundant unlabeled data; SSL methods like DINO can learn rich representations, but satellite imagery poses unique challenges. There is a need to tailor SSL to RS data and to compare against MAE baselines.

Method: Propose SatDINO, a DINO-based SSL model for satellite imagery. Introduce enhancements: GSD encoding and adaptive view sampling. Perform extensive ablations and experiments across multiple RS datasets and testing setups. Release code and models.

Result: SatDINO surpasses MAE-based state-of-the-art methods and achieves competitive performance on benchmarks. Ablation studies confirm contributions of proposed components. Enhancements are modular and can be used independently.

Conclusion: SatDINO is an effective, modular framework for RS representation learning, with practical enhancements and open-source availability; it advances SSL for satellite imagery and provides a reusable toolkit.

Abstract: Self-supervised learning has emerged as a powerful tool for remote sensing,
where large amounts of unlabeled data are available. In this work, we
investigate the use of DINO, a contrastive self-supervised method, for
pretraining on remote sensing imagery. We introduce SatDINO, a model tailored
for representation learning in satellite imagery. Through extensive experiments
on multiple datasets in multiple testing setups, we demonstrate that SatDINO
outperforms other state-of-the-art methods based on much more common masked
autoencoders (MAE) and achieves competitive results in multiple benchmarks.
  We also provide a rigorous ablation study evaluating SatDINO's individual
components. Finally, we propose a few novel enhancements, such as a new way to
incorporate ground sample distance (GSD) encoding and adaptive view sampling.
These enhancements can be used independently on our SatDINO model. Our code and

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A framework to generate a 2D index map for WSIs and a three-layer tissue map (source, tissue type, pathological alterations) to enable interoperable metadata, aiding dataset curation and AI development.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Lack of standardized metadata for Whole Slide Images hampers large-scale cohort assembly, reproducibility, and efficient ML development; manual inspection is infeasible for millions of objects.

Method: Proposes a general framework to produce a 2D index map and a tissue profiling mechanism; defines a three-layer tissue map. Demonstrates interoperability by applying common syntax/semantics in clinical pathology and shows applicability to WSI catalogs, ML pipelines, and graph-based representations.

Result: Augments WSI collections with detailed tissue maps enabling fine-grained content annotation and interoperability across catalogs; supports improved dataset selection for ML and integration with graph-based representations; validated through domain-specific examples.

Conclusion: The framework offers a practical, extensible standard for WSI metadata that facilitates interoperable catalogs and scalable AI-driven analysis in pathology and related fields.

Abstract: A Whole Slide Image (WSI) is a high-resolution digital image created by
scanning an entire glass slide containing a biological specimen, such as tissue
sections or cell samples, at multiple magnifications. These images can be
viewed, analyzed, shared digitally, and are used today for Artificial
Intelligence (AI) algorithm development. WSIs are used in a variety of fields,
including pathology for diagnosing diseases and oncology for cancer research.
They are also utilized in neurology, veterinary medicine, hematology,
microbiology, dermatology, pharmacology, toxicology, immunology, and forensic
science.
  When assembling cohorts for the training or validation of an AI algorithm, it
is essential to know what is present on such a WSI. However, there is currently
no standard for this metadata, so such selection has mainly been done through
manual inspection, which is not suitable for large collections with several
million objects.
  We propose a general framework to generate a 2D index map for WSI and a
profiling mechanism for specific application domains. We demonstrate this
approach in the field of clinical pathology, using common syntax and semantics
to achieve interoperability between different catalogs.
  Our approach augments each WSI collection with a detailed tissue map that
provides fine-grained information about the WSI content. The tissue map is
organized into three layers: source, tissue type, and pathological alterations,
with each layer assigning segments of the WSI to specific classes.
  We illustrate the advantages and applicability of the proposed standard
through specific examples in WSI catalogs, Machine Learning (ML), and
graph-based WSI representations.

### [26] [Unsupervised Incremental Learning Using Confidence-Based Pseudo-Labels](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21424)
*Lucas Rakotoarivony*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ICPL is an unsupervised incremental learning method that uses confidence-based pseudo-labels to enable class-incremental learning from unlabeled data; it integrates pseudo-labels into existing CIL methods, optimized via confidence selection, and evaluated on CIFAR100, ImageNet100, and fine-grained datasets. It achieves competitive results vs supervised CIL and outperforms state-of-the-art class-iNCD methods by over 5% in final accuracy, with consideration of computational complexity for resource-constrained settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In real-world deployment, incremental data often arrives unlabeled, making the common assumption of fully labeled incremental datasets impractical. There is a need for unsupervised or weakly supervised CIL methods that can leverage unlabeled data to learn new classes while preserving previously learned knowledge.

Method: Propose ICPL, which generates confidence-based pseudo-labels for unlabeled data and integrates them into various CIL frameworks. The method uses confidence thresholds to select reliable pseudo-labels, enabling incremental updates without human annotations. The approach is evaluated on CIFAR100 and ImageNet100, compared against class-iNCD methods, and extended to fine-grained datasets. Computational complexity is analyzed to assess suitability for resource-constrained environments.

Result: ICPL achieves competitive performance relative to supervised CIL methods and surpasses state-of-the-art class-iNCD methods by more than 5% in final accuracy. The method remains effective on fine-grained datasets and demonstrates feasible computational costs for constrained environments.

Conclusion: ICPL provides a practical pathway to unsupervised incremental learning, reducing labeling requirements while maintaining strong accuracy. Its confidence-based pseudo-labeling offers a robust mechanism to leverage unlabeled data across diverse datasets. Potential limitations include dependency on reliable confidence estimation and possible degradation if pseudo-label quality is poor; future work may focus on improving calibration and exploring other pseudo-labeling strategies.

Abstract: Deep learning models have achieved state-of-the-art performance in many
computer vision tasks. However, in real-world scenarios, novel classes that
were unseen during training often emerge, requiring models to acquire new
knowledge incrementally. Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) methods enable a
model to learn novel classes while retaining knowledge of previous classes.
However, these methods make the strong assumption that the incremental dataset
is fully labeled, which is unrealistic in practice. In this work, we propose an
unsupervised Incremental Learning method using Confidence-based Pseudo-labels
(ICPL), which replaces human annotations with pseudo-labels, enabling
incremental learning from unlabeled datasets. We integrate these pseudo-labels
into various CIL methods with confidence-based selection and evaluate
performance degradation on CIFAR100 and ImageNet100. Then, we compare our
approach to popular Class Incremental Novel Category Discovery (class-iNCD)
methods addressing similar challenges. Additionally, we apply our method to
fine-grained datasets to demonstrate its real-world practicality and measure
its computational complexity to validate its suitability for
resource-constrained environments. ICPL achieves competitive results compared
to supervised methods and outperforms state-of-the-art class-iNCD methods by
more than 5% in final accuracy.

### [27] [MedShift: Implicit Conditional Transport for X-Ray Domain Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21435)
*Francisco Caetano,Christiaan Viviers,Peter H. H. de With,Fons van der Sommen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MedShift is a unified, class-conditional flow-based model enabling unpaired cross-domain translation between synthetic and real skull X-rays, using Flow Matching and Schrödinger Bridges. It operates across multiple domains with a shared latent space and tunable inference, paired with X-DigiSkull (a synthetic-real aligned skull X-ray dataset). It claims smaller model size than diffusion-based methods, strong performance, and adaptable fidelity/structure trade-offs for scalable domain adaptation; code and data are released.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Domain gaps between synthetic and real medical images hinder generalization to clinical settings. Cross-domain translation is needed to bridge attenuation behavior, noise, and soft-tissue representation, without requiring paired data, and to support multi-domain translation.

Method: MedShift is a unified class-conditional generator based on Flow Matching and Schrödinger Bridges. It learns a shared domain-agnostic latent space and supports translation between any pair of domains observed during training. It operates in an unpaired setting, supports multiple domain pairs, and allows inference-time tuning to prioritize perceptual fidelity or structural consistency. X-DigiSkull is introduced as a dataset of aligned synthetic and real skull X-rays at varying doses to benchmark domain translation.

Result: Experiments show that MedShift achieves strong performance with a smaller model size compared to diffusion-based approaches, while offering flexibility at inference time. The method provides effective cross-domain translation and demonstrates generalization across the supplied domains and varying radiation doses.

Conclusion: MedShift presents a scalable and generalizable solution for domain adaptation in medical imaging by enabling unpaired, multi-domain translation between synthetic and real skull X-rays. The accompanying X-DigiSkull dataset facilitates benchmarking, and the work emphasizes tunable trade-offs between perceptual quality and structural fidelity. The code and dataset are publicly available.

Abstract: Synthetic medical data offers a scalable solution for training robust models,
but significant domain gaps limit its generalizability to real-world clinical
settings. This paper addresses the challenge of cross-domain translation
between synthetic and real X-ray images of the head, focusing on bridging
discrepancies in attenuation behavior, noise characteristics, and soft tissue
representation. We propose MedShift, a unified class-conditional generative
model based on Flow Matching and Schrodinger Bridges, which enables
high-fidelity, unpaired image translation across multiple domains. Unlike prior
approaches that require domain-specific training or rely on paired data,
MedShift learns a shared domain-agnostic latent space and supports seamless
translation between any pair of domains seen during training. We introduce
X-DigiSkull, a new dataset comprising aligned synthetic and real skull X-rays
under varying radiation doses, to benchmark domain translation models.
Experimental results demonstrate that, despite its smaller model size compared
to diffusion-based approaches, MedShift offers strong performance and remains
flexible at inference time, as it can be tuned to prioritize either perceptual
fidelity or structural consistency, making it a scalable and generalizable
solution for domain adaptation in medical imaging. The code and dataset are
available at https://caetas.github.io/medshift.html

### [28] [Trees as Gaussians: Large-Scale Individual Tree Mapping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21437)
*Dimitri Gominski,Martin Brandt,Xiaoye Tong,Siyu Liu,Maurice Mugabowindekwe,Sizhuo Li,Florian Reiner,Andrew Davies,Rasmus Fensholt*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Global-scale detection of large individual trees in 3-m PlanetScope imagery using a deep-learning model trained on lidar-simulated crowns; yields crown centers and binary tree cover maps, with R^2 = 0.81 against aerial lidar and robust performance across biomes; scalable and adaptable to future satellite imagery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a gap between existing global products that either provide binary canopy cover or canopy height and the need to identify individual trees. Accurate, large-scale, tree-level mapping is important for ecosystem function, climate regulation, and the bioeconomy, but current methods struggle to detect individual trees globally and inside/outside forests.

Method: Generate scalable Gaussian-crown simulations to represent tree crowns; train a deep-learning detector on billions of lidar-derived points; extract crown centers and create binary tree-cover maps from 3-m PlanetScope imagery; apply cross-domain validation against airborne lidar and existing tree-cover products; compare with state-of-the-art methods; demonstrate improvements via fine-tuning with manual labels; discuss adaptability to future higher-resolution imagery from new satellites.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance (fractional cover R^2 = 0.81 against aerial lidar); balanced detection metrics across biomes; detects trees both inside and outside forests; robust against existing tree-cover products; performance improves with manual-label fine-tuning; scalable framework for global, high-resolution tree monitoring.

Conclusion: Proposes a scalable, global framework for identifying individual trees at high resolution, enabling improved forest monitoring, ecosystem services assessment, and bioeconomic applications; adaptable to future satellite missions offering improved imagery.

Abstract: Trees are key components of the terrestrial biosphere, playing vital roles in
ecosystem function, climate regulation, and the bioeconomy. However,
large-scale monitoring of individual trees remains limited by inadequate
modelling. Available global products have focused on binary tree cover or
canopy height, which do not explicitely identify trees at individual level. In
this study, we present a deep learning approach for detecting large individual
trees in 3-m resolution PlanetScope imagery at a global scale. We simulate tree
crowns with Gaussian kernels of scalable size, allowing the extraction of crown
centers and the generation of binary tree cover maps. Training is based on
billions of points automatically extracted from airborne lidar data, enabling
the model to successfully identify trees both inside and outside forests. We
compare against existing tree cover maps and airborne lidar with
state-of-the-art performance (fractional cover R$^2 = 0.81$ against aerial
lidar), report balanced detection metrics across biomes, and demonstrate how
detection can be further improved through fine-tuning with manual labels. Our
method offers a scalable framework for global, high-resolution tree monitoring,
and is adaptable to future satellite missions offering improved imagery.

*Jiayu Yang,Weijian Su,Songqian Zhang,Yuqi Han,Jinli Suo,Qiang Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A scalable Gaussian Splatting framework (M) for dynamic/streaming scenes that organizes Gaussians hierarchically by scale, uses hybrid deformation and spawning for motion, and applies bidirectional adaptive masking to speed up training, achieving better visual quality with faster training than state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) enables high-fidelity real-time rendering, but extending it to dynamic scenes suffers from massive data volumes of dense Gaussians and long per-frame training times. There is a need for scalable, efficient training for streaming dynamic scenes.

Method: Gaussians are organized hierarchically by scale in an anchor-based structure. Coarser-level Gaussians capture low-resolution scene structure, while finer Gaussians responsible for detail are selectively activated by coarser Gaussians. A hybrid deformation and spawning strategy models inter-frame motion: Gaussian deformation for motion and spawning to cover wide-range motion. A bidirectional adaptive masking mechanism removes static regions and prioritizes informative viewpoints to improve training efficiency.

Result: Extensive experiments show superior visual quality and significantly reduced training time compared with state-of-the-art methods for dynamic 3D Gaussian Splatting.

Conclusion: The proposed hierarchical, motion-aware, and masking-driven framework enables scalable, efficient training for dynamic scenes in 3DGS, delivering high-quality rendering with lower training costs suitable for streaming and real-time applications.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) enables high-fidelity real-time rendering, a key
requirement for immersive applications. However, the extension of 3DGS to
dynamic scenes remains limitations on the substantial data volume of dense
Gaussians and the prolonged training time required for each frame. This paper
presents \M, a scalable Gaussian Splatting framework designed for efficient
training in streaming tasks. Specifically, Gaussian spheres are hierarchically
organized by scale within an anchor-based structure. Coarser-level Gaussians
represent the low-resolution structure of the scene, while finer-level
Gaussians, responsible for detailed high-fidelity rendering, are selectively
activated by the coarser-level Gaussians. To further reduce computational
overhead, we introduce a hybrid deformation and spawning strategy that models
motion of inter-frame through Gaussian deformation and triggers Gaussian
spawning to characterize wide-range motion. Additionally, a bidirectional
adaptive masking mechanism enhances training efficiency by removing static
regions and prioritizing informative viewpoints. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that \M~ achieves superior visual quality while significantly
reducing training time compared to state-of-the-art methods.

### [30] [One More Glance with Sharp Eyes: Rethinking Lightweight Captioning as a Practical Visual Specialist](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21451)
*Junha Song,Yongsik Jo,So Yeon Min,Quanting Xie,Taehwan Kim,Yonatan Bisk,Jaegul Choo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A 125M-parameter visual captioning specialist can rival large MLLMs on caption tasks and enable on-device use, aided by Sharp-Eyed Refinement and DeepLens to improve visual grounding. Visual blindness and attention limitations remain challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deploying image captioning on local devices is hard due to the heavy compute of multimodal LLMs. A lightweight, specialized model could deliver competitive performance with much lower resource requirements, enabling on-device applications like instruction systems and robots.

Method: Build a specialist model with 125M parameters (≈56× smaller than LLaMA-7B). Evaluate on single-sentence and detailed captioning tasks, and compare to large multimodal generalists. Diagnose failure modes via toy experiments focusing on attention and visual representations. Propose Sharp-Eyed Refinement, with DeepLens extracting detailed visual representations by concentrating on informative regions flagged during an initial glance, to improve grounding.

Result: The specialist achieves performance comparable to large multimodal generalists on captioning tasks. The Sharp-Eyed Refinement framework and DeepLens improve caption quality and visual grounding, outperforming prior small-captioning models and rivaling large generalists. This demonstrates strong potential for on-device captioning.

Conclusion: Lightweight vision-language specialists can closely match large MLLMs for captioning and, with targeted grounding improvements, enable effective on-device use. Nonetheless, visual blindness and limitations in attention mechanisms and visual representations remain areas for further refinement.

Abstract: Image captioning is fundamental for applications like video instruction
systems and exploration robots, yet deploying such models on local devices is
challenging due to the high computational demands of multimodal large language
models (MLLMs). To address this, we first explore lightweight captioning by
implementing a specialist based on a 125M-parameter language model, 56 times
smaller than LLaMA-7B, and evaluating its performance on both single-sentence
and detailed captioning tasks. Surprisingly, we find that our model can achieve
performance comparable to large multimodal generalists, suggesting its
potential to serve as a strong visual specialist for on-device applications.
While promising, our model also exhibits a limitation: like other MLLMs, it
suffers from visual blindness, occasionally resulting in semantic captioning
errors. We carry out toy experiments and investigate the underlying causes,
where we observe that the problems arise from ineffective attention mechanisms
and limited visual representations. To alleviate them, we develop a novel
captioning framework, Sharp-Eyed Refinement, which enhances caption quality
through improved visual grounding. At its core, our DeepLens extracts detailed
visual representations by concentrating on informative regions identified
during the initial glance. Our experiments confirm both the advantages of our
specialist over prior small captioning models and large generalists and the
effectiveness of our framework.

*Kaouther Mouheb,Marawan Elbatel,Janne Papma,Geert Jan Biessels,Jurgen Claassen,Huub Middelkoop,Barbara van Munster,Wiesje van der Flier,Inez Ramakers,Stefan Klein,Esther E. Bron*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: In federated tuning of foundation models for brain MRI dementia diagnosis, the choice of classification head, whether to fine-tune or freeze the encoder, and the aggregation method crucially shape performance and efficiency; freezing the encoder can match full fine-tuning, and advanced aggregation outperforms FedAvg.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how key design choices in federated tuning of foundation models affect performance and efficiency for dementia diagnosis from MRI data.

Method: Systematic benchmarking on a large multi-cohort brain MRI dataset, varying (i) the architecture of the classification head, (ii) the fine-tuning strategy (full fine-tuning vs encoder freezing), and (iii) the aggregation method, then evaluating performance and efficiency metrics.

Result: Classification-head architecture substantially influences performance; freezing the foundation model encoder achieves comparable results to full fine-tuning; advanced aggregation methods outperform standard Federated Averaging (FedAvg).

Conclusion: The study offers practical guidelines for deploying foundation models in decentralized clinical settings, highlighting trade-offs between accuracy, computational cost, and communication efficiency to inform future method development.

Abstract: While foundation models (FMs) offer strong potential for AI-based dementia
diagnosis, their integration into federated learning (FL) systems remains
underexplored. In this benchmarking study, we systematically evaluate the
impact of key design choices: classification head architecture, fine-tuning
strategy, and aggregation method, on the performance and efficiency of
federated FM tuning using brain MRI data. Using a large multi-cohort dataset,
we find that the architecture of the classification head substantially
influences performance, freezing the FM encoder achieves comparable results to
full fine-tuning, and advanced aggregation methods outperform standard
federated averaging. Our results offer practical insights for deploying FMs in
decentralized clinical settings and highlight trade-offs that should guide
future method development.

### [32] [Multi-Method Ensemble for Out-of-Distribution Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21463)
*Lucas Rakotoarivony*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Multi-Method Ensemble (MME) score that unifies state-of-the-art OOD detectors by combining feature truncation with aggregated scoring functions, achieving superior detection across benchmarks (ImageNet-1K with BiT: FPR95 27.57%, +6% over the previous best).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) samples is crucial for neural networks in open-world settings. Existing methods often focus on a single technique or dataset, missing potential gains from combining multiple approaches. A unified ensemble could improve robustness across diverse OOD scenarios.

Method: The authors provide theoretical and empirical evidence that state-of-the-art feature truncation and scoring functions can be effectively combined. They aggregate multiple scoring functions to form the Multi-Method Ensemble (MME) score, unifying several OOD detectors into a single, more effective detector. They validate the approach with extensive experiments on both large-scale and small-scale benchmarks, including near- and far-OOD cases, using models such as BiT.

Result: MME significantly outperforms recent state-of-the-art methods across all benchmarks. On ImageNet-1K with the BiT model, it achieves an average FPR95 of 27.57%, improving the best existing baseline by about 6%.

Conclusion: A unified ensemble that combines feature truncation with multiple scoring-function aggregations yields robust, superior OOD detection across diverse datasets and OOD regimes, demonstrating practical effectiveness with strong empirical gains.

Abstract: Detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) samples is essential for neural networks
operating in open-world settings, particularly in safety-critical applications.
Existing methods have improved OOD detection by leveraging two main techniques:
feature truncation, which increases the separation between in-distribution (ID)
and OOD samples, and scoring functions, which assign scores to distinguish
between ID and OOD data. However, most approaches either focus on a single
family of techniques or evaluate their effectiveness on a specific type of OOD
dataset, overlooking the potential of combining multiple existing solutions.
Motivated by this observation, we theoretically and empirically demonstrate
that state-of-the-art feature truncation and scoring functions can be
effectively combined. Moreover, we show that aggregating multiple scoring
functions enhances robustness against various types of OOD samples. Based on
these insights, we propose the Multi-Method Ensemble (MME) score, which unifies
state-of-the-art OOD detectors into a single, more effective scoring function.
Extensive experiments on both large-scale and small-scale benchmarks, covering
near-OOD and far-OOD scenarios, show that MME significantly outperforms recent
state-of-the-art methods across all benchmarks. Notably, using the BiT model,
our method achieves an average FPR95 of 27.57% on the challenging ImageNet-1K
benchmark, improving performance by 6% over the best existing baseline.

### [33] [Adversarial Patch Attack for Ship Detection via Localized Augmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21472)
*Chun Liu,Panpan Ding,Zheng Zheng,Hailong Wang,Bingqian Zhu,Tao Xu,Zhigang Han,Jiayao Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Localized background augmentation targeted to patch area improves adversarial patch transferability and success rate in ship detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DNN-based ship detectors in remote sensing are vulnerable to adversarial patches; standard augmentation can transfer poorly and background-heavy augmentation may introduce false detections, hindering attack effectiveness.

Method: Introduce a localized augmentation strategy that applies augmentation only to the adversarial patch region during patch-perturbation generation, preserving non-target/background areas.

Result: On HRSC2016, the method increases attack success rate and transferability of adversarial patches, while reducing background-induced errors compared to non-localized augmentation.

Conclusion: Localized, region-specific augmentation effectively concentrates optimization on the patch, boosting adversarial efficacy and transferability in ship-detection attacks without perturbing non-target areas.

Abstract: Current ship detection techniques based on remote sensing imagery primarily
rely on the object detection capabilities of deep neural networks (DNNs).
However, DNNs are vulnerable to adversarial patch attacks, which can lead to
misclassification by the detection model or complete evasion of the targets.
Numerous studies have demonstrated that data transformation-based methods can
improve the transferability of adversarial examples. However, excessive
augmentation of image backgrounds or irrelevant regions may introduce
unnecessary interference, resulting in false detections of the object detection
model. These errors are not caused by the adversarial patches themselves but
rather by the over-augmentation of background and non-target areas. This paper
proposes a localized augmentation method that applies augmentation only to the
target regions, avoiding any influence on non-target areas. By reducing
background interference, this approach enables the loss function to focus more
directly on the impact of the adversarial patch on the detection model, thereby
improving the attack success rate. Experiments conducted on the HRSC2016
dataset demonstrate that the proposed method effectively increases the success
rate of adversarial patch attacks and enhances their transferability.

### [34] [ELV-Halluc: Benchmarking Semantic Aggregation Hallucinations in Long Video Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21496)
*Hao Lu,Jiahao Wang,Yaolun Zhang,Ruohui Wang,Xuanyu Zheng,Yepeng Tang,Dahua Lin,Lewei Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: We introduce ELV-Halluc, a benchmark for long-video hallucination focusing on Semantic Aggregation Hallucination (SAH); we confirm SAH exists, grows with semantic complexity, and propose mitigations via positional encoding and DPO; a dataset of 8k adversarial pairs yields improvements including 27.7% reduction in SAH ratio.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video-LLMs suffer from hallucinations; long videos introduce semantic aggregation errors (SAH) not captured by short-video benchmarks; need systematic evaluation and mitigation targeting aggregation across events.

Method: Create ELV-Halluc benchmark for long videos; define SAH; curate 8k adversarial data pairs; run experiments to measure SAH and effects of semantic complexity and rapid semantics; test mitigations using positional encoding strategy and DPO; evaluate on ELV-Halluc and Video-MME.

Result: SAH exists and increases with semantic complexity; rapid-changing semantics worsen SAH; positional encoding reduces SAH; DPO enhances semantic distinction; dataset improvements show substantial SAH reductions (including 27.7%).

Conclusion: Long-video SAH is a distinct challenge; targeted strategies during encoding and policy optimization can mitigate it; ELV-Halluc provides a platform to study and reduce SAH; results show promising improvements and call for further research.

Abstract: Video multimodal large language models (Video-MLLMs) have achieved remarkable
progress in video understanding. However, they remain vulnerable to
hallucination-producing content inconsistent with or unrelated to video inputs.
Previous video hallucination benchmarks primarily focus on short-videos. They
attribute hallucinations to factors such as strong language priors, missing
frames, or vision-language biases introduced by the visual encoder. While these
causes indeed account for most hallucinations in short videos, they still
oversimplify the cause of hallucinations. Sometimes, models generate incorrect
outputs but with correct frame-level semantics. We refer to this type of
hallucination as Semantic Aggregation Hallucination (SAH), which arises during
the process of aggregating frame-level semantics into event-level semantic
groups. Given that SAH becomes particularly critical in long videos due to
increased semantic complexity across multiple events, it is essential to
separate and thoroughly investigate the causes of this type of hallucination.
To address the above issues, we introduce ELV-Halluc, the first benchmark
dedicated to long-video hallucination, enabling a systematic investigation of
SAH. Our experiments confirm the existence of SAH and show that it increases
with semantic complexity. Additionally, we find that models are more prone to
SAH on rapidly changing semantics. Moreover, we discuss potential approaches to
mitigate SAH. We demonstrate that positional encoding strategy contributes to
alleviating SAH, and further adopt DPO strategy to enhance the model's ability
to distinguish semantics within and across events. To support this, we curate a
dataset of 8K adversarial data pairs and achieve improvements on both
ELV-Halluc and Video-MME, including a substantial 27.7% reduction in SAH ratio.

*Ronan Docherty,Antonis Vamvakeros,Samuel J. Cooper*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Upsampling low-resolution foundation-model features with a CNN enables fast, high-quality interactive segmentation of large micrographs with fewer labels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Patch-based foundation features miss fine microstructural details and struggle with large image sizes in materials/biological images; a method is needed to recover fine detail efficiently for downstream tasks.

Method: Train a CNN to upsample low-resolution (large patch size) foundation model features using reference to the input image, then apply this upsampler without further training to featurize and segment various microscopy images.

Result: Upsampled features enable separation of hard-to-segment phases (e.g., hairline cracks); interactive segmentation using these deep features yields high-quality results much faster and with far fewer labels than training/finetuning a traditional CNN.

Conclusion: The proposed upsampling of foundation-model features provides an efficient, label-light path to accurate segmentation of large microscopy images by leveraging rich semantic descriptors from vision transformers.

Abstract: Feature foundation models - usually vision transformers - offer rich semantic
descriptors of images, useful for downstream tasks such as (interactive)
segmentation and object detection. For computational efficiency these
descriptors are often patch-based, and so struggle to represent the fine
features often present in micrographs; they also struggle with the large image
sizes present in materials and biological image analysis. In this work, we
train a convolutional neural network to upsample low-resolution (i.e, large
patch size) foundation model features with reference to the input image. We
apply this upsampler network (without any further training) to efficiently
featurise and then segment a variety of microscopy images, including plant
cells, a lithium-ion battery cathode and organic crystals. The richness of
these upsampled features admits separation of hard to segment phases, like
hairline cracks. We demonstrate that interactive segmentation with these deep
features produces high-quality segmentations far faster and with far fewer
labels than training or finetuning a more traditional convolutional network.

### [36] [HCCM: Hierarchical Cross-Granularity Contrastive and Matching Learning for Natural Language-Guided Drones](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21539)
*Hao Ruan,Jinliang Lin,Yingxin Lai,Zhiming Luo,Shaozi Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes HCCM, a hierarchical cross-granularity framework for natural language-guided drones that jointly learns region-level and global alignment and matching, with a momentum-based distillation mechanism to handle incomplete descriptions. Shows state-of-the-art and strong zero-shot results on GeoText-1652 and ERA datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenges in vision-language understanding for drones with wide FOV and compositional semantics: global VLMs lack fine-grained semantics, and hierarchical methods rely on precise partitioning, which under dynamic environments may fail.

Method: Introduce RG-ITC (Region-Global Image-Text Contrastive Learning) to contrast local visual regions with global text and vice versa, and RG-ITM (Region-Global Image-Text Matching) to evaluate local semantic consistency within global representations. Employ a Momentum Contrast and Distillation (MCD) mechanism to improve robustness against incomplete/ambiguous drone descriptions.

Result: On GeoText-1652, achieves Recall@1: 28.8% for image retrieval and 14.7% for text retrieval. On ERA (unseen) dataset, achieves 39.93% mean recall (mR) in zero-shot, outperforming fine-tuned baselines.

Conclusion: HCCM enhances fine-grained cross-modal understanding and compositional reasoning for NLGD, offering robustness to ambiguous descriptions and strong zero-shot generalization, with practical improvements on real drone benchmarks.

Abstract: Natural Language-Guided Drones (NLGD) provide a novel paradigm for tasks such
as target matching and navigation. However, the wide field of view and complex
compositional semantics in drone scenarios pose challenges for vision-language
understanding. Mainstream Vision-Language Models (VLMs) emphasize global
alignment while lacking fine-grained semantics, and existing hierarchical
methods depend on precise entity partitioning and strict containment, limiting
effectiveness in dynamic environments. To address this, we propose the
Hierarchical Cross-Granularity Contrastive and Matching learning (HCCM)
framework with two components: (1) Region-Global Image-Text Contrastive
Learning (RG-ITC), which avoids precise scene partitioning and captures
hierarchical local-to-global semantics by contrasting local visual regions with
global text and vice versa; (2) Region-Global Image-Text Matching (RG-ITM),
which dispenses with rigid constraints and instead evaluates local semantic
consistency within global cross-modal representations, enhancing compositional
reasoning. Moreover, drone text descriptions are often incomplete or ambiguous,
destabilizing alignment. HCCM introduces a Momentum Contrast and Distillation
(MCD) mechanism to improve robustness. Experiments on GeoText-1652 show HCCM
achieves state-of-the-art Recall@1 of 28.8% (image retrieval) and 14.7% (text

generalization with 39.93% mean recall (mR), outperforming fine-tuned

### [37] [EZ-Sort: Efficient Pairwise Comparison via Zero-Shot CLIP-Based Pre-Ordering and Human-in-the-Loop Sorting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21550)
*Yujin Park,Haejun Chung,Ikbeom Jang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EZ-Sort combines zero-shot CLIP pre-ordering with uncertainty-guided, bucket-aware Elo ranking and MergeSort to reduce annotation cost in pairwise ranking, achieving large savings while preserving reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pairwise comparisons are more reliable for subjective tasks but scale poorly; prior work reduces burden to O(n log n) with active sampling; there is potential to further reduce human labor by leveraging CLIP priors and automated comparisons.

Method: 1) CLIP-based zero-shot pre-ordering to roughly organize items without training; 2) initialize bucket-aware Elo scores; 3) apply uncertainty-guided human-in-the-loop MergeSort; replace easy comparisons with automated ones; validation on FGNET (face age), DHCI (historical chronology), EyePACS (retinal image quality).

Result: Annotation cost reduced by 90.5% vs exhaustive and by 19.8% vs prior work at n=100; inter-rater reliability is maintained or improved.

Conclusion: Combining CLIP priors with uncertainty-aware sampling yields an efficient, scalable solution for pairwise ranking.

Abstract: Pairwise comparison is often favored over absolute rating or ordinal
classification in subjective or difficult annotation tasks due to its improved
reliability. However, exhaustive comparisons require a massive number of
annotations (O(n^2)). Recent work has greatly reduced the annotation burden
(O(n log n)) by actively sampling pairwise comparisons using a sorting
algorithm. We further improve annotation efficiency by (1) roughly pre-ordering
items using the Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) model
hierarchically without training, and (2) replacing easy, obvious human
comparisons with automated comparisons. The proposed EZ-Sort first produces a
CLIP-based zero-shot pre-ordering, then initializes bucket-aware Elo scores,
and finally runs an uncertainty-guided human-in-the-loop MergeSort. Validation
was conducted using various datasets: face-age estimation (FGNET), historical
image chronology (DHCI), and retinal image quality assessment (EyePACS). It
showed that EZ-Sort reduced human annotation cost by 90.5% compared to
exhaustive pairwise comparisons and by 19.8% compared to prior work (when n =
100), while improving or maintaining inter-rater reliability. These results
demonstrate that combining CLIP-based priors with uncertainty-aware sampling
yields an efficient and scalable solution for pairwise ranking.

### [38] [ECHO: Ego-Centric modeling of Human-Object interactions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21556)
*Ilya A. Petrov,Vladimir Guzov,Riccardo Marin,Emre Aksan,Xu Chen,Daniel Cremers,Thabo Beeler,Gerard Pons-Moll*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ECHO: a diffusion-transformer framework that reconstructs human pose, object motion, and contact from head-and-wrist data in egocentric settings, using a three-variate diffusion process and conveyor-based inference to handle sequences of any length, achieving state-of-the-art in egocentric HOI reconstruction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enable rich egocentric human-object interaction understanding from minimal wearable sensing, addressing the gap in reconstructing multiple coupled modalities from head/wrist cues.

Method: Diffusion Transformer with a three-variate diffusion process for pose, object trajectory, and contact; operates in a head-centric canonical space; conveyor-based progressive diffusion timestamp; flexible input configurations; handles sequences of arbitrary length.

Result: Empirically outperforms non-flexible baselines; achieves state-of-the-art in egocentric HOI reconstruction; robust to global orientation.

Conclusion: Introduces a unified, robust framework capable of recovering three coupled HOI modalities from minimal egocentric observations, advancing wearable-based interaction understanding; potential impact on AR/VR wearables and assistive tech.

Abstract: Modeling human-object interactions (HOI) from an egocentric perspective is a
largely unexplored yet important problem due to the increasing adoption of
wearable devices, such as smart glasses and watches. We investigate how much
information about interaction can be recovered from only head and wrists
tracking. Our answer is ECHO (Ego-Centric modeling of Human-Object
interactions), which, for the first time, proposes a unified framework to
recover three modalities: human pose, object motion, and contact from such
minimal observation. ECHO employs a Diffusion Transformer architecture and a
unique three-variate diffusion process, which jointly models human motion,
object trajectory, and contact sequence, allowing for flexible input
configurations. Our method operates in a head-centric canonical space,
enhancing robustness to global orientation. We propose a conveyor-based
inference, which progressively increases the diffusion timestamp with the frame
position, allowing us to process sequences of any length. Through extensive
evaluation, we demonstrate that ECHO outperforms existing methods that do not
offer the same flexibility, setting a state-of-the-art in egocentric HOI
reconstruction.

*Juneyoung Ro,Namwoo Kim,Yoonjin Yoon*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Evaluates three off-the-shelf VLMs (BLIP-2, InstructBLIP, LLaVA-1.5) on urban spatial reasoning; zero-shot performance is reasonable, but fine-tuning on a synthetic, CoT-guided urban VQA dataset (constructed from street-view segmentation/depth/detection) substantially improves results, especially for negation and counterfactuals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Urban-domain spatial reasoning is underexplored for VLMs; assess transfer from general scenes and develop adaptation via synthetic, step-by-step supervision.

Method: Zero-shot evaluation of three VLMs; create urban-specific VQA dataset from segmentation, depth, and object detection outputs; generate Chain-of-Thought answers with an LLM; fine-tune models with this CoT-supervised data.

Result: VLMs perform reasonably in zero-shot; fine-tuning with synthetic CoT data yields substantial performance gains, notably on challenging question types like negation and counterfactuals.

Conclusion: Urban spatial reasoning constitutes a new challenge for VLMs; synthetic dataset construction is a practical approach to adapting general models to specialized domains.

Abstract: Effectively understanding urban scenes requires fine-grained spatial
reasoning about objects, layouts, and depth cues. However, how well current
vision-language models (VLMs), pretrained on general scenes, transfer these
abilities to urban domain remains underexplored. To address this gap, we
conduct a comparative study of three off-the-shelf VLMs-BLIP-2, InstructBLIP,
and LLaVA-1.5-evaluating both zero-shot performance and the effects of
fine-tuning with a synthetic VQA dataset specific to urban scenes. We construct
such dataset from segmentation, depth, and object detection predictions of
street-view images, pairing each question with LLM-generated Chain-of-Thought
(CoT) answers for step-by-step reasoning supervision. Results show that while
VLMs perform reasonably well in zero-shot settings, fine-tuning with our
synthetic CoT-supervised dataset substantially boosts performance, especially
for challenging question types such as negation and counterfactuals. This study
introduces urban spatial reasoning as a new challenge for VLMs and demonstrates
synthetic dataset construction as a practical path for adapting general-purpose
models to specialized domains.

### [40] [Temporal Flow Matching for Learning Spatio-Temporal Trajectories in 4D Longitudinal Medical Imaging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21580)
*Nico Albert Disch,Yannick Kirchhoff,Robin Peretzke,Maximilian Rokuss,Saikat Roy,Constantin Ulrich,David Zimmerer,Klaus Maier-Hein*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes Temporal Flow Matching (TFM), a unified generative trajectory model for 4D medical image prediction that learns temporal dynamics, can fallback to last-context image (LCI), supports 3D volumes and irregular sampling, achieving state-of-the-art on three longitudinal datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical imaging requires modeling temporal evolution (disease progression, treatment planning, development), but existing methods are limited to single timepoints or specific tasks, hindering fine-grained spatiotemporal predictions. A general, flexible approach is needed to capture temporal distributions across multiple scans and irregular sampling.

Method: Temporal Flow Matching (TFM), a unified generative trajectory model that learns the underlying temporal distribution of longitudinal scans. It can degenerate to a nearest image predictor (last context image) as a special case and supports 3D volumes, multiple priors, and irregular sampling.

Result: On three public longitudinal datasets, TFM consistently outperforms comparable spatio-temporal methods from natural imaging benchmarks, setting a new state-of-the-art and providing a robust baseline for 4D medical image prediction.

Conclusion: TFM offers a flexible, superior framework for 4D medical image prediction by explicitly modeling temporal trajectories and accommodating practical data constraints, with strong empirical validation across multiple datasets.

Abstract: Understanding temporal dynamics in medical imaging is crucial for
applications such as disease progression modeling, treatment planning and
anatomical development tracking. However, most deep learning methods either
consider only single temporal contexts, or focus on tasks like classification
or regression, limiting their ability for fine-grained spatial predictions.
While some approaches have been explored, they are often limited to single
timepoints, specific diseases or have other technical restrictions. To address
this fundamental gap, we introduce Temporal Flow Matching (TFM), a unified
generative trajectory method that (i) aims to learn the underlying temporal
distribution, (ii) by design can fall back to a nearest image predictor, i.e.
predicting the last context image (LCI), as a special case, and (iii) supports
$3D$ volumes, multiple prior scans, and irregular sampling. Extensive
benchmarks on three public longitudinal datasets show that TFM consistently
surpasses spatio-temporal methods from natural imaging, establishing a new
state-of-the-art and robust baseline for $4D$ medical image prediction.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Multimodal deep learning combining preoperative CT and postoperative histopathology WSIs improves recurrence risk prediction in ccRCC; intermediate fusion with TITAN-CONCH (ResNet-18) bested CT alone and nearly matched the adjusted Leibovich score; results suggest imaging data adds value through fusion and that discretization may inflate individualized performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Leibovich score has limited patient-level resolution and does not use imaging data; integrating radiology and pathology could enhance personalized recurrence risk prediction in clear cell RCC.

Method: A modular deep learning framework with pretrained encoders and Cox-based survival modeling tested across unimodal (CT or WSI), late fusion, and intermediate fusion setups in a real-world ccRCC cohort. The best model used TITAN-CONCH with a ResNet-18 backbone.

Result: WSI-based models consistently outperformed CT-only models. Intermediate fusion improved performance; the best model approached the adjusted Leibovich score. Random tie-breaking reduced gaps between clinical baseline and learned models, suggesting discretization may overstate individual performance. Simple embedding concatenation showed radiology added value mainly through fusion.

Conclusion: Foundation-model–driven multimodal integration for personalized ccRCC risk prediction is feasible. Future work should explore more expressive fusion strategies, larger multimodal datasets, and general-purpose CT encoders to better match pathology modeling capacity.

Abstract: Recurrence risk estimation in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is
essential for guiding postoperative surveillance and treatment. The Leibovich
score remains widely used for stratifying distant recurrence risk but offers
limited patient-level resolution and excludes imaging information. This study
evaluates multimodal recurrence prediction by integrating preoperative computed
tomography (CT) and postoperative histopathology whole-slide images (WSIs). A
modular deep learning framework with pretrained encoders and Cox-based survival
modeling was tested across unimodal, late fusion, and intermediate fusion
setups. In a real-world ccRCC cohort, WSI-based models consistently
outperformed CT-only models, underscoring the prognostic strength of pathology.
Intermediate fusion further improved performance, with the best model
(TITAN-CONCH with ResNet-18) approaching the adjusted Leibovich score. Random
tie-breaking narrowed the gap between the clinical baseline and learned models,
suggesting discretization may overstate individualized performance. Using
simple embedding concatenation, radiology added value primarily through fusion.
These findings demonstrate the feasibility of foundation model-based multimodal
integration for personalized ccRCC risk prediction. Future work should explore
more expressive fusion strategies, larger multimodal datasets, and
general-purpose CT encoders to better match pathology modeling capacity.

*Haomiao Zhang,Zhangyuan Li,Yanling Piao,Zhi Li,Xiaodong Wang,Miao Cao,Xiongfei Su,Qiang Song,Xin Yuan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A deep unfolding network (DUN) for computer-generated holography (CGH) that combines an adaptive bandwidth-preserving model (ABPM) with a phase-domain complex-valued denoiser (PCD) to overcome black-box CNN limitations and ASM near-field constraints, achieving state-of-the-art PSNR (>35 dB) on simulated and real data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CGH reconstruction is nonlinear and ill-posed. End-to-end CNNs treat the physics as a black box, hurting interpretability and flexibility. CNNs have limited receptive fields; ASM-based models are confined to finite near-fields. There is a need for a design that respects physics while capturing global context.

Method: A Deep Unfolding Network that unfolds gradient descent into two modules: (1) ABPM, which preserves bandwidth and allows wider working distances than ASM; (2) PC D, a phase-domain complex-valued denoiser with a deformable self-attention module to capture global features.

Result: Experimental results on simulated and real data show state-of-the-art performance with PSNR over 35 dB.

Conclusion: The proposed DUN enhances interpretability and flexibility by embedding physical relationships through unfolding, expands effective working distances, and leverages complex-valued deformable attention to capture global features, yielding superior CGH reconstruction.

Abstract: Computer-generated holography (CGH) has gained wide attention with deep
learning-based algorithms. However, due to its nonlinear and ill-posed nature,
challenges remain in achieving accurate and stable reconstruction.
Specifically, ($i$) the widely used end-to-end networks treat the
reconstruction model as a black box, ignoring underlying physical
relationships, which reduces interpretability and flexibility. ($ii$) CNN-based
CGH algorithms have limited receptive fields, hindering their ability to
capture long-range dependencies and global context. ($iii$) Angular spectrum
method (ASM)-based models are constrained to finite near-fields.In this paper,
we propose a Deep Unfolding Network (DUN) that decomposes gradient descent into
two modules: an adaptive bandwidth-preserving model (ABPM) and a phase-domain
complex-valued denoiser (PCD), providing more flexibility. ABPM allows for
wider working distances compared to ASM-based methods. At the same time, PCD
leverages its complex-valued deformable self-attention module to capture global
features and enhance performance, achieving a PSNR over 35 dB. Experiments on
simulated and real data show state-of-the-art results.

*Maximilian Rokuss,Yannick Kirchhoff,Fabian Isensee,Klaus H. Maier-Hein*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Promptable, interactive segmentation for whole-body PET/CT using Euclidean Distance Transform encodings and online user-interaction simulation improves lesion masking over non-prompted baselines; ensemble models achieve strongest cross-validation performance and code is released.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clinically, accurate lesion segmentation in PET/CT is challenged by tracer heterogeneity, physiological uptake, and multi-center variability. Interactive, human-in-the-loop approaches can combine automated efficiency with expert refinement.

Method: Extend autoPET/CT nnU-Net with promptable capabilities by encoding user-provided foreground/background clicks as input channels. Systematically compare spatial prompt representations, finding Euclidean Distance Transform (EDT) encodings outperform Gaussian kernels. Implement online simulation of user interactions and a custom point sampling strategy. Train an ensemble of EDT-based models with and without external data.

Result: EDT-based prompts reduce both false positives and false negatives and outperform Gaussian representations. Online simulated interactions and the sampling strategy improve robustness under realistic prompting. The ensemble of EDT-based models trained with and without external data achieves the strongest cross-validation performance.

Conclusion: Promptable, user-guided segmentation can enable efficient workflows for multi-tracer, multi-center PET/CT imaging. Code is publicly available at the provided repository.

Abstract: Whole-body PET/CT is a cornerstone of oncological imaging, yet accurate
lesion segmentation remains challenging due to tracer heterogeneity,
physiological uptake, and multi-center variability. While fully automated
methods have advanced substantially, clinical practice benefits from approaches
that keep humans in the loop to efficiently refine predicted masks. The
autoPET/CT IV challenge addresses this need by introducing interactive
segmentation tasks based on simulated user prompts. In this work, we present
our submission to Task 1. Building on the winning autoPET III nnU-Net pipeline,
we extend the framework with promptable capabilities by encoding user-provided
foreground and background clicks as additional input channels. We
systematically investigate representations for spatial prompts and demonstrate
that Euclidean Distance Transform (EDT) encodings consistently outperform
Gaussian kernels. Furthermore, we propose online simulation of user
interactions and a custom point sampling strategy to improve robustness under
realistic prompting conditions. Our ensemble of EDT-based models, trained with
and without external data, achieves the strongest cross-validation performance,
reducing both false positives and false negatives compared to baseline models.
These results highlight the potential of promptable models to enable efficient,
user-guided segmentation workflows in multi-tracer, multi-center PET/CT. Code

### [44] [Mapping like a Skeptic: Probabilistic BEV Projection for Online HD Mapping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21689)
*Fatih Erdoğan,Merve Rabia Barın,Fatma Güney*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A geometry-guided projection with probabilistic confidence is proposed to map image space to BEV for HD maps. It refines the standard camera-based projection, filters irrelevant scene elements, and uses confidence to accumulate temporally, showing improved generalization and long-range perception on nuScenes/Argoverse2; code released.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HD map construction relies on accurate image-to-BEV projection. Standard projection approaches (e.g., attention-based) struggle to generalize, often hallucinating non-existent roads. A geometry-first mapping with scene-adaptive refinement aims to improve precision and reduce false positives.

Method: Start from a basic geometric projection using camera intrinsics/extrinsics. Introduce a probabilistic projection mechanism with per-element confidence scores to refine alignment to the actual scene and filter out irrelevant elements. Use confidence-guided selection to accumulate reliable information over time for temporal processing.

Result: Experiments on new splits of nuScenes and Argoverse2 show improved performance over state-of-the-art approaches, with notable gains in nuScenes and challenging long-range perception, indicating better generalization.

Conclusion: A geometry-driven, confidence-aware projection framework can improve HD map construction by reducing hallucinations and enhancing temporal consistency, offering better generalization across datasets; code and checkpoints are provided.

Abstract: Constructing high-definition (HD) maps from sensory input requires accurately
mapping the road elements in image space to the Bird's Eye View (BEV) space.
The precision of this mapping directly impacts the quality of the final
vectorized HD map. Existing HD mapping approaches outsource the projection to
standard mapping techniques, such as attention-based ones. However, these
methods struggle with accuracy due to generalization problems, often
hallucinating non-existent road elements. Our key idea is to start with a
geometric mapping based on camera parameters and adapt it to the scene to
extract relevant map information from camera images. To implement this, we
propose a novel probabilistic projection mechanism with confidence scores to
(i) refine the mapping to better align with the scene and (ii) filter out
irrelevant elements that should not influence HD map generation. In addition,
we improve temporal processing by using confidence scores to selectively
accumulate reliable information over time. Experiments on new splits of the
nuScenes and Argoverse2 datasets demonstrate improved performance over
state-of-the-art approaches, indicating better generalization. The improvements
are particularly pronounced on nuScenes and in the challenging long perception
range. Our code and model checkpoints are available at

*Shashank Vempati,Nishit Anand,Gaurav Talebailkar,Arpan Garai,Chetan Arora*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Line-level OCR progression from word-level OCR reduces segmentation errors and enables longer context; proposed dataset; 5.4% end-to-end accuracy gain and 4x efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current word-level OCR suffers from segmentation errors and limited language context. Advances in seq-to-seq led to word-level outputs; shifting to line-level OCR provides more context, bypasses word-detection bottlenecks, and could leverage LLMs.

Method: Propose a line-level OCR paradigm that bypasses word detection to utilize larger sentence context; curate a dataset of 251 English page images with line-level annotations; evaluate end-to-end accuracy and efficiency.

Result: End-to-end accuracy improved by 5.4%; 4x efficiency improvement over word-based pipelines.

Conclusion: Line-level OCR is a natural progression that can improve both accuracy and efficiency; dataset enables benchmarking and future integration with large language models.

Abstract: Conventional optical character recognition (OCR) techniques segmented each
character and then recognized. This made them prone to error in character
segmentation, and devoid of context to exploit language models. Advances in
sequence to sequence translation in last decade led to modern techniques first
detecting words and then inputting one word at a time to a model to directly
output full words as sequence of characters. This allowed better utilization of
language models and bypass error-prone character segmentation step. We observe
that the above transition in style has moved the bottleneck in accuracy to word
segmentation. Hence, in this paper, we propose a natural and logical
progression from word level OCR to line-level OCR. The proposal allows to
bypass errors in word detection, and provides larger sentence context for
better utilization of language models. We show that the proposed technique not
only improves the accuracy but also efficiency of OCR. Despite our thorough
literature survey, we did not find any public dataset to train and benchmark
such shift from word to line-level OCR. Hence, we also contribute a
meticulously curated dataset of 251 English page images with line-level
annotations. Our experimentation revealed a notable end-to-end accuracy
improvement of 5.4%, underscoring the potential benefits of transitioning
towards line-level OCR, especially for document images. We also report a 4
times improvement in efficiency compared to word-based pipelines. With
continuous improvements in large language models, our methodology also holds
potential to exploit such advances. Project Website:

*Alvaro Patricio,Atabak Dehban,Rodrigo Ventura*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FLORA uses LoRA-tuned diffusion (Flux 1.1 Dev) to generate high-quality synthetic data for object detection on consumer GPUs, achieving better performance with 500 images than 5000 generated by ODGEN, with significantly lower compute.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reduces reliance on resource-intensive full fine-tuning of large diffusion models and the need for large synthetic datasets; aims to democratize access to effective synthetic data augmentation.

Method: Fine-tune Flux 1.1 Dev diffusion model exclusively with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). Generate synthetic labeled images across seven datasets. Train detectors on 500 FLORA images and compare to baselines (e.g., 5000 ODGEN images). Evaluate performance gains.

Result: Detectors trained on 500 FLORA-generated images achieve higher mAP than those trained on 5000 ODGEN images, with improvements up to 21.3% in mAP@.50:.95. Demonstrates strong data-efficiency: competitive or superior results using only 10% of the data and much lower computational cost.

Conclusion: A quality- and efficiency-focused synthetic data approach can surpass brute-force generation, making advanced synthetic data creation more practical and accessible for real-world object detection tasks.

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion-based generative models have demonstrated
significant potential in augmenting scarce datasets for object detection tasks.
Nevertheless, most recent models rely on resource-intensive full fine-tuning of
large-scale diffusion models, requiring enterprise-grade GPUs (e.g., NVIDIA
V100) and thousands of synthetic images. To address these limitations, we
propose Flux LoRA Augmentation (FLORA), a lightweight synthetic data generation
pipeline. Our approach uses the Flux 1.1 Dev diffusion model, fine-tuned
exclusively through Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). This dramatically reduces
computational requirements, enabling synthetic dataset generation with a
consumer-grade GPU (e.g., NVIDIA RTX 4090). We empirically evaluate our
approach on seven diverse object detection datasets. Our results demonstrate
that training object detectors with just 500 synthetic images generated by our
approach yields superior detection performance compared to models trained on
5000 synthetic images from the ODGEN baseline, achieving improvements of up to
21.3% in mAP@.50:.95. This work demonstrates that it is possible to surpass
state-of-the-art performance with far greater efficiency, as FLORA achieves
superior results using only 10% of the data and a fraction of the computational
cost. This work demonstrates that a quality and efficiency-focused approach is
more effective than brute-force generation, making advanced synthetic data
creation more practical and accessible for real-world scenarios.

*Amirhossein Nazeri,Wael Hafez*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Adversarial perturbations create immediate, detectable entropy signatures in CNN activations; a non-invasive detector using activation entropy yields ~90% accuracy with <20% FP/FN, without retraining or architecture changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CNNs are vulnerable to adversarial perturbations that can cause misclassification with high confidence; standard detectors often require retraining, modify architectures, or hurt clean accuracy. A lightweight, deployable detection method is needed.

Method: Parallel entropy monitoring on CNN activations (example: VGG-16) to compare entropy distributions of clean vs adversarial inputs; focus on early convolutional layers where entropy shifts (~7%) occur.

Result: Adversarial inputs shift activation entropy by about 7% in early layers, enabling 90% detection accuracy with false positive and false negative rates below 20%; entropy distributions for clean and adversarial inputs are fully separable.

Conclusion: Activation entropy alone can quantify CNN reliability and enable real-time self-diagnostic vision systems that detect adversarial inputs without altering the original model or its performance.

Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have become the foundation of modern
computer vision, achieving unprecedented accuracy across diverse image
recognition tasks. While these networks excel on in-distribution data, they
remain vulnerable to adversarial perturbations imperceptible input
modifications that cause misclassification with high confidence. However,
existing detection methods either require expensive retraining, modify network
architecture, or degrade performance on clean inputs. Here we show that
adversarial perturbations create immediate, detectable entropy signatures in
CNN activations that can be monitored without any model modification. Using
parallel entropy monitoring on VGG-16, we demonstrate that adversarial inputs
consistently shift activation entropy by 7% in early convolutional layers,
enabling 90% detection accuracy with false positives and false negative rates
below 20%. The complete separation between clean and adversarial entropy
distributions reveals that CNNs inherently encode distribution shifts in their
activation patterns. This work establishes that CNN reliability can be assessed
through activation entropy alone, enabling practical deployment of
self-diagnostic vision systems that detect adversarial inputs in real-time
without compromising original model performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Synthetic CAD2DMD-SET dataset boosts LVLM robustness for reading Digital Measurement Devices under clutter, occlusion, extreme viewpoints, and motion blur; includes DMDBench validation; 200% ANLS gain for InternVL when fine-tuned with LoRA; open-source planned.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LVLMs currently struggle to read values from DMDs in real-world, cluttered, and dynamic settings typical of head-mounted AR scenarios; need robust training data and validation to improve performance and reliability.

Method: CAD2DMD-SET uses 3D CAD models, advanced rendering, and high-fidelity image composition to generate diverse, VQA-labelled synthetic DMD datasets for LVLM fine-tuning. DMDBench provides a 1,000-image real-world validation set. Benchmarking employed Average Normalised Levenshtein Similarity (ANLS); LoRA adapters were fine-tuned on the synthetic data to transfer improvements to LVLMs.

Result: Significant performance gains on DMD-reading VQA tasks; InternVL shows ~200% ANLS improvement after fine-tuning with CAD2DMD-SET, with no degradation on other tasks; overall robustness under challenging conditions is enhanced.

Conclusion: CAD2DMD-SET substantially improves LVLM robustness for DMD-reading in difficult real-world conditions; DMDBench offers practical validation; planned open-source release will enable community to add devices and generate custom datasets.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated
impressive capabilities across various multimodal tasks. They continue,
however, to struggle with trivial scenarios such as reading values from Digital
Measurement Devices (DMDs), particularly in real-world conditions involving
clutter, occlusions, extreme viewpoints, and motion blur; common in
head-mounted cameras and Augmented Reality (AR) applications. Motivated by
these limitations, this work introduces CAD2DMD-SET, a synthetic data
generation tool designed to support visual question answering (VQA) tasks
involving DMDs. By leveraging 3D CAD models, advanced rendering, and
high-fidelity image composition, our tool produces diverse, VQA-labelled
synthetic DMD datasets suitable for fine-tuning LVLMs. Additionally, we present
DMDBench, a curated validation set of 1,000 annotated real-world images
designed to evaluate model performance under practical constraints.
Benchmarking three state-of-the-art LVLMs using Average Normalised Levenshtein
Similarity (ANLS) and further fine-tuning LoRA's of these models with
CAD2DMD-SET's generated dataset yielded substantial improvements, with InternVL
showcasing a score increase of 200% without degrading on other tasks. This
demonstrates that the CAD2DMD-SET training dataset substantially improves the
robustness and performance of LVLMs when operating under the previously stated
challenging conditions. The CAD2DMD-SET tool is expected to be released as
open-source once the final version of this manuscript is prepared, allowing the
community to add different measurement devices and generate their own datasets.

TL;DR: A self-supervised sound localization framework SSL-SaN with silence/noise training, plus a novel alignment/separability metric and IS3+ dataset with negative audio; achieves state-of-the-art in localization and cross-modal retrieval.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods struggle with negative audio (silence, noise, offscreen sounds) and evaluations bias toward positive, single-source scenarios. The work aims to improve robustness and provide a more informative evaluation.

Method: Threefold contribution: (1) a training strategy that incorporates silence and noise to enhance robustness while maintaining strong positive-case performance; (2) a new metric that quantifies the trade-off between alignment and separability of auditory and visual features across positive and negative audio-visual pairs; (3) IS3+, an extended, improved version of the IS3 synthetic dataset that includes negative (non-sounding) audio.

Result: SSL-SaN achieves state-of-the-art performance among self-supervised models for both sound localization and cross-modal retrieval. The work provides new data, metrics, and code for broader evaluation and replication.

Conclusion: The paper introduces data, metrics, and code to advance robust audio-visual localization in the presence of negative audio, and releases SSL-SaN and IS3+ to support future research and evaluation.

Abstract: Visual sound source localization is a fundamental perception task that aims
to detect the location of sounding sources in a video given its audio. Despite
recent progress, we identify two shortcomings in current methods: 1) most
approaches perform poorly in cases with low audio-visual semantic
correspondence such as silence, noise, and offscreen sounds, i.e. in the
presence of negative audio; and 2) most prior evaluations are limited to
positive cases, where both datasets and metrics convey scenarios with a single
visible sound source in the scene. To address this, we introduce three key
contributions. First, we propose a new training strategy that incorporates
silence and noise, which improves performance in positive cases, while being
more robust against negative sounds. Our resulting self-supervised model,
SSL-SaN, achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to other
self-supervised models, both in sound localization and cross-modal retrieval.
Second, we propose a new metric that quantifies the trade-off between alignment
and separability of auditory and visual features across positive and negative
audio-visual pairs. Third, we present IS3+, an extended and improved version of
the IS3 synthetic dataset with negative audio.

### [50] [UItron: Foundational GUI Agent with Advanced Perception and Planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21767)
*Zhixiong Zeng,Jing Huang,Liming Zheng,Wenkang Han,Yufeng Zhong,Lei Chen,Longrong Yang,Yingjie Chu,Yuzhi He,Lin Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UItron is an open-source foundational model for automated GUI agents that integrates perception, grounding, and planning with systemic data engineering and interactive infrastructure to operate across mobile/PC devices, achieving notable gains in Chinese app scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GUI agents enable automated operations on devices, a key step toward general AI but face data scarcity, lack of interactive infrastructure, and weak initial capabilities of foundation models. This work argues for systemic data engineering and interactive environments to advance GUI agents.

Method: Supervised fine-tuning on GUI perception and planning tasks across diverse GUI scenarios, followed by curriculum reinforcement learning in online environments. Large-scale data collection of over one million operation trajectories from the top 100 apps to support offline/online evaluation and benchmarking. Development of an interactive environment connecting mobile and PC devices.

Result: UItron attains superior performance on benchmarks for GUI perception, grounding, and planning, with notable improvements in Chinese app scenarios—demonstrated by stronger interaction capabilities with top-tier Chinese mobile apps.

Conclusion: Systemic data engineering and interactive infrastructures are foundational for advancing GUI agents; UItron's data-centric training and cross-device environment substantively progress toward real-world GUI agent deployment, especially in Chinese-language contexts.

Abstract: GUI agent aims to enable automated operations on Mobile/PC devices, which is
an important task toward achieving artificial general intelligence. The rapid
advancement of VLMs accelerates the development of GUI agents, owing to their
powerful capabilities in visual understanding and task planning. However,
building a GUI agent remains a challenging task due to the scarcity of
operation trajectories, the availability of interactive infrastructure, and the
limitation of initial capabilities in foundation models. In this work, we
introduce UItron, an open-source foundational model for automatic GUI agents,
featuring advanced GUI perception, grounding, and planning capabilities. UItron
highlights the necessity of systemic data engineering and interactive
infrastructure as foundational components for advancing GUI agent development.
It not only systematically studies a series of data engineering strategies to
enhance training effects, but also establishes an interactive environment
connecting both Mobile and PC devices. In training, UItron adopts supervised
finetuning over perception and planning tasks in various GUI scenarios, and
then develop a curriculum reinforcement learning framework to enable complex
reasoning and exploration for online environments. As a result, UItron achieves
superior performance in benchmarks of GUI perception, grounding, and planning.
In particular, UItron highlights the interaction proficiency with top-tier
Chinese mobile APPs, as we identified a general lack of Chinese capabilities
even in state-of-the-art solutions. To this end, we manually collect over one
million steps of operation trajectories across the top 100 most popular apps,
and build the offline and online agent evaluation environments. Experimental
results demonstrate that UItron achieves significant progress in Chinese app
scenarios, propelling GUI agents one step closer to real-world application.

### [51] [Domain Generalization in-the-Wild: Disentangling Classification from Domain-Aware Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21769)
*Ha Min Son,Zhe Zhao,Shahbaz Rezaei,Xin Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR:  CLIP's domain-generalization (DG) degrades on challenging unseen data; CLIP-DCA improves DG by increasing domain awareness and disentangling domain features from classification, yielding stronger performance on out-of-distribution (OOD) datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation:  DG evaluation for foundation models like CLIP is imperfect: web-scale pretraining may already cover many benchmarks, so current DG tests may be too easy or fail to capture genuinely unseen data scenarios. There is a need for in-the-wild evaluation and approaches that respect useful domain-specific cues rather than discarding them.

Method:  CLIP-DCA introduces a separate domain head to detect domain information and uses synthetically generated diverse domain data to boost domain awareness. It also enforces disentanglement between domain features and class features to enable domain-invariant classification while preserving domain-aware representations.

Result: (CLIP-DCA) shows significant improvements over prior methods, especially on datasets that are more out-of-distribution (OOD), indicating improved robustness in DG tasks for CLIP under challenging unseen data.

Conclusion: Enhancing domain awareness before enforcing domain-invariant classification can improve generalization of foundation models to unseen domains. CLIP-DCA’s disentanglement approach yields stronger DG performance on hard, OOD datasets compared with existing techniques.

Abstract: Evaluating domain generalization (DG) for foundational models like CLIP is
challenging, as web-scale pretraining data potentially covers many existing
benchmarks. Consequently, current DG evaluation may neither be sufficiently
challenging nor adequately test genuinely unseen data scenarios. To better
assess the performance of CLIP on DG in-the-wild, a scenario where CLIP
encounters challenging unseen data, we consider two approaches: (1) evaluating
on 33 diverse datasets with quantified out-of-distribution (OOD) scores after
fine-tuning CLIP on ImageNet, and (2) using unlearning to make CLIP `forget'
some domains as an approximation. We observe that CLIP's performance
deteriorates significantly on more OOD datasets. To address this, we present
CLIP-DCA (Disentangling Classification from enhanced domain Aware
representations). Our approach is motivated by the observation that while
standard domain invariance losses aim to make representations domain-invariant,
this can be harmful to foundation models by forcing the discarding of
domain-aware representations beneficial for generalization. We instead
hypothesize that enhancing domain awareness is a prerequisite for effective
domain-invariant classification in foundation models. CLIP-DCA identifies and
enhances domain awareness within CLIP's encoders using a separate domain head
and synthetically generated diverse domain data. Simultaneously, it encourages
domain-invariant classification through disentanglement from the domain
features. CLIP-DCA shows significant improvements within this challenging
evaluation compared to existing methods, particularly on datasets that are more
OOD.

### [52] [What Can We Learn from Harry Potter? An Exploratory Study of Visual Representation Learning from Atypical Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21770)
*Qiyue Sun,Qiming Huang,Yang Yang,Hongjun Wang,Jianbo Jiao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduce a dataset of unusual atypical videos and show that incorporating such data during training improves open-world learning across OOD detection, NCD, and ZSAR; diversity of atypical data benefits performance, with opposite trends for dataset size depending on the task.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Open-world learning is under-explored for video data; existing work focuses on closed-set data. The paper investigates whether exposing models to atypical/uncommon videos during training can enhance generalization and discovery in open-world tasks.

Method: Collect a new video dataset containing atypical data types (e.g., sci-fi, animation, etc.). Train representation learning models with these atypical samples and evaluate on three open-world tasks (OOD detection, NCD, ZSAR). Explore effects of diversity and size of atypical data on performance.

Result: Atypical data consistently improve performance across OOD, NCD, and ZSAR. Increasing categorical diversity of atypical samples boosts OOD detection; for NCD, a smaller but semantically diverse atypical set outperforms a larger but more typical one; in ZSAR, semantic diversity aids generalization to unseen actions.

Conclusion: Atypical videos are beneficial for open-world visual representation learning. The proposed dataset and findings motivate further research into leveraging atypical data for robust, open-world video understanding.

Abstract: Humans usually show exceptional generalisation and discovery ability in the
open world, when being shown uncommon new concepts. Whereas most existing
studies in the literature focus on common typical data from closed sets,
open-world novel discovery is under-explored in videos. In this paper, we are
interested in asking: \textit{What if atypical unusual videos are exposed in
the learning process?} To this end, we collect a new video dataset consisting
of various types of unusual atypical data (\eg sci-fi, animation, \etc). To
study how such atypical data may benefit open-world learning, we feed them into
the model training process for representation learning. Focusing on three key
tasks in open-world learning: out-of-distribution (OOD) detection, novel
category discovery (NCD), and zero-shot action recognition (ZSAR), we found
that even straightforward learning approaches with atypical data consistently
improve performance across various settings. Furthermore, we found that
increasing the categorical diversity of the atypical samples further boosts OOD
detection performance. Additionally, in the NCD task, using a smaller yet more
semantically diverse set of atypical samples leads to better performance
compared to using a larger but more typical dataset. In the ZSAR setting, the
semantic diversity of atypical videos helps the model generalise better to
unseen action classes. These observations in our extensive experimental
evaluations reveal the benefits of atypical videos for visual representation
learning in the open world, together with the newly proposed dataset,
encouraging further studies in this direction.

### [53] [Unsupervised Video Continual Learning via Non-Parametric Deep Embedded Clustering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21773)
*Nattapong Kurpukdee,Adrian G. Bors*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Unsupervised video continual learning (uVCL) without task labels or boundaries, using a non-parametric KDE-based memory of deep video features with novelty-driven expansion; transfer learning from past tasks; evaluated on three standard datasets (UCF101, HMDB51, Something-Something V2) with no labels/boundaries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Video data are rich, unlabeled, and sequentially encountered in realistic scenarios. Prior work in continual learning is mostly supervised and relies on task boundaries and labels, which are costly and impractical. There is a need for an unsupervised, non-parametric approach that can handle unstructured video streams and grow memory as new knowledge appears.

Method: Extract deep video features using unsupervised video transformer networks. Apply Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) to these features to form a non-parametric probabilistic representation. Use a novelty detection criterion to dynamically expand memory clusters when new information arrives. Leverage transfer learning from previously learned tasks as initialization for current tasks. Evaluate on unstructured video data across tasks without labels or boundaries.

Result: The proposed approach substantially improves performance when learning many tasks in succession, demonstrating the viability of uVCL for video data. Evaluations on UCF101, HMDB51, and Something-Something V2 show effectiveness without any labels or task boundaries.

Conclusion: This work defines a realistic unsupervised video continual learning framework and provides a non-parametric solution that manages memory growth through novelty detection and leverages transfer learning, achieving improved performance across multiple video action datasets without supervision.

Abstract: We propose a realistic scenario for the unsupervised video learning where
neither task boundaries nor labels are provided when learning a succession of
tasks. We also provide a non-parametric learning solution for the
under-explored problem of unsupervised video continual learning. Videos
represent a complex and rich spatio-temporal media information, widely used in
many applications, but which have not been sufficiently explored in
unsupervised continual learning. Prior studies have only focused on supervised
continual learning, relying on the knowledge of labels and task boundaries,
while having labeled data is costly and not practical. To address this gap, we
study the unsupervised video continual learning (uVCL). uVCL raises more
challenges due to the additional computational and memory requirements of
processing videos when compared to images. We introduce a general benchmark
experimental protocol for uVCL by considering the learning of unstructured
video data categories during each task. We propose to use the Kernel Density
Estimation (KDE) of deep embedded video features extracted by unsupervised
video transformer networks as a non-parametric probabilistic representation of
the data. We introduce a novelty detection criterion for the incoming new task
data, dynamically enabling the expansion of memory clusters, aiming to capture
new knowledge when learning a succession of tasks. We leverage the use of
transfer learning from the previous tasks as an initial state for the knowledge
transfer to the current learning task. We found that the proposed methodology
substantially enhances the performance of the model when successively learning
many tasks. We perform in-depth evaluations on three standard video action
recognition datasets, including UCF101, HMDB51, and Something-to-Something V2,
without using any labels or class boundaries.

### [54] [A Multi-Stage Fine-Tuning and Ensembling Strategy for Pancreatic Tumor Segmentation in Diagnostic and Therapeutic MRI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21775)
*Omer Faruk Durugol,Maximilian Rokuss,Yannick Kirchhoff,Klaus H. Maier-Hein*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Cascaded, pre-trained nnU-Net models with metric-aware ensembling achieve strong PDAC segmentation in MRI under limited data; demonstrates trade-off between augmentation for volume accuracy vs boundary precision; Task 1 Dice 0.661, Task 2 Dice 0.523.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PDAC MRI segmentation is hampered by poor tissue contrast and data scarcity; aim to improve automatic segmentation for clinical workflows via advanced training strategies and ensembles.

Method: Multi-stage cascaded pre-training: start from a generic anatomical foundation model, fine-tune sequentially on CT pancreatic lesion datasets, then MRI modalities; five-fold cross-validation; compare augmentation schemes; build heterogeneous ensembles of specialist models (mix of experts); metric-aware ensembling.

Result: Task 1 MASD 5.46 mm, HD95 17.33 mm; Task 1 Tumor Dice 0.661; Task 2 Tumor Dice 0.523.

Conclusion: The approach yields robust performance in limited data, with effective specialization and ensembling to balance volumetric accuracy and boundary precision; demonstrates a scalable methodology for complex medical imaging tasks.

Abstract: Automated segmentation of Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma (PDAC) from MRI is
critical for clinical workflows but is hindered by poor tumor-tissue contrast
and a scarcity of annotated data. This paper details our submission to the
PANTHER challenge, addressing both diagnostic T1-weighted (Task 1) and
therapeutic T2-weighted (Task 2) segmentation. Our approach is built upon the
nnU-Net framework and leverages a deep, multi-stage cascaded pre-training
strategy, starting from a general anatomical foundation model and sequentially
fine-tuning on CT pancreatic lesion datasets and the target MRI modalities.
Through extensive five-fold cross-validation, we systematically evaluated data
augmentation schemes and training schedules. Our analysis revealed a critical
trade-off, where aggressive data augmentation produced the highest volumetric
accuracy, while default augmentations yielded superior boundary precision
(achieving a state-of-the-art MASD of 5.46 mm and HD95 of 17.33 mm for Task 1).
For our final submission, we exploited this finding by constructing custom,
heterogeneous ensembles of specialist models, essentially creating a mix of
experts. This metric-aware ensembling strategy proved highly effective,
achieving a top cross-validation Tumor Dice score of 0.661 for Task 1 and 0.523
for Task 2. Our work presents a robust methodology for developing specialized,
high-performance models in the context of limited data and complex medical
imaging tasks (Team MIC-DKFZ).

### [55] [Benchmarking GPT-5 in Radiation Oncology: Measurable Gains, but Persistent Need for Expert Oversight](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21777)
*Ugur Dinc,Jibak Sarkar,Philipp Schubert,Sabine Semrau,Thomas Weissmann,Andre Karius,Johann Brand,Bernd-Niklas Axer,Ahmed Gomaa,Pluvio Stephan,Ishita Sheth,Sogand Beirami,Annette Schwarz,Udo Gaipl,Benjamin Frey,Christoph Bert,Stefanie Corradini,Rainer Fietkau,Florian Putz*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GPT-5 substantially improves radiation oncology tasks over GPT-4 and GPT-3.5 on benchmarks, with high-quality treatment recommendations but with caveats: occasional substantive errors, hallucinations infrequent yet possible, and notably low inter-rater agreement on correctness indicating substantial subjectivity in clinical judgment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Evaluate GPT-5's readiness for clinical decision support in radiation oncology using objective benchmarks (an exam and real-world vignettes) to assess accuracy, completeness, and safety considerations.

Method: Two benchmarks: (i) ACR Radiation Oncology In-Training Examination (TXIT, 2021) with 300 MCQs; (ii) 60 authentic radiation oncology vignettes. GPT-5 generated concise treatment plans. Four board-certified radiation oncologists rated correctness, comprehensiveness, and hallucinations. Inter-rater reliability assessed with Fleiss' kappa.

Result: TXIT accuracy: 92.8% for GPT-5 vs GPT-4 78.8% and GPT-3.5 62.1%. In vignette evaluation, treatment recommendations rated correctness 3.24/4 (CI 3.11–3.38) and comprehensiveness 3.59/4 (CI 3.49–3.69). Hallucinations were rare; no case reached majority consensus for hallucinations. Inter-rater agreement was low (kappa = 0.083). Errors clustered in complex scenarios requiring precise trial knowledge or detailed clinical adaptation.

Conclusion: GPT-5 outperforms prior models on the radiation oncology MCQ benchmark; while it shows favorable performance in generating real-world treatment recommendations, the correctness ratings indicate room for improvement. Hallucinations were infrequent but substantive errors exist, underscoring the need for rigorous expert oversight before clinical implementation.

Abstract: Introduction: Large language models (LLM) have shown great potential in
clinical decision support. GPT-5 is a novel LLM system that has been
specifically marketed towards oncology use.
  Methods: Performance was assessed using two complementary benchmarks: (i) the
ACR Radiation Oncology In-Training Examination (TXIT, 2021), comprising 300
multiple-choice items, and (ii) a curated set of 60 authentic radiation
oncologic vignettes representing diverse disease sites and treatment
indications. For the vignette evaluation, GPT-5 was instructed to generate
concise therapeutic plans. Four board-certified radiation oncologists rated
correctness, comprehensiveness, and hallucinations. Inter-rater reliability was
quantified using Fleiss' \k{appa}.
  Results: On the TXIT benchmark, GPT-5 achieved a mean accuracy of 92.8%,
outperforming GPT-4 (78.8%) and GPT-3.5 (62.1%). Domain-specific gains were
most pronounced in Dose and Diagnosis. In the vignette evaluation, GPT-5's
treatment recommendations were rated highly for correctness (mean 3.24/4, 95%
CI: 3.11-3.38) and comprehensiveness (3.59/4, 95% CI: 3.49-3.69).
Hallucinations were rare with no case reaching majority consensus for their
presence. Inter-rater agreement was low (Fleiss' \k{appa} 0.083 for
correctness), reflecting inherent variability in clinical judgment. Errors
clustered in complex scenarios requiring precise trial knowledge or detailed
clinical adaptation.
  Discussion: GPT-5 clearly outperformed prior model variants on the radiation
oncology multiple-choice benchmark. Although GPT-5 exhibited favorable
performance in generating real-world radiation oncology treatment
recommendations, correctness ratings indicate room for further improvement.
While hallucinations were infrequent, the presence of substantive errors
underscores that GPT-5-generated recommendations require rigorous expert
oversight before clinical implementation.

### [56] [TMUAD: Enhancing Logical Capabilities in Unified Anomaly Detection Models with a Text Memory Bank](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21795)
*Jiawei Liu,Jiahe Hou,Wei Wang,Jinsong Du,Yang Cong,Huijie Fan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TMUAD introduces a Three-Memory framework that unifies structural and logical anomaly detection using a text memory bank (for logical anomalies), an object memory bank (for complete object contours), and a patch memory bank (for local structure). It achieves state-of-the-art results on seven datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Anomaly detection is hard due to limited normal data and the reliance on hand-crafted features and memory banks. There is a need to unify structural and logical anomaly detection by leveraging multiple memory banks that capture different aspects (textual logic, object contours, and local structure).

Method: Three-Memory framework (TMUAD): 1) class-level text memory bank built via a logic-aware text extractor to capture rich logical descriptions from images; 2) object-level image memory bank preserving complete object contours by extracting features from segmented objects; 3) patch-level memory bank for structural anomaly detection using patch features. These three memory banks are used to retrieve similar normal images, compute multi-level anomaly scores (class-level logical, object-level structural, patch-level), and fuse them into a final anomaly score.

Result: TMUAD achieves state-of-the-art performance across seven publicly available datasets spanning industrial and medical domains. The authors also provide code at the project URL.

Conclusion: Unifying structural and logical anomaly detection through collaborative three-memory banks yields superior anomaly detection performance and generalizes across diverse domains.

Abstract: Anomaly detection, which aims to identify anomalies deviating from normal
patterns, is challenging due to the limited amount of normal data available.
Unlike most existing unified methods that rely on carefully designed image
feature extractors and memory banks to capture logical relationships between
objects, we introduce a text memory bank to enhance the detection of logical
anomalies. Specifically, we propose a Three-Memory framework for Unified
structural and logical Anomaly Detection (TMUAD). First, we build a class-level
text memory bank for logical anomaly detection by the proposed logic-aware text
extractor, which can capture rich logical descriptions of objects from input
images. Second, we construct an object-level image memory bank that preserves
complete object contours by extracting features from segmented objects. Third,
we employ visual encoders to extract patch-level image features for
constructing a patch-level memory bank for structural anomaly detection. These
three complementary memory banks are used to retrieve and compare normal images
that are most similar to the query image, compute anomaly scores at multiple
levels, and fuse them into a final anomaly score. By unifying structural and
logical anomaly detection through collaborative memory banks, TMUAD achieves
state-of-the-art performance across seven publicly available datasets involving
industrial and medical domains. The model and code are available at
https://github.com/SIA-IDE/TMUAD.

*Jasper Uijlings,Xingyi Zhou,Xiuye Gu,Arsha Nagrani,Anurag Arnab,Alireza Fathi,David Ross,Cordelia Schmid*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VoCap is a scalable video model that jointly handles promptable video object segmentation, referring expression segmentation, and object captioning by using a video prompt (text/box/mask) to produce spatio-temporal masklets and captions, leveraging pseudo-caption annotations on SAV to create SAV-Caption and achieving state-of-the-art in RE-VOS and competitive performance elsewhere.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enable fine-grained, multilingual-capable video understanding with a unified, promptable model while reducing data bottlenecks through pseudo-caption augmentation of an existing segmentation dataset.

Method: VoCap consumes a video and a prompt (text, box, or mask) to predict a spatio-temporal masklet and a corresponding object-centric caption. The authors generate SAV-Caption by annotating SAV with pseudo object captions using a large Vision-Language Model, then train VoCap on SAV-Caption plus other image/video datasets.

Result: State-of-the-art on referring expression video object segmentation; competitive on semi-supervised video object segmentation; establishes a benchmark for video object captioning; dataset SAV-Caption to be released.

Conclusion: A scalable, multi-task framework that unifies segmentation, referring expression understanding, and captioning for video, achieving strong performance and providing a new dataset to support video object captioning research.

Abstract: Understanding objects in videos in terms of fine-grained localization masks
and detailed semantic properties is a fundamental task in video understanding.
In this paper, we propose VoCap, a flexible video model that consumes a video
and a prompt of various modalities (text, box or mask), and produces a
spatio-temporal masklet with a corresponding object-centric caption. As such
our model addresses simultaneously the tasks of promptable video object
segmentation, referring expression segmentation, and object captioning. Since
obtaining data for this task is tedious and expensive, we propose to annotate
an existing large-scale segmentation dataset (SAV) with pseudo object captions.
We do so by preprocessing videos with their ground-truth masks to highlight the
object of interest and feed this to a large Vision Language Model (VLM). For an
unbiased evaluation, we collect manual annotations on the validation set. We
call the resulting dataset SAV-Caption. We train our VoCap model at scale on a
SAV-Caption together with a mix of other image and video datasets. Our model
yields state-of-the-art results on referring expression video object
segmentation, is competitive on semi-supervised video object segmentation, and
establishes a benchmark for video object captioning. Our dataset will be made
available at https://github.com/google-deepmind/vocap.

*Yiming Lin,Yuchen Niu,Shang Wang,Kaizhu Huang,Qiufeng Wang,Xiao-Bo Jin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Verb classification in semantic role SR is inherently multi-label; introduces SPMLL and GE-VerbMLP with a multi-label benchmark, achieving >3% MAP improvement and competitive top-1/top-5 results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ambiguity in visual event recognition: multiple verb categories can describe a single image, making single-label verb classification insufficient. Annotating large datasets with multiple labels is impractical, so a principled formulation and fair evaluation for multi-label SR is needed.

Method: Empirically demonstrate that verb classification is multi-label due to semantic overlap. Reformulate as Single Positive Multi-Label Learning (SPMLL). Develop Graph Enhanced Verb Multilayer Perceptron (GE-VerbMLP) that uses graph neural networks to model label correlations and employs adversarial training to sharpen decision boundaries. Create a comprehensive multi-label evaluation benchmark for SR.

Result: Extensive experiments on real-world datasets show the approach achieves more than 3% MAP improvement and remains competitive on traditional top-1 and top-5 accuracy metrics.

Conclusion: A multi-label framing (SPMLL) better captures the inherent ambiguity in visual SR. The GE-VerbMLP effectively leverages label correlations and adversarial training, and the new multi-label benchmark provides a fair evaluation framework for SR models.

Abstract: Context recognition (SR) is a fundamental task in computer vision that aims
to extract structured semantic summaries from images by identifying key events
and their associated entities. Specifically, given an input image, the model
must first classify the main visual events (verb classification), then identify
the participating entities and their semantic roles (semantic role labeling),
and finally localize these entities in the image (semantic role localization).
Existing methods treat verb classification as a single-label problem, but we
show through a comprehensive analysis that this formulation fails to address
the inherent ambiguity in visual event recognition, as multiple verb categories
may reasonably describe the same image. This paper makes three key
contributions: First, we reveal through empirical analysis that verb
classification is inherently a multi-label problem due to the ubiquitous
semantic overlap between verb categories. Second, given the impracticality of
fully annotating large-scale datasets with multiple labels, we propose to
reformulate verb classification as a single positive multi-label learning
(SPMLL) problem - a novel perspective in SR research. Third, we design a
comprehensive multi-label evaluation benchmark for SR that is carefully
designed to fairly evaluate model performance in a multi-label setting. To
address the challenges of SPMLL, we futher develop the Graph Enhanced Verb
Multilayer Perceptron (GE-VerbMLP), which combines graph neural networks to
capture label correlations and adversarial training to optimize decision
boundaries. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets show that our approach
achieves more than 3\% MAP improvement while remaining competitive on
traditional top-1 and top-5 accuracy metrics.

### [59] [DriveQA: Passing the Driving Knowledge Test](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21824)
*Maolin Wei,Wanzhou Liu,Eshed Ohn-Bar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DriveQA provides a comprehensive, open-source text+vision benchmark for driving knowledge, revealing strengths and gaps in LLM/MLLM reasoning about traffic rules and edge cases; fine-tuning and pretraining on DriveQA improve real-world driving QA tasks and downstream transfer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bridge the gap between standard driving QA benchmarks and real-world traffic knowledge. Assess how LLMs/MLLMs handle traffic rules, signage, right-of-way, and edge cases, and how data variations affect robustness and transfer to downstream driving tasks.

Method: Introduce DriveQA: an extensive text+vision benchmark of traffic regulations and scenarios; include DriveQA-V with controlled environmental variations; evaluate state-of-the-art LLMs/MLLMs; study effects of fine-tuning on DriveQA; study effects of pretraining on DriveQA; validate transfer to real-world datasets (nuScenes, BDD).

Result: LLMs/MLLMs perform well on basic traffic rules but show weaknesses in numerical reasoning, complex right-of-way scenarios, traffic sign variations, and spatial layouts. Fine-tuning on DriveQA improves accuracy across categories, especially regulatory sign recognition and intersection decisions. DriveQA-V reveals sensitivity to lighting, perspective, distance, and weather. Pretraining on DriveQA enhances downstream driving-task performance on real datasets, indicating internalization of text/synthetic traffic knowledge and better generalization to downstream QA tasks.

Conclusion: DriveQA is effective for training and evaluating driving-specific QA capabilities and generalization. Its synthetic and controlled variations help diagnose robustness, while pretraining on DriveQA translates into practical gains on real-world driving datasets.

Abstract: If a Large Language Model (LLM) were to take a driving knowledge test today,
would it pass? Beyond standard spatial and visual question-answering (QA) tasks
on current autonomous driving benchmarks, driving knowledge tests require a
complete understanding of all traffic rules, signage, and right-of-way
principles. To pass this test, human drivers must discern various edge cases
that rarely appear in real-world datasets. In this work, we present DriveQA, an
extensive open-source text and vision-based benchmark that exhaustively covers
traffic regulations and scenarios. Through our experiments using DriveQA, we
show that (1) state-of-the-art LLMs and Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) perform well on
basic traffic rules but exhibit significant weaknesses in numerical reasoning
and complex right-of-way scenarios, traffic sign variations, and spatial
layouts, (2) fine-tuning on DriveQA improves accuracy across multiple
categories, particularly in regulatory sign recognition and intersection
decision-making, (3) controlled variations in DriveQA-V provide insights into

### [60] [Fuzzy, Symbolic, and Contextual: Enhancing LLM Instruction via Cognitive Scaffolding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21204)
*Vanessa Figueiredo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Architectural inductive biases like symbolic scaffolding and short-term memory steer LLMs toward adaptive, structured reasoning in Socratic tutoring; memory and symbolic structure are crucial for abstraction and continuity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Investigate how architectural design choices shape cognitive behaviors and instructional strategies in LLMs, using a controlled, cognitive-grounded evaluation in tutoring settings.

Method: Five system variants with symbolic scaffolding and memory components are ablated to assess their impact. Outputs are evaluated with expert-designed rubrics covering scaffolding, responsiveness, symbolic reasoning, and conversational memory. An LLM-based evaluation framework aligned to a cognitively grounded rubric enables scalable, early-stage comparisons across variants.

Result: The full system consistently outperforms baselines. Removing memory or symbolic structure degrades key cognitive behaviors such as abstraction, adaptive probing, and conceptual continuity.

Conclusion: Findings support a processing-level account: architectural scaffolds reliably shape emergent instructional strategies in LLMs, and the proposed evaluation framework enables scalable comparisons in early-stage experimentation.

Abstract: We study how architectural inductive biases influence the cognitive behavior
of large language models (LLMs) in instructional dialogue. We introduce a
symbolic scaffolding mechanism paired with a short-term memory schema designed
to promote adaptive, structured reasoning in Socratic tutoring. Using
controlled ablation across five system variants, we evaluate model outputs via
expert-designed rubrics covering scaffolding, responsiveness, symbolic
reasoning, and conversational memory. We present preliminary results using an
LLM-based evaluation framework aligned to a cognitively grounded rubric. This
enables scalable, systematic comparisons across architectural variants in
early-stage experimentation. The preliminary results show that our full system
consistently outperforms baseline variants. Analysis reveals that removing
memory or symbolic structure degrades key cognitive behaviors, including
abstraction, adaptive probing, and conceptual continuity. These findings
support a processing-level account in which architectural scaffolds can
reliably shape emergent instructional strategies in LLMs.

TL;DR: GraphRAG is evaluated in the Alzheimer's domain against a standard GPT-4o model to assess quality and traceability, with a community-accessible Alzheimer's knowledge base and interface.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs suffer from hallucinations, limited domain-specific knowledge, and lack of explainability/traceability. GraphRAG integrates domain context before response generation to improve reliability, but its effectiveness in knowledge-dense biomedical domains (e.g., Alzheimer's) is under-studied.

Method: Build a GraphRAG knowledge base from a dataset of 50 Alzheimer's-related papers and 70 expert questions, use GPT-4o as the LLM to answer queries, compare GraphRAG outputs with standard GPT-4o, evaluate traceability across several RAG/GraphRAG systems, and provide a pre-built Alzheimer's disease database interface for researchers to test performance.

Result: The abstract describes a qualitative and comparative evaluation comparing GraphRAG to standard GPT-4o and discusses traceability; no specific quantitative results are provided in the abstract.

Conclusion: GraphRAG shows promise for enhancing reliability and traceability in domain-specific QA for Alzheimer's disease, and the authors provide an easy-to-use interface and dataset for researchers to test GraphRAG vs standard RAG.

Abstract: In the past two years, large language model (LLM)-based chatbots, such as
ChatGPT, have revolutionized various domains by enabling diverse task
completion and question-answering capabilities. However, their application in
scientific research remains constrained by challenges such as hallucinations,
limited domain-specific knowledge, and lack of explainability or traceability
for the response. Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (GraphRAG) has
emerged as a promising approach to improving chatbot reliability by integrating
domain-specific contextual information before response generation, addressing
some limitations of standard LLMs. Despite its potential, there are only
limited studies that evaluate GraphRAG on specific domains that require
intensive knowledge, like Alzheimer's disease or other biomedical domains. In
this paper, we assess the quality and traceability of two popular GraphRAG
systems. We compile a database of 50 papers and 70 expert questions related to
Alzheimer's disease, construct a GraphRAG knowledge base, and employ GPT-4o as
the LLM for answering queries. We then compare the quality of responses
generated by GraphRAG with those from a standard GPT-4o model. Additionally, we
discuss and evaluate the traceability of several Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG) and GraphRAG systems. Finally, we provide an easy-to-use interface with a
pre-built Alzheimer's disease database for researchers to test the performance
of both standard RAG and GraphRAG.

### [63] [Multi-Ontology Integration with Dual-Axis Propagation for Medical Concept Representation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21320)
*Mohsen Nayebi Kerdabadi,Arya Hadizadeh Moghaddam,Dongjie Wang,Zijun Yao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LINKO is an LLM-augmented, integrative ontology learning framework that jointly propagates knowledge within and across multiple medical ontologies to improve concept representations and EHR predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses fragmented use of single-ontology or isolated multi-ontology knowledge in medical concept embedding; aims to unify cross-ontology relationships to improve predictive models, especially with limited data and rare diseases.

Method: Init embeddings via LLM-based graph retrieval with concept descriptions and ontology context; perform dual-axis propagation: intra-ontology vertical (hierarchy levels) and inter-ontology horizontal (per level, across ontologies). Evaluate on two public datasets; acts as plug-in encoder for EHR models; robust to data scarcity.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on two datasets; improves predictive performance and robustness, particularly in low-data and rare-disease scenarios; demonstrates effective integration of multiple ontologies.

Conclusion: LINKO provides a unified, scalable approach to integrate heterogeneous medical ontologies using LLM-augmented initialization and dual-axis propagation, enhancing medical concept representations for EHR prediction and enabling robust downstream applications.

Abstract: Medical ontology graphs map external knowledge to medical codes in electronic
health records via structured relationships. By leveraging domain-approved
connections (e.g., parent-child), predictive models can generate richer medical
concept representations by incorporating contextual information from related
concepts. However, existing literature primarily focuses on incorporating
domain knowledge from a single ontology system, or from multiple ontology
systems (e.g., diseases, drugs, and procedures) in isolation, without
integrating them into a unified learning structure. Consequently, concept
representation learning often remains limited to intra-ontology relationships,
overlooking cross-ontology connections. In this paper, we propose LINKO, a
large language model (LLM)-augmented integrative ontology learning framework
that leverages multiple ontology graphs simultaneously by enabling dual-axis
knowledge propagation both within and across heterogeneous ontology systems to
enhance medical concept representation learning. Specifically, LINKO first
employs LLMs to provide a graph-retrieval-augmented initialization for ontology
concept embedding, through an engineered prompt that includes concept
descriptions, and is further augmented with ontology context. Second, our
method jointly learns the medical concepts in diverse ontology graphs by
performing knowledge propagation in two axes: (1) intra-ontology vertical
propagation across hierarchical ontology levels and (2) inter-ontology
horizontal propagation within every level in parallel. Last, through extensive
experiments on two public datasets, we validate the superior performance of
LINKO over state-of-the-art baselines. As a plug-in encoder compatible with
existing EHR predictive models, LINKO further demonstrates enhanced robustness
in scenarios involving limited data availability and rare disease prediction.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TiG reframes RL as language modeling, enabling LLMs to acquire procedural knowledge through interactive game environments, achieving competitive results with far lower data/computation and providing natural language explanations for decisions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bridges the gap between declarative world knowledge in LLMs and procedural, interactive decision-making; reduces data and computational demands of traditional RL while preserving reasoning capabilities.

Method: Introduce Think in Games (TiG); LLMs generate language-guided policies and explanations; reformulate RL as a language-modeling task; iteratively refine policies via online RL using environmental feedback.

Result: TiG successfully spans declarative and procedural knowledge, achieving competitive performance with dramatically lower data and compute than standard RL; offers step-by-step natural language explanations that enhance transparency and interpretability in interactive tasks.

Conclusion: TiG offers a viable approach to endow LLMs with procedural understanding through interactive learning, improving data efficiency and interpretability while retaining LLMs’ reasoning strengths.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at complex reasoning tasks such as
mathematics and coding, yet they frequently struggle with simple interactive
tasks that young children perform effortlessly. This discrepancy highlights a
critical gap between declarative knowledge (knowing about something) and
procedural knowledge (knowing how to do something). Although traditional
reinforcement learning (RL) agents can acquire procedural knowledge through
environmental interaction, they often operate as black boxes and require
substantial training data. In contrast, LLMs possess extensive world knowledge
and reasoning capabilities, but are unable to effectively convert this static
knowledge into dynamic decision-making in interactive settings. To address this
challenge, we propose Think in Games (TiG), a novel framework that empowers
LLMs to develop procedural understanding through direct interaction with game
environments, while retaining their inherent reasoning and explanatory
abilities. Specifically, TiG reformulates RL-based decision-making as a
language modeling task: LLMs generate language-guided policies, which are
refined iteratively through online reinforcement learning based on
environmental feedback. Our experimental results show that TiG successfully
bridges the gap between declarative and procedural knowledge, achieving
competitive performance with dramatically lower data and computational demands
compared to conventional RL methods. Moreover, TiG provides step-by-step
natural language explanations for its decisions, greatly improving transparency
and interpretability in complex interactive tasks.

### [65] [AHELM: A Holistic Evaluation of Audio-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21376)
*Tony Lee,Haoqin Tu,Chi Heem Wong,Zijun Wang,Siwei Yang,Yifan Mai,Yuyin Zhou,Cihang Xie,Percy Liang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AHELM provides a standardized, multi-aspect benchmark for audio-language models, aggregating datasets (including PARADE and CoRe-Bench) to assess 10 capabilities; evaluates 14 ALMs and baselines; Gemini 2.5 Pro excels in several areas but shows group unfairness; the benchmark is intended to be a living, transparent resource.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of standardized, cross-model evaluations across audio-language models, which currently measure limited capabilities and hinder fair comparisons.

Method: Aggregate diverse datasets into AHELM, including two synthetic datasets PARADE (stereotype avoidance) and CoRe-Bench (conversational, inferential QA); evaluate across 10 aspects; standardize prompts, inference parameters, and metrics; test 14 open-weight and closed-API ALMs plus baselines (ASR+LM).

Result: Gemini 2.5 Pro ranks top in 5/10 aspects but shows group unfairness on ASR tasks (p=0.01); baseline systems perform reasonably well (one ranking 5th overall with only speech-to-text); raw prompts, generations shared on website.

Conclusion: AHELM as a living benchmark; ongoing updates with new datasets/models; commitment to transparency and comparability.

Abstract: Evaluations of audio-language models (ALMs) -- multimodal models that take
interleaved audio and text as input and output text -- are hindered by the lack
of standardized benchmarks; most benchmarks measure only one or two
capabilities and omit evaluative aspects such as fairness or safety.
Furthermore, comparison across models is difficult as separate evaluations test
a limited number of models and use different prompting methods and inference
parameters. To address these shortfalls, we introduce AHELM, a benchmark that
aggregates various datasets -- including 2 new synthetic audio-text datasets
called PARADE, which evaluates the ALMs on avoiding stereotypes, and
CoRe-Bench, which measures reasoning over conversational audio through
inferential multi-turn question answering -- to holistically measure the
performance of ALMs across 10 aspects we have identified as important to the
development and usage of ALMs: audio perception, knowledge, reasoning, emotion
detection, bias, fairness, multilinguality, robustness, toxicity, and safety.
We also standardize the prompts, inference parameters, and evaluation metrics
to ensure equitable comparisons across models. We test 14 open-weight and
closed-API ALMs from 3 developers and 3 additional simple baseline systems each
consisting of an automatic speech recognizer and a language model. Our results
show that while Gemini 2.5 Pro ranks top in 5 out of 10 aspects, it exhibits
group unfairness ($p=0.01$) on ASR tasks whereas most of the other models do
not. We also find that the baseline systems perform reasonably well on AHELM,
with one ranking 5th overall despite having only speech-to-text capabilities.
For transparency, all raw prompts, model generations, and outputs are available
on our website at https://crfm.stanford.edu/helm/audio/v1.0.0. AHELM is
intended to be a living benchmark and new datasets and models will be added
over time.

development.

*Christoph Beierle,Alexander Hahn,Diana Howey,Gabriele Kern-Isberner,Kai Sauerwald*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A comprehensive study of forgetting in epistemic states; introduces five epistemic forgetting types, seven concrete operations for Spohn ranking functions, and an axiom-driven evaluation across logic-programming and AGM postulates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extend forgetting from propositional logic to richer epistemic semantics, to understand what forgetting means in epistemic backgrounds and to compare different forgetting operators.

Method: Propose five general epistemic forgetting types; instantiate seven concrete forgetting operations for Spohn's ranking functions; derive forgetting postulates inspired by logic programming and AGM theory; evaluate all concrete operations against all postulates.

Result: Provides a unified landscape of forgetting operators in epistemic settings, highlighting differences and commonalities; maps how ranking-function–based operations satisfy or violate the postulates across various axes.

Conclusion: Offers a principled framework for epistemic forgetting that connects established forgetting theories with richer epistemic semantics, enabling informed choices among operators and revealing how semantics shape forgetting behavior.

Abstract: Forgetting as a knowledge management operation deliberately ignores parts of
the knowledge and beliefs of an agent, for various reasons. Forgetting has many
facets, one may want to forget parts of the syntax, a proposition, or a
conditional. In the literature, two main operators suitable for performing
forgetting have been proposed and investigated in depth: First, variable
elimination is a syntactical method that blends out certain atomic variables to
focus on the rest of the language. It has been mainly used in the area of logic
programming and answer set programming. Second, contraction in AGM belief
revision theory effectively removes propositions from belief sets under logical
deduction. Both operations rely mainly on classical logics. In this article, we
take an epistemic perspective and study forgetting operations in epistemic
states with richer semantic structures, but with clear links to propositional
logic. This allows us to investigate what forgetting in the epistemic
background means, thereby lifting well-known and novel forgetting operations to
the epistemic level. We present five general types of epistemic forgetting and
instantiate them with seven concrete forgetting operations for Spohn's ranking
functions. We take inspiration from postulates of forgetting both from logic
programming and AGM theory to propose a rich landscape of axioms for evaluating
forgetting operations. Finally, we evaluate all concrete forgetting operations
according to all postulates, leading to a novel comprehensive overview
highlighting differences and commonalities among the forgetting operators.

### [69] [Learning Lifted Action Models From Traces of Incomplete Actions and States](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21449)
*Niklas Jansen,Jonas Gösgens,Hector Geffner*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes STRIPS+ and SYNTH for learning lifted STRIPS models from partial state-action traces where both states and actions are incomplete; proves correctness/completeness and demonstrates scalability on traces derived from STRIPS+ models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses realism: observed atoms partially specify STRIPS states and actions reveal but do not fully specify preconditions/effects; enables handling implicit action arguments and limited existential preconditions.

Method: Define STRIPS+ as a variant with implicit action arguments and existential-like preconditions; SYNTH builds a stratified conjunction of precondition queries per action to ground implicit arguments; learns STRIPS+ models from STRIPS+ traces; proves correctness and completeness; evaluates scalability on traces from existing STRIPS domains.

Result: Algorithm is proven correct and complete; scalability demonstrated on multiple traces; shows viability of learning STRIPS+ models from partial observations.

Conclusion: STRIPS+ and SYNTH enable realistic learning of lifted STRIPS models from partial observations, with theoretical guarantees and practical scalability; provides a foundation for future extensions to more expressive forms.

Abstract: Consider the problem of learning a lifted STRIPS model of the sliding-tile
puzzle from random state-action traces where the states represent the location
of the tiles only, and the actions are the labels up, down, left, and right,
with no arguments. Two challenges are involved in this problem. First, the
states are not full STRIPS states, as some predicates are missing, like the
atoms representing the position of the ``blank''. Second, the actions are not
full STRIPS either, as they do not reveal all the objects involved in the
actions effects and preconditions. Previous approaches have addressed different
versions of this model learning problem, but most assume that actions in the
traces are full STRIPS actions or that the domain predicates are all
observable. The new setting considered in this work is more ``realistic'', as
the atoms observed convey the state of the world but not full STRIPS states,
and the actions reveal the arguments needed for selecting the action but not
the ones needed for modeling it in STRIPS. For formulating and addressing the
learning problem, we introduce a variant of STRIPS, which we call STRIPS+,
where certain STRIPS action arguments can be left implicit in preconditions
which can also involve a limited form of existential quantification. The
learning problem becomes the problem of learning STRIPS+ models from STRIPS+
state-action traces. For this, the proposed learning algorithm, called SYNTH,
constructs a stratified sequence (conjunction) of precondition expressions or
``queries'' for each action, that denote unique objects in the state and ground
the implicit action arguments in STRIPS+. The correctness and completeness of
SYNTH is established, and its scalability is tested on state-action traces
obtained from STRIPS+ models derived from existing STRIPS domains.

*Xijia Tao,Yihua Teng,Xinxing Su,Xinyu Fu,Jihao Wu,Chaofan Tao,Ziru Liu,Haoli Bai,Rui Liu,Lingpeng Kong*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MMSearch-Plus introduces a 311-task multimodal browsing benchmark that requires iterative multimodal search and cross-verification, highlighting gaps in current models' fine-grained visual reasoning and long-horizon planning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many multimodal benchmarks can be solved by shallow, fixed workflows that exploit high-recall image search and local masking. There is a need for tasks that force genuinely multimodal reasoning, provenance verification, and long-horizon tool use.

Method: The authors present MMSearch-Plus, a model-agnostic agent framework with browsing tools and Spatial-Temporal Extrapolation to seed questions that require extrapolating from spatial cues and temporal traces. They evaluate a range of closed and open MLLMs on 311 tasks, measuring accuracy, bounding-box production, cropped-image search, and analyzing errors to identify failures in source verification, part-based reasoning, and long-horizon planning.

Result: The strongest agent (o3) achieves 15.1% accuracy without search and 36.0% with rollout under the framework; a strong open model (Qwen-2.5-VL-72B-Instruct) reaches 0.0% without search and 6.9% after 20 rounds of search.

Conclusion: The benchmark reveals persistent challenges in provenance verification, part-based and spatial-temporal reasoning, and long-horizon planning, underscoring the need for improved multimodal reasoning and search strategies in current LLM-based agents.

Abstract: Large multimodal language models (MLLMs) are increasingly deployed as web
agents, yet many multimodal browsing benchmarks can be solved by shallow, fixed
workflows that lean on high-recall image search and nearby text-masking the
genuinely multimodal challenges of fine-grained visual reasoning, provenance
verification, and long-horizon tool use. We introduce MMSearch-Plus, a
benchmark of 311 tasks that highly demand multimodal understanding while
preserving the difficulty profile of strong text-only browsing suites. Each
item is constructed to contain multiple weak, localized visual signals that
must be extracted, propagated through iterative text-image search, and
cross-validated under retrieval noise before answering. Our curation procedure,
Spatial-Temporal Extrapolation, seeds questions whose answers require
extrapolating from spatial cues (micro-text, part-level appearance, layouts,
signage) and temporal traces (broadcast overlays, seasonal context) to
out-of-image facts such as events, dates, and venues. We provide a
model-agnostic agent framework with browsing tools and evaluate a range of
closed and open MLLMs. The strongest agent (o3) attains 15.1% without search
and 36.0% accuracy with rollout under our framework, while a strong open-source
model (Qwen-2.5-VL-72B-Instruct) achieves 0.0% without search and 6.9% after 20
rounds of search. Beyond answer accuracy, we assess bounding-box production and
cropped-image search, and conduct an error analysis that surfaces failures in
source verification, part-based reasoning, and long-horizon planning.

*Sweta Kaman,Ankita Sharma,Romi Banerjee*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes a multidimensional, uncertainty-aware measure of wisdom using a fuzzy Z-number based inference system; demonstrates convergent/divergent validity with existing scales and potential AI applications for confidence-sensitive reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the limitations of self-report wisdom measures by incorporating multidimensionality and uncertainty, and explore how such a framework could enable more humane AI and safer, interpretable reasoning.

Method: Introduces a fuzzy inference system using Z-numbers where each decision is a pair: wisdom score and confidence. Involves N=100 participants exposed to culturally neutral pictorial moral dilemmas; think-aloud responses mapped to five wisdom components; 21 base rules; Gaussian kernel density estimation to tune membership functions.

Result: Proof-of-concept showing dual-attribute wisdom representations that modestly but significantly correlate with established wisdom scales and show negligible relations with unrelated traits, supporting convergent and divergent validity.

Conclusion: Formalizes wisdom as a multidimensional, uncertainty-conscious construct via Z-numbers, advancing psychological measurement and enabling AI systems with interpretable, confidence-sensitive reasoning that bridges strict computation and human judgment.

Abstract: Background: Wisdom is a superordinate construct that embraces perspective
taking, reflectiveness, prosocial orientation, reflective empathetic action,
and intellectual humility. Unlike conventional models of reasoning that are
rigidly bound by binary thinking, wisdom unfolds in shades of ambiguity,
requiring both graded evaluation and self-reflective humility. Current measures
depend on self-reports and seldom reflect the humility and uncertainty inherent
in wise reasoning. A computational framework that takes into account both
multidimensionality and confidence has the potential to improve psychological
science and allow humane AI. Method: We present a fuzzy inference system with Z
numbers, each of the decisions being expressed in terms of a wisdom score
(restriction) and confidence score (certainty). As part of this study,
participants (N = 100) were exposed to culturally neutral pictorial moral
dilemma tasks to which they generated think-aloud linguistic responses, which
were mapped into five theoretically based components of wisdom. The scores of
each individual component were combined using a base of 21 rules, with
membership functions tuned via Gaussian kernel density estimation. Results: In
a proof of concept study, the system produced dual attribute wisdom
representations that correlated modestly but significantly with established
scales while showing negligible relations with unrelated traits, supporting
convergent and divergent validity. Contribution: The contribution is to
formalize wisdom as a multidimensional, uncertainty-conscious construct,
operationalized in the form of Z-numbers. In addition to progressing
measurement in psychology, it calculates how fuzzy Z numbers can provide AI
systems with interpretable, confidence-sensitive reasoning that affords a safe,
middle ground between rigorous computation and human-like judgment.

### [72] [Counterfactual Scenarios for Automated Planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21521)
*Nicola Gigante,Francesco Leofante,Andrea Micheli*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A new framework for counterfactual explanations in automated planning that uses explicit plan-quantified counterfactual scenarios constrained by an LTL formula ψ; analyzes complexity and shows viability comparable to planning itself.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To move beyond simple plan-edit explanations and capture higher-level problem properties by generating minimal problem modifications that enable plans satisfying desired properties.

Method: Define planning problem P and LTL property ψ; present two qualitative counterfactual instantiations with explicit plan quantification; study the computational complexity under different modification types; argue viability and outline algorithmic directions.

Result: Characterizes the computational complexity of generating counterfactual scenarios; shows that producing such scenarios is often as expensive as computing a plan for P; provides a framework for practical algorithms.

Conclusion: Proposes a viable, scalable explanation paradigm for planning based on counterfactual scenarios with ψ, enabling minimal problem modifications to achieve desired plan properties and guiding algorithm design.

Abstract: Counterfactual Explanations (CEs) are a powerful technique used to explain
Machine Learning models by showing how the input to a model should be minimally
changed for the model to produce a different output. Similar proposals have
been made in the context of Automated Planning, where CEs have been
characterised in terms of minimal modifications to an existing plan that would
result in the satisfaction of a different goal. While such explanations may
help diagnose faults and reason about the characteristics of a plan, they fail
to capture higher-level properties of the problem being solved. To address this
limitation, we propose a novel explanation paradigm that is based on
counterfactual scenarios. In particular, given a planning problem $P$ and an
\ltlf formula $\psi$ defining desired properties of a plan, counterfactual
scenarios identify minimal modifications to $P$ such that it admits plans that
comply with $\psi$. In this paper, we present two qualitative instantiations of
counterfactual scenarios based on an explicit quantification over plans that
must satisfy $\psi$. We then characterise the computational complexity of
generating such counterfactual scenarios when different types of changes are
allowed on $P$. We show that producing counterfactual scenarios is often only
as expensive as computing a plan for $P$, thus demonstrating the practical
viability of our proposal and ultimately providing a framework to construct
practical algorithms in this area.

*Eduardo Illueca-Fernandez,Kaile Chen,Fernando Seoane,Farhad Abtahi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A GenAI framework (HealthProcessAI) wraps PM4PY/bupaR and uses multiple LLMs to automate interpretation and reporting of healthcare process mining; validated on sepsis data with varying LLM performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Barriers in healthcare process mining include technical complexity, lack of standardized approaches, and limited practical training resources, hindering adoption by clinicians and researchers.

Method: Develop HealthProcessAI as a wrapper around Python PM4PY and R bupaR; integrate five LLMs via OpenRouter for automated process map interpretation and report generation; validate on sepsis progression data across four proof-of-concept scenarios; assess LLMs with automated evaluators.

Result: The framework processed sepsis data across four scenarios with robust technical performance and produced automated reports; Claude Sonnet-4 and Gemini 2.5-Pro showed the highest consistency scores among the five LLMs (3.79/4.0 and 3.65/4.0) when evaluated by automated assessors.

Conclusion: Integrating multiple LLMs addresses unfamiliarity with process mining outputs, increasing accessibility for clinicians, data scientists, and researchers; represents a novel methodological advance in translating complex process mining results into actionable healthcare insights.

Abstract: Process mining has emerged as a powerful analytical technique for
understanding complex healthcare workflows. However, its application faces
significant barriers, including technical complexity, a lack of standardized
approaches, and limited access to practical training resources. We introduce
HealthProcessAI, a GenAI framework designed to simplify process mining
applications in healthcare and epidemiology by providing a comprehensive
wrapper around existing Python (PM4PY) and R (bupaR) libraries. To address
unfamiliarity and improve accessibility, the framework integrates multiple
Large Language Models (LLMs) for automated process map interpretation and
report generation, helping translate technical analyses into outputs that
diverse users can readily understand. We validated the framework using sepsis
progression data as a proof-of-concept example and compared the outputs of five
state-of-the-art LLM models through the OpenRouter platform. To test its
functionality, the framework successfully processed sepsis data across four
proof-of-concept scenarios, demonstrating robust technical performance and its
capability to generate reports through automated LLM analysis. LLM evaluation
using five independent LLMs as automated evaluators revealed distinct model
strengths: Claude Sonnet-4 and Gemini 2.5-Pro achieved the highest consistency
scores (3.79/4.0 and 3.65/4.0) when evaluated by automated LLM assessors. By
integrating multiple Large Language Models (LLMs) for automated interpretation
and report generation, the framework addresses widespread unfamiliarity with
process mining outputs, making them more accessible to clinicians, data
scientists, and researchers. This structured analytics and AI-driven
interpretation combination represents a novel methodological advance in
translating complex process mining results into potentially actionable insights
for healthcare applications.

### [74] [Revisiting Landmarks: Learning from Previous Plans to Generalize over Problem Instances](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21564)
*Issa Hanou,Sebastijan Dumančić,Mathijs de Weerdt*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A framework learns generalized landmarks from solved instances to guide planning across a domain, using state-function-based landmarks and a directed generalized landmark graph with loop handling; it transfers from small to larger instances and improves heuristic performance when repetitive subplans exist, yielding interpretable guidance for planners.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional landmark extraction is domain-predicate bound and often fails to generalize across problem instances. The goal is to capture reusable, object-independent goals that reflect repetitive structure in planning domains and to provide transferable heuristics.

Method: Introduce state functions that are domain-independent and apply to similar objects. Learn generalized landmarks from solved instances. Build a directed generalized landmark graph that encodes landmark progression and allows for loops to represent repetitive subplans. Use this graph to design a heuristic for solving new instances in the same domain.

Result: Generalized landmark graphs learned from a small set of solved instances perform well on larger instances within the same domain. Detecting loops that indicate repetition yields significant heuristic improvements over baselines. The approach yields interpretable domain information that can be discovered from few plans.

Conclusion: Generalized landmarks provide transferable, interpretable guidance for planning across similar domains. They can be learned from a limited set of plans and effectively support solving larger instances, especially when repetitive subplans are present.

Abstract: We propose a new framework for discovering landmarks that automatically
generalize across a domain. These generalized landmarks are learned from a set
of solved instances and describe intermediate goals for planning problems where
traditional landmark extraction algorithms fall short. Our generalized
landmarks extend beyond the predicates of a domain by using state functions
that are independent of the objects of a specific problem and apply to all
similar objects, thus capturing repetition. Based on these functions, we
construct a directed generalized landmark graph that defines the landmark
progression, including loop possibilities for repetitive subplans. We show how
to use this graph in a heuristic to solve new problem instances of the same
domain. Our results show that the generalized landmark graphs learned from a
few small instances are also effective for larger instances in the same domain.
If a loop that indicates repetition is identified, we see a significant
improvement in heuristic performance over the baseline. Generalized landmarks
capture domain information that is interpretable and useful to an automated
planner. This information can be discovered from a small set of plans for the
same domain.

### [75] [Scalable Solution Methods for Dec-POMDPs with Deterministic Dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21595)
*Yang You,Alex Schutz,Zhikun Li,Bruno Lacerda,Robert Skilton,Nick Hawes*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes a deterministic subclass of Dec-POMDPs (Det-Dec-POMDPs) and a scalable iterative planner (IDPP) built on JESP for large-scale multi-agent planning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-level multi-agent planning problems (e.g., multi-robot navigation) are often well modeled with deterministic transitions and observations, but existing Dec-POMDP solvers struggle with scale. There is a need for a practical, scalable solver.

Method: Define Det-Dec-POMDP as Dec-POMDP with deterministic state transitions and deterministic observations conditioned on the state and joint actions. Introduce Iterative Deterministic POMDP Planning (IDPP), a practical solver built on the Joint Equilibrium Search for Policies (JESP) framework, optimized to handle large Det-Dec-POMDP instances.

Result: IDPP provides a scalable solution approach capable of tackling larger Det-Dec-POMDP problems than current Dec-POMDP solvers, by leveraging determinism and an iterative planning structure.

Conclusion: The combination of Det-Dec-POMDPs and IDPP offers a tractable framework for deterministic multi-agent planning, enabling efficient planning in domains such as multi-robot navigation and path planning.

Abstract: Many high-level multi-agent planning problems, including multi-robot
navigation and path planning, can be effectively modeled using deterministic
actions and observations.
  In this work, we focus on such domains and introduce the class of
Deterministic Decentralized POMDPs (Det-Dec-POMDPs). This is a subclass of
Dec-POMDPs characterized by deterministic transitions and observations
conditioned on the state and joint actions.
  We then propose a practical solver called Iterative Deterministic POMDP
Planning (IDPP). This method builds on the classic Joint Equilibrium Search for
Policies framework and is specifically optimized to handle large-scale
Det-Dec-POMDPs that current Dec-POMDP solvers are unable to address
efficiently.

### [76] [Integrating Large Language Models with Network Optimization for Interactive and Explainable Supply Chain Planning: A Real-World Case Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21622)
*Saravanan Venkatachalam*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: An integrated framework fusing traditional network optimization with LLMs to provide interactive, explainable, and role-aware supply chain planning; MILP inventory redistribution across multi-period/multi-item networks; AI agents and UI for real-time insights; case study shows improved stockouts, costs, and service levels; future work includes private LLMs, transfer learning, RL, and Bayesian nets.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bridge the gap between complex optimization outputs and business stakeholders; enhance explainability, adaptability, and real-time decision support in supply chain planning.

Method: A hybrid architecture combining a mixed-integer linear programming model for tactical inventory redistribution with AI agents, RESTful APIs, and a dynamic user interface. LLMs generate natural language summaries, contextual visualizations, and tailored KPIs to support configuration updates and simulation-based insights.

Result: Case study demonstrates improvements in planning outcomes by preventing stockouts, reducing costs, and maintaining service levels.

Conclusion: Future extensions include integrating private LLMs, transfer learning, reinforcement learning, and Bayesian neural networks to enhance explainability, adaptability, and real-time decision-making.

Abstract: This paper presents an integrated framework that combines traditional network
optimization models with large language models (LLMs) to deliver interactive,
explainable, and role-aware decision support for supply chain planning. The
proposed system bridges the gap between complex operations research outputs and
business stakeholder understanding by generating natural language summaries,
contextual visualizations, and tailored key performance indicators (KPIs). The
core optimization model addresses tactical inventory redistribution across a
network of distribution centers for multi-period and multi-item, using a
mixed-integer formulation. The technical architecture incorporates AI agents,
RESTful APIs, and a dynamic user interface to support real-time interaction,
configuration updates, and simulation-based insights. A case study demonstrates
how the system improves planning outcomes by preventing stockouts, reducing
costs, and maintaining service levels. Future extensions include integrating
private LLMs, transfer learning, reinforcement learning, and Bayesian neural
networks to enhance explainability, adaptability, and real-time
decision-making.

### [77] [A-MHA*: Anytime Multi-Heuristic A*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21637)
*Ramkumar Natarajan,Muhammad Suhail Saleem,William Xiao,Sandip Aine,Howie Choset,Maxim Likhachev*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: An anytime extension of Multi-Heuristic A* (A-MHA*) that uses Anytime Repairing A* ideas to quickly find a feasible suboptimal solution and steadily improve it, while preserving suboptimality and completeness guarantees; demonstrated in 3-D path planning and sliding tile puzzle, outperforming MHA* and other anytime algorithms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Heuristic search researchers seek informative heuristics that are not only admissible but domain-right; MHA* can leverage multiple inadmissible heuristics for speed but is a one-shot method, lacking time-based improvement. An anytime version is desirable to obtain quick solutions and progressively improve them without sacrificing guarantees.

Method: Extend the MHA* framework by incorporating ARA*-style inflation and refinement concepts to enable an anytime search. Provide theoretical proofs that the adapted algorithm preserves the suboptimality bounds and completeness of the original MHA*, while enabling iterative improvement of the solution as time progresses. Implement and evaluate A-MHA* against MHA* and other anytime algorithms in 3-D path planning and sliding tile puzzles.

Result: A-MHA* yields quick feasible suboptimal solutions and continuously improves the solution over time. Empirical results show improved performance compared to MHA* and other anytime algorithms in the tested domains (3-D path planning and sliding tiles).

Conclusion: A-MHA* successfully integrates anytime capabilities into the MHA* framework without sacrificing theoretical guarantees, providing faster initial solutions and ongoing improvements. This approach broadens the applicability of multi-heuristic search to time-bounded planning problems.

Abstract: Designing good heuristic functions for graph search requires adequate domain
knowledge. It is often easy to design heuristics that perform well and
correlate with the underlying true cost-to-go values in certain parts of the
search space but these may not be admissible throughout the domain thereby
affecting the optimality guarantees of the search. Bounded suboptimal search
using several such partially good but inadmissible heuristics was developed in
Multi-Heuristic A* (MHA*). Although MHA* leverages multiple inadmissible
heuristics to potentially generate a faster suboptimal solution, the original
version does not improve the solution over time. It is a one shot algorithm
that requires careful setting of inflation factors to obtain a desired one time
solution. In this work, we tackle this issue by extending MHA* to an anytime
version that finds a feasible suboptimal solution quickly and continually
improves it until time runs out. Our work is inspired from the Anytime
Repairing A* (ARA*) algorithm. We prove that our precise adaptation of ARA*
concepts in the MHA* framework preserves the original suboptimal and
completeness guarantees and enhances MHA* to perform in an anytime fashion.
Furthermore, we report the performance of A-MHA* in 3-D path planning domain
and sliding tiles puzzle and compare against MHA* and other anytime algorithms.

### [78] [Leveraging Imperfection with MEDLEY A Multi-Model Approach Harnessing Bias in Medical AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21648)
*Farhad Abtahi,Mehdi Astaraki,Fernando Seoane*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MEDLEY uses a diverse ensemble of over 30 language models to preserve disagreement and latent biases, treating hallucinations as provisional hypotheses for clinician verification; a synthetic-case proof-of-concept shows how structured diversity surfaces diagnostic uncertainty, though it is not clinically validated.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bias in AI is often treated as a defect to eliminate, but human reasoning is inherently biased; leveraging diverse model outputs could enhance medical reasoning, transparency, and oversight rather than suppressing disagreement.

Method: MEDLEY orchestrates multiple AI models, documents model-specific biases, preserves minority outputs, and reframes hallucinations as provisional hypotheses for clinician verification. A proof-of-concept with 30+ LLMs and synthetic cases demonstrates preserving both consensus and minority views to surface diagnostic uncertainty.

Result: A demonstrator preserves consensus and minority views, making diagnostic uncertainty and latent biases transparent for clinical oversight. It shows the feasibility of structured diversity but is not yet a validated clinical tool.

Conclusion: Reframing AI imperfection as a resource can enable new regulatory, ethical, and innovation pathways for trustworthy medical AI, shifting from bias suppression to principled management of diversity.

Abstract: Bias in medical artificial intelligence is conventionally viewed as a defect
requiring elimination. However, human reasoning inherently incorporates biases
shaped by education, culture, and experience, suggesting their presence may be
inevitable and potentially valuable. We propose MEDLEY (Medical Ensemble
Diagnostic system with Leveraged diversitY), a conceptual framework that
orchestrates multiple AI models while preserving their diverse outputs rather
than collapsing them into a consensus. Unlike traditional approaches that
suppress disagreement, MEDLEY documents model-specific biases as potential
strengths and treats hallucinations as provisional hypotheses for clinician
verification. A proof-of-concept demonstrator was developed using over 30 large
language models, creating a minimum viable product that preserved both
consensus and minority views in synthetic cases, making diagnostic uncertainty
and latent biases transparent for clinical oversight. While not yet a validated
clinical tool, the demonstration illustrates how structured diversity can
enhance medical reasoning under clinician supervision. By reframing AI
imperfection as a resource, MEDLEY offers a paradigm shift that opens new
regulatory, ethical, and innovation pathways for developing trustworthy medical
AI systems.

### [79] [PosterForest: Hierarchical Multi-Agent Collaboration for Scientific Poster Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21720)
*Jiho Choi,Seojeong Park,Seongjong Song,Hyunjung Shim*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A training-free framework PosterForest for automated scientific poster generation that uses a hierarchical Poster Tree to jointly encode document structure and visual-textual relations. It employs multi-agent collaboration (content summarization and layout planning) to optimize logical consistency, content fidelity, and visual coherence, achieving results close to expert posters across domains and outperforming baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior approaches largely neglect the hierarchical structure of scientific documents and the semantic integration of textual and visual elements; there is a need for a method that handles both without requiring training data.

Method: Introduce Poster Tree, a hierarchical intermediate representation; a multi-agent collaboration framework with agents for content summarization and layout planning; iterative mutual feedback to jointly optimize logical consistency, content fidelity, and visual coherence; training-free.

Result: Experiments across multiple academic domains show state-of-the-art performance, outperforming baselines in qualitative and quantitative metrics; posters achieve quality closest to expert ground truth with better information preservation, structural clarity, and user preference.

Conclusion: PosterForest demonstrates that a training-free, structure-aware, multi-agent approach can effectively generate high-quality scientific posters by integrating document structure and visual-textual relationships.

Abstract: We present a novel training-free framework, \textit{PosterForest}, for
automated scientific poster generation. Unlike prior approaches, which largely
neglect the hierarchical structure of scientific documents and the semantic
integration of textual and visual elements, our method addresses both
challenges directly. We introduce the \textit{Poster Tree}, a hierarchical
intermediate representation that jointly encodes document structure and
visual-textual relationships at multiple levels. Our framework employs a
multi-agent collaboration strategy, where agents specializing in content
summarization and layout planning iteratively coordinate and provide mutual
feedback. This approach enables the joint optimization of logical consistency,
content fidelity, and visual coherence. Extensive experiments on multiple
academic domains show that our method outperforms existing baselines in both
qualitative and quantitative evaluations. The resulting posters achieve quality
closest to expert-designed ground truth and deliver superior information
preservation, structural clarity, and user preference.

### [80] [Freeze and Conquer: Reusable Ansatz for Solving the Traveling Salesman Problem](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21730)
*Fabrizio Fagiolo,Nicolo' Vescera*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Variational TSP with compact permutation encoding and an optimize-freeze-reuse strategy; high success on small instances but scalability issues beyond 6–7 cities; reduces qubit count and time-to-solution; potential extensions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable practical quantum optimization for TSP on NISQ hardware by reducing qubit requirements and removing repeated architecture search, while promoting generalization across instances.

Method: Use a compact permutation encoding; optimize the circuit topology (Ansatz) on a training instance via Simulated Annealing; freeze the topology and reuse it on new instances, re-optimizing only circuit parameters; test on 40 randomly generated symmetric TSP instances with 4–7 cities.

Result: Average probability of sampling the optimal tour: 100% for 4 cities, 90% for 5 cities, 80% for 6 cities, and ~20% for 7 cities. Indicates robust generalization for moderate sizes and notable scalability limitations; freezing drastically reduces time-to-solution without degrading solution quality.

Conclusion: Freezing the Ansatz yields substantial time-to-solution gains and maintains solution quality for moderate problem sizes, but scalability is limited; discusses warm-start effects and potential extensions to related problems like Vehicle Routing and Job-Shop Scheduling.

Abstract: In this paper we present a variational algorithm for the Traveling Salesman
Problem (TSP) that combines (i) a compact encoding of permutations, which
reduces the qubit requirement too, (ii) an optimize-freeze-reuse strategy:
where the circuit topology (``Ansatz'') is first optimized on a training
instance by Simulated Annealing (SA), then ``frozen'' and re-used on novel
instances, limited to a rapid re-optimization of only the circuit parameters.
This pipeline eliminates costly structural research in testing, making the
procedure immediately implementable on NISQ hardware.
  On a set of $40$ randomly generated symmetric instances that span $4 - 7$
cities, the resulting Ansatz achieves an average optimal trip sampling
probability of $100\%$ for 4 city cases, $90\%$ for 5 city cases and $80\%$ for
6 city cases. With 7 cities the success rate drops markedly to an average of
$\sim 20\%$, revealing the onset of scalability limitations of the proposed
method.
  The results show robust generalization ability for moderate problem sizes and
indicate how freezing the Ansatz can dramatically reduce time-to-solution
without degrading solution quality. The paper also discusses scalability
limitations, the impact of ``warm-start'' initialization of parameters, and
prospects for extension to more complex problems, such as Vehicle Routing and
Job-Shop Scheduling.

### [81] [Tree-Guided Diffusion Planner](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21800)
*Hyeonseong Jeon,Cheolhong Min,Jaesik Park*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Tree-guided Diffusion Planner (TDP) enables zero-shot test-time planning by combining training-free particle guidance for diverse trajectories with fast conditional denoising guided by task rewards; it overcomes gradient guidance limits and outperforms baselines on three tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Gradient-guided planning struggles with non-convex, non-differentiable objectives and multi-reward settings; existing supervised planning requires task-specific training, limiting flexibility and zero-shot generalization.

Method: Frame planning as tree search with bi-level sampling. Generate diverse parent trajectories using training-free particle guidance for exploration; refine sub-trajectories with fast conditional denoising conditioned on task objectives; rely exclusively on pretrained diffusion models and test-time reward signals.

Result: Empirically outperforms state-of-the-art methods on three tasks: maze gold-picking, robot arm block manipulation, and AntMaze multi-goal exploration; demonstrates improved exploration and solution quality in test-time planning.

Conclusion: TDP provides a zero-shot planning framework that leverages pretrained diffusion models to balance exploration and exploitation, expanding the feasible solution space and enabling effective test-time planning without task-specific training.

Abstract: Planning with pretrained diffusion models has emerged as a promising approach
for solving test-time guided control problems. However, standard gradient
guidance typically performs optimally under convex and differentiable reward
landscapes, showing substantially reduced effectiveness in real-world scenarios
involving non-convex objectives, non-differentiable constraints, and
multi-reward structures. Furthermore, recent supervised planning approaches
require task-specific training or value estimators, which limits test-time
flexibility and zero-shot generalization. We propose a Tree-guided Diffusion
Planner (TDP), a zero-shot test-time planning framework that balances
exploration and exploitation through structured trajectory generation. We frame
test-time planning as a tree search problem using a bi-level sampling process:
(1) diverse parent trajectories are produced via training-free particle
guidance to encourage broad exploration, and (2) sub-trajectories are refined
through fast conditional denoising guided by task objectives. TDP addresses the
limitations of gradient guidance by exploring diverse trajectory regions and
harnessing gradient information across this expanded solution space using only
pretrained models and test-time reward signals. We evaluate TDP on three
diverse tasks: maze gold-picking, robot arm block manipulation, and AntMaze
multi-goal exploration. TDP consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
approaches on all tasks. The project page can be found at:

### [82] [Orientability of Causal Relations in Time Series using Summary Causal Graphs and Faithful Distributions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21742)
*Timothée Loranchet,Charles K. Assaad*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper provides theoretical conditions to orient micro-level causal edges between temporal variables using a summary causal graph (SCG) with a faithful, causally sufficient distribution, even when macro-level graphs contain cycles or bidirected edges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In time series with partial knowledge of the causal structure, experts often supply a high-level SCG. The work seeks when such SCGs can yield identifiable micro-level edge directions, improving causal discovery from observational data.

Method: Derives (graphical) conditions linking SCG structure and the assumed distribution to the identifiability/orientability of micro-level edges; handles cycles and bidirected macro-edges; relies on assumptions of faithfulness and causal sufficiency.

Result: Theoretical guarantees that micro-edge orientation is possible under the stated conditions; provides guidance for using SCGs to inform causal discovery in complex temporal systems.

Conclusion: Incorporating expert-provided SCGs enhances causal inference in temporal data by enabling micro-edge orientation even without a fully specified full graph, under faithfulness and causal sufficiency assumptions.

Abstract: Understanding causal relations between temporal variables is a central
challenge in time series analysis, particularly when the full causal structure
is unknown. Even when the full causal structure cannot be fully specified,
experts often succeed in providing a high-level abstraction of the causal
graph, known as a summary causal graph, which captures the main causal
relations between different time series while abstracting away micro-level
details. In this work, we present conditions that guarantee the orientability
of micro-level edges between temporal variables given the background knowledge
encoded in a summary causal graph and assuming having access to a faithful and
causally sufficient distribution with respect to the true unknown graph. Our
results provide theoretical guarantees for edge orientation at the micro-level,
even in the presence of cycles or bidirected edges at the macro-level. These
findings offer practical guidance for leveraging SCGs to inform causal
discovery in complex temporal systems and highlight the value of incorporating
expert knowledge to improve causal inference from observational time series
data.

*Yeawon Lee,Xiaoyang Wang,Christopher C. Yang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A collaborative multi-agent system for clinical narrative interpretation improves detection of key conditions by simulating a clinical team debate, outperforming single-agent baselines on MIMIC-III notes, with caveats about groupthink.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robustness and interpretability in clinical NLP tasks; address brittleness of single-model approaches by leveraging diverse expert agents to mimic diagnostic reasoning.

Method: Manager agent coordinates a team of specialist agents; analysis restricted to S and O sections of SOAP notes; dynamic, hierarchical, iterative debate to reach consensus; evaluation on 420 MIMIC-III notes; comparison to a single-agent baseline.

Result: Improved identification of congestive heart failure, acute kidney injury, and sepsis; qualitative debates reveal evidence weighing; some susceptibility to groupthink.

Conclusion: Clinical-team-inspired MAS shows promise for accurate, robust, and interpretable clinical decision support, with limitations and room for improvement.

Abstract: Accurate interpretation of clinical narratives is critical for patient care,
but the complexity of these notes makes automation challenging. While Large
Language Models (LLMs) show promise, single-model approaches can lack the
robustness required for high-stakes clinical tasks. We introduce a
collaborative multi-agent system (MAS) that models a clinical consultation team
to address this gap. The system is tasked with identifying clinical problems by
analyzing only the Subjective (S) and Objective (O) sections of SOAP notes,
simulating the diagnostic reasoning process of synthesizing raw data into an
assessment. A Manager agent orchestrates a dynamically assigned team of
specialist agents who engage in a hierarchical, iterative debate to reach a
consensus. We evaluated our MAS against a single-agent baseline on a curated
dataset of 420 MIMIC-III notes. The dynamic multi-agent configuration
demonstrated consistently improved performance in identifying congestive heart
failure, acute kidney injury, and sepsis. Qualitative analysis of the agent
debates reveals that this structure effectively surfaces and weighs conflicting
evidence, though it can occasionally be susceptible to groupthink. By modeling
a clinical team's reasoning process, our system offers a promising path toward
more accurate, robust, and interpretable clinical decision support tools.

*Thanasis Schoinas,Benjamin Guinard,Diba Esbati,Richard Chalk*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Hybrid pipeline for clustering transaction counterparties using string similarity, topic modeling, hierarchical clustering, and rules; handles unknown cluster counts; outperforms keyword baselines and supports investigator workflows.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the lack of NLP-ready clustering for unstructured, noisy counterparty fields in banking messages; provide interpretable, scalable grouping to support anti-fraud/sanctions investigations and reduce manual review.

Method: A hybrid workflow combining string similarity measures to capture name variations, topic modeling for latent themes, hierarchical clustering for flexible grouping, and rule-based components; accommodates an unknown number of clusters; evaluation relies on precision/recall-based metrics on a real-life labeled dataset.

Result: Significant improvement over a baseline keyword approach; retains interpretability; reduces manual review; enhances risk control in sanctions investigations by better identifying entity variations.

Conclusion: The approach offers an effective, interpretable clustering framework that bridges NLP techniques with traditional rule-based systems, suitable for tracing transaction originators/beneficiaries and funds, and scalable to varying cluster counts.

Abstract: Short text clustering is a known use case in the text analytics community.
When the structure and content falls in the natural language domain e.g.
Twitter posts or instant messages, then natural language techniques can be
used, provided texts are of sufficient length to allow for use of (pre)trained
models to extract meaningful information, such as part-of-speech or topic
annotations. However, natural language models are not suitable for clustering
transaction counterparties, as they are found in bank payment messaging
systems, such as SWIFT. The manually typed tags are typically physical or legal
entity details, which lack sentence structure, while containing all the
variations and noise that manual entry introduces. This leaves a gap in an
investigator or counter-fraud professional's toolset when looking to augment
their knowledge of payment flow originator and beneficiary entities and trace
funds and assets. A gap that vendors traditionally try to close with fuzzy
matching tools. With these considerations in mind, we are proposing a hybrid
string similarity, topic modelling, hierarchical clustering and rule-based
pipeline to facilitate clustering of transaction counterparties, also catering
for unknown number of expected clusters. We are also devising metrics to
supplement the evaluation of the approach, based on the well-known measures of
precision and recall. Testing on a real-life labelled dataset demonstrates
significantly improved performance over a baseline rule-based ('keyword')
approach. The approach retains most of the interpretability found in rule-based
systems, as the former adds an additional level of cluster refinement to the
latter. The resulting workflow reduces the need for manual review. When only a
subset of the population needs to be investigated, such as in sanctions
investigations, the approach allows for better control of the risks of missing
entity variations.

### [85] [Beyond Prediction: Reinforcement Learning as the Defining Leap in Healthcare AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21101)
*Dilruk Perera,Gousia Habib,Qianyi Xu,Daniel J. Tan,Kai He,Erik Cambria,Mengling Feng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A comprehensive survey positioning reinforcement learning in healthcare as a move from predictive models to agentive decision-making, detailing data fusion across modalities, architectures (centralized, federated, edge), method variants (model-based/free, offline/batch, reward design, uncertainty), broad applications, and a critical appraisal of ethics, deployment, and reward design, culminating in a roadmap for safe, human-aligned policy learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To unlock long-horizon clinical decision-making and interventions by RL, addressing limitations of fixed-association predictors and leveraging multi-source data with real-time constraints to improve patient outcomes and workflow efficiency.

Method: Survey-style synthesis of RL techniques (model-based/model-free, offline/batch, reward specification, and uncertainty calibration) applied to healthcare, with a multi-dimensional analysis of data fusion levels (signals, features, decisions), architectures (centralized, federated, edge), and a taxonomy of applications (critical care, chronic disease, mental health, diagnostics, robotics). Critical evaluation of challenges and synthesis of lessons for safe, human-aligned policy learning.

Result: Identifies trends (growing RL adoption in healthcare), gaps (evaluation in real-world settings, generalization, data sharing), and bottlenecks (ethical, deployment, reward design). Provides a critical analysis of design challenges and actionable lessons, framing RL as safe, agentive clinical intelligence rather than mere predictors.

Conclusion: RL in healthcare is transformative but contingent on robust safety, alignment with clinical values, and practical deployment strategies. The paper offers a technical roadmap and reflective guidance toward agentive, human-aligned policy learning rather than traditional prediction models.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) marks a fundamental shift in how artificial
intelligence is applied in healthcare. Instead of merely predicting outcomes,
RL actively decides interventions with long term goals. Unlike traditional
models that operate on fixed associations, RL systems learn through trial,
feedback, and long-term reward optimization, introducing transformative
possibilities and new risks. From an information fusion lens, healthcare RL
typically integrates multi-source signals such as vitals, labs clinical notes,
imaging and device telemetry using temporal and decision-level mechanisms.
These systems can operate within centralized, federated, or edge architectures
to meet real-time clinical constraints, and naturally span data, features and
decision fusion levels. This survey explore RL's rise in healthcare as more
than a set of tools, rather a shift toward agentive intelligence in clinical
environments. We first structure the landscape of RL techniques including
model-based and model-free methods, offline and batch-constrained approaches,
and emerging strategies for reward specification and uncertainty calibration
through the lens of healthcare constraints. We then comprehensively analyze RL
applications spanning critical care, chronic disease, mental health,
diagnostics, and robotic assistance, identifying their trends, gaps, and
translational bottlenecks. In contrast to prior reviews, we critically analyze
RL's ethical, deployment, and reward design challenges, and synthesize lessons
for safe, human-aligned policy learning. This paper serves as both a a
technical roadmap and a critical reflection of RL's emerging transformative
role in healthcare AI not as prediction machinery, but as agentive clinical
intelligence.

### [86] [Spatiotemporal EEG-Based Emotion Recognition Using SAM Ratings from Serious Games with Hybrid Deep Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21103)
*Abdul Rehman,Ilona Heldal,Jerry Chun-Wei Lin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A unified multigranularity EEG emotion classification framework on GAMEEMO; LSTM-GRU achieves high performance across binary valence, multi-class, and multi-label tasks, addressing generalizability beyond binary/subject-specific approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current EEG emotion studies are limited to binary valence or subject-specific classification, hindering generalizability; a multigranularity, subject-independent framework on a richer dataset is needed for real-world affective computing.

Method: Preprocessing with temporal window segmentation; hybrid statistical and frequency-domain features; z-score normalization; labels encoded into three axes (binary valence, multi-class, and 10-class ordinal multi-label). Evaluated models include RF, XGBoost, SVM, and deep architectures (LSTM, LSTM-GRU, CNN-LSTM) on the GAMEEMO dataset (14-channel EEG, 28 subjects, 4 gameplay scenarios).

Result: LSTM-GRU consistently outperforms others, achieving F1=0.932 for binary valence, and 94.5% and 90.6% in multi-class and multi-label emotion classification.

Conclusion: Demonstrates a generalizable, multigranularity EEG emotion classification framework on GAMEEMO; confirms effectiveness of LSTM-GRU and the value of multi-axis labeling for affective computing deployment.

Abstract: Recent advancements in EEG-based emotion recognition have shown promising
outcomes using both deep learning and classical machine learning approaches;
however, most existing studies focus narrowly on binary valence prediction or
subject-specific classification, which limits generalizability and deployment
in real-world affective computing systems. To address this gap, this paper
presents a unified, multigranularity EEG emotion classification framework built
on the GAMEEMO dataset, which consists of 14-channel EEG recordings and
continuous self-reported emotion ratings (boring, horrible, calm, and funny)
from 28 subjects across four emotion-inducing gameplay scenarios. Our pipeline
employs a structured preprocessing strategy that comprises temporal window
segmentation, hybrid statistical and frequency-domain feature extraction, and
z-score normalization to convert raw EEG signals into robust, discriminative
input vectors. Emotion labels are derived and encoded across three
complementary axes: (i) binary valence classification based on the averaged
polarity of positive and negative emotion ratings, and (ii) Multi-class emotion
classification, where the presence of the most affective state is predicted.
(iii) Fine-grained multi-label representation via binning each emotion into 10
ordinal classes. We evaluate a broad spectrum of models, including Random
Forest, XGBoost, and SVM, alongside deep neural architectures such as LSTM,
LSTM-GRU, and CNN-LSTM. Among these, the LSTM-GRU model consistently
outperforms the others, achieving an F1-score of 0.932 in the binary valence
task and 94.5% and 90.6% in both multi-class and Multi-Label emotion
classification.

*Wenfeng Feng,Penghong Zhao,Guochao Jiang,Chuzhan Hao,Yuewei Zhang,Hao Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PVPO introduces an advantage reference anchor and data pre-sampling to make critic-free group-policy RL more data-efficient, reducing rollouts and intra-policy bias, achieving SOTA on nine datasets across two domains with robust generalization and scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Critic-free RL with group policies faces high sampling burden and bias from intra-policy comparisons, risking local optima and costly training.

Method: Train a reference model to rollout in advance and derive a reward-based anchor; use this to correct cumulative bias from intra-group comparisons; perform data pre-sampling using the reference model to gauge sample difficulty and select high-gain data.

Result: Empirical evaluation on nine datasets across two domains shows State-of-the-Art performance; results indicate strong generalization across tasks and scalability across model sizes.

Conclusion: PVPO reduces dependence on extensive rollouts, improves training efficiency and stability, and generalizes well across tasks and model scales.

Abstract: Critic-free reinforcement learning methods, particularly group policies, have
attracted considerable attention for their efficiency in complex tasks.
However, these methods rely heavily on multiple sampling and comparisons within
the policy to estimate advantage, which may cause the policy to fall into local
optimum and increase computational cost. To address these issues, we propose
PVPO, an efficient reinforcement learning method enhanced by an advantage
reference anchor and data pre-sampling. Specifically, we use the reference
model to rollout in advance and employ the calculated reward score as a
reference anchor. Our approach effectively corrects the cumulative bias
introduced by intra-group comparisons and significantly reduces reliance on the
number of rollouts. Meanwhile, the reference model can assess sample difficulty
during data pre-sampling, enabling effective selection of high-gain data to
improve training efficiency. Experiments conducted on nine datasets across two
domains demonstrate that PVPO achieves State-Of-The-Art (SOTA) performance. Our
approach not only demonstrates robust generalization across multiple tasks, but
also exhibits scalable performance across models of varying scales.

### [88] [Dynamic Low-rank Approximation of Full-Matrix Preconditioner for Training Generalized Linear Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21106)
*Tatyana Matveeva,Aleksandr Katrutsa,Evgeny Frolov*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AdaGram is a scalable full-matrix adaptive gradient optimizer that uses fast symmetric factorization and low-rank preconditioners, enabling full-matrix-style updates at low rank. It achieves faster convergence or matches diagonal adaptive methods on standard tasks at rank as small as 5.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diagonal/adagrad-style adaptive methods fail to capture parameter correlations; full-matrix methods can model these correlations for faster convergence but are computationally and memory-intensive. There is a need for scalable full-matrix adaptive optimization for large-scale models.

Method: AdaGram uses fast symmetric factorization to compute the preconditioned update efficiently and maintains a low-rank preconditioner along the optimization trajectory using matrix integrator methods, preserving tractable memory and compute costs while approximating full-matrix behavior.

Result: Numerical experiments on standard machine learning tasks show that AdaGram converges faster or matches the performance of diagonal adaptive optimizers when using rank five and smaller rank approximations.

Conclusion: AdaGram demonstrates the potential of scalable full-matrix adaptive optimization for large models, offering competitive performance with significantly reduced rank-based approximations.

Abstract: Adaptive gradient methods like Adagrad and its variants are widespread in
large-scale optimization. However, their use of diagonal preconditioning
matrices limits the ability to capture parameter correlations. Full-matrix
adaptive methods, approximating the exact Hessian, can model these correlations
and may enable faster convergence. At the same time, their computational and
memory costs are often prohibitive for large-scale models. To address this
limitation, we propose AdaGram, an optimizer that enables efficient full-matrix
adaptive gradient updates. To reduce memory and computational overhead, we
utilize fast symmetric factorization for computing the preconditioned update
direction at each iteration. Additionally, we maintain the low-rank structure
of a preconditioner along the optimization trajectory using matrix integrator
methods. Numerical experiments on standard machine learning tasks show that
AdaGram converges faster or matches the performance of diagonal adaptive
optimizers when using rank five and smaller rank approximations. This
demonstrates AdaGram's potential as a scalable solution for adaptive
optimization in large models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A deep learning framework using a stacked BiLSTM with attention forecasts 48-hour multivariate weather (temperature, irradiance, humidity) to support MPC in smart HVAC. It achieves MAEs of 1.3°C, 31 W/m², and 6.7 pp, outperforming NWP/ML baselines, with Integrated Gradients and attention analysis providing interpretability.

Conclusion: Demonstrates that multivariate DL forecasting with attention and explainability can enhance short-term weather predictions for energy-efficient building control, supporting reliable MPC-based HVAC operation.

Abstract: This paper presents a Deep Learning (DL) framework for 48-hour forecasting of
temperature, solar irradiance, and relative humidity to support Model
Predictive Control (MPC) in smart HVAC systems. The approach employs a stacked
Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) network with attention, capturing
temporal and cross-feature dependencies by jointly predicting all three
variables. Historical meteorological data (2019-2022) with encoded cyclical
time features were used for training, while 2023 data evaluated generalization.
The model achieved Mean Absolute Errors of 1.3 degrees Celsius (temperature),
31 W/m2 (irradiance), and 6.7 percentage points (humidity), outperforming
state-of-the-art numerical weather prediction and machine learning benchmarks.
Integrated Gradients quantified feature contributions, and attention weights
revealed temporal patterns, enhancing interpretability. By combining

transparency highlight the framework's potential for energy-efficient building
control through reliable short-term meteorological forecasting.

### [90] [Automating the Deep Space Network Data Systems; A Case Study in Adaptive Anomaly Detection through Agentic AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21111)
*Evan J. Chou,Lisa S. Locke,Harvey M. Soldan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A system employing ML-based data reconstruction, anomaly detection, reinforcement learning for severity classification, and an LLM for explanations, all integrated in a DSN data pipeline with an agentic AI for end-to-end anomaly detection and maintenance-oriented reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DSN generates large multivariate time-series data; transmitter/antenna degradation can disrupt data flow and threaten mission operations. The study aims to directly pinpoint anomalies and degradation to support maintenance and continued DSN operations.

Method: Experiment with predictive ML models to reconstruct data; use statistical thresholds for anomaly detection; implement a reinforcement-learning subsystem to classify anomaly severity; deploy an LLM to label explanations for anomalies; build a data pipeline for DSN transmitter data and connect models; integrate with an agentic AI system for complex reasoning and decision support; include human-in-the-loop feedback for refinement.

Result: The abstract describes the development and integration of the data pipeline and the ML/RL/LLM components, demonstrating feasibility of end-to-end anomaly detection and explainable labeling within DSN operations. No quantitative results are reported in the abstract.

Conclusion: This approach enables direct anomaly pinpointing, supports ongoing maintenance, and is adaptable with human feedback to improve over time; the framework is scalable for future space missions.

Abstract: The Deep Space Network (DSN) is NASA's largest network of antenna facilities
that generate a large volume of multivariate time-series data. These facilities
contain DSN antennas and transmitters that undergo degradation over long
periods of time, which may cause costly disruptions to the data flow and
threaten the earth-connection of dozens of spacecraft that rely on the Deep
Space Network for their lifeline. The purpose of this study was to experiment
with different methods that would be able to assist JPL engineers with directly
pinpointing anomalies and equipment degradation through collected data, and
continue conducting maintenance and operations of the DSN for future space
missions around our universe. As such, we have researched various machine
learning techniques that can fully reconstruct data through predictive
analysis, and determine anomalous data entries within real-time datasets
through statistical computations and thresholds. On top of the fully trained
and tested machine learning models, we have also integrated the use of a
reinforcement learning subsystem that classifies identified anomalies based on
severity level and a Large Language Model that labels an explanation for each
anomalous data entry, all of which can be improved and fine-tuned over time
through human feedback/input. Specifically, for the DSN transmitters, we have
also implemented a full data pipeline system that connects the data extraction,
parsing, and processing workflow all together as there was no coherent program
or script for performing these tasks before. Using this data pipeline system,
we were able to then also connect the models trained from DSN antenna data,
completing the data workflow for DSN anomaly detection. This was all wrapped
around and further connected by an agentic AI system, where complex reasoning
was utilized to determine the classifications and predictions of anomalous
data.

*Pranoy Panda,Raghav Magazine,Chaitanya Devaguptapu,Sho Takemori,Vishal Sharma*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A contextual bandit framework for LLM routing (PILOT) with a shared embedding space and a cost-aware policy for budget-constrained selection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world LLM routing lacks complete optimal query-LLM mappings and must adapt to evolving user queries while controlling costs.

Method: Create a joint query-LLM embedding space aligned by offline human preferences; refine with online bandit feedback; extend LinUCB into Preference-prior Informed LinUCB (PILOT); introduce a multi-choice knapsack-based online cost policy for budget-aware routing.

Result: The abstract presents the framework and algorithmic design but does not report empirical results or benchmarks.

Conclusion: Framing LLM routing as a contextual bandit with preference priors and cost-aware decisions is a promising direction for adaptive, resource-efficient multi-LLM routing; requires high-quality offline preferences and robust online feedback to succeed.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing,
but their varying capabilities and costs pose challenges in practical
applications. LLM routing addresses this by dynamically selecting the most
suitable LLM for each query/task. Previous approaches treat this as a
supervised learning problem, assuming complete knowledge of optimal query-LLM
pairings. However, real-world scenarios lack such comprehensive mappings and
face evolving user queries. We thus propose to study LLM routing as a
contextual bandit problem, enabling adaptive decision-making using bandit
feedback without requiring exhaustive inference across all LLMs for all queries
(in contrast to supervised routing). To address this problem, we develop a
shared embedding space for queries and LLMs, where query and LLM embeddings are
aligned to reflect their affinity. This space is initially learned from offline
human preference data and refined through online bandit feedback. We
instantiate this idea through Preference-prior Informed Linucb fOr adaptive
rouTing (PILOT), a novel extension of LinUCB. To handle diverse user budgets
for model routing, we introduce an online cost policy modeled as a multi-choice
knapsack problem, ensuring resource-efficient routing.

### [92] [Privacy Auditing Synthetic Data Release through Local Likelihood Attacks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21146)
*Joshua Ward,Chi-Hua Wang,Guang Cheng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Gen-LRA is a no-box membership inference attack for synthetic tabular data that exploits overfitting by measuring a test point's influence on a surrogate model's local likelihood ratio estimation; it outperforms other MIAs, making synthetic data privacy auditing more effective.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Auditing privacy leakage in synthetic data remains unresolved and dominated by heuristic attacks that miss end-to-end privacy exposure. There is a need for attacks that explicitly target overfitting regions in training distributions to reveal membership of training samples in synthetic outputs.

Method: Gen-LRA is a no-box MIA that requires no knowledge or access to the target model. It builds a surrogate model on or related to the synthetic data and evaluates how a test observation affects the estimated local likelihood ratio over the synthetic data, quantifying membership likelihood through the generative likelihood ratio.

Result: Across diverse datasets, model architectures, and attack settings, Gen-LRA consistently outperforms other MIAs in multiple metrics, indicating strong privacy leakage risk from generative model overfitting in practice.

Conclusion: Gen-LRA provides an effective privacy auditing tool for synthetic data releases and highlights the privacy risk posed by overfitting in tabular generative models, underscoring the need for defenses and careful privacy evaluation.

Abstract: Auditing the privacy leakage of synthetic data is an important but unresolved
problem. Most existing privacy auditing frameworks for synthetic data rely on
heuristics and unreasonable assumptions to attack the failure modes of
generative models, exhibiting limited capability to describe and detect the
privacy exposure of training data through synthetic data release. In this
paper, we study designing Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs) that specifically
exploit the observation that tabular generative models tend to significantly
overfit to certain regions of the training distribution. Here, we propose
Generative Likelihood Ratio Attack (Gen-LRA), a novel, computationally
efficient No-Box MIA that, with no assumption of model knowledge or access,
formulates its attack by evaluating the influence a test observation has in a
surrogate model's estimation of a local likelihood ratio over the synthetic
data. Assessed over a comprehensive benchmark spanning diverse datasets, model
architectures, and attack parameters, we find that Gen-LRA consistently
dominates other MIAs for generative models across multiple performance metrics.
These results underscore Gen-LRA's effectiveness as a privacy auditing tool for
the release of synthetic data, highlighting the significant privacy risks posed
by generative model overfitting in real-world applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limited long-term information processing capability of traditional ESNs by stacking untrained recurrent layers with temporal residual connections and exploring orthogonal configurations.

Method: Propose a deep, untrained RNN architecture (DeepResESN) with hierarchical temporal residual connections. Investigate orthogonal configurations (random and fixed-structure). Provide mathematical conditions for stable dynamics. Empirically evaluate on diverse time-series tasks against shallow and deep RC baselines.

Result: Demonstrates improved memory capacity and long-term temporal modeling; establishes stability conditions; empirical results favor DeepResESN over traditional shal/deep RC on multiple time-series tasks.

Conclusion: DeepResESNs offer a robust, training-free means to enhance temporal memory via residual connections in an untrained deep RC framework, with provable stability under certain orthogonal configurations and strong empirical performance.

Abstract: Echo State Networks (ESNs) are a particular type of untrained Recurrent
Neural Networks (RNNs) within the Reservoir Computing (RC) framework, popular
for their fast and efficient learning. However, traditional ESNs often struggle
with long-term information processing. In this paper, we introduce a novel
class of deep untrained RNNs based on temporal residual connections, called
Deep Residual Echo State Networks (DeepResESNs). We show that leveraging a
hierarchy of untrained residual recurrent layers significantly boosts memory
capacity and long-term temporal modeling. For the temporal residual
connections, we consider different orthogonal configurations, including
randomly generated and fixed-structure configurations, and we study their
effect on network dynamics. A thorough mathematical analysis outlines necessary
and sufficient conditions to ensure stable dynamics within DeepResESN. Our
experiments on a variety of time series tasks showcase the advantages of the
proposed approach over traditional shallow and deep RC.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FUTURE enables end-to-end unlearning in tree ensembles via gradient-based optimization and probabilistic approximations to handle non-differentiability; shows strong unlearning performance on real datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Growing demand for data privacy and the right to be forgotten; existing unlearning methods are often model-specific or rely on discrete tree structures, hindering generalization and scalability.

Method: Formulate sample forgetting as a gradient-based optimization problem; adopt probabilistic model approximations to bridge non-differentiability of tree ensembles, enabling end-to-end unlearning.

Result: Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate significant and successful unlearning performance of FUTURE.

Conclusion: FUTURE offers a general, scalable unlearning framework for tree ensembles, addressing limitations of prior methods and enabling practical deployment.

Abstract: Tree ensembles are widely recognized for their effectiveness in
classification tasks, achieving state-of-the-art performance across diverse
domains, including bioinformatics, finance, and medical diagnosis. With
increasing emphasis on data privacy and the \textit{right to be forgotten},
several unlearning algorithms have been proposed to enable tree ensembles to
forget sensitive information. However, existing methods are often tailored to a
particular model or rely on the discrete tree structure, making them difficult
to generalize to complex ensembles and inefficient for large-scale datasets. To
address these limitations, we propose FUTURE, a novel unlearning algorithm for
tree ensembles. Specifically, we formulate the problem of forgetting samples as
a gradient-based optimization task. In order to accommodate
non-differentiability of tree ensembles, we adopt the probabilistic model
approximations within the optimization framework. This enables end-to-end
unlearning in an effective and efficient manner. Extensive experiments on
real-world datasets show that FUTURE yields significant and successful
unlearning performance.

### [95] [Manifold Trajectories in Next-Token Prediction: From Replicator Dynamics to Softmax Equilibrium](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21186)
*Christopher R. Lee-Jenkins*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A principled variational view of decoding in LLMs shows the next-token distribution follows a replicator flow on the probability simplex, with temperature, top-k, and nucleus affecting the trajectory in precise, interpretable ways; training dynamics are not addressed, but path-dependence and hallucination-like behavior are discussed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a formal, minimal foundation for decoding dynamics in large language models, connecting common heuristics (softmax, temperature, top-k, nucleus) to a constrained variational framework and continuous-time dynamics.

Method: Formulate a constrained variational principle on the probability simplex for decoding. Identify the discrete, normalization-respecting ascent as the multiplicative-weights (entropic mirror) update and its continuous-time limit as the replicator flow. Analyze the resulting trajectory of the next-token distribution under fixed context and temperature. Derive implications for temperature scaling, top-k/nucleus restricting the flow to faces, and connections between score adjustments and loop-like behavior.

Result: Prove that for a fixed context and temperature, the next-token distribution follows a smooth trajectory inside the simplex and converges to the softmax equilibrium. Temperature acts as an exact rescaling of time along this trajectory, while top-k and nucleus sampling constrain the flow to a face while preserving the same convergence guarantees. Outline how path-dependent score adjustments relate to loop-like, hallucination-style behavior. Quantify concrete, practice-facing consequences without making claims about training dynamics.

Conclusion: The paper does not address training dynamics or internal representations; these are reserved for future work. It provides a principled, dynamical understanding of decoding at the output distribution level and clarifies how common sampling heuristics map to the same underlying trajectory on the probability simplex.

Abstract: Decoding in large language models is often described as scoring tokens and
normalizing with softmax. We give a minimal, self-contained account of this
step as a constrained variational principle on the probability simplex. The
discrete, normalization-respecting ascent is the classical
multiplicative-weights (entropic mirror) update; its continuous-time limit is
the replicator flow. From these ingredients we prove that, for a fixed context
and temperature, the next-token distribution follows a smooth trajectory inside
the simplex and converges to the softmax equilibrium. This formalizes the
common ``manifold traversal'' intuition at the output-distribution level. The
analysis yields precise, practice-facing consequences: temperature acts as an
exact rescaling of time along the same trajectory, while top-k and nucleus
sampling restrict the flow to a face with identical guarantees. We also outline
a controlled account of path-dependent score adjustments and their connection
to loop-like, hallucination-style behavior. We make no claims about training
dynamics or internal representations; those are deferred to future work.

### [96] [Model-Task Alignment Drives Distinct RL Outcomes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21188)
*Haoze Wu,Cheng Wang,Wenshuo Zhao,Junxian He*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Many counterintuitive RL-LLM observations hinge on strong model-task alignment; when alignment is weak, standard RL remains effective and the purported tricks fail.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To resolve conflicting claims about RL in LLMs by identifying the single factor (model-task alignment) that differentiates when counterintuitive results appear.

Method: Systematic, cross-architecture experiments evaluating a suite of counterintuitive claims (e.g., single-example parity, low-reward accuracy, negative-sample training) against standard RL baselines; measure pass@k to quantify alignment and learning across tasks and domains.

Result: Standard RL training remains robust across regimes; most counterintuitive tricks only yield gains when the model-task alignment is already strong; in challenging regimes, these tricks fail to drive substantial learning.

Conclusion: Model-task alignment explains variability in RL outcomes for LLMs; future work should consider alignment as a prerequisite for applying such tricks and ensure evaluation across alignment levels.

Abstract: Recent advances in applying reinforcement learning (RL) to large language
models (LLMs) have led to substantial progress. In particular, a series of
remarkable yet often counterintuitive phenomena have been reported in LLMs,
exhibiting patterns not typically observed in traditional RL settings. For
example, notable claims include that a single training example can match the
performance achieved with an entire dataset, that the reward signal does not
need to be very accurate, and that training solely with negative samples can
match or even surpass sophisticated reward-based methods. However, the precise
conditions under which these observations hold - and, critically, when they
fail - remain unclear. In this work, we identify a key factor that
differentiates RL observations: whether the pretrained model already exhibits
strong Model-Task Alignment, as measured by pass@k accuracy on the evaluated
task. Through a systematic and comprehensive examination of a series of
counterintuitive claims, supported by rigorous experimental validation across
different model architectures and task domains, our findings show that while
standard RL training remains consistently robust across settings, many of these
counterintuitive results arise only when the model and task already exhibit
strong model-task alignment. In contrast, these techniques fail to drive
substantial learning in more challenging regimes, where standard RL methods
remain effective.

*Pujan Thapa,Alexander Ororbia,Travis Desell*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Memory-efficient generative continual learning using SOMs and VAEs to replay without storing raw data or labels; SOM operates in VAE latent space for high-dimensional data and standalone for low-dimensional data; stores per-unit statistics to generate samples; VAE-based samples decoded for replay. Competitive with memory-based methods and outperforms memory-free baselines on standard class-incremental benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enable replay-based continual learning without storing past samples or task labels, addressing memory, scalability, and privacy concerns, especially for high-dimensional data.

Method: A generative continual learning framework that combines self-organizing maps (SOMs) with variational autoencoders (VAEs). For high-dimensional inputs (e.g., CIFAR-10/100), SOM operates on the VAE latent space; for low-dimensional inputs (e.g., MNIST/Fashion-MNIST), SOM can operate standalone. The method stores a running mean, variance, and covariance per SOM unit to synthesize samples for future learning iterations; in the VAE-based setup, generated samples are passed through the decoder before replay.

Result: On standard class-incremental benchmarks, the approach is competitive with state-of-the-art memory-based methods and outperforms memory-free methods; it notably improves single-class incremental performance on CIFAR-10 by ~10% and CIFAR-100 by ~7%. The method also supports visualization and can function as a post-training generative model.

Conclusion: The proposed SOM+VAE framework offers a scalable, task-label-free, memory-efficient solution for continual learning, achieving strong replay performance without raw data storage and with applicability across input dimensionalities.

Abstract: This work introduces a novel generative continual learning framework based on
self-organizing maps (SOMs) and variational autoencoders (VAEs) to enable
memory-efficient replay, eliminating the need to store raw data samples or task
labels. For high-dimensional input spaces, such as of CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100,
we design a scheme where the SOM operates over the latent space learned by a
VAE, whereas, for lower-dimensional inputs, such as those found in MNIST and
FashionMNIST, the SOM operates in a standalone fashion. Our method stores a
running mean, variance, and covariance for each SOM unit, from which synthetic
samples are then generated during future learning iterations. For the VAE-based
method, generated samples are then fed through the decoder to then be used in
subsequent replay. Experimental results on standard class-incremental
benchmarks show that our approach performs competitively with state-of-the-art
memory-based methods and outperforms memory-free methods, notably improving
over best state-of-the-art single class incremental performance on CIFAR-10 and
CIFAR-100 by nearly $10$\% and $7$\%, respectively. Our methodology further
facilitates easy visualization of the learning process and can also be utilized
as a generative model post-training. Results show our method's capability as a
scalable, task-label-free, and memory-efficient solution for continual
learning.

### [98] [A Mixture of Experts Gating Network for Enhanced Surrogate Modeling in External Aerodynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21249)
*Mohammad Amin Nabian,Sanjay Choudhry*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A Mixture of Experts (MoE) framework dynamically ensembles three heterogeneous CFD surrogates—DoMINO, X-MeshGraphNet, and FigConvNet—via a gating network with entropy regularization, achieving lower L2 errors on surface pressure and wall shear stress than any single model or the ensemble average on the DrivAerML dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-fidelity CFD simulations are computationally expensive. The landscape features diverse specialized neural architectures with no universal winner. Leveraging architectural diversity through a principled MoE approach can improve accuracy and robustness by combining complementary strengths.

Method: A Mixture of Experts with a dedicated gating network that learns spatially varying weights to combine predictions from three heterogeneous surrogates (DoMINO, X-MeshGraphNet, FigConvNet). Entropy regularization is included to prevent expert collapse and encourage balanced contributions. Trained and validated on the DrivAerML CFD benchmark for automotive aerodynamics, focusing on surface pressure and wall shear stress fields.

Result: The MoE model achieves a significant reduction in L2 prediction error, outperforming both the ensemble average and the best individual expert across all evaluated quantities (surface pressure and wall shear stress), demonstrating improved robustness and accuracy.

Conclusion: Dynamic, heterogeneous expert fusion via MoE is an effective strategy for constructing more robust and accurate composite CFD surrogates by leveraging complementary strengths of specialized architectures.

Abstract: The computational cost associated with high-fidelity CFD simulations remains
a significant bottleneck in the automotive design and optimization cycle. While
ML-based surrogate models have emerged as a promising alternative to accelerate
aerodynamic predictions, the field is characterized by a diverse and rapidly
evolving landscape of specialized neural network architectures, with no single
model demonstrating universal superiority. This paper introduces a novel
meta-learning framework that leverages this architectural diversity as a
strength. We propose a Mixture of Experts (MoE) model that employs a dedicated
gating network to dynamically and optimally combine the predictions from three
heterogeneous, state-of-the-art surrogate models: DoMINO, a decomposable
multi-scale neural operator; X-MeshGraphNet, a scalable multi-scale graph
neural network; and FigConvNet, a factorized implicit global convolution
network. The gating network learns a spatially-variant weighting strategy,
assigning credibility to each expert based on its localized performance in
predicting surface pressure and wall shear stress fields. To prevent model
collapse and encourage balanced expert contributions, we integrate an entropy
regularization term into the training loss function. The entire system is
trained and validated on the DrivAerML dataset, a large-scale, public benchmark
of high-fidelity CFD simulations for automotive aerodynamics. Quantitative
results demonstrate that the MoE model achieves a significant reduction in L-2
prediction error, outperforming not only the ensemble average but also the most
accurate individual expert model across all evaluated physical quantities. This
work establishes the MoE framework as a powerful and effective strategy for
creating more robust and accurate composite surrogate models by synergistically
combining the complementary strengths of specialized architectures.

### [99] [RelP: Faithful and Efficient Circuit Discovery via Relevance Patching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21258)
*Farnoush Rezaei Jafari,Oliver Eberle,Ashkan Khakzar,Neel Nanda*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Relevance Patching (RelP) replaces local gradients in attribution patching with Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) propagation coefficients to improve faithfulness and efficiency of model patching. It maintains the two-forward-one-backward-pass efficiency, and outperforms standard attribution patching while matching the faithfulness of methods like Integrated Gradients at lower cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Activation patching is accurate but computationally expensive for large models. Attribution patching is faster but noisy and less reliable in deep, nonlinear networks. The work seeks a method that is both faithful to activation patching and efficient.

Method: Introduce RelP by substituting the local gradient signals in attribution patching with propagation coefficients derived from Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP). This yields relevance propagation via two forward passes and one backward pass, preserving computational efficiency. The approach is validated across models/tasks, with emphasis on residual streams and MLP outputs in the IOI task.

Result: RelP more faithfully approximates activation patching than standard attribution patching. In GPT-2 Large MLP outputs, attribution patching has Pearson r=0.006, while RelP achieves r=0.956. RelP also shows comparable faithfulness to Integrated Gradients (IG) for sparse feature circuits, but without IG's extra compute cost.

Conclusion: RelP offers a fast, faithful alternative to activation patching that improves reliability in deep networks, reduces noise, and maintains efficiency. It generalizes across models and tasks and can match IG in faithfulness for sparse circuits without added computational burden.

Abstract: Activation patching is a standard method in mechanistic interpretability for
localizing the components of a model responsible for specific behaviors, but it
is computationally expensive to apply at scale. Attribution patching offers a
faster, gradient-based approximation, yet suffers from noise and reduced
reliability in deep, highly non-linear networks. In this work, we introduce
Relevance Patching (RelP), which replaces the local gradients in attribution
patching with propagation coefficients derived from Layer-wise Relevance
Propagation (LRP). LRP propagates the network's output backward through the
layers, redistributing relevance to lower-level components according to local
propagation rules that ensure properties such as relevance conservation or
improved signal-to-noise ratio. Like attribution patching, RelP requires only
two forward passes and one backward pass, maintaining computational efficiency
while improving faithfulness. We validate RelP across a range of models and
tasks, showing that it more accurately approximates activation patching than
standard attribution patching, particularly when analyzing residual stream and
MLP outputs in the Indirect Object Identification (IOI) task. For instance, for
MLP outputs in GPT-2 Large, attribution patching achieves a Pearson correlation
of 0.006, whereas RelP reaches 0.956, highlighting the improvement offered by
RelP. Additionally, we compare the faithfulness of sparse feature circuits
identified by RelP and Integrated Gradients (IG), showing that RelP achieves
comparable faithfulness without the extra computational cost associated with
IG.

### [100] [Owen Sampling Accelerates Contribution Estimation in Federated Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21261)
*Hossein KhademSohi,Hadi Hemmati,Jiayu Zhou,Steve Drew*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FedOwen offers an efficient Shapley-value approximation for client contributions in Federated Learning using Owen sampling, plus adaptive client selection; yields faster convergence and higher final accuracy under a fixed evaluation budget, outperforming baselines on non-IID data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurately valuing client contributions is crucial for fair rewards and effective client selection to accelerate FL convergence; exact Shapley value is computationally intractable as the number of clients grows.

Method: Use Owen sampling to approximate Shapley values within the same total evaluation budget; incorporate an adaptive client selection strategy that trades off exploiting high-value clients with exploring under-sampled ones to reduce bias and reveal rare but informative data.

Result: Under a fixed valuation cost, FedOwen achieves up to 23% higher final accuracy within the same number of communication rounds compared to state-of-the-art baselines on non-IID benchmarks.

Conclusion: FedOwen provides a scalable, accurate contribution estimation framework and adaptive selection mechanism that improves FL performance on non-IID data with efficient computation.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) aggregates information from multiple clients to train
a shared global model without exposing raw data. Accurately estimating each
client's contribution is essential not just for fair rewards, but for selecting
the most useful clients so the global model converges faster. The Shapley value
is a principled choice, yet exact computation scales exponentially with the
number of clients, making it infeasible for large federations. We propose
FedOwen, an efficient framework that uses Owen sampling to approximate Shapley
values under the same total evaluation budget as existing methods while keeping
the approximation error small. In addition, FedOwen uses an adaptive client
selection strategy that balances exploiting high-value clients with exploring
under-sampled ones, reducing bias and uncovering rare but informative data.
Under a fixed valuation cost, FedOwen achieves up to 23 percent higher final
accuracy within the same number of communication rounds compared to
state-of-the-art baselines on non-IID benchmarks.

### [101] [Guess-and-Learn (G&L): Measuring the Cumulative Error Cost of Cold-Start Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21270)
*Roland Arnold*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Guess-and-Learn (G&L) v1.0 to measure cold-start adaptability by tracking cumulative mistakes as models learn from unlabeled data. It separates init and update effects into four tracks, ties concepts to mistake-bound theory, and shows an adaptability gap where models are not near an oracle reference on MNIST and AG News.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current ML benchmarks focus on final accuracy and endpoint performance, ignoring the cost and dynamics of learning from scratch. Understanding adaptation speed, selection quality, and bias during early learning is crucial for reliable deployment in real-world, data-scarce or cost-sensitive settings.

Method: Define a sequential labeling protocol: at each step choose an unlabeled instance, predict, observe true label, and update parameters. Compare online (per-sample) and batch (delayed) updates. Disentangle initialization and update frequency via four tracks: Scratch vs. Pretrained cross Online vs. Batch. Formalize the protocol, connect to classical mistake-bound theory, and estimate an oracle reference band on MNIST. Conduct baseline experiments across classic models (Perceptron, k-NN), CNN/ResNet-50, ViT-B/16, BERT-base on MNIST and AG News to analyze early-phase efficiency and adaptation gaps.

Result: Across methods and domains, smaller models can adapt with fewer initial mistakes, pretrained models yield domain-dependent benefits, and current models are consistently above the oracle band. The findings reveal systematic differences in early-phase efficiency—adaptation speed, selection quality, and bias—highlighting an adaptability gap between practical models and the ideal reference.

Conclusion: G&L offers a reproducible framework that complements endpoint accuracy benchmarks by quantifying the cost of early learning. It enables development of learners that are not only accurate in the long run but reliable from the first examples, prompting improvements in initialization, update strategies, and selection mechanisms to close the adaptability gap.

Abstract: Evaluation of machine learning models typically emphasizes final accuracy,
overlooking the cost of adaptation: the cumulative errors incurred while
learning from scratch. Guess-and- Learn (G&L) v1.0 addresses this gap by
measuring cold-start adaptability - the total mistakes a model makes while
sequentially labeling an unlabeled dataset. At each step, the learner selects
an instance, predicts its label, receives the ground truth, and updates
parameters under either online (per-sample) or batch (delayed) mode. The
resulting error trajectory exposes adaptation speed, selection quality, and
bias - dynamics invisible to endpoint metrics.
  G&L defines four tracks (Scratch/Pretrained $\times$ Online/Batch) to
disentangle the effects of initialization and update frequency. We formalize
the protocol, relate it to classical mistake-bound theory, and estimate a
heuristic "oracle reference band" for MNIST as a plausibility reference.
Baseline experiments on MNIST and AG News, spanning classical methods
(Perceptron, k-NN), convolutional architectures (CNN, ResNet-50), and
pretrained transformers (ViT-B/16, BERT-base), reveal systematic differences in
early-phase efficiency: smaller models can adapt with fewer initial errors,
while pretraining benefits vary by domain. Across settings, current models
remain well above the oracle band, highlighting an adaptability gap.
  By quantifying the mistake cost of early learning, G&L complements
conventional benchmarks and provides a reproducible framework for developing
learners that are not only accurate in the limit but also reliable from the
first examples.

*Yibin Sun,Nick Lim,Guilherme Weigert Cassales,Heitor Murilo Gomes,Bernhard Pfahringer,Albert Bifet,Anany Dwivedi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Evaluates drift-detection for EMG domain shifts using streaming learning with KPCA preprocessing; finds current real-time drift detectors underperform but streaming approaches show promise for maintaining stable EMG decoders.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EMG signals are inherently non-stationary, causing domain shifts that degrade myoelectric decoding; real-time detection of these shifts is needed to sustain robust models.

Method: Define domains as distinct time-series segments by subjects and recording sessions; apply Kernel PCA with a cosine kernel to preprocess data and highlight shifts; evaluate drift detectors (CUSUM, Page-Hinckley, ADWIN) on the streaming data.

Result: Current drift-detection methods exhibit limited performance for real-time EMG domain-shift detection; KPCA preprocessing can reveal shifts but existing detectors struggle with robustness and speed in real-time settings.

Conclusion: Streaming-based approaches hold potential for maintaining stable EMG decoding models; further research is needed to improve robustness and accuracy in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Detecting domain shifts in myoelectric activations poses a significant
challenge due to the inherent non-stationarity of electromyography (EMG)
signals. This paper explores the detection of domain shifts using data stream
(DS) learning techniques, focusing on the DB6 dataset from the Ninapro
database. We define domains as distinct time-series segments based on different
subjects and recording sessions, applying Kernel Principal Component Analysis
(KPCA) with a cosine kernel to pre-process and highlight these shifts. By
evaluating multiple drift detection methods such as CUSUM, Page-Hinckley, and
ADWIN, we reveal the limitations of current techniques in achieving high
performance for real-time domain shift detection in EMG signals. Our results
underscore the potential of streaming-based approaches for maintaining stable
EMG decoding models, while highlighting areas for further research to enhance
robustness and accuracy in real-world scenarios.

### [103] [CALM: A Framework for Continuous, Adaptive, and LLM-Mediated Anomaly Detection in Time-Series Streams](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21273)
*Ashok Devireddy,Shunping Huang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CALM is an end-to-end adaptive anomaly detection framework for non-stationary streams that combines continuous fine-tuning with an LLM-based anomaly judge, implemented on Apache Beam using TimesFm for forecasting-based detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Non-stationary data with concept drift degrades offline anomaly detectors; there is a need for real-time adaptation and semantic curation of anomalies to maintain high performance.

Method: A closed-loop, real-time fine-tuning pipeline that updates the detector in near real-time, plus an LLM-as-a-Judge that semantically filters anomalies to curate training data. Implemented on Apache Beam with TimesFm for forecast-based detection; evaluated on the TSB-UAD benchmark.

Result: Continual fine-tuning yields ROC AUC improvements on most datasets compared to a static pre-trained base model, demonstrating robustness to drift.

Conclusion: Adaptive, LLM-guided anomaly detection in streaming environments is effective; CALM demonstrates sustained high performance through continuous adaptation and semantic data curation.

Abstract: The detection of anomalies in non-stationary time-series streams is a
critical but challenging task across numerous industrial and scientific
domains. Traditional models, trained offline, suffer significant performance
degradation when faced with concept drift, where the underlying statistical
properties of the data change over time. This paper introduces CALM
(Continuous, Adaptive, and LLM-Mediated), a novel, end-to-end framework for
real-time anomaly detection designed to address this challenge. CALM is built
on the Apache Beam distributed processing framework and leverages the TimesFm
foundation model for forecasting-based anomaly detection. The framework's
novelty lies in two core contributions. First, it implements a closed-loop,
continuous fine-tuning mechanism that allows the anomaly detection model to
adapt to evolving data patterns in near real-time. Second, it introduces an
LLM-as-a-Judge component, a Large Language Model that provides semantic,
context-aware judgments on detected anomalies to curate a high-quality training
dataset, deciding whether an anomaly represents transient noise or a meaningful
pattern shift. We evaluate CALM on the comprehensive TSB-UAD benchmark. Our
results demonstrate that the continuously fine-tuned model improves the ROC AUC
score in most datasets compared to the static, pre-trained base model,
validating the efficacy of our adaptive, LLM-guided approach to maintaining
high-performance anomaly detection in dynamic streaming environments.

### [104] [MyGO: Memory Yielding Generative Offline-consolidation for Lifelong Learning Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21296)
*Shihao Ji,Zihui Song*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MyGO is a memory-efficient lifelong learning framework that avoids storing raw data by using per-task generative memories and a wake-sleep consolidation loop, improving continual learning while preserving privacy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address privacy, storage, and performance challenges in continual/lifelong learning, especially when tasks are dissimilar, which are common with experience replay and weight-regularization methods.

Method: Wake phase: train on a new task and construct a compact Generative Memory (G-mem) to capture its data distribution. Sleep phase: offline consolidation uses all learned G-mem models to generate pseudo-data (dreams) and distill knowledge into a core feature extractor. No raw data storage; only compact generative models are retained.

Result: On Split-MNIST (vision) and Split-AG News (NLP), MyGO significantly mitigates catastrophic forgetting and maintains high average accuracy across tasks compared to a sequential fine-tuning baseline.

Conclusion: Demonstrates a privacy- and storage-efficient, domain-general continual learning framework with strong performance, suggesting broad applicability beyond the evaluated benchmarks.

Abstract: Continual or Lifelong Learning aims to develop models capable of acquiring
new knowledge from a sequence of tasks without catastrophically forgetting what
has been learned before. Existing approaches often rely on storing samples from
previous tasks (experience replay) or employing complex regularization terms to
protect learned weights. However, these methods face challenges related to data
privacy, storage limitations, and performance degradation when tasks are
dissimilar. To address these challenges, we introduce MyGO (Memory Yielding
Generative Offline-consolidation), a novel lifelong learning framework inspired
by the biological wake-sleep cycle. During the "wake" phase, the system rapidly
learns a new task and trains a compact generative model (Generative Memory,
G-mem) to capture its data distribution. During the "sleep" phase, the system
enters an offline state, using all learned G-mem models to generate pseudo-data
("dreams") and consolidate new and old knowledge into a core feature extractor
via knowledge distillation. This approach obviates the need to store any raw
data, retaining only compact generative models, which offers significant
advantages in privacy and storage efficiency. We evaluate MyGO on computer
vision (Split-MNIST) and natural language processing (Split-AG News)
benchmarks, comparing it against a sequential fine-tuning baseline. The results
demonstrate that MyGO significantly mitigates catastrophic forgetting and
maintains high average accuracy across tasks, proving the framework's
effectiveness and domain-generality.

### [105] [Improving Fisher Information Estimation and Efficiency for LoRA-based LLM Unlearning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21300)
*Yejin Kim,Eunwon Kim,Buru Chang,Junsuk Choe*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: VILA: a parameter-efficient unlearning framework that fixes Fisher-information estimation flaws and avoids full-model access, delivering large efficiency and speed gains and SOTA results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs risk leaking sensitive information; retraining is costly. FILA introduces a parameter-efficient solution but still requires full model access and relies on Fisher information assumptions that may be inaccurate.

Method: VILA explicitly accounts for the Fisher-information assumptions overlooked by FILA and enables identifying the forget-set parameters without accessing the full model, using adapters to apply updates (LoRA-based) for efficient unlearning.

Result: VILA achieves up to 100x higher parameter efficiency and 40x faster training than FILA, and attains state-of-the-art performance on TOFU, WMDP, and MUSE benchmarks.

Conclusion: VILA improves both the accuracy of forget-set parameter identification and computational efficiency, making unlearning more practical for large models; code is provided.

Abstract: LLMs have demonstrated remarkable performance across various tasks but face
challenges related to unintentionally generating outputs containing sensitive
information. A straightforward approach to address this issue is to retrain the
model after excluding the problematic data. However, this approach incurs
prohibitively high computational costs. To overcome this limitation, machine
unlearning has emerged as a promising solution that can effectively remove
sensitive information without the need to retrain the model from scratch.
Recently, FILA has been proposed as a parameter-efficient unlearning method by
integrating LoRA adapters. Specifically, it calculates the Fisher information
to identify parameters associated with the forget set and assigns them to LoRA
adapters for updates. Despite its innovative approach, FILA still requires
access to all model parameters and does not adequately account for fundamental
assumptions underlying Fisher information, leading to inaccuracies in
importance estimation. To address these limitations, we propose VILA, a novel
unlearning framework that explicitly considers the assumptions overlooked in
FILA, thereby enhancing the accuracy of parameter identification for the forget
set. Moreover, VILA significantly reduces computational costs by enabling
parameter identification without accessing the entire model. Our method
achieves up to 100x higher parameter efficiency and 40x faster training speed
compared to FILA, and sets new state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks
including TOFU, WMDP, and MUSE. Our code is available at

### [106] [Convergence of regularized agent-state-based Q-learning in POMDPs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21314)
*Amit Sinha,Matthieu Geist,Aditya Mahajan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RASQL converges to a regularized MDP fixed point under mild conditions; the framework also extends to learning periodic policies, with experiments supporting the theory.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In practice, Q-learning often uses non-belief-state agent representations and policy regularization. There is a need to understand how these real-world factors affect convergence and what the limiting behavior looks like.

Method: Analyze the simplest regularized agent-state-based Q-learning (RASQL) algorithm, derive its convergence to the fixed point of a regularized MDP determined by the stationary distribution induced by the behavioral policy, and extend the analysis to a variant that learns periodic policies; provide numerical experiments to validate the theory.

Result: Proves convergence of RASQL to the fixed point of a suitably defined regularized MDP; shows the periodic-policy variant also converges; numerical experiments show empirical convergence matches the theoretical limit.

Conclusion: Regularization and agent-state updates yield a well-defined convergence target (a regularized MDP fixed point) dependent on the behavior-policy distribution; the approach extends to periodic policies, and empirical results corroborate the theoretical predictions.

Abstract: In this paper, we present a framework to understand the convergence of
commonly used Q-learning reinforcement learning algorithms in practice. Two
salient features of such algorithms are: (i)~the Q-table is recursively updated
using an agent state (such as the state of a recurrent neural network) which is
not a belief state or an information state and (ii)~policy regularization is
often used to encourage exploration and stabilize the learning algorithm. We
investigate the simplest form of such Q-learning algorithms which we call
regularized agent-state-based Q-learning (RASQL) and show that it converges
under mild technical conditions to the fixed point of an appropriately defined
regularized MDP, which depends on the stationary distribution induced by the
behavioral policy. We also show that a similar analysis continues to work for a
variant of RASQL that learns periodic policies. We present numerical examples
to illustrate that the empirical convergence behavior matches with the proposed
theoretical limit.

### [107] [Distribution-Aware Feature Selection for SAEs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21324)
*Narmeen Oozeer,Nirmalendu Prakash,Michael Lan,Alice Rigg,Amirali Abdullah*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Sampled-SAE is a tunable, distribution-aware variant of BatchTopK for sparse autoencoders that scores feature columns across batch activations and selects a limited pool to balance global consistency with token-specific reconstruction, with l controlling the pool size and trade-offs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To fix inefficiencies and instability of TopK SAE and BatchTopK (activation lottery) by creating a controllable pool of informative features that can adapt between global and token-specific reconstruction.

Method: Score feature columns of the batch activation matrix using criteria like L2 norm or entropy, form a candidate pool of size Kl, apply Top-K across the batch restricted to this pool, and vary l to interpolate between batch-level and token-specific selection.

Result: On the Pythia-160M dataset, no single l value optimizes all metrics; the best l depends on the trade-off among shared structure, reconstruction fidelity, and downstream performance.

Conclusion: Sampled-SAE reframes BatchTopK as a tunable, distribution-aware family, offering a spectrum between global consistency and fine-grained, token-specific reconstruction.

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) decompose neural activations into interpretable
features. A widely adopted variant, the TopK SAE, reconstructs each token from
its K most active latents. However, this approach is inefficient, as some
tokens carry more information than others. BatchTopK addresses this limitation
by selecting top activations across a batch of tokens. This improves average
reconstruction but risks an "activation lottery," where rare high-magnitude
features crowd out more informative but lower-magnitude ones. To address this
issue, we introduce Sampled-SAE: we score the columns (representing features)
of the batch activation matrix (via $L_2$ norm or entropy), forming a candidate
pool of size $Kl$, and then apply Top-$K$ to select tokens across the batch
from the restricted pool of features. Varying $l$ traces a spectrum between
batch-level and token-specific selection. At $l=1$, tokens draw only from $K$
globally influential features, while larger $l$ expands the pool toward
standard BatchTopK and more token-specific features across the batch. Small $l$
thus enforces global consistency; large $l$ favors fine-grained reconstruction.
On Pythia-160M, no single value optimizes $l$ across all metrics: the best
choice depends on the trade-off between shared structure, reconstruction
fidelity, and downstream performance. Sampled-SAE thus reframes BatchTopK as a
tunable, distribution-aware family.

### [108] [Stage-Diff: Stage-wise Long-Term Time Series Generation Based on Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21330)
*Xuan Hou,Shuhan Liu,Zhaohui Peng,Yaohui Chu,Yue Zhang,Yining Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Stage-Diff introduces a staged diffusion-based generator for long-term time series, using stage-wise generation with inter-stage transfer and within-stage progressive decomposition to balance long-range dependencies and distribution drift, plus channel-independent vs multi-channel fusion to capture intra- and inter-sequence relations; experiments show improved realism on real datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long-term time series exhibit strong long-range dependencies and non-stationary distribution shifts over time. Capturing both intra-sequence and inter-sequence dependencies while accounting for distribution drift is challenging for existing generative models.

Method: A staged diffusion model (Stage-Diff) with: (1) stage-wise sequence generation with information transfer between stages; (2) within each stage, progressive sequence decomposition enabling channel-independent modeling across multiple time scales; (3) inter-stage multi-channel fusion that combines channel-independent robustness with cross-channel information exchange to model inter-sequence dependencies.

Result: Extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets show Stage-Diff achieves better generation quality and diversity compared to baselines, validating the approach.

Conclusion: Stage-Diff effectively balances long-term dependencies and distribution drift in long-term time series generation by combining staged generation, progressive time-scale decomposition, and multi-channel fusion.

Abstract: Generative models have been successfully used in the field of time series
generation. However, when dealing with long-term time series, which span over
extended periods and exhibit more complex long-term temporal patterns, the task
of generation becomes significantly more challenging. Long-term time series
exhibit long-range temporal dependencies, but their data distribution also
undergoes gradual changes over time. Finding a balance between these long-term
dependencies and the drift in data distribution is a key challenge. On the
other hand, long-term time series contain more complex interrelationships
between different feature sequences, making the task of effectively capturing
both intra-sequence and inter-sequence dependencies another important
challenge. To address these issues, we propose Stage-Diff, a staged generative
model for long-term time series based on diffusion models. First, through
stage-wise sequence generation and inter-stage information transfer, the model
preserves long-term sequence dependencies while enabling the modeling of data
distribution shifts. Second, within each stage, progressive sequence
decomposition is applied to perform channel-independent modeling at different
time scales, while inter-stage information transfer utilizes multi-channel
fusion modeling. This approach combines the robustness of channel-independent
modeling with the information fusion advantages of multi-channel modeling,
effectively balancing the intra-sequence and inter-sequence dependencies of
long-term time series. Extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets
validate the effectiveness of Stage-Diff in long-term time series generation
tasks.

*Xuan Hou,Shuhan Liu,Zhaohui Peng,Yaohui Chu,Yue Zhang,Yining Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Two-stage DLGAN combines a time-series autoencoder with a GAN to synthesize sequence features for faithful temporal dependencies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing time-series synthesis methods generate from random sequences and often fail to preserve temporal dependencies or capture the feature information of the original data, hindering secure and realistic sharing of time-series data.

Method: A two-stage approach: (1) sequence feature extraction and reconstruction via a time-series autoencoder to learn and restore temporal structure; (2) a GAN that generates synthetic feature vectors aligned with real sequence features to capture temporal patterns.

Result: Extensive experiments on four public datasets show the proposed model outperforms baselines across multiple evaluation metrics.

Conclusion: DLGAN provides a simple yet effective two-stage framework that preserves temporal dependencies in generated time-series data and improves synthesis quality for secure data sharing.

Abstract: Time series synthesis is an effective approach to ensuring the secure
circulation of time series data. Existing time series synthesis methods
typically perform temporal modeling based on random sequences to generate
target sequences, which often struggle to ensure the temporal dependencies in
the generated time series. Additionally, directly modeling temporal features on
random sequences makes it challenging to accurately capture the feature
information of the original time series. To address the above issues, we
propose a simple but effective generative model \textbf{D}ual-\textbf{L}ayer
\textbf{G}enerative \textbf{A}dversarial \textbf{N}etworks, named
\textbf{DLGAN}. The model decomposes the time series generation process into
two stages: sequence feature extraction and sequence reconstruction. First,
these two stages form a complete time series autoencoder, enabling supervised
learning on the original time series to ensure that the reconstruction process
can restore the temporal dependencies of the sequence. Second, a Generative
Adversarial Network (GAN) is used to generate synthetic feature vectors that
align with the real-time sequence feature vectors, ensuring that the generator
can capture the temporal features from real time series. Extensive experiments
on four public datasets demonstrate the superiority of this model across
various evaluation metrics.

### [110] [Adaptive Heavy-Tailed Stochastic Gradient Descent](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21353)
*Bodu Gong,Gustavo Enrique Batista,Pierre Lafaye de Micheaux*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: An adaptive heavy-tailed noise injection method (AHTSGD) is proposed to improve generalization by exploring early with heavy-tailed noise and gradually switching to lighter-tailed noise as sharpness stabilizes, guided by the Edge of Stability (EoS). It aims to converge to wide basins and outperform SGD on standard benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generalization in large-scale neural networks remains challenged by overreliance on training loss. Wide basins are believed to confer stability and better generalization, whereas sharp minima are brittle. Empirical cues—the heavy-tailed gradient noise in SGD and the Edge of Stability during training—suggest the need for an optimizer that adapts its noise profile to the loss landscape to promote exploration and robust convergence.

Method: Introduce Adaptive Heavy Tailed Stochastic Gradient Descent (AHTSGD). The optimizer injects heavier-tailed noise in early training to enhance exploration, then gradually transitions to lighter-tailed noise as the sharpness of the loss landscape stabilizes. The method dynamically adapts to the landscape's sharpness, effectively adjusting the noise tail-heaviness based on the Edge of Stability phenomenon. It is claimed to be the first to adjust noise type in response to EoS.

Result: AHTSGD consistently outperforms SGD and other noise-based methods on benchmarks such as MNIST and CIFAR-10, with marked gains on noisier datasets like SVHN. It accelerates early training from poor initializations and improves generalization across both clean and noisy settings, exhibiting robustness to learning-rate choices.

Conclusion: AHTSGD accelerates convergence to wide basins and improves generalization by adaptively shaping gradient noise in response to the Edge of Stability, representing a novel approach to noise-based optimization that is robust across datasets and learning-rate settings.

Abstract: In the era of large-scale neural network models, optimization algorithms
often struggle with generalization due to an overreliance on training loss. One
key insight widely accepted in the machine learning community is the idea that
wide basins (regions around a local minimum where the loss increases gradually)
promote better generalization by offering greater stability to small changes in
input data or model parameters. In contrast, sharp minima are typically more
sensitive and less stable. Motivated by two key empirical observations - the
inherent heavy-tailed distribution of gradient noise in stochastic gradient
descent and the Edge of Stability phenomenon during neural network training, in
which curvature grows before settling at a plateau, we introduce Adaptive Heavy
Tailed Stochastic Gradient Descent (AHTSGD). The algorithm injects
heavier-tailed noise into the optimizer during the early stages of training to
enhance exploration and gradually transitions to lighter-tailed noise as
sharpness stabilizes. By dynamically adapting to the sharpness of the loss
landscape throughout training, AHTSGD promotes accelerated convergence to wide
basins. AHTSGD is the first algorithm to adjust the nature of injected noise
into an optimizer based on the Edge of Stability phenomenon. AHTSGD
consistently outperforms SGD and other noise-based methods on benchmarks like
MNIST and CIFAR-10, with marked gains on noisy datasets such as SVHN. It
ultimately accelerates early training from poor initializations and improves
generalization across clean and noisy settings, remaining robust to learning
rate choices.

### [111] [Iterative Inference in a Chess-Playing Neural Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21380)
*Elias Sandmann,Sebastian Lapuschkin,Wojciech Samek*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Neural networks can refine representations in non-smooth, complex ways. In Leela Chess Zero, policy behavior shows monotonic improvement in strength and puzzle solving across layers, but policy distributions are non-smooth, with early correct puzzles later discarded, weak move-ranking correlations, and late policy divergence, contrasting with smooth language-model convergence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand whether representation learning proceeds through smooth refinement or discrete, complex computations by analyzing a policy network in a high-performance board-game AI and comparing it to language models.

Method: Extend the logit lens approach to Leela Chess Zero's policy network, analyzing layer-by-layer changes in playing strength, puzzle-solving ability, move rankings, and policy distributions, tracking correlations and divergence across layers.

Result: Findings show strong monotonic trends in playing strength and puzzle-solving ability across layers, while policy distributions exhibit non-smooth trajectories: early correct puzzles are discarded later, move rankings poorly correlate with final outputs, and policy divergence remains high until late in the network.

Conclusion: The results point to non-smooth, stepwise computational dynamics in the chess-policy network, contrasting with the smooth distributional convergence observed in language models, highlighting domain-dependent learning dynamics and the need for analysis methods that capture non-monotonic, discrete shifts.

Abstract: Do neural networks build their representations through smooth, gradual
refinement, or via more complex computational processes? We investigate this by
extending the logit lens to analyze the policy network of Leela Chess Zero, a
superhuman chess engine. We find strong monotonic trends in playing strength
and puzzle-solving ability across layers, yet policy distributions frequently
follow non-smooth trajectories. Evidence for this includes correct puzzle
solutions that are discovered early but subsequently discarded, move rankings
that remain poorly correlated with final outputs, and high policy divergence
until late in the network. These findings contrast with the smooth
distributional convergence typically observed in language models.

*Robert A. Vandermeulen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PMODE introduces a general, modular mixture framework built by partitioning data and fitting separate estimators per subset, achieving near-optimal rates and remaining valid when mixture components come from different distribution families. MV-PMODE extends this to very high dimensions and shows competitive anomaly-detection performance on CIFAR-10 against deep baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a flexible, theory-backed mixture modeling framework that can incorporate both parametric and nonparametric components and remain valid across heterogeneous component families, while addressing scalable high-dimensional density estimation.

Method: Partition the data into subsets and fit separate estimators (parametric or nonparametric) on each subset, then combine them into a mixture. The framework supports components from different distribution families and provides near-optimal rates. MV-PMODE adapts the approach for high-dimensional settings (thousands of dimensions).

Result: PMODE achieves near-optimal rates for the proposed estimator class and remains valid when mixture components originate from different distribution families. MV-PMODE scales to thousands of dimensions and performs competitively against deep baselines on CIFAR-10 anomaly detection.

Conclusion: PMODE provides a general, modular approach to mixture modeling with solid theoretical guarantees, and MV-PMODE demonstrates practical effectiveness in high-dimensional density estimation and anomaly detection, bridging theory and scalable application.

Abstract: We introduce PMODE (Partitioned Mixture Of Density Estimators), a general and
modular framework for mixture modeling with both parametric and nonparametric
components. PMODE builds mixtures by partitioning the data and fitting separate
estimators to each subset. It attains near-optimal rates for this estimator
class and remains valid even when the mixture components come from different
distribution families. As an application, we develop MV-PMODE, which scales a
previously theoretical approach to high-dimensional density estimation to
settings with thousands of dimensions. Despite its simplicity, it performs
competitively against deep baselines on CIFAR-10 anomaly detection.

### [113] [Benchmarking the State of Networks with a Low-Cost Method Based on Reservoir Computing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21420)
*Felix Simon Reimers,Carl-Hendrik Peters,Stefano Nichele*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A low-cost, non-invasive method to monitor the state of mobile and transportation networks using reservoir computing on aggregated mobile network data; ESN-based proxy-task performance tracks network health and degrades under perturbations, enabling near real-time monitoring and weak-spot identification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable inexpensive, non-invasive monitoring of large-scale communication/mobility networks using readily available, anonymized data, leveraging the efficiency of reservoir computing.

Method: Represent anonymous, aggregated mobile network utilization as a weighted network. Use an Echo State Network (ESN) to transform inputs into a high-dimensional space and train a single output layer on neuroscience-inspired proxy tasks. Analyze how performance depends on network configurations and respond to perturbations.

Result: The ESN-based proxy-task performance correlates with the underlying network state and decreases when the network is perturbed. The approach demonstrates feasibility using readily available data and is energy-efficient compared to deep learning.

Conclusion: This work serves as a proof-of-concept for near-real-time monitoring and weak-spot identification in mobile and transportation networks using reservoir computing on aggregated data, with potential for scalable and inexpensive deployment.

Abstract: Using data from mobile network utilization in Norway, we showcase the
possibility of monitoring the state of communication and mobility networks with
a non-invasive, low-cost method. This method transforms the network data into a
model within the framework of reservoir computing and then measures the model's
performance on proxy tasks. Experimentally, we show how the performance on
these proxies relates to the state of the network. A key advantage of this
approach is that it uses readily available data sets and leverages the
reservoir computing framework for an inexpensive and largely agnostic method.
Data from mobile network utilization is available in an anonymous, aggregated
form with multiple snapshots per day. This data can be treated like a weighted
network. Reservoir computing allows the use of weighted, but untrained networks
as a machine learning tool. The network, initialized as a so-called echo state
network (ESN), projects incoming signals into a higher dimensional space, on
which a single trained layer operates. This consumes less energy than deep
neural networks in which every weight of the network is trained. We use
neuroscience inspired tasks and trained our ESN model to solve them. We then
show how the performance depends on certain network configurations and also how
it visibly decreases when perturbing the network. While this work serves as
proof of concept, we believe it can be elevated to be used for near-real-time
monitoring as well as the identification of possible weak spots of both mobile
communication networks as well as transportation networks.

### [114] [Rethinking Layer-wise Model Merging through Chain of Merges](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21421)
*Pietro Buzzega,Riccardo Salami,Angelo Porrello,Simone Calderara*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Chain of Merges (CoM) is a layer-wise, auto-regressive merging method that updates activation statistics across layers to account for inter-layer dependencies, yielding a coherent merged model with state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To merge multiple fine-tuned modules into a single unified model without retraining, while respecting inter-layer dependencies; existing per-layer heuristics cause distributional shifts and degrade performance.

Method: Perform layer-wise merges with auto-regressive updates of activation statistics, modeling cross-layer interactions and using conditionally optimal updates to minimize covariate shift.

Result: Empirical results on standard benchmarks show state-of-the-art performance and reduced degradation due to covariate shift.

Conclusion: CoM provides a coherent, covariate-shift-aware merging framework that outperforms prior independent-layer approaches.

Abstract: Fine-tuning pretrained models has become a standard pathway to achieve
state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of domains, leading to a
proliferation of task-specific model variants. As the number of such
specialized modules in-creases, merging them into a unified model without
retraining has become a critical challenge. Existing merging techniques often
rely on interference heuristics,importance weighting, or activation matching
while treating each layer independently, thereby failing to account for the
inter-layer dependencies inherent in deep networks. This simplification leads
to distributional mismatches, especially inactivation-based methods, when
changes in early layers are not properly reflected in downstream ones. We
identify these mismatches as a form of internal covariate shift, comparable to
the phenomenon encountered in the initial phases of neural networks training.
To address it, we propose Chain of Merges (CoM), a layer-wise merging procedure
that updates activation statistics in an auto-regressive fashion, explicitly
accounting for cross-layer interactions. CoM produces a coherent merged model
through a series of conditionally optimal updates, effectively mitigating
degradation caused by covariate shift. Experiments on standard bench-marks
demonstrate that CoM achieves state-of-the-art performance.

*Rajiv Kailasanathan,William R. Clements,Mohammad Reza Boskabadi,Shawn M. Gibford,Emmanouil Papadakis,Christopher J. Savoie,Seyed Soheil Mansouri*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Unsupervised anomaly detection for continuous biomanufacturing using an ensemble of GANs; benchmarks on synthetic data; shows improved detection with a hybrid quantum/classical GAN (simulated and real photonic processor).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Continuous biomanufacturing processes are complex, nonlinear, and sensitive to small deviations; early anomaly detection is critical to prevent yield loss, schedule disruptions, and economic impact.

Method: Develop a GAN-based ensemble for unsupervised anomaly detection; create a benchmark dataset simulating normal and anomalous regimes; test detection of anomalies from feedstock variability; evaluate a hybrid quantum/classical GAN using a simulated quantum circuit and a real photonic quantum processor.

Result: Hybrid quantum/classical GANs yield improved anomaly detection rates compared with non-hybrid baselines, demonstrating potential for real-world complex bioprocess monitoring.

Conclusion: Hybrid quantum/classical GAN approaches can enhance anomaly detection in continuous biomanufacturing; further work could optimize architecture, data generation, and hardware integration for robust deployment.

Abstract: The development of continuous biomanufacturing processes requires robust and
early anomaly detection, since even minor deviations can compromise yield and
stability, leading to disruptions in scheduling, reduced weekly production, and
diminished economic performance. These processes are inherently complex and
exhibit non-linear dynamics with intricate relationships between process
variables, thus making advanced methods for anomaly detection essential for
efficient operation. In this work, we present a novel framework for
unsupervised anomaly detection in continuous biomanufacturing based on an
ensemble of generative adversarial networks (GANs). We first establish a
benchmark dataset simulating both normal and anomalous operation regimes in a
continuous process for the production of a small molecule. We then demonstrate
the effectiveness of our GAN-based framework in detecting anomalies caused by
sudden feedstock variability. Finally, we evaluate the impact of using a hybrid
quantum/classical GAN approach with both a simulated quantum circuit and a real
photonic quantum processor on anomaly detection performance. We find that the
hybrid approach yields improved anomaly detection rates. Our work shows the
potential of hybrid quantum/classical approaches for solving real-world
problems in complex continuous biomanufacturing processes.

### [116] [Beyond expected value: geometric mean optimization for long-term policy performance in reinforcement learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21443)
*Xinyi Sheng,Dominik Baumann*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: An RL method that optimizes both ensemble reward and time-average growth rate via a Bellman operator and a sliding-window geometric mean regularizer, improving performance over standard RL in simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In real-world deployments, the ensemble average (expected cumulative reward) poorly reflects performance of individual trajectories. Optimizing long-term trajectory performance is often more desirable.

Method: Define a Bellman operator for time-average growth rate. Show that with multiplicative reward dynamics, the geometric mean aligns with this rate. Introduce an N-sliding window geometric mean to estimate the time-average growth rate under general, unknown reward dynamics. Embed this estimator as a regularizer in the RL objective to jointly optimize ensemble average and trajectory growth.

Result: Empirical evaluation in challenging simulations shows the proposed algorithm outperforms conventional RL methods.

Conclusion: The approach yields a practical algorithm that leverages both ensemble average and the time-average growth rate to improve long-term trajectory performance, including under general reward dynamics via the sliding-window estimator.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms typically optimize the expected
cumulative reward, i.e., the expected value of the sum of scalar rewards an
agent receives over the course of a trajectory. The expected value averages the
performance over an infinite number of trajectories. However, when deploying
the agent in the real world, this ensemble average may be uninformative for the
performance of individual trajectories. Thus, in many applications, optimizing
the long-term performance of individual trajectories might be more desirable.
In this work, we propose a novel RL algorithm that combines the standard
ensemble average with the time-average growth rate, a measure for the long-term
performance of individual trajectories. We first define the Bellman operator
for the time-average growth rate. We then show that, under multiplicative
reward dynamics, the geometric mean aligns with the time-average growth rate.
To address more general and unknown reward dynamics, we propose a modified
geometric mean with $N$-sliding window that captures the path-dependency as an
estimator for the time-average growth rate. This estimator is embedded as a
regularizer into the objective, forming a practical algorithm and enabling the
policy to benefit from ensemble average and time-average simultaneously. We
evaluate our algorithm in challenging simulations, where it outperforms
conventional RL methods.

### [117] [Normalized Maximum Likelihood Code-Length on Riemannian Manifold Data Spaces](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21466)
*Kota Fukuzawa,Atsushi Suzuki,Kenji Yamanishi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces Riemannian manifold NML (Rm-NML), a coordinate-invariant version of Normalized Maximum Likelihood for non-Euclidean spaces, focusing on Riemannian symmetric spaces including hyperbolic spaces; provides invariance theory, Euclidean-consistent behavior, computational extensions, and explicit calculation for hyperbolic normals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: NML is key for regret minimization and model selection, but existing formulations are Euclidean and coordinate-dependent, hindering extension to curved manifolds. A geometry-aware NML could leverage hyperbolic representations and other manifold structures in graph data.

Method: Define Rm-NML on Riemannian manifolds, prove invariance under coordinate changes, show it coincides with ordinary NML under natural Euclidean parameterization, extend existing NML computation techniques to the manifold setting, derive simplifications for Riemannian symmetric spaces (including hyperbolic spaces), and compute Rm-NML for normal distributions on hyperbolic spaces.

Result: Rm-NML is defined and coordinate-invariant; a bridge to Euclidean NML under the natural parameterization; computational techniques extended to manifolds with simplifications for symmetric spaces; explicit computation demonstrated for normal distributions on hyperbolic spaces.

Conclusion: Rm-NML enables coordinate-free regret minimization and model selection on manifold-valued data, aligns with Euclidean NML in the appropriate limit, and is practically computable in hyperbolic spaces, with potential applications to graph data exhibiting hierarchical structure.

Abstract: In recent years, with the large-scale expansion of graph data, there has been
an increased focus on Riemannian manifold data spaces other than Euclidean
space. In particular, the development of hyperbolic spaces has been remarkable,
and they have high expressive power for graph data with hierarchical
structures. Normalized Maximum Likelihood (NML) is employed in regret
minimization and model selection. However, existing formulations of NML have
been developed primarily in Euclidean spaces and are inherently dependent on
the choice of coordinate systems, making it non-trivial to extend NML to
Riemannian manifolds. In this study, we define a new NML that reflects the
geometric structure of Riemannian manifolds, called the Riemannian manifold NML
(Rm-NML). This Rm-NML is invariant under coordinate transformations and
coincides with the conventional NML under the natural parameterization in
Euclidean space. We extend existing computational techniques for NML to the
setting of Riemannian manifolds. Furthermore, we derive a method to simplify
the computation of Rm-NML on Riemannian symmetric spaces, which encompass data
spaces of growing interest such as hyperbolic spaces. To illustrate the
practical application of our proposed method, we explicitly computed the Rm-NML
for normal distributions on hyperbolic spaces.

*Seungyeon Choi,Hwanhee Kim,Chihyun Park,Dahyeon Lee,Seungyong Lee,Yoonju Kim,Hyoungjoon Park,Sein Kwon,Youngwan Jo,Sanghyun Park*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes CByG, a gradient-based conditional generative model extending Bayesian Flow Network for structure-based drug design, integrating binding affinity, synthetic feasibility, and selectivity into generation, with a comprehensive multi-property evaluation scheme; reports strong improvements over baselines for real-world drug discovery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional diffusion-based SBDD models largely optimize binding affinity and overlook practical properties like synthetic feasibility and selectivity, leading to gaps in real-world drug discovery relevance.

Method: Introduce CByG, a gradient-based conditional generative framework that extends Bayesian Flow Network to incorporate property-specific guidance for multiple pharmacological attributes; develop a comprehensive evaluation scheme with benchmarks for binding affinity, synthetic feasibility, and selectivity.

Result: Experimental results show CByG outperforms baseline models across essential evaluation criteria, indicating improved practicality for drug discovery.

Conclusion: CByG provides a robust, multi-property-guided generative approach for SBDD, addressing practical constraints and offering a more realistic path for translating generative models into real-world drug discovery workflows.

Abstract: Recent advances in Structure-based Drug Design (SBDD) have leveraged
generative models for 3D molecular generation, predominantly evaluating model
performance by binding affinity to target proteins. However, practical drug
discovery necessitates high binding affinity along with synthetic feasibility
and selectivity, critical properties that were largely neglected in previous
evaluations. To address this gap, we identify fundamental limitations of
conventional diffusion-based generative models in effectively guiding molecule
generation toward these diverse pharmacological properties. We propose CByG, a
novel framework extending Bayesian Flow Network into a gradient-based
conditional generative model that robustly integrates property-specific
guidance. Additionally, we introduce a comprehensive evaluation scheme
incorporating practical benchmarks for binding affinity, synthetic feasibility,
and selectivity, overcoming the limitations of conventional evaluation methods.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed CByG framework
significantly outperforms baseline models across multiple essential evaluation
criteria, highlighting its effectiveness and practicality for real-world drug
discovery applications.

*Pascal R. van der Vaart,Neil Yorke-Smith,Matthijs T. J. Spaan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Cold posterior effects in Bayesian deep Q-learning: priors and likelihoods matter, with Gaussian likelihoods often violated; improving priors/likelihoods yields better Bayesian RL performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Investigate how prior and likelihood choices affect posterior quality in Bayesian model-free RL to improve uncertainty quantification, exploration, and robustness.

Method: Empirical study of priors; statistical tests on Gaussian likelihood assumptions; analysis of likelihood/prior mismatch; propose simple, implementable priors/likelihoods to enhance deep Q-learning performance.

Result: Found cold posterior effect (better performance with lower posterior temperature); Gaussian likelihood frequently violated; proposed practical priors and likelihood adjustments that improve Bayesian deep Q-learning.

Conclusion: Correct modeling of priors and likelihoods is crucial in Bayesian RL; future work should develop more suitable likelihoods and priors to achieve reliable uncertainty quantification and improved performance.

Abstract: Uncertainty quantification in reinforcement learning can greatly improve
exploration and robustness. Approximate Bayesian approaches have recently been
popularized to quantify uncertainty in model-free algorithms. However, so far
the focus has been on improving the accuracy of the posterior approximation,
instead of studying the accuracy of the prior and likelihood assumptions
underlying the posterior. In this work, we demonstrate that there is a cold
posterior effect in Bayesian deep Q-learning, where contrary to theory,
performance increases when reducing the temperature of the posterior. To
identify and overcome likely causes, we challenge common assumptions made on
the likelihood and priors in Bayesian model-free algorithms. We empirically
study prior distributions and show through statistical tests that the common
Gaussian likelihood assumption is frequently violated. We argue that developing
more suitable likelihoods and priors should be a key focus in future Bayesian
reinforcement learning research and we offer simple, implementable solutions
for better priors in deep Q-learning that lead to more performant Bayesian
algorithms.

### [120] [Failure Prediction Is a Better Performance Proxy for Early-Exit Networks Than Calibration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21495)
*Piotr Kubaty,Filip Szatkowski,Metod Jazbec,Bartosz Wójcik*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Calibration is not a reliable indicator for multi-exit models; failure prediction provides a better proxy for efficiency and overall performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In early-exit networks, exit decisions are often based on calibration of intermediate classifiers. However, calibration may be misleading and fail to reflect actual efficiency, misranking samples and wasting computation. A metric that correlates with efficiency is needed.

Method: Empirical analysis of calibration-based exit strategies on early-exit models, demonstration that miscalibrated networks can outperform calibrated ones, and proposal of failure prediction as an alternative proxy. Evaluation of how failure prediction preserves sample ranking and correlates with efficiency improvements.

Result: Calibration measures can mislead performance in multi-exit models; well-calibrated classifiers may still waste computation, and ranking preservation is not guaranteed. Miscalibrated networks can outperform calibrated ones. Failure prediction shows a strong correlation with efficiency gains and is a more dependable basis for designing and evaluating early-exit models.

Conclusion: Failure prediction should be adopted as the primary proxy for evaluating and guiding the design of early-exit models, rather than calibration alone, as it better reflects ranking changes and efficiency outcomes.

Abstract: Early-exit models speed up inference by attaching internal classifiers to
intermediate layers of the model and allowing computation to stop once a
prediction satisfies an exit criterion. Most early-exit methods rely on
confidence-based exit strategies, which motivated some works to calibrate
intermediate classifiers to improve the performance of the entire model. In
this paper, we show that calibration measures can be misleading indicators of
the performance of multi-exit models: a well-calibrated classifier may still
waste computation, and common calibration methods do not preserve the sample
ranking within a classifier. We demonstrate empirical cases where miscalibrated
networks outperform calibrated ones. As an alternative, we propose to use
failure prediction as a more useful proxy for early-exit model performance.
Unlike calibration, failure prediction accounts for changes in the ranking of
samples and shows a strong correlation with efficiency improvements, making it
a more dependable basis for designing and evaluating early-exit models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Spiking Decision Transformer (SNN-DT) combines Leaky Integrate-and-Fire neurons with Transformer-style sequence modeling to achieve competitive RL performance on classic tasks while using extremely few spikes per decision, signaling large energy savings for edge devices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bring energy-efficient neuromorphic computation to return-conditioned sequence modeling in reinforcement learning, enabling real-time, low-power control on edge and wearable platforms.

Method: Embed LIF neurons into each self-attention block, train end-to-end with surrogate gradients, and augment with biologically inspired three-factor plasticity, phase-shifted spike-based positional encodings, and a lightweight dendritic routing module.

Result: Matches or exceeds standard Decision Transformer performance on CartPole-v1, MountainCar-v0, Acrobot-v1, Pendulum-v1, while emitting fewer than ten spikes per decision (energy proxy suggesting >10^4× reduction in per-inference energy).

Conclusion: Demonstrates a viable path to real-time, low-power decision-making on neuromorphic hardware and embedded systems by marrying sequence modeling with spiking, event-driven inference.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning agents based on Transformer architectures have
achieved impressive performance on sequential decision-making tasks, but their
reliance on dense matrix operations makes them ill-suited for
energy-constrained, edge-oriented platforms. Spiking neural networks promise
ultra-low-power, event-driven inference, yet no prior work has seamlessly
merged spiking dynamics with return-conditioned sequence modeling. We present
the Spiking Decision Transformer (SNN-DT), which embeds Leaky
Integrate-and-Fire neurons into each self-attention block, trains end-to-end
via surrogate gradients, and incorporates biologically inspired three-factor
plasticity, phase-shifted spike-based positional encodings, and a lightweight
dendritic routing module. Our implementation matches or exceeds standard
Decision Transformer performance on classic control benchmarks (CartPole-v1,
MountainCar-v0, Acrobot-v1, Pendulum-v1) while emitting fewer than ten spikes
per decision, an energy proxy suggesting over four orders-of-magnitude
reduction in per inference energy. By marrying sequence modeling with
neuromorphic efficiency, SNN-DT opens a pathway toward real-time, low-power
control on embedded and wearable devices.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LLMs' ability to process tabular loan data is highly sensitive to the text serialization format; in-context learning boosts performance but can worsen fairness, highlighting the need for fairness-aware data representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ensure reliable and fair LLM-based financial decision-making when tabular data must be processed by LLMs, across diverse regions.

Method: Evaluate zero-shot and in-context learning of LLMs on serialized loan-approval datasets from Ghana, Germany, and the US; compare serialization formats (e.g., GReat, LIFT) and measure accuracy (F1) and fairness disparities.

Result: Serialization format markedly affects performance and fairness; GReat and LIFT yield higher F1 but amplify fairness disparities; ICL improves performance by 4.9-59.6% relative to zero-shot, with fairness impact varying by dataset.

Conclusion: Effective tabular data representations and fairness-aware modeling are crucial to improve LLM reliability in financial decisions; select formats that balance accuracy with fairness considerations and develop fairness-aware ICL approaches.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly employed in high-stakes
decision-making tasks, such as loan approvals. While their applications expand
across domains, LLMs struggle to process tabular data, ensuring fairness and
delivering reliable predictions. In this work, we assess the performance and
fairness of LLMs on serialized loan approval datasets from three geographically
distinct regions: Ghana, Germany, and the United States. Our evaluation focuses
on the model's zero-shot and in-context learning (ICL) capabilities. Our
results reveal that the choice of serialization (Serialization refers to the
process of converting tabular data into text formats suitable for processing by
LLMs.) format significantly affects both performance and fairness in LLMs, with
certain formats such as GReat and LIFT yielding higher F1 scores but
exacerbating fairness disparities. Notably, while ICL improved model
performance by 4.9-59.6% relative to zero-shot baselines, its effect on
fairness varied considerably across datasets. Our work underscores the
importance of effective tabular data representation methods and fairness-aware
models to improve the reliability of LLMs in financial decision-making.

*Geri Skenderi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Negative curvature in SAT graphs explains GNN performance drops on hard instances; curvature tracks instance hardness and oversquashing; serves as a predictor of solver performance and guides design.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explain fundamental architectural limitations of GNNs on SAT by a geometric lens (graph Ricci curvature) and to relate local connectivity bottlenecks to solver performance.

Method: Provide theoretical proofs that bipartite graphs from random k-SAT are inherently negatively curved and that curvature decreases with problem difficulty; connect curvature to oversquashing in GNNs; validate claims empirically across SAT benchmarks and show curvature predicts performance.

Result: Demonstrates negative curvature in SAT-derived graphs; curvature correlates with problem difficulty and with oversquashing; empirically validates curvature as a strong indicator of complexity and solver performance.

Conclusion: Curvature-informed understanding offers design principles for SAT solvers and suggests future work to mitigate curvature-induced bottlenecks and oversquashing in GNN-based SAT solvers.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have recently shown promise as solvers for
Boolean Satisfiability Problems (SATs) by operating on graph representations of
logical formulas. However, their performance degrades sharply on harder
instances, raising the question of whether this reflects fundamental
architectural limitations. In this work, we provide a geometric explanation
through the lens of graph Ricci Curvature (RC), which quantifies local
connectivity bottlenecks. We prove that bipartite graphs derived from random
k-SAT formulas are inherently negatively curved, and that this curvature
decreases with instance difficulty. Building on this, we show that GNN-based
SAT solvers are affected by oversquashing, a phenomenon where long-range
dependencies become impossible to compress into fixed-length representations.
We validate our claims empirically across different SAT benchmarks and confirm
that curvature is both a strong indicator of problem complexity and can be used
to predict performance. Finally, we connect our findings to design principles
of existing solvers and outline promising directions for future work.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Feasible data minimization for implicit feedback in recommender systems; substantial reduction possible with minimal performance loss, but practical adoption hinges on technical setting and user characteristics; universal 'necessity' standard is hard.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Legal principle of data minimization; recommender systems rely on extensive personal data; need to operationalize minimization for acceptable utility.

Method: Proposes a novel problem formulation; analyzes multiple minimization techniques; examines factors affecting effectiveness; conducts feasibility analysis.

Result: Significant reduction in inference data is technically feasible with limited accuracy/utility loss; but impact depends on performance targets, model choice, history size, and preference complexity.

Conclusion: Technical feasibility established but practical adoption remains challenging; universal standard for data necessity unlikely; recommendations for context-aware, tailored minimization approaches.

Abstract: Data minimization is a legal principle requiring personal data processing to
be limited to what is necessary for a specified purpose. Operationalizing this
principle for recommender systems, which rely on extensive personal data,
remains a significant challenge. This paper conducts a feasibility study on
minimizing implicit feedback inference data for such systems. We propose a
novel problem formulation, analyze various minimization techniques, and
investigate key factors influencing their effectiveness. We demonstrate that
substantial inference data reduction is technically feasible without
significant performance loss. However, its practicality is critically
determined by two factors: the technical setting (e.g., performance targets,
choice of model) and user characteristics (e.g., history size, preference
complexity). Thus, while we establish its technical feasibility, we conclude
that data minimization remains practically challenging and its dependence on
the technical and user context makes a universal standard for data `necessity'
difficult to implement.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Textile-based ECG garment with a novel electrode placement reduces noise and motion artifacts, achieving high signal fidelity comparable to reference devices. A sex-balanced study (30 participants: 15 male, 15 female) evaluates signal quality, rhythm/morphology, ML classification, and electrode projection angle effects across real-world activities, revealing sex-specific determinants and supporting equitable, wearable cardiac monitoring.

Motivation: Wearable ECG engineering faces noise and motion artifacts, and performance can vary by sex due to anatomical differences. This work aims to (i) optimize electrode placement on a textile garment to minimize artifacts, (ii) validate performance against references, and (iii) examine sex-specific factors to support equitable cardiac monitoring.

Method: Develop a wearable textile ECG garment with innovative electrode placement. Conduct a sex-balanced evaluation with 15 healthy males and 15 healthy females. Assess performance via (a) quantitative signal quality indices, (b) rhythm-based analyses of heart rate and heart rate variability, (c) machine learning classification tasks for predictive utility, (d) morphological ECG feature analysis (amplitudes/intervals), and (e) electrode projection angle effects relative to body shape. All analyses are stratified by sex and cover multiple activity phases to simulate real-world conditions.

Result: The textile system delivers signal quality highly concordant with reference devices in both rhythm and morphological analyses, demonstrates robust classification performance, and enables identification of key sex-specific determinants affecting signal acquisition. The findings support practical viability for textile-based ECG garments in physiological monitoring and psychophysiological state detection.

Conclusion: Textile ECG garments are a viable, equitable platform for wearable cardiac monitoring. Incorporating sex-specific design considerations is important to ensure reliable diagnostics across diverse users.

Abstract: We introduce a novel wearable textile-garment featuring an innovative
electrode placement aimed at minimizing noise and motion artifacts, thereby
enhancing signal fidelity in Electrocardiography (ECG) recordings. We present a
comprehensive, sex-balanced evaluation involving 15 healthy males and 15
healthy female participants to ensure the device's suitability across
anatomical and physiological variations. The assessment framework encompasses
distinct evaluation approaches: quantitative signal quality indices to
objectively benchmark device performance; rhythm-based analyzes of
physiological parameters such as heart rate and heart rate variability; machine
learning classification tasks to assess application-relevant predictive
utility; morphological analysis of ECG features including amplitude and
interval parameters; and investigations of the effects of electrode projection
angle given by the textile / body shape, with all analyzes stratified by sex to
elucidate sex-specific influences. Evaluations were conducted across various
activity phases representing real-world conditions. The results demonstrate
that the textile system achieves signal quality highly concordant with
reference devices in both rhythm and morphological analyses, exhibits robust
classification performance, and enables identification of key sex-specific
determinants affecting signal acquisition. These findings underscore the
practical viability of textile-based ECG garments for physiological monitoring
as well as psychophysiological state detection. Moreover, we identify the
importance of incorporating sex-specific design considerations to ensure
equitable and reliable cardiac diagnostics in wearable health technologies.

*Julen Cestero,Carmine Delle Femine,Kenji S. Muro,Marco Quartulli,Marcello Restelli*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PINNs outperform classical ML as surrogate models for smart grid dynamics, offering better generalization and physics-consistent predictions across interpolation, cross-validation, and episodic forecasting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address data scarcity and physical inconsistency in data-driven smart grid models; require safe, feasible, and real-time surrogates that respect first-principles physics.

Method: Train physics-informed neural networks using physics-based loss terms (power balance, operational constraints, grid stability) and compare with XGBoost, Random Forest, and Linear Regression across interpolation, cross-validation, and episodic trajectory prediction experiments.

Result: PINNs exhibit superior generalization with lower MAE and reliable state-transition capture in dynamic grid operations, while baselines show erratic performance; PINNs retain physical feasibility even in safety-critical regimes, with modest degradation in extreme conditions.

Conclusion: PINNs are a paradigm-shifting tool for smart grid surrogation, merging data-driven flexibility with physics-based rigor, enabling real-time control and scalable digital twins.

Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) present a transformative approach
for smart grid modeling by integrating physical laws directly into learning
frameworks, addressing critical challenges of data scarcity and physical
consistency in conventional data-driven methods. This paper evaluates PINNs'
capabilities as surrogate models for smart grid dynamics, comparing their
performance against XGBoost, Random Forest, and Linear Regression across three
key experiments: interpolation, cross-validation, and episodic trajectory
prediction. By training PINNs exclusively through physics-based loss functions
(enforcing power balance, operational constraints, and grid stability) we
demonstrate their superior generalization, outperforming data-driven models in
error reduction. Notably, PINNs maintain comparatively lower MAE in dynamic
grid operations, reliably capturing state transitions in both random and
expert-driven control scenarios, while traditional models exhibit erratic
performance. Despite slight degradation in extreme operational regimes, PINNs
consistently enforce physical feasibility, proving vital for safety-critical
applications. Our results contribute to establishing PINNs as a
paradigm-shifting tool for smart grid surrogation, bridging data-driven
flexibility with first-principles rigor. This work advances real-time grid
control and scalable digital twins, emphasizing the necessity of physics-aware
architectures in mission-critical energy systems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: InsightTab distills actionable insights to enable robust few-shot tabular classification by guiding LLMs through rule summarization, strategic exemplar selection, and reflective learning; evaluated on nine datasets with consistent state-of-the-art gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs show promise for few-shot tabular classification but struggle with data variability and domain-specific requirements; a data-driven distillation process is needed to align LLM capabilities with tabular tasks.

Method: InsightTab is a framework that follows divide-and-conquer, easy-first, and reflective learning principles. It combines rule summarization, strategic exemplification, and insight reflection through deep collaboration between LLMs and data modeling techniques to produce actionable insights for LLMs on tabular tasks.

Result: Extensive evaluation on nine datasets shows consistent improvements over state-of-the-art methods; ablation studies validate the principle-guided distillation; analyses highlight InsightTab’s effectiveness in leveraging labeled data and in managing bias.

Conclusion: Extracted insights enable LLMs to align their general knowledge with the specific requirements of tabular tasks, enabling robust and effective few-shot classification while supporting data efficiency and bias management.

Abstract: Recent studies show the promise of large language models (LLMs) for few-shot
tabular classification but highlight challenges due to the variability in
structured data. To address this, we propose distilling data into actionable
insights to enable robust and effective classification by LLMs. Drawing
inspiration from human learning processes, we introduce InsightTab, an insight
distillation framework guided by principles of divide-and-conquer, easy-first,
and reflective learning. Our approach integrates rule summarization, strategic
exemplification, and insight reflection through deep collaboration between LLMs
and data modeling techniques. The obtained insights enable LLMs to better align
their general knowledge and capabilities with the particular requirements of
specific tabular tasks. We extensively evaluate InsightTab on nine datasets.
The results demonstrate consistent improvement over state-of-the-art methods.
Ablation studies further validate the principle-guided distillation process,
while analyses emphasize InsightTab's effectiveness in leveraging labeled data

*Bo Li,Yingqi Feng,Ming Jin,Xin Zheng,Yufei Tang,Laurent Cherubin,Alan Wee-Chung Liew,Can Wang,Qinghua Lu,Jingwei Yao,Shirui Pan,Hong Zhang,Xingquan Zhu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: OASIS uses diffusion-adversarial modeling to impute sparse ocean salinity data from drifters, addressing nonlinearity, noise, and missingness where traditional methods fail.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Salinity is key to ocean dynamics; drifter data are sparse and noisy. Traditional linear-based methods (remote sensing, optimal interpolation) are hampered by cloud cover, sensor drift, and low satellite revisit. A flexible approach is needed to handle severe sparsity while incorporating physical covariates without extra sensors.

Method: A diffusion probabilistic model trained in an adversarial framework to impute missing salinity values conditioned on covariates (e.g., location, time, auxiliary physical variables). The diffusion process generates plausible imputations while the adversarial component enforces physical realism and consistency with observed data.

Result: Anticipated improvements over baselines in imputation accuracy under sparse conditions, with better handling of noise and irregular sampling. The model should more effectively capture spatial-temporal structure and leverage covariates than linear methods or standard ML models.

Conclusion: OASIS offers a flexible, principled framework for salinity imputation in drifter datasets, outperforming traditional approaches and potentially extending to other geophysical variables, with implications for improved ocean state estimates and climate analyses.

Abstract: Ocean salinity plays a vital role in circulation, climate, and marine
ecosystems, yet its measurement is often sparse, irregular, and noisy,
especially in drifter-based datasets. Traditional approaches, such as remote
sensing and optimal interpolation, rely on linearity and stationarity, and are
limited by cloud cover, sensor drift, and low satellite revisit rates. While
machine learning models offer flexibility, they often fail under severe
sparsity and lack principled ways to incorporate physical covariates without
specialized sensors. In this paper, we introduce the OceAn Salinity Imputation
System (OASIS), a novel diffusion adversarial framework designed to address
these challenges.

### [129] [Convergence of Stochastic Gradient Methods for Wide Two-Layer Physics-Informed Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21571)
*Bangti Jin,Longjun Wu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proves that stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and SGD flow converge linearly (exponentially) with high probability when training over-parameterized two-layer PINNs for a broad class of activation functions, extending prior gradient-descent results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PINNs are a popular tool for solving PDEs, and SGD-based training is standard in practice. However, convergence guarantees in the stochastic setting—especially for over-parameterized networks and broad activation functions—are lacking. Establishing such guarantees helps understand optimization dynamics and provides reliability assurances for training PINNs with stochastic methods.

Method: The authors perform a theoretical analysis of SGD/flow for an over-parameterized two-layer PINN with a general activation class. They address the challenges posed by dynamic randomness in stochastic optimization by proving that the Gram matrices involved remain positive definite throughout training, enabling a linear-convergence bound with high probability.

Result: Under suitable over-parameterization and mild assumptions on the activation class, SGD/SGD-flow achieves linear convergence with high probability for training two-layer PINNs, extending the known results from gradient descent to stochastic optimization.

Conclusion: The work yields a rigorous convergence guarantee for stochastic training of PINNs, offering insight into the optimization dynamics and confirming that the stochastic dynamics preserve favorable conditioning (positive definiteness of Gram matrices) during training, which underpins reliable convergence.

Abstract: Physics informed neural networks (PINNs) represent a very popular class of
neural solvers for partial differential equations. In practice, one often
employs stochastic gradient descent type algorithms to train the neural
network. Therefore, the convergence guarantee of stochastic gradient descent is
of fundamental importance. In this work, we establish the linear convergence of
stochastic gradient descent / flow in training over-parameterized two layer
PINNs for a general class of activation functions in the sense of high
probability. These results extend the existing result [18] in which gradient
descent was analyzed. The challenge of the analysis lies in handling the
dynamic randomness introduced by stochastic optimization methods. The key of
the analysis lies in ensuring the positive definiteness of suitable Gram
matrices during the training. The analysis sheds insight into the dynamics of
the optimization process, and provides guarantees on the neural networks
trained by stochastic algorithms.

*Agustinus Kristiadi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Accessible, self-contained introduction to the theory of probabilistic decision-making algorithms (bandits, Bayesian optimization, and tree search) aimed at non-experts, linking theory to practical data-efficient scientific discovery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Theoretical analyses of probabilistic decision-making methods are powerful but often inaccessible to non-experts. This monograph addresses the need for a clear, beginner-friendly treatment to understand how these algorithms behave and to guide the development of next-generation, data-efficient workflows for costly experimentation in science and engineering.

Method: Systematic, self-contained exposition of core theory governing bandit algorithms, Bayesian optimization, and tree search, with minimal prerequisites (probability, statistics, and basic Gaussian-process concepts). The presentation likely includes definitions, proofs, examples, and possibly pseudocode or conceptual illustrations to build intuition.

Result: A readable, self-contained introduction that demystifies the theoretical underpinnings of probabilistic decision-making methods, enabling practitioners and researchers to reason about performance, convergence, and information-gathering, and to design more data-efficient algorithms.

Conclusion: By making theoretical analyses more accessible, this work aims to accelerate the adoption and advancement of principled, data-efficient decision-making tools in scientific discovery and related fields.

Abstract: Decision theories offer principled methods for making choices under various
types of uncertainty. Algorithms that implement these theories have been
successfully applied to a wide range of real-world problems, including
materials and drug discovery. Indeed, they are desirable since they can
adaptively gather information to make better decisions in the future, resulting
in data-efficient workflows. In scientific discovery, where experiments are
costly, these algorithms can thus significantly reduce the cost of
experimentation. Theoretical analyses of these algorithms are crucial for
understanding their behavior and providing valuable insights for developing
next-generation algorithms. However, theoretical analyses in the literature are
often inaccessible to non-experts. This monograph aims to provide an
accessible, self-contained introduction to the theoretical analysis of commonly
used probabilistic decision-making algorithms, including bandit algorithms,
Bayesian optimization, and tree search algorithms. Only basic knowledge of
probability theory and statistics, along with some elementary knowledge about
Gaussian processes, is assumed.

### [132] [Predicting Social Media Engagement from Emotional and Temporal Features](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21650)
*Yunwoo Kim,Junhyuk Hwang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A machine learning model predicts social media engagement (likes and comments) from emotional and temporal song features using a HistGradientBoostingRegressor on log-transformed targets. It performs extremely well for likes but poorly for comments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how affective signals (valence/arousal) and timing influence engagement, while handling skewed engagement distributions and separating prediction behavior for likes versus comments.

Method: Train a multi-target regression model (HistGradientBoostingRegressor) on 600-song dataset with features including valence, arousal, sentiment metrics, temporal metadata, and existing view counts. Targets are engagement ratios log-transformed to reduce skew. Evaluation uses a custom magnitude-based accuracy measure plus standard metrics like R^2.

Result: The model achieves R^2 = 0.98 for predicting likes and R^2 = 0.41 for comments, indicating near-perfect prediction of likes but limited capture of factors driving comments.

Conclusion: Engagement for likes is largely explained by readily captured affective and exposure signals, while comments rely on additional factors beyond the current feature set.

Abstract: We present a machine learning approach for predicting social media engagement
(comments and likes) from emotional and temporal features. The dataset contains
600 songs with annotations for valence, arousal, and related sentiment metrics.
A multi target regression model based on HistGradientBoostingRegressor is
trained on log transformed engagement ratios to address skewed targets.
Performance is evaluated with both a custom order of magnitude accuracy and
standard regression metrics, including the coefficient of determination (R^2).
Results show that emotional and temporal metadata, together with existing view
counts, predict future engagement effectively. The model attains R^2 = 0.98 for
likes but only R^2 = 0.41 for comments. This gap indicates that likes are
largely driven by readily captured affective and exposure signals, whereas
comments depend on additional factors not represented in the current feature
set.

### [133] [Activation Subspaces for Out-of-Distribution Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21695)
*Barış Zöngür,Robin Hesse,Stefan Roth*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ActSub: a subspace-based OOD detector that uses SVD of the classifier head to separate decisive and insignificant activation components, yielding strong performance, especially under large distribution shifts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: OOD detection remains challenging under real-world distribution shifts; existing activation cues can be tainted by the classification task, particularly in far-OOD; a representation that isolates task-invariant signals could improve discrimination between ID and OOD.

Method: Perform singular value decomposition on the classifier head's weight matrix to split activations into a decisive subspace (maximally affecting the output) and an insignificant subspace (minimally affecting the output). In near-OOD regimes, use the decisive subspace; in far-OOD regimes, rely on the insignificant subspace; combine both into a unified approach called ActSub.

Result: The insignificant subspace better separates ID from OOD under large distribution shifts (Far-OOD), while the decisive subspace helps under smaller shifts (Near-OOD). ActSub achieves state-of-the-art results on standard OOD benchmarks by integrating these findings.

Conclusion: A subspace-aware activation shaping framework (ActSub) can adapt to the distribution-shift regime and substantially improve OOD detection performance across benchmarks.

Abstract: To ensure the reliability of deep models in real-world applications,
out-of-distribution (OOD) detection methods aim to distinguish samples close to
the training distribution (in-distribution, ID) from those farther away (OOD).
In this work, we propose a novel OOD detection method that utilizes singular
value decomposition of the weight matrix of the classification head to
decompose the model's activations into decisive and insignificant components,
which contribute maximally, respectively minimally, to the final classifier
output. We find that the subspace of insignificant components more effectively
distinguishes ID from OOD data than raw activations in regimes of large
distribution shifts (Far-OOD). This occurs because the classification objective
leaves the insignificant subspace largely unaffected, yielding features that
are ''untainted'' by the target classification task. Conversely, in regimes of
smaller distribution shifts (Near-OOD), we find that activation shaping methods
profit from only considering the decisive subspace, as the insignificant
component can cause interference in the activation space. By combining two
findings into a single approach, termed ActSub, we achieve state-of-the-art
results in various standard OOD benchmarks.

*Siddharth Mangalik,Ojas Deshpande,Adithya V. Ganesan,Sean A. P. Clouston,H. Andrew Schwartz*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Adapts Longitudinal Regression Discontinuity Designs into a statistical learning framework to predict local-level discontinuities and slope changes in mental health scores due to events; using exogenous/dynamic covariates improves accuracy; modest correlations but useful for estimating idiosyncratic effects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To quantify community-specific mental health impacts of local events beyond simple forecasts, enabling quasi-experimental causal insights from observational data by extending LRDD into a predictive learning setting.

Method: Propose a statistical learning framework that estimates future discontinuities and changes in slope given a history of scores, dynamic covariates, and exogenous/static variables. Apply to US counties' anxiety around COVID-19 events and compare models of increasing sophistication that incorporate exogenous and dynamic covariates.

Result: Best performance arises when integrating exogenous and dynamic covariates. Discontinuity correlation r=0.46; slope correlation r=0.65, indicating improvement over traditional static community representations.

Conclusion: Discontinuity forecasting enables estimation of idiosyncratic effects of potential future or hypothetical events on communities; the approach improves predictive power and yields more causal-like insights for policy and public health planning.

Abstract: Estimating community-specific mental health effects of local events is vital
for public health policy. While forecasting mental health scores alone offers
limited insights into the impact of events on community well-being,
quasi-experimental designs like the Longitudinal Regression Discontinuity
Design (LRDD) from econometrics help researchers derive more effects that are
more likely to be causal from observational data. LRDDs aim to extrapolate the
size of changes in an outcome (e.g. a discontinuity in running scores for
anxiety) due to a time-specific event. Here, we propose adapting LRDDs beyond
traditional forecasting into a statistical learning framework whereby future
discontinuities (i.e. time-specific shifts) and changes in slope (i.e. linear
trajectories) are estimated given a location's history of the score, dynamic
covariates (other running assessments), and exogenous variables (static
representations). Applying our framework to predict discontinuities in the
anxiety of US counties from COVID-19 events, we found the task was difficult
but more achievable as the sophistication of models was increased, with the
best results coming from integrating exogenous and dynamic covariates. Our
approach shows strong improvement ($r=+.46$ for discontinuity and $r = +.65$
for slope) over traditional static community representations. Discontinuity
forecasting raises new possibilities for estimating the idiosyncratic effects
of potential future or hypothetical events on specific communities.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SNL enables real-time FPGA-based ML inference for ultra-high-rate data; Auto-SNL eases deployment; benchmark shows competitive or superior latency and sometimes resource savings vs hls4ml on ZCU102.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To manage the massive data streams from the LCLS-II FEL (up to 1 MHz pulses and >1 TB/s) by performing real-time data reduction with low latency. Conventional ML incurs prohibitive latency and lacks flexible weight updates; need dynamic, reconfigurable inference on FPGA.

Method: Develop SLAC Neural Network Library (SNL) for FPGA deployment with support for dynamic weight updates without FPGA resynthesis. Introduce Auto-SNL, a Python extension to convert Python neural networks into SNL-compatible high-level synthesis code. Benchmark against hls4ml across multiple networks, fixed-point precisions, and synthesis configurations on a Xilinx ZCU102 FPGA.

Result: SNL achieves competitive or superior latency in most tested architectures and, in some cases, offers FPGA resource savings compared with hls4ml.

Conclusion: SNL/Auto-SNL broaden access to real-time ML on FPGA, enabling adaptive learning and deployment in high-energy physics, medical imaging, robotics, and other data-intensive fields, by delivering low-latency inference with flexible updating and streamlined tooling.

Abstract: The LCLS-II Free Electron Laser (FEL) will generate X-ray pulses for beamline
experiments at rates of up to 1~MHz, with detectors producing data throughputs
exceeding 1 TB/s. Managing such massive data streams presents significant
challenges, as transmission and storage infrastructures become prohibitively
expensive. Machine learning (ML) offers a promising solution for real-time data
reduction, but conventional implementations introduce excessive latency, making
them unsuitable for high-speed experimental environments. To address these
challenges, SLAC developed the SLAC Neural Network Library (SNL), a specialized
framework designed to deploy real-time ML inference models on
Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA). SNL's key feature is the ability to
dynamically update model weights without requiring FPGA resynthesis, enhancing
flexibility for adaptive learning applications. To further enhance usability
and accessibility, we introduce Auto-SNL, a Python extension that streamlines
the process of converting Python-based neural network models into
SNL-compatible high-level synthesis code. This paper presents a benchmark
comparison against hls4ml, the current state-of-the-art tool, across multiple
neural network architectures, fixed-point precisions, and synthesis
configurations targeting a Xilinx ZCU102 FPGA. The results showed that SNL
achieves competitive or superior latency in most tested architectures, while in
some cases also offering FPGA resource savings. This adaptation demonstrates
SNL's versatility, opening new opportunities for researchers and academics in
fields such as high-energy physics, medical imaging, robotics, and many more.

### [136] [UniMLR: Modeling Implicit Class Significance for Multi-Label Ranking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21772)
*V. Bugra Yesilkaynak,Emine Dari,Alican Mertan,Gozde Unal*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: UniMLR introduces ranking among positive labels in multi-label ranking by modeling their significance as probability distributions, introduces Ranked MNISTs, and demonstrates positive-rank-order learning and empirical benefits on real and synthetic data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLR methods only leverage bipartition into positive/negative labels and ignore the relative importance/ranking among positive labels; this limits modeling of class relevance and hinders unified ranking/classification. Additionally, scarcity and annotation bias in MLR datasets motivate synthetic, controllable data (Ranked MNISTs) for evaluation.

Method: Proposes UniMLR, a paradigm that treats implicit class relevance as probability distributions informed by the ranking among positive labels; unifies ranking and classification tasks in MLR. Introduces eight synthetic Ranked MNIST datasets with varying significance-determining factors. Evaluates via statistical analysis of learned positive rank order and extensive experiments on real-world and synthetic data.

Result: Empirically, UniMLR learns a representation of the positive rank order that matches ground truth and scales with underlying significance; experiments on real-world and synthetic datasets demonstrate the method's value and robustness.

Conclusion: Modeling positive-label ranking as a probability distribution within MLR (UniMLR) is effective, enabling unified ranking/classification and improved representation of positive-label significance; the Ranked MNISTs provide a controllable evaluation platform and support broader adoption of this approach.

Abstract: Existing multi-label ranking (MLR) frameworks only exploit information
deduced from the bipartition of labels into positive and negative sets.
Therefore, they do not benefit from ranking among positive labels, which is the
novel MLR approach we introduce in this paper. We propose UniMLR, a new MLR
paradigm that models implicit class relevance/significance values as
probability distributions using the ranking among positive labels, rather than
treating them as equally important. This approach unifies ranking and
classification tasks associated with MLR. Additionally, we address the
challenges of scarcity and annotation bias in MLR datasets by introducing eight
synthetic datasets (Ranked MNISTs) generated with varying
significance-determining factors, providing an enriched and controllable
experimental environment. We statistically demonstrate that our method
accurately learns a representation of the positive rank order, which is
consistent with the ground truth and proportional to the underlying
significance values. Finally, we conduct comprehensive empirical experiments on
both real-world and synthetic datasets, demonstrating the value of our proposed
framework.

*Peng Yang,Zhengdong Huang,Zicheng Xie,Wentao Tian,Jingyu Liu,Lunhong Dong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A framework for heart rate prediction robust to data heterogeneity across devices and users. Introduces random feature dropout for source heterogeneity, time-aware attention with a contrastive objective for user heterogeneity, and releases ParroTao benchmark. Achieves 17% and 15% improvements on ParroTao and FitRec respectively; demonstrates discriminative representations and a practical downstream benefit.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Data heterogeneity—from fragmented device markets and individual physiological variability—hampers real-world HR prediction. There is a need for representations that remain effective across diverse feature sets and user patterns.

Method: 1) Random feature dropout to simulate and tolerate missing or varying feature sets across devices (source heterogeneity). 2) Time-aware attention module to capture long-term physiological traits for users (user heterogeneity). 3) Contrastive learning objective to form a discriminative latent representation space. 4) Public release of ParroTao benchmark dataset to reflect real-world heterogeneity. 5) Downstream predictors operate on the learned latent representations, improving robustness across heterogeneous data patterns.

Result: The model significantly outperforms existing baselines by 17% on ParroTao and 15% on FitRec datasets. Learned representations are highly discriminative, and downstream tasks confirm practical utility of the approach.

Conclusion: The proposed heterogeneity-robust framework effectively handles both source and user heterogeneity in heart rate prediction, yields strong empirical gains, and contributes a valuable benchmark for future research.

Abstract: Heart rate prediction is vital for personalized health monitoring and
fitness, while it frequently faces a critical challenge when deploying in
real-world: data heterogeneity. We classify it in two key dimensions: source
heterogeneity from fragmented device markets with varying feature sets, and
user heterogeneity reflecting distinct physiological patterns across
individuals and activities. Existing methods either discard device-specific
information, or fail to model user-specific differences, limiting their
real-world performance. To address this, we propose a framework that learns
latent representations agnostic to both heterogeneity, enabling downstream
predictors to work consistently under heterogeneous data patterns.
Specifically, we introduce a random feature dropout strategy to handle source
heterogeneity, making the model robust to various feature sets. To manage user
heterogeneity, we employ a time-aware attention module to capture long-term
physiological traits and use a contrastive learning objective to build a
discriminative representation space. To reflect the heterogeneous nature of
real-world data, we created and publicly released a new benchmark dataset,
ParroTao. Evaluations on both ParroTao and the public FitRec dataset show that
our model significantly outperforms existing baselines by 17% and 15%,
respectively. Furthermore, analysis of the learned representations demonstrates
their strong discriminative power, and one downstream application task confirm
the practical value of our model.

*Xiaoyang Wang,Christopher C. Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MoE-Health is a Mixture-of-Experts framework for robust multimodal fusion in healthcare, handling incomplete modalities with dynamic gating and showing superior performance on MIMIC-IV tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world healthcare data are multimodal and often incomplete; existing methods assume full modality data or rely on manual selection, hindering deployment across diverse settings.

Method: A Mixture of Experts architecture with specialized experts for different modality subsets and a dynamic gating mechanism that selects/composes experts based on available modalities for each sample.

Result: On MIMIC-IV, MoE-Health improves performance over existing multimodal fusion methods across in-hospital mortality, long length of stay, and readmission, and remains robust across varying modality availability patterns.

Conclusion: MoE-Health offers flexible, robust multimodal fusion for healthcare prediction, enabling better performance in heterogeneous data environments and facilitating real-world deployment.

Abstract: Healthcare systems generate diverse multimodal data, including Electronic
Health Records (EHR), clinical notes, and medical images. Effectively
leveraging this data for clinical prediction is challenging, particularly as
real-world samples often present with varied or incomplete modalities. Existing
approaches typically require complete modality data or rely on manual selection
strategies, limiting their applicability in real-world clinical settings where
data availability varies across patients and institutions. To address these
limitations, we propose MoE-Health, a novel Mixture of Experts framework
designed for robust multimodal fusion in healthcare prediction. MoE-Health
architecture is specifically developed to handle samples with differing
modalities and improve performance on critical clinical tasks. By leveraging
specialized expert networks and a dynamic gating mechanism, our approach
dynamically selects and combines relevant experts based on available data
modalities, enabling flexible adaptation to varying data availability
scenarios. We evaluate MoE-Health on the MIMIC-IV dataset across three critical
clinical prediction tasks: in-hospital mortality prediction, long length of
stay, and hospital readmission prediction. Experimental results demonstrate
that MoE-Health achieves superior performance compared to existing multimodal

### [139] [QR-LoRA: QR-Based Low-Rank Adaptation for Efficient Fine-Tuning of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21810)
*Jessica Liang,Anirudh Bharadwaj*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: QR-LoRA expresses LoRA updates as coefficients of an orthonormal basis derived from the pretrained weight matrix via QR decomposition with column pivoting, enabling ultra-compact fine-tuning that matches or outperforms full fine-tuning and other LoRA variants on GLUE with ~601 trainable params.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the expensive, less interpretable SVD-based LoRA initializations and to achieve higher parameter efficiency by enforcing a structured adaptation basis.

Method: Compute a QR decomposition with column pivoting on the pretrained weight matrix to extract an orthonormal basis. Represent the LoRA update as a linear combination of these basis vectors and train only the scalar coefficients.

Result: On GLUE tasks, QR-LoRA matches or exceeds the performance of full fine-tuning, standard LoRA, and SVD-LoRA, using as few as 601 trainable parameters—over 1000x fewer than full fine-tuning and roughly 77x fewer than typical LoRA configurations.

Conclusion: A QR-based orthonormal basis provides a structured, highly parameter-efficient mechanism for adapting large models, achieving competitive or superior performance with substantially reduced trainable parameters.

Abstract: The growing scale of Large Language Models (LLMs) has necessitated the
development of parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques. Low-Rank Adaptation
(LoRA) has emerged as a promising approach, reducing the number of trainable
parameters by applying low-rank updates to pretrained weights. While standard
LoRA learns both update factors directly, several recent variants first
initialize those matrices via an SVD of the pretrained weights -- an operation
that can be expensive on large models and yields singular vectors that are not
always easy to interpret. In this work, we extract an orthonormal basis from
the pretrained weight matrix using QR decomposition with column pivoting, and
then express the LoRA update as a linear combination of these basis vectors --
training only the scalar coefficients, which imposes clear structure on
adaptation and drastically reduces parameter count. Experiments across GLUE
tasks show that QR-LoRA matches or exceeds the performance of full fine-tuning,
standard LoRA, and SVD-LoRA (LoRA with update matrices initialized via singular
value decomposition) with as few as 601 parameters -- a reduction of over 1000x
compared to full fine-tuning and 77x fewer than typical LoRA setups.

### [140] [Achieving Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Under Rényi Differential Privacy for Fair and Private Data Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21815)
*Tobias Hyrup,Emmanouil Panagiotou,Arjun Roy,Arthur Zimek,Eirini Ntoutsi,Peter Schneider-Kamp*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A privacy-preserving, task-agnostic synthetic data generator for tabular data (FLIP) using a transformer-based VAE with latent diffusion, achieving fairness under Rényi differential privacy via input-space balanced sampling and latent-space CKA alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Regulatory pressure (GDPR/HIPAA) and AI governance require risk-aware data sharing and responsible AI; existing synthetic data methods struggle to balance privacy, fairness, and utility, especially in tabular healthcare data.

Method: FLIP combines a transformer-based variational autoencoder with latent diffusion to generate heterogeneous tabular data. Privacy is enforced with Rényi differential privacy during training. Fairness in the input space is addressed with RDP-compatible balanced sampling across group-specific noise levels and varying sampling rates. In latent space, CKA-based alignment of neuron activations across protected groups promotes independence between latent representations and protected attributes.

Result: Empirical results show FLIP achieves significant fairness improvements for task-agnostic fairness and across diverse downstream tasks under differential privacy constraints.

Conclusion: FLIP presents a broadly applicable, privacy-preserving approach to fair synthetic tabular data generation, suitable for risk-aware data sharing in sensitive domains and robust across downstream tasks under RDP constraints.

Abstract: As privacy regulations such as the GDPR and HIPAA and responsibility
frameworks for artificial intelligence such as the AI Act gain traction, the
ethical and responsible use of real-world data faces increasing constraints.
Synthetic data generation has emerged as a promising solution to risk-aware
data sharing and model development, particularly for tabular datasets that are
foundational to sensitive domains such as healthcare. To address both privacy
and fairness concerns in this setting, we propose FLIP (Fair Latent
Intervention under Privacy guarantees), a transformer-based variational
autoencoder augmented with latent diffusion to generate heterogeneous tabular
data. Unlike the typical setup in fairness-aware data generation, we assume a
task-agnostic setup, not reliant on a fixed, defined downstream task, thus
offering broader applicability. To ensure privacy, FLIP employs R\'enyi
differential privacy (RDP) constraints during training and addresses fairness
in the input space with RDP-compatible balanced sampling that accounts for
group-specific noise levels across multiple sampling rates. In the latent
space, we promote fairness by aligning neuron activation patterns across
protected groups using Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA), a similarity measure
extending the Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC). This alignment
encourages statistical independence between latent representations and the
protected feature. Empirical results demonstrate that FLIP effectively provides
significant fairness improvements for task-agnostic fairness and across diverse
downstream tasks under differential privacy constraints.

*Delin Qu,Haoming Song,Qizhi Chen,Zhaoqing Chen,Xianqiang Gao,Xinyi Ye,Qi Lv,Modi Shi,Guanghui Ren,Cheng Ruan,Maoqing Yao,Haoran Yang,Jiacheng Bao,Bin Zhao,Dong Wang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: EO-1 is an embodied foundation model trained with interleaved vision-text-action pre-training on EO-Data1.5M, achieving improved multimodal embodied reasoning and robot control across open-world tasks and multiple embodiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current vision-language-action models struggle with human-level flexibility for interleaved reasoning and interaction in open-world robotics; there is a need for a unified architecture that handles multimodal inputs and a large, high-quality dataset focused on interleaved vision-text-action tasks.

Method: A unified architecture that processes multimodal inputs indiscriminately (image, text, video, action) and is trained on EO-Data1.5M via auto-regressive decoding and flow matching denoising, enabling seamless generation of robot actions and multimodal reasoning in interleaved fashion; evaluation on long-horizon, dexterous manipulation tasks across multiple embodiments.

Result: Extensive experiments show that interleaved vision-text-action learning improves open-world understanding and generalization, with EO-1 achieving superior multimodal embodied reasoning and robot control across diverse tasks and embodiments.

Conclusion:  EO-1 and EO-Data1.5M offer a valuable framework and dataset strategy for advancing embodied foundation models, supporting more flexible and generalizable multimodal understanding and manipulation in open-world settings.

Abstract: The human ability to seamlessly perform multimodal reasoning and physical
interaction in the open world is a core goal for general-purpose embodied
intelligent systems. Recent vision-language-action (VLA) models, which are
co-trained on large-scale robot and visual-text data, have demonstrated notable
progress in general robot control. However, they still fail to achieve
human-level flexibility in interleaved reasoning and interaction. In this work,
introduce EO-Robotics, consists of EO-1 model and EO-Data1.5M dataset. EO-1 is
a unified embodied foundation model that achieves superior performance in
multimodal embodied reasoning and robot control through interleaved
vision-text-action pre-training. The development of EO-1 is based on two key
pillars: (i) a unified architecture that processes multimodal inputs
indiscriminately (image, text, video, and action), and (ii) a massive,
high-quality multimodal embodied reasoning dataset, EO-Data1.5M, which contains
over 1.5 million samples with emphasis on interleaved vision-text-action
comprehension. EO-1 is trained through synergies between auto-regressive
decoding and flow matching denoising on EO-Data1.5M, enabling seamless robot
action generation and multimodal embodied reasoning. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness of interleaved vision-text-action learning for
open-world understanding and generalization, validated through a variety of
long-horizon, dexterous manipulation tasks across multiple embodiments. This
paper details the architecture of EO-1, the data construction strategy of
EO-Data1.5M, and the training methodology, offering valuable insights for
developing advanced embodied foundation models.

### [142] [Observer Design for Optical Flow-Based Visual-Inertial Odometry with Almost-Global Convergence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21163)
*Tarek Bouazza,Soulaimane Berkane,Minh-Duc Hua,Tarek Hamel*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A cascaded observer framework fuses optical flow and IMU for continuous monocular visual-inertial odometry (VIO). It estimates body-frame velocity and gravity direction via a Riccati observer, uses a complementary SO(3) observer for attitude, and derives velocity direction from sparse optical flow with a gradient-descent on the unit sphere. The design is almost globally stable and validated in simulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To achieve robust, continuous monocular VIO by integrating optical flow-derived velocity information with IMU data, enabling simultaneous estimation of body velocity and gravity direction, and providing reliable attitude estimation under persistent translational motion.

Method: A cascaded observer architecture: (1) a globally exponentially stable Riccati observer fuses optical-flow velocity-direction measurements with gyro and accelerometer data to estimate body-frame velocity and gravity direction under persistent translational motion; (2) optionally use magnetometer to assist gravity; (3) a complementary observer on SO(3) for attitude estimation; (4) a gradient-descent algorithm on the unit sphere to recover velocity direction from sparse optical-flow data by solving a constrained minimization problem on the sphere. The interconnected observers are proven to be almost globally asymptotically stable; simulations validate the approach.

Result: Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed observers and the ability to estimate velocity direction, gravity direction, and attitude from monocular VIO data under the proposed framework.

Conclusion: The paper presents a stable, cascaded observer approach for continuous monocular VIO that combines optical flow and IMU data to estimate velocity direction, gravity, and attitude. The Riccati and complementary observers offer stability guarantees (global exponential stability and almost global asymptotic stability, respectively) with a gradient-descent step handling sparse flow data, and the architecture is validated via simulations.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel cascaded observer architecture that combines
optical flow and IMU measurements to perform continuous monocular
visual-inertial odometry (VIO). The proposed solution estimates body-frame
velocity and gravity direction simultaneously by fusing velocity direction
information from optical flow measurements with gyro and accelerometer data.
This fusion is achieved using a globally exponentially stable Riccati observer,
which operates under persistently exciting translational motion conditions. The
estimated gravity direction in the body frame is then employed, along with an
optional magnetometer measurement, to design a complementary observer on
$\mathbf{SO}(3)$ for attitude estimation. The resulting interconnected observer
architecture is shown to be almost globally asymptotically stable. To extract
the velocity direction from sparse optical flow data, a gradient descent
algorithm is developed to solve a constrained minimization problem on the unit
sphere. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithms is validated through
simulation results.

### [143] [Multi-robot Path Planning and Scheduling via Model Predictive Optimal Transport (MPC-OT)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21205)
*Usman A. Khan,Mouhacine Benosman,Wenliang Liu,Federico Pecora,Joseph W. Durham*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: An OT-based approach to multi-robot path planning and scheduling that guarantees non-overlapping trajectories by discretizing space into K cells and using a KxK cost; achieves minimum-cost routes; complexity O(K^3 log K) worst-case, O(K^2 log K) for well-behaved cases; extends with replans and MPC to handle overlaps and dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prevent deadlocks and overlapping paths in multi-robot navigation when matching robots to targets; provide non-overlapping, optimal transitions and scalable planning.

Method: Space discretization into K cells; construct a KxK cost matrix representing transitions; apply optimal transport to compute joint robot-to-target assignments and non-overlapping cell trajectories; incorporate replans and MPC to add temporal structure and account for robot dynamics.

Result: OT yields optimal, non-overlapping routes; computational complexity bounds given; framework ready for deployment without scheduling; temporal extension via replans and MPC.

Conclusion: The integration of OT with MPC and replans offers a principled, scalable framework for safe, efficient multi-robot navigation, but relies on discretization and may face scalability and real-world constraints; further evaluation and parameter choices (K, grid, cost design) are important.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel methodology for path planning and
scheduling for multi-robot navigation that is based on optimal transport theory
and model predictive control. We consider a setup where $N$ robots are tasked
to navigate to $M$ targets in a common space with obstacles. Mapping robots to
targets first and then planning paths can result in overlapping paths that lead
to deadlocks. We derive a strategy based on optimal transport that not only
provides minimum cost paths from robots to targets but also guarantees
non-overlapping trajectories. We achieve this by discretizing the space of
interest into $K$ cells and by imposing a ${K\times K}$ cost structure that
describes the cost of transitioning from one cell to another. Optimal transport
then provides \textit{optimal and non-overlapping} cell transitions for the
robots to reach the targets that can be readily deployed without any scheduling
considerations. The proposed solution requires $\unicode{x1D4AA}(K^3\log K)$
computations in the worst-case and $\unicode{x1D4AA}(K^2\log K)$ for
well-behaved problems. To further accommodate potentially overlapping
trajectories (unavoidable in certain situations) as well as robot dynamics, we
show that a temporal structure can be integrated into optimal transport with
the help of \textit{replans} and \textit{model predictive control}.

### [144] [Uncertainty-Aware Ankle Exoskeleton Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21221)
*Fatima Mumtaza Tourk,Bishoy Galoaa,Sanat Shajan,Aaron J. Young,Michael Everett,Max K. Shepherd*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Uncertainty-aware control enables ankle exoskeletons to safely operate in unstructured environments by automatically disengaging with out-of-distribution movements, using ensembles/autoencoders/GANs to detect uncertainty; online testing with ensembles achieved high F1 (89.2).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enable real-world, safe operation of exoskeletons by moving beyond discrete, predefined actions to handle unfamiliar movements.

Method: Evaluate three uncertainty estimation architectures (model ensembles, autoencoders, GANs) on offline data; select strongest (ensemble of gait phase estimators) and test online to switch assistance on/off based on in-distribution vs out-of-distribution movements.

Result: Online test showed the ensemble approach could reliably identify in- vs out-of-distribution movements and control assistance accordingly, achieving F1 score of 89.2.

Conclusion: Uncertainty-aware disengagement provides a viable path for safe, autonomous exoskeleton support in unstructured environments.

Abstract: Lower limb exoskeletons show promise to assist human movement, but their
utility is limited by controllers designed for discrete, predefined actions in
controlled environments, restricting their real-world applicability. We present
an uncertainty-aware control framework that enables ankle exoskeletons to
operate safely across diverse scenarios by automatically disengaging when
encountering unfamiliar movements. Our approach uses an uncertainty estimator
to classify movements as similar (in-distribution) or different
(out-of-distribution) relative to actions in the training set. We evaluated
three architectures (model ensembles, autoencoders, and generative adversarial
networks) on an offline dataset and tested the strongest performing
architecture (ensemble of gait phase estimators) online. The online test
demonstrated the ability of our uncertainty estimator to turn assistance on and
off as the user transitioned between in-distribution and out-of-distribution
tasks (F1: 89.2). This new framework provides a path for exoskeletons to safely
and autonomously support human movement in unstructured, everyday environments.

### [145] [Remarks on stochastic cloning and delayed-state filtering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21260)
*Tara Mina,Lindsey Marinello,John Christian*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Delayed-state Kalman filtering can reproduce stochastic cloning updates exactly for correlated delayed measurements, but with lower computational and memory costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robotics and navigation often use measurements linked to prior states (e.g., odometry). Handling delayed, correlated measurements via stochastic cloning is common but augments the state. There is value in revisiting an older, unaugmented approach to improve efficiency and clarify misconceptions.

Method: Derive the delayed-state Kalman filter in a generalized Kalman filter form and prove that it yields the same state and covariance updates as stochastic cloning for correlated delayed measurements; analyze computational and memory implications vs. state augmentation.

Result: The delayed-state Kalman filter produces identical state estimates and covariances as stochastic cloning for delayed measurements, while offering computational advantages and reduced memory usage for high-dimensional states.

Conclusion: Properly derived delayed-state Kalman formulations can handle correlated delayed measurements without state augmentation, dispelling the belief that Kalman variants cannot and highlighting practical efficiency gains.

Abstract: Many estimation problems in robotics and navigation involve measurements that
depend on prior states. A prominent example is odometry, which measures the
relative change between states over time. Accurately handling these
delayed-state measurements requires capturing their correlations with prior
state estimates, and a widely used approach is stochastic cloning (SC), which
augments the state vector to account for these correlations.
  This work revisits a long-established but often overlooked alternative--the
delayed-state Kalman filter--and demonstrates that a properly derived filter
yields exactly the same state and covariance update as SC, without requiring
state augmentation. Moreover, the generalized Kalman filter formulation
provides computational advantages, while also reducing memory requirements for
higher-dimensional states.
  Our findings clarify a common misconception that Kalman filter variants are
inherently unable to handle correlated delayed-state measurements,
demonstrating that an alternative formulation achieves the same results more
efficiently.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable reliable, scalable autonomous control research in a cost-effective setting using Mini Autonomous Cars (MACs) and to understand how temporal models (3D CNNs vs RNNs) generalize under varying environmental features and online training requirements.

Method: Train and evaluate RGB-D + 3D CNN architectures against recurrent neural networks on two simulated MAC tracks with distinct environmental features, using task completion, lap time, and driving consistency as metrics.

Result: The 3D CNN approach demonstrated promising results compared with RNNs, with performance and generalization influenced by architectural modifications and track complexity.

Conclusion: 3D CNNs are a viable approach for MAC autonomous driving in simulated environments, offering competitive performance and insights into model design and generalization, warranting further exploration of 3D temporal models in MAC settings.

Abstract: Autonomous driving applications have become increasingly relevant in the
automotive industry due to their potential to enhance vehicle safety,
efficiency, and user experience, thereby meeting the growing demand for
sophisticated driving assistance features. However, the development of reliable
and trustworthy autonomous systems poses challenges such as high complexity,
prolonged training periods, and intrinsic levels of uncertainty. Mini
Autonomous Cars (MACs) are used as a practical testbed, enabling validation of
autonomous control methodologies on small-scale setups. This simplified and
cost-effective environment facilitates rapid evaluation and comparison of
machine learning models, which is particularly useful for algorithms requiring
online training. To address these challenges, this work presents a methodology
based on RGB-D information and three-dimensional convolutional neural networks
(3D CNNs) for MAC autonomous driving in simulated environments. We evaluate the
proposed approach against recurrent neural networks (RNNs), with architectures
trained and tested on two simulated tracks with distinct environmental
features. Performance was assessed using task completion success, lap-time
metrics, and driving consistency. Results highlight how architectural
modifications and track complexity influence the models' generalization
capability and vehicle control performance. The proposed 3D CNN demonstrated
promising results when compared with RNNs.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Introduces a constraint-aware, legal-action masked DQN with safe ZYZ regrasp and hierarchical Q decomposition for autonomous Soma-cube assembly on a 6-DOF collaborative robot, achieving efficient training and notable success rates across three curriculum levels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address combinatorial action-space explosion, unsafe motion planning, and strategy learning in manipulation; integrate constraint-aware reinforcement learning with singularity-safe motion planning for underactuated gripper-equipped collaborative robots.

Method: Proposes a legal-action masked DQN with hierarchical Q-function estimation split into orientation and position components; employs safe ZYZ regrasp; ensures singularity-safe planning on a Doosan M0609; uses curriculum learning over 2-piece, 3-piece, and 7-piece Soma-cube tasks; ground-first, vertically accessible reward shaping; reduces action-space complexity from O(3,132) to O(116) + O(27).

Result: Achieves 100% success in Level 1 within 500 episodes, 92.9% in Level 2, and 39.9% in Level 3 across 105,300 total training episodes; claims first comprehensive application and systematic integration of constraint-aware RL with singularity-safe motion planning for this setup.

Conclusion: Demonstrates feasibility and efficiency of combining constraint-aware reinforcement learning with safe motion planning for underactuated, 6-DOF collaborative robots, enabling scalable and efficient strategy learning for complex assembly tasks; potential for broader applicability in manipulation.

Abstract: This paper presents the first comprehensive application of legal-action
masked Deep Q-Networks with safe ZYZ regrasp strategies to an underactuated
gripper-equipped 6-DOF collaborative robot for autonomous Soma cube assembly
learning. Our approach represents the first systematic integration of
constraint-aware reinforcement learning with singularity-safe motion planning
on a Doosan M0609 collaborative robot. We address critical challenges in
robotic manipulation: combinatorial action space explosion, unsafe motion
planning, and systematic assembly strategy learning. Our system integrates a
legal-action masked DQN with hierarchical architecture that decomposes
Q-function estimation into orientation and position components, reducing
computational complexity from $O(3,132)$ to $O(116) + O(27)$ while maintaining
solution completeness. The robot-friendly reward function encourages
ground-first, vertically accessible assembly sequences aligned with
manipulation constraints. Curriculum learning across three progressive
difficulty levels (2-piece, 3-piece, 7-piece) achieves remarkable training
efficiency: 100\% success rate for Level 1 within 500 episodes, 92.9\% for
Level 2, and 39.9\% for Level 3 over 105,300 total training episodes.

*Seyed Ali Rakhshan,Mehdi Golestani,He Kong*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Matroid-based greedy assignment for heterogeneous robots improves multi-target tracking with provable constant-factor guarantees and scalable performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To maximize tracking quality by reducing target-state uncertainty via efficient robot-to-target assignments under heterogeneous sensing capabilities.

Method: Divide robots into sufficient-sensing (range+bearing) and limited-sensing (range or bearing) groups, then apply a greedy, matroid-theoretic algorithm to allocate robots to targets; provides 1/3 guarantee for arbitrary tracking quality functions and 1/2 for submodular ones; runs in polynomial time.

Result: Simulation studies show accurate, long-horizon target estimation and tracking; performance near optimal assignments, validating robustness and practicality.

Conclusion: A scalable, theoretically-grounded approach for heterogeneous sensor networks in multi-target tracking, combining matroid theory with greedy allocation to achieve strong performance guarantees.

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of assigning heterogeneous sensors (i.e.,
robots with varying sensing capabilities) for multi-target tracking. We
classify robots into two categories: (1) sufficient sensing robots, equipped
with range and bearing sensors, capable of independently tracking targets, and
(2) limited sensing robots, which are equipped with only range or bearing
sensors and need to at least form a pair to collaboratively track a target. Our
objective is to optimize tracking quality by minimizing uncertainty in target
state estimation through efficient robot-to-target assignment. By leveraging
matroid theory, we propose a greedy assignment algorithm that dynamically
allocates robots to targets to maximize tracking quality. The algorithm
guarantees constant-factor approximation bounds of 1/3 for arbitrary tracking
quality functions and 1/2 for submodular functions, while maintaining
polynomial-time complexity. Extensive simulations demonstrate the algorithm's
effectiveness in accurately estimating and tracking targets over extended
periods. Furthermore, numerical results confirm that the algorithm's
performance is close to that of the optimal assignment, highlighting its
robustness and practical applicability.

### [149] [Robust Real-Time Coordination of CAVs: A Distributed Optimization Framework under Uncertainty](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21322)
*Haojie Bai,Yang Wang,Cong Guo,Xiongwei Zhao,Hai Zhu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A robust, real-time cooperative vehicle coordination framework that directly controls trajectory distributions through adaptive safety constraints, uses a parallel ADMM-based distributed trajectory negotiation (ADMM-DTN), and an interactive attention mechanism to focus on critical participants. It achieves improved safety (up to ~41% collision reduction) and reduced computation (up to ~14%) with scalable performance and real-world validation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Safety guarantees and real-time performance in cooperative vehicle coordination remain challenging in dynamic, uncertain environments. Existing methods often sacrifice safety for speed or computational tractability. There is a need for a scalable distributed optimization approach that can handle uncertainty in interactive trajectories while prioritizing critical agents to save computation.

Method: Three innovations: 1) direct control of vehicles' trajectory distributions within a robust cooperative planning problem with adaptive enhanced safety constraints to bound uncertainty in interactive trajectories; 2) a fully parallel ADMM-based distributed trajectory negotiation (ADMM-DTN) algorithm enabling configurable negotiation rounds to balance solution quality and computational resources; 3) an interactive attention mechanism that selectively focuses on critical interactive participants to reduce computational load.

Result: Simulation and real-world experiments show substantial gains: significant safety improvements (collision rate reduction up to 40.79%), and real-time performance gains over state-of-the-art methods, with strong scalability as vehicle numbers grow. The interactive attention mechanism further reduces computational demand by 14.1%. Real-world tests with unexpected dynamic obstacles validate robustness in complex environments; an experiment demo is provided via a YouTube link.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates that combining robust trajectory-distribution control, scalable distributed optimization, and selective attention yields a practical solution for safe, real-time cooperative vehicle coordination in dynamic environments. It is scalable, robust to uncertainty, and capable of operating in real-world scenarios, with potential for deployment and further optimization.

Abstract: Achieving both safety guarantees and real-time performance in cooperative
vehicle coordination remains a fundamental challenge, particularly in dynamic
and uncertain environments. This paper presents a novel coordination framework
that resolves this challenge through three key innovations: 1) direct control
of vehicles' trajectory distributions during coordination, formulated as a
robust cooperative planning problem with adaptive enhanced safety constraints,
ensuring a specified level of safety regarding the uncertainty of the
interactive trajectory, 2) a fully parallel ADMM-based distributed trajectory
negotiation (ADMM-DTN) algorithm that efficiently solves the optimization
problem while allowing configurable negotiation rounds to balance solution
quality and computational resources, and 3) an interactive attention mechanism
that selectively focuses on critical interactive participants to further
enhance computational efficiency. Both simulation results and practical
experiments demonstrate that our framework achieves significant advantages in
safety (reducing collision rates by up to 40.79\% in various scenarios) and
real-time performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, while maintaining
strong scalability with increasing vehicle numbers. The proposed interactive
attention mechanism further reduces the computational demand by 14.1\%. The
framework's effectiveness is further validated through real-world experiments
with unexpected dynamic obstacles, demonstrating robust coordination in complex
environments. The experiment demo could be found at

*Alberto Bertipaglia,Dariu M. Gavrila,Barys Shyrokau*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A multi-modal MPPI-based motion planning framework for automated vehicles that uses Sobol sampling around prior inputs, analytical collision avoidance, and multiple operational modes to generate diverse, collision-free trajectories under non-linear vehicle dynamics with tyre friction constraints; demonstrated to robustly handle obstacles, occlusions, and varying road friction in high-fidelity simulations, outperforming standard MPPI.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhance robustness and reliability of autonomous vehicle motion planning under uncertainty and dynamic environments, addressing sub-optimal solutions from single-mode sampling and lack of explicit collision avoidance constraints.

Method: A multi-modal Model Predictive Path Integral controller that samples around the current input using Sobol sequences, incorporates analytical collision avoidance, uses a nonlinear single-track vehicle model with Fiala tyre, enforces friction-circle constraints, and optimizes steering and longitudinal acceleration to generate collision-free trajectories across multiple modes (e.g., maneuvering around obstacles, stopping before them). Validation is performed in high-fidelity simulations with moving obstacles and occlusions, including manoeuvres like double lane changes on different friction surfaces.

Result: The proposed algorithm successfully avoids obstacles, maintains vehicle stability, and outperforms a standard MPPI approach in simulation across scenarios with high/low friction and occlusions.

Conclusion: Multi-modal MPPI with analytical collision handling and physical tire constraints improves robustness and safety in autonomous vehicle planning, with demonstrated potential for real-time application and better handling of occlusions and moving obstacles compared to standard MPPI.

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel approach to motion planning and decision-making
for automated vehicles, using a multi-modal Model Predictive Path Integral
control algorithm. The method samples with Sobol sequences around the prior
input and incorporates analytical solutions for collision avoidance. By
leveraging multiple modes, the multi-modal control algorithm explores diverse
trajectories, such as manoeuvring around obstacles or stopping safely before
them, mitigating the risk of sub-optimal solutions. A non-linear single-track
vehicle model with a Fiala tyre serves as the prediction model, and tyre force
constraints within the friction circle are enforced to ensure vehicle stability
during evasive manoeuvres. The optimised steering angle and longitudinal
acceleration are computed to generate a collision-free trajectory and to
control the vehicle. In a high-fidelity simulation environment, we demonstrate
that the proposed algorithm can successfully avoid obstacles, keeping the
vehicle stable while driving a double lane change manoeuvre on high and
low-friction road surfaces and occlusion scenarios with moving obstacles,
outperforming a standard Model Predictive Path Integral approach.

*Anuj Pasricha,Joewie Koh,Jay Vakil,Alessandro Roncone*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A diffusion-model-based trajectory planner can safely exceed nominal payloads across large parts of the workspace, generating constant-time joint-space trajectories that can run directly on hardware.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Nominal payload ratings are conservative and fail to capture the robot's true capabilities; expanding the usable workspace by accounting for actual payload dynamics could increase efficiency and utilization.

Method: Use denoising diffusion models to generate dynamically feasible joint-space trajectories while explicitly enforcing payload constraints, achieving constant-time trajectory generation without post-processing.

Result: Experimental validation on a 7-DoF Franka Emika Panda shows up to 67.6% of the workspace remains accessible with payloads over 3x nominal capacity, enabling direct hardware execution in real time.

Conclusion: Payload-aware diffusion-based planning can substantially expand the operational envelope of manipulators; it outperforms traditional sampling, optimization, and kinodynamic planners in terms of speed and practicality for real hardware.

Abstract: Nominal payload ratings for articulated robots are typically derived from
worst-case configurations, resulting in uniform payload constraints across the
entire workspace. This conservative approach severely underutilizes the robot's
inherent capabilities -- our analysis demonstrates that manipulators can safely
handle payloads well above nominal capacity across broad regions of their
workspace while staying within joint angle, velocity, acceleration, and torque
limits. To address this gap between assumed and actual capability, we propose a
novel trajectory generation approach using denoising diffusion models that
explicitly incorporates payload constraints into the planning process. Unlike
traditional sampling-based methods that rely on inefficient trial-and-error,
optimization-based methods that are prohibitively slow, or kinodynamic planners
that struggle with problem dimensionality, our approach generates dynamically
feasible joint-space trajectories in constant time that can be directly
executed on physical hardware without post-processing. Experimental validation
on a 7 DoF Franka Emika Panda robot demonstrates that up to 67.6% of the
workspace remains accessible even with payloads exceeding 3 times the nominal
capacity. This expanded operational envelope highlights the importance of a
more nuanced consideration of payload dynamics in motion planning algorithms.

### [152] [RoboInspector: Unveiling the Unreliability of Policy Code for LLM-enabled Robotic Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21378)
*Chenduo Ying,Linkang Du,Peng Cheng,Yuanchao Shu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: RoboInspector analyzes reliability issues in policy-code generation for LLM-enabled robotic manipulation, identifies four failure modes, and offers a failure-guided refinement that improves reliability by up to 35% across tasks, instructions, and LLMs in both simulation and real-world.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs can generate policy code to control robots, but reliability is inconsistent due to varying task requirements and instruction granularity. A systematic diagnosis and mitigation strategy is needed to bridge the gap between diverse user instructions and robust robotic behavior.

Method: Introduce RoboInspector, a pipeline to diagnose and characterize policy-code unreliability from manipulation-task complexity and instruction granularity. Evaluate 168 task–instruction–LLM combinations across two frameworks. Identify four main unreliable behaviors and analyze their causes. Propose a refinement approach guided by failure policy code feedback and validate improvements in simulation and real-world environments.

Result: -The paper identifies four unreliable behaviors causing manipulation failure and provides a detailed characterization of their causes. The refinement approach guided by failure-feedback improves policy-code generation reliability by up to 35% in both simulated and real-world robotic manipulation.

Conclusion: RoboInspector offers a practical debugging and mitigation framework to diagnose and reduce unreliability in LLM-driven robotic manipulation. The work provides actionable insights for developers to improve robustness and demonstrates tangible reliability gains with a failure-guided refinement.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities in reasoning
and code generation, enabling robotic manipulation to be initiated with just a
single instruction. The LLM carries out various tasks by generating policy code
required to control the robot. Despite advances in LLMs, achieving reliable
policy code generation remains a significant challenge due to the diverse
requirements of real-world tasks and the inherent complexity of user
instructions. In practice, different users may provide distinct instructions to
drive the robot for the same task, which may cause the unreliability of policy
code generation. To bridge this gap, we design RoboInspector, a pipeline to
unveil and characterize the unreliability of the policy code for LLM-enabled
robotic manipulation from two perspectives: the complexity of the manipulation
task and the granularity of the instruction. We perform comprehensive
experiments with 168 distinct combinations of tasks, instructions, and LLMs in
two prominent frameworks. The RoboInspector identifies four main unreliable
behaviors that lead to manipulation failure. We provide a detailed
characterization of these behaviors and their underlying causes, giving insight
for practical development to reduce unreliability. Furthermore, we introduce a
refinement approach guided by failure policy code feedback that improves the
reliability of policy code generation by up to 35% in LLM-enabled robotic
manipulation, evaluated in both simulation and real-world environments.

### [153] [Assessing Human Cooperation for Enhancing Social Robot Navigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21455)
*Hariharan Arunachalam,Phani Teja Singamaneni,Rachid Alami*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A geometry-based, communication-enabled approach to socially aware robot navigation in head-on crossing scenarios, including an assessment methodology and metrics to distinguish cooperative vs. non-cooperative humans, plus demonstrations of using geometric reasoning to generate verbal or robotic actions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address failures where robots misinterpret human intentions and humans don’t understand the robot’s plan, by enabling timely, geometry-informed communication that clarifies intent and cooperativeness.

Method: Geometric analysis of the scene to assess human cooperativeness; development of an assessment methodology and evaluation metrics; using geometric reasoning to generate appropriate verbal responses or robot actions.

Result: Proposes an assessment framework and metrics to differentiate cooperative from non-cooperative humans and demonstrates how geometric reasoning can guide verbal responses or robot actions.

Conclusion: Effective geometry-based communication can bridge misunderstandings in head-on crossing scenarios, improving coordination and safety in socially aware navigation.

Abstract: Socially aware robot navigation is a planning paradigm where the robot
navigates in human environments and tries to adhere to social constraints while
interacting with the humans in the scene. These navigation strategies were
further improved using human prediction models, where the robot takes the
potential future trajectory of humans while computing its own. Though these
strategies significantly improve the robot's behavior, it faces difficulties
from time to time when the human behaves in an unexpected manner. This happens
as the robot fails to understand human intentions and cooperativeness, and the
human does not have a clear idea of what the robot is planning to do. In this
paper, we aim to address this gap through effective communication at an
appropriate time based on a geometric analysis of the context and human
cooperativeness in head-on crossing scenarios. We provide an assessment
methodology and propose some evaluation metrics that could distinguish a
cooperative human from a non-cooperative one. Further, we also show how
geometric reasoning can be used to generate appropriate verbal responses or
robot actions.

*Pierrick Lorang,Hong Lu,Johannes Huemer,Patrik Zips,Matthias Scheutz*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A data-efficient neuro-symbolic imitation learning framework that jointly learns continuous controllers and symbolic task abstractions from few demonstrations, using a graph representation, ASP for symbolic rules, diffusion policy imitation for low-level policies, and an oracle to prune observations; demonstrates strong few- and zero-shot generalization across six robotic domains with interpretable decisions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the limitations of standard imitation learning in long-horizon tasks, distribution shifts, and poor generalization, by combining symbolic reasoning with continuous control to improve data efficiency and interpretability.

Method: 1) Learn a graph-based high-level task representation (symbolic abstractions) from demonstrations. 2) Discover symbolic rules via an Answer Set Programming (ASP) solver. 3) Train low-level controllers using diffusion policy imitation learning. 4) Use a high-level oracle to filter task-relevant information, focusing each controller on a minimal observation/action space. 5) Validate on six domains (four robotic arms: Stacking, Kitchen, Assembly, Towers of Hanoi; and Automated Forklift domain with two environments). The framework captures non-spatial and temporal relations that are hard for data-driven clustering to discover in limited data.

Result: The approach achieves high data efficiency (as few as five skill demonstrations), strong zero- and few-shot generalization, and interpretable decision making across multiple robotic domains."

Conclusion: A neuro-symbolic graph-based framework that jointly learns continuous control policies and symbolic domain abstractions enables efficient, generalizable, and interpretable imitation learning for long-horizon tasks by leveraging symbolic ASP rules and a task-relevant oracle to constrain learning.

Abstract: Imitation learning enables intelligent systems to acquire complex behaviors
with minimal supervision. However, existing methods often focus on
short-horizon skills, require large datasets, and struggle to solve
long-horizon tasks or generalize across task variations and distribution
shifts. We propose a novel neuro-symbolic framework that jointly learns
continuous control policies and symbolic domain abstractions from a few skill
demonstrations. Our method abstracts high-level task structures into a graph,
discovers symbolic rules via an Answer Set Programming solver, and trains
low-level controllers using diffusion policy imitation learning. A high-level
oracle filters task-relevant information to focus each controller on a minimal
observation and action space. Our graph-based neuro-symbolic framework enables
capturing complex state transitions, including non-spatial and temporal
relations, that data-driven learning or clustering techniques often fail to
discover in limited demonstration datasets. We validate our approach in six
domains that involve four robotic arms, Stacking, Kitchen, Assembly, and Towers
of Hanoi environments, and a distinct Automated Forklift domain with two
environments. The results demonstrate high data efficiency with as few as five
skill demonstrations, strong zero- and few-shot generalizations, and
interpretable decision making.

### [155] [Estimated Informed Anytime Search for Sampling-Based Planning via Adaptive Sampler](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21549)
*Liding Zhang,Kuanqi Cai,Yu Zhang,Zhenshan Bing,Chaoqun Wang,Fan Wu,Sami Haddadin,Alois Knoll*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: MIT* is a multi-informed, adaptive, and lazy-evaluating planner that speeds up initial convergence for high-dimensional path planning by constructing estimated informed sets, adapting sampling, and using length-aware sparse collision checks; it outperforms single-query planners in R^4–R^16 and applies to real-world robot manipulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Informed sampling-based planners rely on current best solution cost to define informed sets. When no solution exists yet, they resample and explore the entire configuration space, which is time-consuming in high dimensions. There is a need for faster initial convergence and more efficient exploration, especially for high-dimensional robotics tasks.

Method: Introduce Multi-Informed Trees (MIT*): constructs estimated informed sets from prior admissible solution costs before the first solution. Employs an adaptive sampler that dynamically adjusts the sampling strategy during exploration. Uses length-related adaptive sparse collision checks to guide lazy reverse search. Evaluated in simulations and real-world robot manipulation tasks, compared against single-query planners.

Result: MIT* outperforms existing single-query, sampling-based planners for problems in R^4 to R^16; achieves high success rates in confined scenarios; validated through simulations and real-world experiments, with a video demonstration available.

Conclusion: MIT* accelerates initial convergence and improves path cost efficiency while maintaining high success rates, making it suitable for high-dimensional path planning and real-world manipulation tasks.

Abstract: Path planning in robotics often involves solving continuously valued,
high-dimensional problems. Popular informed approaches include graph-based
searches, such as A*, and sampling-based methods, such as Informed RRT*, which
utilize informed set and anytime strategies to expedite path optimization
incrementally. Informed sampling-based planners define informed sets as subsets
of the problem domain based on the current best solution cost. However, when no
solution is found, these planners re-sample and explore the entire
configuration space, which is time-consuming and computationally expensive.
This article introduces Multi-Informed Trees (MIT*), a novel planner that
constructs estimated informed sets based on prior admissible solution costs
before finding the initial solution, thereby accelerating the initial
convergence rate. Moreover, MIT* employs an adaptive sampler that dynamically
adjusts the sampling strategy based on the exploration process. Furthermore,
MIT* utilizes length-related adaptive sparse collision checks to guide lazy
reverse search. These features enhance path cost efficiency and computation
times while ensuring high success rates in confined scenarios. Through a series
of simulations and real-world experiments, it is confirmed that MIT*
outperforms existing single-query, sampling-based planners for problems in R^4
to R^16 and has been successfully applied to real-world robot manipulation
tasks. A video showcasing our experimental results is available at:

### [156] [Learning Agile Gate Traversal via Analytical Optimal Policy Gradient](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21592)
*Tianchen Sun,Bingheng Wang,Longbin Tang,Yichao Gao,Lin Zhao*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A hybrid MPC-NN framework adaptively tunes MPC online for quadrotor gate traversal, achieving high efficiency and interpretability; hardware experiments show large gains in sample efficiency over end-to-end RL.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Narrow-gate traversal is a challenging benchmark for agile quadrotor flight. Traditional modular stacks require heavy design and tuning, while end-to-end RL suffers from poor sample efficiency and limited interpretability.

Method: An offline-trained NN predicts a reference pose and cost-function weights conditioned on gate corners and drone state; online, these guide adaptive MPC parameters. The authors derive analytical policy gradients for both the MPC module and an optimization-based gate-traversal detector, and propose a simplified attitude-tracking error formulation with bounded gradients.

Result: Hardware experiments demonstrate fast and accurate quadrotor traversal through narrow gates in confined environments, with orders-of-magnitude improvement in sample efficiency over naive end-to-end RL.

Conclusion: The proposed hybrid MPC-NN framework offers improved sample efficiency, interpretability, and robustness for narrow-gate traversal compared to end-to-end RL, addressing modular design challenges while maintaining performance in constrained environments.

Abstract: Traversing narrow gates presents a significant challenge and has become a
standard benchmark for evaluating agile and precise quadrotor flight.
Traditional modularized autonomous flight stacks require extensive design and
parameter tuning, while end-to-end reinforcement learning (RL) methods often
suffer from low sample efficiency and limited interpretability. In this work,
we present a novel hybrid framework that adaptively fine-tunes model predictive
control (MPC) parameters online using outputs from a neural network (NN)
trained offline. The NN jointly predicts a reference pose and cost-function
weights, conditioned on the coordinates of the gate corners and the current
drone state. To achieve efficient training, we derive analytical policy
gradients not only for the MPC module but also for an optimization-based gate
traversal detection module. Furthermore, we introduce a new formulation of the
attitude tracking error that admits a simplified representation, facilitating
effective learning with bounded gradients. Hardware experiments demonstrate
that our method enables fast and accurate quadrotor traversal through narrow
gates in confined environments. It achieves several orders of magnitude
improvement in sample efficiency compared to naive end-to-end RL approaches.

*Bernhard Wullt,Johannes Köhler,Per Mattsson,Mikeal Norrlöf,Thomas B. Schön*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A robust tube MPC with corridor planning enables collision-free, fast motion for 6-DOF industrial manipulators under model uncertainties; demonstrated superior speed and safety in simulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In cluttered environments with uncertain model parameters, safe and fast motion planning is hard; there is a need for controllers that guarantee safety while enabling fast execution.

Method: Propose a robust tube MPC augmented with a corridor planning algorithm to ensure collision avoidance, yielding a convex MPC solvable efficiently; validated via simulation on a 6-DOF robot with parameter uncertainties.

Result: Outperforms benchmark methods, tolerates higher levels of model uncertainties, and achieves faster motion in simulation.

Conclusion: The approach provides a practical, real-time capable solution for safe, fast manipulation in uncertain, cluttered settings.

Abstract: Industrial manipulators are normally operated in cluttered environments,
making safe motion planning important. Furthermore, the presence of
model-uncertainties make safe motion planning more difficult. Therefore, in
practice the speed is limited in order to reduce the effect of disturbances.
There is a need for control methods that can guarantee safe motions that can be
executed fast. We address this need by suggesting a novel model predictive
control (MPC) solution for manipulators, where our two main components are a
robust tube MPC and a corridor planning algorithm to obtain collision-free
motion. Our solution results in a convex MPC, which we can solve fast, making
our method practically useful. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method in a
simulated environment with a 6 DOF industrial robot operating in cluttered
environments with uncertainties in model parameters. We outperform benchmark
methods, both in terms of being able to work under higher levels of model
uncertainties, while also yielding faster motion.

### [159] [Can a mobile robot learn from a pedestrian model to prevent the sidewalk salsa?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21690)
*Olger Siebinga,David Abbink*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Reinforcement learning agents can learn to interact safely with a CEI-based pedestrian model; a risk-averse variant reduces perceived risk by signaling intent through motion, improving pedestrian cooperation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand implicit communication in pedestrian-robot interactions (the sidewalk salsa) and use that understanding to design safe, acceptable robot behavior.

Method: Builds on a CEI-backed pedestrian model of sidewalk salsa; trains a basic RL agent to interact with the model; adds a risk-averse RL agent that uses the model's perceived risk to guide motion-based communication.

Result: Basic RL learns to interact with CEI; risk-averse RL reduces perceived risk and triggers more cooperative behavior from the pedestrian model.

Conclusion: Combining CEI with RL is a promising approach for safe robot planning in human-robot cooperation, warranting further research.

Abstract: Pedestrians approaching each other on a sidewalk sometimes end up in an
awkward interaction known as the "sidewalk salsa": they both (repeatedly)
deviate to the same side to avoid a collision. This provides an interesting use
case to study interactions between pedestrians and mobile robots because, in
the vast majority of cases, this phenomenon is avoided through a negotiation
based on implicit communication. Understanding how it goes wrong and how
pedestrians end up in the sidewalk salsa will therefore provide insight into
the implicit communication. This understanding can be used to design safe and
acceptable robotic behaviour. In a previous attempt to gain this understanding,
a model of pedestrian behaviour based on the Communication-Enabled Interaction
(CEI) framework was developed that can replicate the sidewalk salsa. However,
it is unclear how to leverage this model in robotic planning and
decision-making since it violates the assumptions of game theory, a much-used
framework in planning and decision-making. Here, we present a proof-of-concept
for an approach where a Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent leverages the model
to learn how to interact with pedestrians. The results show that a basic RL
agent successfully learned to interact with the CEI model. Furthermore, a
risk-averse RL agent that had access to the perceived risk of the CEI model
learned how to effectively communicate its intention through its motion and
thereby substantially lowered the perceived risk, and displayed effort by the
modelled pedestrian. These results show this is a promising approach and
encourage further exploration.
