We use RMLPs when fine-tuning DINOv2 to both medical and natural image modalities, showing that it improves or maintains downstream performance while producing more interpretable attention maps. We also provide a mathematical analysis of RMLPs, offering insights into its role in enhancing ViT-based models and advancing our understanding of contrastive learning."}

Unlike world-model approaches that rely on computationally intensive future scene generation or vision-language-action (VLA) systems constrained by Markov assumptions, we show that a minimal set of semantically rich tokens is sufficient for effective planning. Experiments on the nuPlan benchmark (720 scenarios, over 11,000 samples) using perception-informed BEV representations yield three key findings: (1) even without future prediction, our sparse representation achieves 0.548 m ADE, comparable to or surpassing prior methods reporting around 0.75 m on nuScenes; (2) conditioning trajectory decoding on predicted future tokens reduces ADE to 0.479 m, a 12.6% improvement over current-state baselines; and (3) explicit reconstruction loss offers no benefit and may degrade performance under reliable perception inputs. Notably, we observe the emergence of temporal fuzziness, where the model adaptively attends to task-relevant semantics rather than aligning rigidly to fixed timestamps, providing a cognitive advantage for planning under uncertainty. Our \"token is all you need\" principle marks a paradigm shift from reconstructing the world to understanding it, laying a foundation for cognitively inspired systems that plan through imagination rather than reaction."}

Although multi-task learning is an effective way to integrate these tasks, its increasing model parameters and complexity make deployment on on-board devices difficult. To address this challenge, we propose a multi-task model compression framework that combines task-aware safe pruning with feature-level knowledge distillation. Our safe pruning strategy integrates Taylor-based channel importance with gradient conflict penalty to keep important channels while removing redundant and conflicting channels. To mitigate performance degradation after pruning, we further design a task head-agnostic distillation method that transfers intermediate backbone and encoder features from a teacher to a student model as guidance. Experiments on the BDD100K dataset demonstrate that our compressed model achieves a 32.7% reduction in parameters while segmentation performance shows negligible accuracy loss and only a minor decrease in detection (-1.2% for Recall and -1.8% for mAP50) compared to the teacher. The compressed model still runs at 32.7 FPS in real-time. These results show that combining pruning and knowledge distillation provides an effective compression solution for multi-task panoptic perception."}

We first construct and release a large-scale, diverse benchmark dataset for fillet recognition to address the inadequacy of existing data.

The core innovation of this network is its use of pose-invariant intrinsic geometric features, such as curvature, enabling it to learn more fundamental geometric patterns and thereby achieve high-precision recognition of complex geometric topologies. Experiments show that FilletRec surpasses state-of-the-art methods in both accuracy and generalization, while using only 0.2\\%-5.4\\% of the parameters of baseline models, demonstrating high model efficiency.

Anchoring bias, a classic human judgment bias, offers a critical test case. While prior work shows LLMs exhibit anchoring, most evidence relies on surface-level outputs, leaving internal mechanisms and attributional contributions unexplored. This paper advances the study of anchoring in LLMs through three contributions: (1) a log-probability-based behavioral analysis showing that anchors shift entire output distributions, with controls for training-data contamination; (2) exact Shapley-value attribution over structured prompt fields to quantify anchor influence on model log-probabilities; and (3) a unified Anchoring Bias Sensitivity Score integrating behavioral and attributional evidence across six open-source models. Results reveal robust anchoring effects in Gemma-2B, Phi-2, and Llama-2-7B, with attribution signaling that the anchors influence reweighting. Smaller models such as GPT-2, Falcon-RW-1B, and GPT-Neo-125M show variability, suggesting scale may modulate sensitivity. Attributional effects, however, vary across prompt designs, underscoring fragility in treating LLMs as human substitutes. The findings demonstrate that anchoring bias in LLMs is robust, measurable, and interpretable, while highlighting risks in applied domains. More broadly, the framework bridges behavioral science, LLM safety, and interpretability, offering a reproducible path for evaluating other cognitive biases in LLMs."}

A novel\nmethod of RoadTracer using the Teacher-Student based ensemble learning model of\nAdaptive DBN is proposed, since the road maps contain many complicated features\nso that a model with high representation power to detect should be required.\nThe experimental results showed the detection accuracy of the proposed model\nwas improved from 40.0\\% to 89.0\\% on average in the seven major cities among\nthe test dataset. In addition, we challenged to apply our method to the\ndetection of available roads when landslide by natural disaster is occurred, in\norder to rapidly obtain a way of transportation. For fast inference, a small\nsize of the trained model was implemented on a small embedded edge device as\nlightweight deep learning. We reported the detection results for the satellite\nimage before and after the rainfall disaster in Japan."}

In this paper, we investigate the design for automated recognition of modality bias at the sample level. Specifically, we propose three bias quantification methods based on theories/views of different levels of granularity: 1) a coarse-grained evaluation of modality benefit; 2) a medium-grained quantification of information flow; and 3) a fine-grained causality analysis. To verify the effectiveness, we conduct a human evaluation on two popular benchmarks. Experimental results reveal three interesting findings that provide potential direction toward future research: 1)~Ensembling multiple views is crucial for reliable automated analysis; 2)~Automated analysis is prone to detector-induced fluctuations; and 3)~Different views produce a higher agreement on modality-balanced samples but diverge on biased ones."}

However, even state-of-the-art models often suffer from fine-grained artifacts and poor identity preservation, particularly under challenging poses and expressions.

In this work, we propose DiffSwap++, a novel diffusion-based face-swapping pipeline that incorporates 3D facial latent features during training. By guiding the generation process with 3D-aware representations, our method enhances geometric consistency and improves the disentanglement of facial identity from appearance attributes. We further design a diffusion architecture that conditions the denoising process on both identity embeddings and facial landmarks, enabling high-fidelity and identity-preserving face swaps. Extensive experiments on CelebA, FFHQ, and CelebV-Text demonstrate that DiffSwap++ outperforms prior methods in preserving source identity while maintaining target pose and expression.

However, their success hinges on navigating a fundamental cognitive tension: the need to balance broad, divergent exploration of the solution space with a principled, convergent synthesis to the optimal solution. Existing paradigms often struggle to manage this duality, leading to premature consensus, error propagation, and a critical credit assignment problem that fails to distinguish between genuine reasoning and superficially plausible arguments. To resolve this core challenge, we propose the Multi-Agent Exploration-Synthesis framework Through Role Orchestration (Maestro), a principled paradigm for collaboration that structurally decouples these cognitive modes. Maestro uses a collective of parallel Execution Agents for diverse exploration and a specialized Central Agent for convergent, evaluative synthesis. To operationalize this critical synthesis phase, we introduce Conditional Listwise Policy Optimization (CLPO), a reinforcement learning objective that disentangles signals for strategic decisions and tactical rationales. By combining decision-focused policy gradients with a list-wise ranking loss over justifications, CLPO achieves clean credit assignment and stronger comparative supervision. Experiments on mathematical reasoning and general problem-solving benchmarks demonstrate that Maestro, coupled with CLPO, consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art multi-agent approaches, delivering absolute accuracy gains of 6% on average and up to 10% at best."}

However, by relying on a final softmax classifier, these methods suffer from two fundamental distortions: additive logit shifts that arbitrarily bias importance scores, and sign collapse that conflates excitatory and inhibitory features. We propose a simple, architecture-agnostic dual-branch sigmoid head that decouples localization from classification. Given any pretrained model, we clone its classification head into a parallel branch ending in per-class sigmoid outputs, freeze the original softmax head, and fine-tune only the sigmoid branch with class-balanced binary supervision. At inference, softmax retains recognition accuracy, while class evidence maps are generated from the sigmoid branch -- preserving both magnitude and sign of feature contributions. Our method integrates seamlessly with most CAM variants and incurs negligible overhead. Extensive evaluations on fine-grained tasks (CUB-200-2011, Stanford Cars) and WSOL benchmarks (ImageNet-1K, OpenImages30K) show improved explanation fidelity and consistent Top-1 Localization gains -- without any drop in classification accuracy.

We develop three soft sleeve actuators that produce linear, bending, and twisting motion, and an omnidirectional design that combines these motions in one device. Actuators are fabricated from thermoplastic elastomers using a customized fused filament fabrication process that produces airtight and compliant structures and resolves leakage observed with conventional methods. A dedicated experimental platform quantifies kinematic outputs such as displacement, angle, and twist, and kinetic outputs such as force and torque under low pneumatic pressures.

We hypothesize that explicitly disentangled object-level representations, by localizing task-relevant information, can enhance policy performance across novel feature combinations. To test this hypothesis, we introduce DLPWM, a fully unsupervised, disentangled object-centric world model that learns object-level latents directly from pixels. DLPWM achieves strong reconstruction and prediction performance, including robustness to several out-of-distribution (OOD) visual variations. However, when used for downstream model-based control, policies trained on DLPWM latents underperform compared to DreamerV3. Through latent-trajectory analyses, we identify representation shift during multi-object interactions as a key driver of unstable policy learning. Our results suggest that, although object-centric perception supports robust visual modeling, achieving stable control requires mitigating latent drift."}

However, for multi-agent planning, MCTS is confronted with a large combinatorial action space that often grows exponentially with the number of agents. As a result, the branching factor of MCTS during tree expansion also increases exponentially, making it very difficult to efficiently explore and exploit during tree search. To this end, we propose MALinZero, a new approach to leverage low-dimensional representational structures on joint-action returns and enable efficient MCTS in complex multi-agent planning. Our solution can be viewed as projecting the joint-action returns into the low-dimensional space representable using a contextual linear bandit problem formulation. We solve the contextual linear bandit problem with convex and $μ$-smooth loss functions -- in order to place more importance on better joint actions and mitigate potential representational limitations -- and derive a linear Upper Confidence Bound applied to trees (LinUCT) to enable novel multi-agent exploration and exploitation in the low-dimensional space. We analyze the regret of MALinZero for low-dimensional reward functions and propose an $(1-\\tfrac1e)$-approximation algorithm for the joint action selection by maximizing a sub-modular objective.

To fill this gap, we introduce a new evaluation framework, PRIME (Puzzle Reasoning for Implicit Biases in Model Evaluation), that uses logic grid puzzles to systematically probe the influence of social stereotypes on logical reasoning and decision making in LLMs. Our use of logic puzzles enables automatic generation and verification, as well as variability in complexity and biased settings. PRIME includes stereotypical, anti-stereotypical, and neutral puzzle variants generated from a shared puzzle structure, allowing for controlled and fine-grained comparisons. We evaluate multiple model families across puzzle sizes and test the effectiveness of prompt-based mitigation strategies. Focusing our experiments on gender stereotypes, our findings highlight that models consistently reason more accurately when solutions align with stereotypical associations. This demonstrates the significance of PRIME for diagnosing and quantifying social biases perpetuated in the deductive reasoning of LLMs, where fairness is critical."}

In this paper, we address this essential problem by formulating the generation process as learning an optimal, direct transport trajectory between the distribution of the current rendering and the desired target distribution, thereby enabling high-quality generation with smaller Classifier-free Guidance (CFG) values. At first, we theoretically establish SDS as a simplified instance of the Schrödinger Bridge framework. We prove that SDS employs the reverse process of an Schrödinger Bridge, which, under specific conditions (e.g., a Gaussian noise as one end), collapses to SDS's score function of the pre-trained diffusion model. Based upon this, we introduce Trajectory-Centric Distillation (TraCe), a novel text-to-3D generation framework, which reformulates the mathematically trackable framework of Schrödinger Bridge to explicitly construct a diffusion bridge from the current rendering to its text-conditioned, denoised target, and trains a LoRA-adapted model on this trajectory's score dynamics for robust 3D optimization. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that TraCe consistently achieves superior quality and fidelity to state-of-the-art techniques."}

ExpReS-VLA stores compact feature representations from the frozen vision backbone instead of raw image-action pairs, reducing memory usage by approximately 97 percent. During deployment, relevant past experiences are retrieved using cosine similarity and used to guide adaptation, while prioritized experience replay emphasizes successful trajectories. We also introduce Thresholded Hybrid Contrastive Loss, which enables learning from both successful and failed attempts. On the LIBERO simulation benchmark, ExpReS-VLA improves success rates from 82.6 to 93.1 percent on spatial reasoning tasks and from 61 to 72.3 percent on long-horizon tasks. On physical robot experiments with five manipulation tasks, it reaches 98 percent success on both seen and unseen settings, compared to 84.7 and 32 percent for naive fine-tuning. Adaptation takes 31 seconds using 12 demonstrations on a single RTX 5090 GPU, making the approach practical for real robot deployment."}

Existing approaches typically navigate to proximity-based regions without considering affordances, resulting in frequent manipulation failures. We propose Affordance-Guided Coarse-to-Fine Exploration, a zero-shot framework for base placement that integrates semantic understanding from vision-language models (VLMs) with geometric feasibility through an iterative optimization process. Our method constructs cross-modal representations, namely Affordance RGB and Obstacle Map+, to align semantics with spatial context. This enables reasoning that extends beyond the egocentric limitations of RGB perception. To ensure interaction is guided by task-relevant affordances, we leverage coarse semantic priors from VLMs to guide the search toward task-relevant regions and refine placements with geometric constraints, thereby reducing the risk of convergence to local optima. Evaluated on five diverse open-vocabulary mobile manipulation tasks, our system achieves an 85% success rate, significantly outperforming classical geometric planners and VLM-based methods. This demonstrates the promise of affordance-aware and multimodal reasoning for generalizable, instruction-conditioned planning in OVMM."}

Game events and dialogue are mapped to four linguistically-agnostic constraint classes-evidence, phenomena, assertions, and hypotheses. Hard constraints prune impossible role assignments, while weighted soft constraints score the remainder; information-gain weighting links each hypothesis to its expected value under entropy reduction, and a simple closed-form scoring rule guarantees that truthful assertions converge to classical hard logic with minimum error.

Locating the sensor off the contact interface reduces damage risk, preserves softness, and simplifies fabrication and maintenance. We first characterize the optical sensing element and the compliant skin, thendetermine the design of a prototype tactile sensor. Compression experiments validate the approach, exhibiting a monotonic force output relationship consistent with theory, low hysteresis, high repeatability over repeated cycles, and small response indentation speeds. We further demonstrate integration on a soft robotic gripper, where the module reliably detects grasp events. Compared with liquid filled or wireembedded tactile skins, the proposed modular add on architecture enhances durability, reduces wiring complexity, and supports straightforward deployment across diverse robot geometries. Because the sensing principle reads skin strain patterns, it also suggests extensions to other somatosensory cues such as joint angle or actuator state estimation from surface deformation.

Previous work has shown that verifying the correctness of individual reasoning steps can further improve the performance and efficiency of LLMs on such tasks and enhance solution interpretability. However, existing verification approaches, such as Process Reward Models (PRMs), are either computationally expensive, limited to specific domains, or require large-scale human or model-generated annotations. Thus, we propose a lightweight alternative for step-level reasoning verification based on data-driven uncertainty scores. We train transformer-based uncertainty quantification heads (UHeads) that use the internal states of a frozen LLM to estimate the uncertainty of its reasoning steps during generation. The approach is fully automatic: target labels are generated either by another larger LLM (e.g., DeepSeek R1) or in a self-supervised manner by the original model itself. UHeads are both effective and lightweight, containing less than 10M parameters. Across multiple domains, including mathematics, planning, and general knowledge question answering, they match or even surpass the performance of PRMs that are up to 810x larger. Our findings suggest that the internal states of LLMs encode their uncertainty and can serve as reliable signals for reasoning verification, offering a promising direction toward scalable and generalizable introspective LLMs."}

In this work, we present a novel method for visuo-tactile-based tracking of unseen objects (single, multiple, or articulated) during robotic interaction without assuming any prior knowledge regarding object shape or dynamics. Our novel pose tracking approach termed ArtReg (stands for Articulated Registration) integrates visuo-tactile point clouds in an unscented Kalman Filter formulation in the SE(3) Lie Group for point cloud registration. ArtReg is used to detect possible articulated joints in objects using purposeful manipulation maneuvers such as pushing or hold-pulling with a two-robot team. Furthermore, we leverage ArtReg to develop a closed-loop controller for goal-driven manipulation of articulated objects to move the object into the desired pose configuration. We have extensively evaluated our approach on various types of unknown objects through real robot experiments. We also demonstrate the robustness of our method by evaluating objects with varying center of mass, low-light conditions, and with challenging visual backgrounds. Furthermore, we benchmarked our approach on a standard dataset of articulated objects and demonstrated improved performance in terms of pose accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods.

To overcome these limitations, this study introduces ROAR, a novel approach for accident detection and prediction. ROAR combines Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT), a self adaptive object aware module, and dynamic focal loss to tackle these challenges. The DWT effectively extracts features from noisy and incomplete data, while the object aware module improves accident prediction by focusing on high-risk vehicles and modeling the spatial temporal relationships among traffic agents. Moreover, dynamic focal loss mitigates the impact of class imbalance between positive and negative samples. Evaluated on three widely used datasets, Dashcam Accident Dataset (DAD), Car Crash Dataset (CCD), and AnAn Accident Detection (A3D), our model consistently outperforms existing baselines in key metrics such as Average Precision (AP) and mean Time to Accident (mTTA). These results demonstrate the model's robustness in real-world conditions, particularly in handling sensor degradation, environmental noise, and imbalanced data distributions.

These, however, alter actions in ways unseen during training, causing unpredictable behavior and performance degradation. To address these problems, we propose path-consistent safety filtering (PACS) for DPs. Our approach performs path-consistent braking on a trajectory computed from the sequence of generated actions. In this way, we keep execution consistent with the policy's training distribution, maintaining the learned, task-completing behavior. To enable a real-time deployment and handle uncertainties, we verify safety using set-based reachability analysis. Our experimental evaluation in simulation and on three challenging real-world human-robot interaction tasks shows that PACS (a) provides formal safety guarantees in dynamic environments, (b) preserves task success rates, and (c) outperforms reactive safety approaches, such as control barrier functions, by up to 68% in terms of task success.

Prior work on large language model negotiation largely emphasizes autonomous bargaining between agents and omits practical needs such as staged information gathering, explicit authorization boundaries, and systematic feedback integration. We propose GAIA, a governance-first framework for LLM-human agency in B2B negotiation and screening. GAIA defines three essential roles - Principal (human), Delegate (LLM agent), and Counterparty - with an optional Critic to enhance performance, and organizes interactions through three mechanisms: information-gated progression that separates screening from negotiation; dual feedback integration that combines AI critique with lightweight human corrections; and authorization boundaries with explicit escalation paths. Our contributions are fourfold: (1) a formal governance framework with three coordinated mechanisms and four safety invariants for delegation with bounded authorization; (2) information-gated progression via task-completeness tracking (TCI) and explicit state transitions that separate screening from commitment; (3) dual feedback integration that blends Critic suggestions with human oversight through parallel learning channels; and (4) a hybrid validation blueprint that combines automated protocol metrics with human judgment of outcomes and safety. By bridging theory and practice, GAIA offers a reproducible specification for safe, efficient, and accountable AI delegation that can be instantiated across procurement, real estate, and staffing workflows."}

We introduce VMDT (Video-Modal DecodingTrust), the first unified platform for evaluating text-to-video (T2V) and video-to-text (V2T) models across five key trustworthiness dimensions: safety, hallucination, fairness, privacy, and adversarial robustness. Through our extensive evaluation of 7 T2V models and 19 V2T models using VMDT, we uncover several significant insights. For instance, all open-source T2V models evaluated fail to recognize harmful queries and often generate harmful videos, while exhibiting higher levels of unfairness compared to image modality models. In V2T models, unfairness and privacy risks rise with scale, whereas hallucination and adversarial robustness improve -- though overall performance remains low. Uniquely, safety shows no correlation with model size, implying that factors other than scale govern current safety levels. Our findings highlight the urgent need for developing more robust and trustworthy video foundation models, and VMDT provides a systematic framework for measuring and tracking progress toward this goal.

This model incorporates the closed-loop dynamics of the robot and a ground contact model based on the estimated ground normal vector. We use a LiDAR inertial odometry framework and improved Principal Component Analysis for terrain estimation. Task controllers, including PD control law and LQR, are employed for pose control and centroidal dynamics-based balance control, respectively.

Large language models have become a new tool to help numerical reasoning and understanding these documents. However, prompt quality can have a major effect on how well LLMs perform these financial reasoning tasks. Most current methods tune prompts on fixed datasets of financial text or tabular data, which limits their ability to adapt to new question types or document structures, or they involve costly and manually labeled/curated dataset to help build the prompts. We introduce a self-improving prompt framework driven by data-augmented optimization. In this closed-loop process, we generate synthetic financial tables and document excerpts, verify their correctness and robustness, and then update the prompt based on the results. Specifically, our framework combines a synthetic data generator with verifiers and a prompt optimizer, where the generator produces new examples that exposes weaknesses in the current prompt, the verifiers check the validity and robustness of the produced examples, and the optimizer incrementally refines the prompt in response. By iterating these steps in a feedback cycle, our method steadily improves prompt accuracy on financial reasoning tasks without needing external labels. Evaluation on DocMath-Eval benchmark demonstrates that our system achieves higher performance in both accuracy and robustness than standard prompt methods, underscoring the value of incorporating synthetic data generation into prompt learning for financial applications."}

By comparing screw combinations, the approach demonstrates consistent accuracy in both pairing and registration tasks. The method also employs 2D-3D alignment with screw CAD 3D models to accurately pair and estimate screw pose from dual views. Our results show that the correct screw combination consistently outperforms incorrect pairings across all test cases, even prior to registration.

In this work, we introduce a new reasoning data generation framework spanning diverse skills and levels of complexity with over 1M high-quality synthetic vision-centric questions. The dataset also includes preference data and instruction prompts supporting both offline and online RL. Our synthesis framework proceeds in two stages: (1) scale; and (2) complexity. Reasoning traces are then synthesized through a two-stage process that leverages VLMs and reasoning LLMs, producing CoT traces for VLMs that capture the richness and diverse cognitive behaviors found in frontier reasoning models. Remarkably, we show that finetuning Qwen2.5-VL-7B on our data outperforms all open-data baselines across all evaluated vision-centric benchmarks, and even surpasses strong closed-data models such as MiMo-VL-7B-RL on V* Bench, CV-Bench and MMStar-V. Perhaps most surprising, despite being entirely vision-centric, our data transfers positively to text-only reasoning (MMLU-Pro) and audio reasoning (MMAU), demonstrating its effectiveness. Similarly, despite not containing videos or embodied visual data, we observe notable gains when evaluating on a single-evidence embodied QA benchmark (NiEH). Finally, we use our data to analyze the entire VLM post-training pipeline. Our empirical analysis highlights that (i) SFT on high-quality data with non-linear reasoning traces is essential for effective online RL, (ii) staged offline RL matches online RL's performance while reducing compute demands, and (iii) careful SFT on high quality data can substantially improve out-of-domain, cross-modality transfer."}

Although foundation models such as Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) demonstrate strong zero-shot and prompt-guided segmentation capabilities, their performance deteriorates substantially when transferred to medical imaging domains. Current adaptation studies mainly emphasize architectural modifications, while the influence of data characteristics and training regimes has not been systematically examined. In this study, we present a comprehensive, data-centric investigation of SAM2 adaptation for ultrasound video segmentation. We analyze how training-set size, video duration, and augmentation schemes affect adaptation performance under three paradigms: task-specific fine-tuning, intermediate adaptation, and multi-task joint training, across five SAM2 variants and multiple prompting modes. We further design six ultrasound-specific augmentations, assessing their effect relative to generic strategies. Experiments on three representative ultrasound datasets reveal that data scale and temporal context play a more decisive role than model architecture or initialization. Moreover, joint training offers an efficient compromise between modality alignment and task specialization. This work aims to provide empirical insights for developing efficient, data-aware adaptation pipelines for SAM2 in ultrasound video analysis."}

Detecting and mitigating hallucinations is challenging when ground-truth references are unavailable and model internals are inaccessible. This paper proposes a novel self-contained low-rank approach to automatically rank multiple candidate captions generated by multiple VLMs based on their hallucination levels, using only the captions themselves without requiring external references or model access. By constructing a sentence-embedding matrix and decomposing it into a low-rank consensus component and a sparse residual, we use the residual magnitude to rank captions: selecting the one with the smallest residual as the most hallucination-free. Experiments on the NuScenes dataset demonstrate that our approach achieves 87% selection accuracy in identifying hallucination-free captions, representing a 19% improvement over the unfiltered baseline and a 6-10% improvement over multi-agent debate method. The sorting produced by sparse error magnitudes shows strong correlation with human judgments of hallucinations, validating our scoring mechanism. Additionally, our method, which can be easily parallelized, reduces inference time by 51-67% compared to debate approaches, making it practical for real-time autonomous driving applications."}

To address these limitations, this study introduces ALIGN (Accident Location Inference through Geo-Spatial Neural Reasoning)- a vision-language framework that emulates human spatial reasoning to infer accident coordinates directly from textual and map-based cues. ALIGN integrates large language and vision-language models within a multi-stage pipeline that performs optical character recognition, linguistic reasoning, and map-level verification through grid-based spatial scanning. The framework systematically evaluates each predicted location against contextual and visual evidence, ensuring interpretable, fine-grained geolocation outcomes without requiring model retraining.

Whether a legged robot making-and-breaking contact with a floor, or a manipulator grasping objects, contact is everywhere. Unfortunately, the switching of dynamics at contact boundaries makes control difficult. Predictive controllers face non-convex optimization problems when contact is involved. Here, we overcome this difficulty by applying Koopman operators to subsume the segmented dynamics due to contact changes into a unified, globally-linear model in an embedding space. We show that viscoelastic contact at robot-environment interactions underpins the use of Koopman operators without approximation to control inputs. This methodology enables the convex Model Predictive Control of a legged robot, and the real-time control of a manipulator engaged in dynamic pushing.

Recent methods have further improved LLM performance in complex mathematical reasoning. However, when extending these methods beyond the domain of mathematical reasoning to tasks involving complex domain-specific knowledge, we observe a consistent failure of LLMs to generate novel insights during the reflection stage. Instead of conducting genuine cognitive refinement, the model tends to mechanically reiterate earlier reasoning steps without introducing new information or perspectives, a phenomenon referred to as \"Echo Reflection\". We attribute this behavior to two key defects: (1) Uncontrollable information flow during response generation, which allows premature intermediate thoughts to propagate unchecked and distort final decisions; (2) Insufficient exploration of internal knowledge during reflection, leading to repeating earlier findings rather than generating new cognitive insights. Building on these findings, we proposed a novel reinforcement learning method termed Adaptive Entropy Policy Optimization (AEPO). Specifically, the AEPO framework consists of two major components: (1) Reflection-aware Information Filtration, which quantifies the cognitive information flow and prevents the final answer from being affected by earlier bad cognitive information; (2) Adaptive-Entropy Optimization, which dynamically balances exploration and exploitation across different reasoning stages, promoting both reflective diversity and answer correctness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AEPO consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance over mainstream reinforcement learning baselines across diverse benchmarks."}

To address this gap, we propose TCSA-UDA, a Text-driven Cross-Semantic Alignment framework that leverages domain-invariant textual class descriptions to guide visual representation learning. Our approach introduces a vision-language covariance cosine loss to directly align image encoder features with inter-class textual semantic relations, encouraging semantically meaningful and modality-invariant feature representations. Additionally, we incorporate a prototype alignment module that aligns class-wise pixel-level feature distributions across domains using high-level semantic prototypes. This mitigates residual category-level discrepancies and enhances cross-modal consistency. Extensive experiments on challenging cross-modality cardiac, abdominal, and brain tumor segmentation benchmarks demonstrate that our TCSA-UDA framework significantly reduces domain shift and consistently outperforms state-of-the-art UDA methods, establishing a new paradigm for integrating language-driven semantics into domain-adaptive medical image analysis."}

However, their reliability remains a challenge, especially in long-horizon tasks, since they often produce overconfident yet wrong outputs. Conformal Prediction (CP) has been leveraged to address this issue by wrapping LLM outputs into prediction sets that contain the correct action with a user-defined confidence. When the prediction set is a singleton, the planner executes that action; otherwise, it requests help from a user. This has led to LLM-based planners that can ensure plan correctness with a user-defined probability. However, as LLMs are trained in an uncertainty-agnostic manner, without awareness of prediction sets, they tend to produce unnecessarily large sets, particularly at higher confidence levels, resulting in frequent human interventions limiting autonomous deployment. To address this, we introduce CoFineLLM (Conformal Finetuning for LLMs), the first CP-aware finetuning framework for LLM-based planners that explicitly reduces prediction-set size and, in turn, the need for user interventions. We evaluate our approach on multiple language-instructed robot planning problems and show consistent improvements over uncertainty-aware and uncertainty-agnostic finetuning baselines in terms of prediction-set size, and help rates. Finally, we demonstrate robustness of our method to out-of-distribution scenarios in hardware experiments."}

However, while the discrete-token CoT reasoning pattern can be reinforced through policy optimization algorithms such as group relative policy optimization (GRPO), extending the soft-thinking pattern with Reinforcement Learning (RL) remains challenging. This difficulty stems from the complexities of injecting stochasticity into soft-thinking tokens and updating soft-thinking policies accordingly. As a result, previous attempts to combine soft-thinking with GRPO typically underperform their discrete-token GRPO counterparts. To fully unlock the potential of soft-thinking, this paper presents a novel policy optimization algorithm, SofT-GRPO, to reinforce LLMs under the soft-thinking reasoning pattern. SofT-GRPO injects the Gumbel noise into logits, employs the Gumbel-Softmax technique to avoid soft-thinking tokens outside the pre-trained embedding space, and leverages the reparameterization trick in policy gradient. We conduct experiments across base LLMs ranging from 1.5B to 7B parameters, and results demonstrate that SofT-GRPO enables soft-thinking LLMs to slightly outperform discrete-token GRPO on Pass@1 (+0.13% on average accuracy), while exhibiting a substantial uplift on Pass@32 (+2.19% on average accuracy).

While convolutional neural networks (CNNs) effectively capture local features, they struggle with modeling long-range dependencies. Transformers mitigate this issue with self-attention mechanisms but lack the ability to preserve local contextual information. State-of-the-art models primarily follow an encoder-decoder architecture, achieving notable success. However, two key limitations remain: (1) Shallow layers, which are closer to the input, capture fine-grained details but suffer from information loss as data propagates through deeper layers. (2) Inefficient integration of local details and global context between the encoder and decoder stages. To address these challenges, we propose the MACMD-based decoder, which enhances attention mechanisms and facilitates channel mixing between encoder and decoder stages via skip connections. This design leverages hierarchical dilated convolutions, attention-driven modulation, and a cross channel-mixing module to capture long-range dependencies while preserving local contextual details, essential for precise medical image segmentation.

To achieve this, a pervasive paradigm is to leverage the rich vision-semantic priors of large vision-language models (VLMs). However, the fundamental question persists: How do VLAs effectively inherit the prior knowledge from VLMs? To address this critical question, we introduce a diagnostic benchmark, GrinningFace, an emoji tabletop manipulation task where the robot arm is asked to place objects onto printed emojis corresponding to language instructions. This task design is particularly revealing -- knowledge associated with emojis is ubiquitous in Internet-scale datasets used for VLM pre-training, yet emojis themselves are largely absent from standard robotics datasets. Consequently, they provide a clean proxy: successful task completion indicates effective transfer of VLM priors to embodied control. We implement this diagnostic task in both simulated environment and a real robot, and compare various promising techniques for knowledge transfer. Specifically, we investigate the effects of parameter-efficient fine-tuning, VLM freezing, co-training, predicting discretized actions, and predicting latent actions. Through systematic evaluation, our work not only demonstrates the critical importance of preserving VLM priors for the generalization of VLA but also establishes guidelines for future research in developing truly generalizable embodied AI systems."}

However, this method is difficult to apply to desktop software or some newly launched websites not included in the Common Crawl. While we expect the model to possess strong generalization capabilities to handle this, it is still crucial for personalized scenarios that require rapid and perfect adaptation to new software or websites. To address this, we propose an automated data collection method with minimal annotation costs, named Auto-Explorer. It incorporates a simple yet effective exploration mechanism that autonomously parses and explores GUI environments, gathering data efficiently. Additionally, to assess the quality of exploration, we have developed the UIXplore benchmark. This benchmark creates environments for explorer agents to discover and save software states. Using the data gathered, we fine-tune a multimodal large language model (MLLM) and establish a GUI element grounding testing set to evaluate the effectiveness of the exploration strategies.

Despite significant progress, designing an accurate and efficient end-to-end text spotter for arbitrary-shaped text remains largely unsolved. We identify the primary bottleneck as the lack of a reliable and efficient text detection method. To address this, we propose a novel parameterized text shape method based on low-rank approximation for precise detection and a triple assignment detection head to enable fast inference. Specifically, unlike other shape representation methods that employ data-irrelevant parameterization, our data-driven approach derives a low-rank subspace directly from labeled text boundaries. To ensure this process is robust against the inherent annotation noise in this data, we utilize a specialized recovery method based on an $\\ell_1$-norm formulation, which accurately reconstructs the text shape with only a few key orthogonal vectors. By exploiting the inherent shape correlation among different text contours, our method achieves consistency and compactness in shape representation. Next, the triple assignment scheme introduces a novel architecture where a deep sparse branch (for stabilized training) is used to guide the learning of an ultra-lightweight sparse branch (for accelerated inference), while a dense branch provides rich parallel supervision. Building upon these advancements, we integrate the enhanced detection module with a lightweight recognition branch to form an end-to-end text spotting framework, termed LRANet++, capable of accurately and efficiently spotting arbitrary-shaped text. Extensive experiments on several challenging benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of LRANet++ compared to state-of-the-art methods.

In contrast, soft robotic simulation frameworks remain scarce and are seldom adopted by the soft robotics community. This gap stems partly from the lack of easy-to-use, general-purpose frameworks and partly from the high computational cost of accurately simulating continuum mechanics, which often renders policy learning infeasible. In this work, we demonstrate that rapid soft robot policy learning is indeed achievable via implicit time-stepping. Our simulator of choice, DisMech, is a general-purpose, fully implicit soft-body simulator capable of handling both soft dynamics and frictional contact. We further introduce delta natural curvature control, a method analogous to delta joint position control in rigid manipulators, providing an intuitive and effective means of enacting control for soft robot learning. To highlight the benefits of implicit time-stepping and delta curvature control, we conduct extensive comparisons across four diverse soft manipulator tasks against one of the most widely used soft-body frameworks, Elastica. With implicit time-stepping, parallel stepping of 500 environments achieves up to 6x faster speeds for non-contact cases and up to 40x faster for contact-rich scenarios. Finally, a comprehensive sim-to-sim gap evaluation--training policies in one simulator and evaluating them in another--demonstrates that implicit time-stepping provides a rare free lunch: dramatic speedups achieved without sacrificing accuracy."}

To address this limitation, we propose MONICA, a novel Monitor-guided Calibration framework that monitors and mitigates sycophancy during model inference at the level of reasoning steps, without requiring the model to finish generating its complete answer. MONICA integrates a sycophantic monitor that provides real-time monitoring of sycophantic drift scores during response generation with a calibrator that dynamically suppresses sycophantic behavior when scores exceed predefined thresholds. Extensive experiments across 12 datasets and 3 LRMs demonstrate that our method effectively reduces sycophantic behavior in both intermediate reasoning steps and final answers, yielding robust performance improvements."}

This work proposes a novel method for constructing windows and neighborhoods based on the Hilbert curve. Image tokens are first reordered along a Hilbert curve, and windows and neighborhoods are then formed on the reordered 1D sequence. From a block-sparse perspective, this strategy significantly increases block sparsity and can be combined with existing block-sparse kernels to improve the efficiency of 2D local attention. Experiments show that the proposed Hilbert Window Attention and Hilbert Slide Attention can accelerate window attention and slide attention by about $4\\times$ and $18\\times$, respectively. To assess practicality, the strategy is instantiated as the Hilbert Window Transformer and the Hilbert Neighborhood Transformer, both of which achieve end-to-end speedups with minimal accuracy loss. Overall, combining Hilbert-guided local attention with block-sparse kernels offers a general and practical approach to enhancing the efficiency of 2D local attention for images.

Inspired by human conscious planning behaviors, we first introduced a top-down attention mechanism, which allows a decision-time planning agent to dynamically focus its reasoning on the most relevant aspects of the environmental state given its instantaneous intentions, a process we call \"spatial abstraction\". This approach significantly improves systematic generalization outside the training tasks. Subsequently, building on spatial abstraction, we developed the Skipper framework to automatically decompose complex tasks into simpler, more manageable sub-tasks. Skipper provides robustness against distributional shifts and efficacy in long-term, compositional planning by focusing on pertinent spatial and temporal elements of the environment. Finally, we identified a common failure mode and safety risk in planning agents that rely on generative models to generate state targets during planning. It is revealed that most agents blindly trust the targets they hallucinate, resulting in delusional planning behaviors. Inspired by how the human brain rejects delusional intentions, we propose learning a feasibility evaluator to enable rejecting hallucinated infeasible targets, which led to significant performance improvements in various kinds of planning agents. Finally, we suggest directions for future research, aimed at achieving general task abstraction and fully enabling abstract planning."}

Using this framework, we systematically investigate cross-task generalization-training on a specific handwriting task and evaluating on unseen ones-to reveal which task types and writing patterns most effectively discriminate AD.

To this end, we fully leverage the high capacity of Unmanned Ground Vehicle (UGV) to integrate multiple sensors, enabling a semi-distributed cross-modal air-ground relative localization framework. In this work, both the UGV and the Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) independently perform SLAM while extracting deep learning-based keypoints and global descriptors, which decouples the relative localization from the state estimation of all agents.

The BA process adopts sparse keypoint optimization and is divided into two stages: First, optimizing camera poses interpolated from LiDAR-Inertial Odometry (LIO), followed by estimating the relative camera poses between the UGV and UAV. Additionally, we implement an incremental loop closure detection algorithm using deep learning-based descriptors to maintain and retrieve keyframes efficiently. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves outstanding performance in both accuracy and efficiency. Unlike traditional multi-robot SLAM approaches that transmit images or point clouds, our method only transmits keypoint pixels and their descriptors, effectively constraining the communication bandwidth under 0.3 Mbps.

In this setting, edge costs are not fixed but depend on the specific trajectory selected through each convex region, making classical TSP methods inapplicable. We introduce GHOST, a hierarchical framework that optimally solves the GCS-TSP by combining combinatorial tour search with convex trajectory optimization. GHOST systematically explores tours on a complete graph induced by the GCS, using a novel abstract-path-unfolding algorithm to compute admissible lower bounds that guide best-first search at both the high level (over tours) and the low level (over feasible GCS paths realizing the tour). These bounds provide strong pruning power, enabling efficient search while avoiding unnecessary convex optimization calls. We prove that GHOST guarantees optimality and present a bounded-suboptimal variant for time-critical scenarios. Experiments show that GHOST is orders-of-magnitude faster than unified mixed-integer convex programming baselines for simple cases and uniquely handles complex trajectory planning problems involving high-order continuity constraints and an incomplete GCS."}

In contrast, we study object-relation-centric representations as a pathway to more structured, efficient, and explainable visuomotor control. Our contributions are two-fold. First, we introduce LIBERO+, a fine-grained benchmark dataset designed to enable and evaluate object-relation reasoning in robotic manipulation. Unlike prior datasets, LIBERO+ provides object-centric annotations that enrich demonstrations with box- and mask-level labels as well as instance-level temporal tracking, supporting compact and interpretable visuomotor representations. Second, we propose SlotVLA, a slot-attention-based framework that captures both objects and their relations for action decoding. It uses a slot-based visual tokenizer to maintain consistent temporal object representations, a relation-centric decoder to produce task-relevant embeddings, and an LLM-driven module that translates these embeddings into executable actions. Experiments on LIBERO+ demonstrate that object-centric slot and object-relation slot representations drastically reduce the number of required visual tokens, while providing competitive generalization.

In this study, we construct a high-quality point cloud dataset for 3D segmentation of surface defects in CPS, i.e., CPS3D-Seg, which has the best point resolution and precision compared to existing 3D industrial datasets. CPS3D-Seg consists of 1300 point cloud samples under 20 product categories, and each sample provides accurate point-level annotations.

Peak torque or speed specifications tell us little about whether a joint can deliver the right combination of torque, power, and endurance at task-relevant postures and rates. We introduce a comprehensive framework that makes ``human-level'' measurable and comparable across systems. Our approach has three components. First, a kinematic \\emph{DoF atlas} standardizes joint coordinate systems and ranges of motion using ISB-based conventions, ensuring that human and robot joints are compared in the same reference frames. Second, \\emph{Human-Equivalence Envelopes (HEE)} define per-joint requirements by measuring whether a robot meets human torque \\emph{and} power simultaneously at the same joint angle and rate $(q,ω)$, weighted by positive mechanical work in task-specific bands (walking, stairs, lifting, reaching, and hand actions). Third, the \\emph{Human-Level Actuation Score (HLAS)} aggregates six physically grounded factors: workspace coverage (ROM and DoF), HEE coverage, torque-mode bandwidth, efficiency, and thermal sustainability. We provide detailed measurement protocols using dynamometry, electrical power monitoring, and thermal testing that yield every HLAS input from reproducible experiments. A worked example demonstrates HLAS computation for a multi-joint humanoid, showing how the score exposes actuator trade-offs (gearing ratio versus bandwidth and efficiency) that peak-torque specifications obscure. The framework serves as both a design specification for humanoid development and a benchmarking standard for comparing actuation systems, with all components grounded in published human biomechanics data."}

We introduce a detailed ontology mapping core legal contract elements to their graph-theoretic equivalents of nodes and edges. We then present a reinforcement learning based Large Language Model (LLM) framework for segmentation and extraction of entities and relationships from contracts. Our method, GRAPH-GRPO-LEX, incorporates both LLMs and reinforcement learning with group relative policy optimization (GRPO).

To mitigate this, concept erasure methods have been developed to remove undesirable concepts from pre-trained models. However, existing methods remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks that can regenerate the erased content. Moreover, achieving robust erasure often degrades the model's generative quality for safe, unrelated concepts, creating a difficult trade-off between safety and performance. To address this challenge, we introduce Classifier-Guided Concept Erasure (CGCE), an efficient plug-and-play framework that provides robust concept erasure for diverse generative models without altering their original weights. CGCE uses a lightweight classifier operating on text embeddings to first detect and then refine prompts containing undesired concepts. This approach is highly scalable, allowing for multi-concept erasure by aggregating guidance from several classifiers. By modifying only unsafe embeddings at inference time, our method prevents harmful content generation while preserving the model's original quality on benign prompts. Extensive experiments show that CGCE achieves state-of-the-art robustness against a wide range of red-teaming attacks. Our approach also maintains high generative utility, demonstrating a superior balance between safety and performance. We showcase the versatility of CGCE through its successful application to various modern T2I and T2V models, establishing it as a practical and effective solution for safe generative AI."}

Traditional navigation systems rely on expensive LiDARs that, while geometrically precise, are seman- tically unaware, they cannot distinguish a important document on an office floor from a harmless piece of litter, treating both as physically traversable. While advanced semantic segmentation exists, no prior work has successfully integrated this visual intelligence into a real-time path planner that is efficient enough for low-cost, embedded hardware. This paper presents a frame- work to bridge this gap, delivering context-aware navigation on an affordable robotic platform. Our approach centers on a novel, tight integration of a lightweight perception module with an online A* planner. The perception system employs a semantic segmentation model to identify user-defined visual constraints, enabling the robot to navigate based on contextual importance rather than physical size alone. This adaptability allows an operator to define what is critical for a given task, be it sensitive papers in an office or safety lines in a factory, thus resolving the ambiguity of what to avoid. This semantic perception is seamlessly fused with geometric data. The identified visual constraints are projected as non-geometric obstacles onto a global map that is continuously updated from sensor data, enabling robust navigation through both partially known and unknown environments. We validate our framework through extensive experiments in high-fidelity simulations and on a real-world robotic platform. The results demonstrate robust, real-time performance, proving that a cost- effective robot can safely navigate complex environments while respecting critical visual cues invisible to traditional planners."}

Previous work has attempted to catch these unsafe instances by interrogating models directly about their objectives and behaviors. However, the main weakness of trusting interrogations is that models can lie. We propose self-report fine-tuning (SRFT), a simple supervised fine-tuning technique that trains models to admit their factual mistakes when asked. We show that the admission of factual errors in simple question-answering settings generalizes out-of-distribution (OOD) to the admission of hidden misaligned objectives in adversarial agentic settings. We evaluate SRFT in OOD stealth tasks, where models are instructed to complete a hidden misaligned objective alongside a user-specified objective without being caught by monitoring. After SRFT, models are more likely to confess the details of their hidden objectives when interrogated, even under strong pressure not to disclose them. Interrogation on SRFT models can detect hidden objectives with near-ceiling performance (F1 score = 0.98), while the baseline model lies when interrogated under the same conditions (F1 score = 0). Interrogation on SRFT models can further elicit the content of the hidden objective, recovering 28-100% details, compared to 0% details recovered in the baseline model and by prefilled assistant turn attacks. This provides a promising technique for promoting honesty propensity and incriminating misaligned AI systems."}

The continuum of virtual viewpoints in light field data enables efficient depth estimation using Epipolar Line Images (EPIs) with robust occlusion handling.

It often leads to artifacts, blurred edges, and texture distortion. To address these issues, we propose SAR-FAH, a frequency-adaptive heterogeneous despeckling model based on a divide-and-conquer architecture. First, wavelet decomposition is used to separate the image into frequency sub-bands carrying different intrinsic characteristics. Inspired by their differing noise characteristics, we design specialized sub-networks for different frequency components. The tailored approach leverages statistical variations across frequencies, improving edge and texture preservation while suppressing noise. Specifically, for the low-frequency part, denoising is formulated as a continuous dynamic system via neural ordinary differential equations, ensuring structural fidelity and sufficient smoothness that prevents artifacts. For high-frequency sub-bands rich in edges and textures, we introduce an enhanced U-Net with deformable convolutions for noise suppression and enhanced features. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real SAR images validate the superior performance of the proposed model in noise removal and structural preservation."}

This paper presents Raspi$^2$USBL, an open-source, Raspberry Pi-based passive inverted ultra-short baseline (piUSBL) positioning system designed to provide a low-cost and accessible solution for underwater robotic research. The system comprises a passive acoustic receiver and an active beacon. The receiver adopts a modular hardware architecture that integrates a hydrophone array, a multichannel preamplifier, an oven-controlled crystal oscillator (OCXO), a Raspberry Pi 5, and an MCC-series data acquisition (DAQ) board. Apart from the Pi 5, OCXO, and MCC board, the beacon comprises an impedance-matching network, a power amplifier, and a transmitting transducer. An open-source C++ software framework provides high-precision clock synchronization and triggering for one-way travel-time (OWTT) messaging, while performing real-time signal processing, including matched filtering, array beamforming, and adaptive gain control, to estimate the time of flight (TOF) and direction of arrival (DOA) of received signals. The Raspi$^2$USBL system was experimentally validated in an anechoic tank, freshwater lake, and open-sea trials. Results demonstrate a slant-range accuracy better than 0.1%, a bearing accuracy within 0.1$^\\circ$, and stable performance over operational distances up to 1.3 km. These findings confirm that low-cost, reproducible hardware can deliver research-grade underwater positioning accuracy. By releasing both the hardware and software as open-source, Raspi$^2$USBL provides a unified reference platform that lowers the entry barrier for underwater robotics laboratories, fosters reproducibility, and promotes collaborative innovation in underwater acoustic navigation and swarm robotics."}

Specifically, we design emotion-sensitive prompt templates based on both explicit and implicit emotional cues to better guide the model in understanding the speaker's psychological states. We construct the first dedicated demonstration retrieval repository for ERC, which includes training samples from widely used datasets, as well as high-quality dialogue examples generated by LLMs and manually verified. Moreover, we introduce a curriculum learning strategy into the LoRA fine-tuning process, incorporating weighted emotional shifts between same-speaker and different-speaker utterances to assign difficulty levels to dialogue samples, which are then organized in an easy-to-hard training sequence.

Analogous to how perceived facial age reflects an individual's health, the visual appearance of a city serves as its ``portrait\", encapsulating latent socio-economic and environmental characteristics. Recent studies have explored leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to incorporate textual knowledge into imagery-based urban region representation learning. However, two major challenges remain: i)~difficulty in aligning fine-grained visual features with long captions, and ii) suboptimal knowledge incorporation due to noise in LLM-generated captions. To address these issues, we propose a novel pre-training framework called UrbanLN that improves Urban region representation learning through Long-text awareness and Noise suppression. Specifically, we introduce an information-preserved stretching interpolation strategy that aligns long captions with fine-grained visual semantics in complex urban scenes. To effectively mine knowledge from LLM-generated captions and filter out noise, we propose a dual-level optimization strategy. At the data level, a multi-model collaboration pipeline automatically generates diverse and reliable captions without human intervention. At the model level, we employ a momentum-based self-distillation mechanism to generate stable pseudo-targets, facilitating robust cross-modal learning under noisy conditions. Extensive experiments across four real-world cities and various downstream tasks demonstrate the superior performance of our UrbanLN."}

Factors such as tire characteristics, road surface conditions, aerodynamic disturbances, and vehicle load make it infeasible to model real-world dynamics accurately, which hinders direct transfer of RL agents trained in simulation. In this paper, we present a framework that decouples motion planning from vehicle control through a spatial and temporal alignment strategy between a virtual vehicle and the real system. An RL agent is first trained in simulation using a kinematic bicycle model to output continuous control actions. Its behavior is then distilled into a trajectory-predicting agent that generates finite-horizon ego-vehicle trajectories, enabling synchronization between virtual and real vehicles. At deployment, a Stanley controller governs lateral dynamics, while longitudinal alignment is maintained through adaptive update mechanisms that compensate for deviations between virtual and real trajectories. We validate our approach on a real vehicle and demonstrate that the proposed alignment strategy enables robust zero-shot transfer of RL-based motion planning from simulation to reality, successfully decoupling high-level trajectory generation from low-level vehicle control."}

To address these challenges, we introduce RedOne 2.0, an SNS-oriented LLM trained with a progressive, RL-prioritized post-training paradigm designed for rapid and stable adaptation. The pipeline consist in three stages: (1) Exploratory Learning on curated SNS corpora to establish initial alignment and identify systematic weaknesses; (2) Targeted Fine-Tuning that selectively applies SFT to the diagnosed gaps while mixing a small fraction of general data to mitigate forgetting; and (3) Refinement Learning that re-applies RL with SNS-centric signals to consolidate improvements and harmonize trade-offs across tasks. Across various tasks spanning three categories, our 4B scale model delivers an average improvements about 2.41 over the 7B sub-optimal baseline. Additionally, RedOne 2.0 achieves average performance lift about 8.74 from the base model with less than half the data required by SFT-centric method RedOne, evidencing superior data efficiency and stability at compact scales.

Existing analyses are insufficiently comprehensive and lack examination covering visual and textual tokens, model components, and the full range of layers. This limitation restricts actionable insights to improve the faithfulness of model output and the development of downstream tasks, such as hallucination mitigation. To address this limitation, we introduce Fine-grained Cross-modal Causal Tracing (FCCT) framework, which systematically quantifies the causal effects on visual object perception. FCCT conducts fine-grained analysis covering the full range of visual and textual tokens, three core model components including multi-head self-attention (MHSA), feed-forward networks (FFNs), and hidden states, across all decoder layers. Our analysis is the first to demonstrate that MHSAs of the last token in middle layers play a critical role in aggregating cross-modal information, while FFNs exhibit a three-stage hierarchical progression for the storage and transfer of visual object representations. Building on these insights, we propose Intermediate Representation Injection (IRI), a training-free inference-time technique that reinforces visual object information flow by precisely intervening on cross-modal representations at specific components and layers, thereby enhancing perception and mitigating hallucination. Consistent improvements across five widely used benchmarks and LVLMs demonstrate IRI achieves state-of-the-art performance, while preserving inference speed and other foundational performance."}

This paper presents an automated roadmap generation approach that bridges this gap by operating in continuous-space, integrating station-to-station transport demand and enforcing minimum distance constraints for nodes and edges. By combining free space discretization, transport demand-driven $K$-shortest-path optimization, and path smoothing, the approach produces roadmaps tailored to intralogistics applications. Evaluation across multiple intralogistics use cases demonstrates that the proposed approach consistently outperforms established baselines (4-connected grid, 8-connected grid, and random sampling), achieving lower structural complexity, higher redundancy, and near-optimal path lengths, enabling efficient and robust routing of mobile robot fleets."}

By situating LLM reasoning within these formal structures, the approach transforms opaque inference into transparent and auditable decision traces. A layered architecture is presented that separates the reasoning space of the LLM from the explainable process space above it. Empirical evaluations show that the system can reproduce human-level decision logic in decentralized governance, systems analysis, and strategic reasoning contexts.

Meanwhile, ViT in MAE suffers from inefficient parameter use due to fixed spatial resolution across layers. To overcome these limitations, we propose the Complementary Masked Autoencoders (CoMA), which employ a complementary masking strategy to ensure uniform sampling across all pixels, thereby improving effective learning of all features and enhancing the model's adaptability. Furthermore, we introduce DyViT, a hierarchical vision transformer that employs a Dynamic Multi-Window Self-Attention (DM-MSA), significantly reducing the parameters and FLOPs while improving fine-grained feature learning. Pre-trained on ImageNet-1K with CoMA, DyViT matches the downstream performance of MAE using only 12% of the pre-training epochs, demonstrating more effective learning.

Personnel with this expertise are often not available outside of larger cities, leading to difficult, costly travel and long wait times for rural populations. To address this issue, tele-ultrasound techniques are being developed, including robotic teleoperation and recently human teleoperation, in which a novice user is remotely guided in a hand-over-hand manner through mixed reality to perform an ultrasound exam. These methods have not been compared, and their relative strengths are unknown. Human teleoperation may be more practical than robotics for small communities due to its lower cost and complexity, but this is only relevant if the performance is comparable. This paper therefore evaluates the differences between human and robotic teleoperation, examining practical aspects such as setup time and flexibility and experimentally comparing performance metrics such as completion time, position tracking, and force consistency. It is found that human teleoperation does not lead to statistically significant differences in completion time or position accuracy, with mean differences of 1.8% and 0.5%, respectively, and provides more consistent force application despite being substantially more practical and accessible."}

Recent generative modeling approaches have attempted to capture progression by mapping images into a latent representational space and then controlling and guiding the representations to generate follow-up images from a baseline image. However, existing approaches impose constraints on distribution learning, leading to latent spaces with limited controllability to generate follow-up images without explicit supervision from subject-specific longitudinal images. In order to enable controlled movements in the latent representational space and generate progression images from a baseline image in an unsupervised manner, we introduce a conditionable Diffusion Auto-encoder framework. The explicit encoding mechanism of image-diffusion auto-encoders forms a compact latent space capturing high-level semantics, providing means to disentangle information relevant for progression. Our approach leverages this latent space to condition and apply controlled shifts to baseline representations for generating follow-up. Controllability is induced by restricting these shifts to a subspace, thereby isolating progression-related factors from subject identity-preserving components. The shifts are implicitly guided by correlating with progression attributes, without requiring subject-specific longitudinal supervision. We validate the generations through image quality metrics, volumetric progression analysis, and downstream classification in Alzheimer's disease datasets from two different sources and disease categories. This demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach for Alzheimer's progression modeling and longitudinal image generation."}

While it is straightforward to look at situations where the model fails, it is hard to understand the underlying reason. This motivates us to conduct a systematic study, where inputs to the model are perturbed and the predictions observed. We introduce PlanT 2.0, a lightweight, object-centric planning transformer designed for autonomous driving research in CARLA. The object-level representation enables controlled analysis, as the input can be easily perturbed (e.g., by changing the location or adding or removing certain objects), in contrast to sensor-based models. To tackle the scenarios newly introduced by the challenging CARLA Leaderboard 2.0, we introduce multiple upgrades to PlanT, achieving state-of-the-art performance on Longest6 v2, Bench2Drive, and the CARLA validation routes. Our analysis exposes insightful failures, such as a lack of scene understanding caused by low obstacle diversity, rigid expert behaviors leading to exploitable shortcuts, and overfitting to a fixed set of expert trajectories.

Although facial expression recognition algorithms demonstrate impressive performance on high-resolution images, their effectiveness tends to degrade when confronted with low-resolution images. We find it is because: 1) low-resolution images lack detail information; 2) current methods complete weak global modeling, which make it difficult to extract discriminative features. To alleviate the above issues, we proposed a novel global multiple extraction network (GME-Net) for low-resolution facial expression recognition, which incorporates 1) a hybrid attention-based local feature extraction module with attention similarity knowledge distillation to learn image details from high-resolution network; 2) a multi-scale global feature extraction module with quasi-symmetric structure to mitigate the influence of local image noise and facilitate capturing global image features. As a result, our GME-Net is capable of extracting expression-related discriminative features. Extensive experiments conducted on several widely-used datasets demonstrate that the proposed GME-Net can better recognize low-resolution facial expression and obtain superior performance than existing solutions."}

However, the high cost of tactile data collection makes sample efficiency the key requirement for developing visuotactile policies. We present EquiTac, a framework that exploits the inherent SO(2) symmetry of in-hand object rotation to improve sample efficiency and generalization for visuotactile policy learning. EquiTac first reconstructs surface normals from raw RGB inputs of vision-based tactile sensors, so rotations of the normal vector field correspond to in-hand object rotations. An SO(2)-equivariant network then predicts a residual rotation action that augments a base visuomotor policy at test time, enabling real-time rotation correction without additional reorientation demonstrations. On a real robot, EquiTac accurately achieves robust zero-shot generalization to unseen in-hand orientations with very few training samples, where baselines fail even with more training data. To our knowledge, this is the first tactile learning method to explicitly encode tactile equivariance for policy learning, yielding a lightweight, symmetry-aware module that improves reliability in contact-rich tasks."}

The research compares three scenarios: fully manual (human-only), AI-assisted (human-in-the-loop, HITL), and an advanced multi-agent agentic AI workflow leveraging parsers and verifiers. Empirical results show that AI-assisted HITL and agentic AI scenarios achieve reductions of up to 70-90% in energy consumption, 90-97% in carbon dioxide emissions, and 89-98% in water usage compared to manual processes. Notably, full agentic configurations, combining advanced reasoning (thinking mode) and multi-agent validation, achieve substantial sustainability gains over human-only approaches, even when resource usage increases slightly versus simpler AI-assisted solutions.

Consequently, humanoid robots lack integrated strategies for impact mitigation and prompt recovery when real falls defy these scripts. We aim to go beyond keeping balance to make the entire fall-and-recovery process safe and autonomous: prevent falls when possible, reduce impact when unavoidable, and stand up when fallen.

To address these challenges, we propose a unified solution that synergizes architectural efficiency with adaptive optimization.

To address this issue, we examine the subtle distributional differences between real and model-generated time series and propose the contraction hypothesis, which states that model-generated time series, unlike real ones, exhibit progressively decreasing uncertainty under recursive forecasting. We formally prove this hypothesis under theoretical assumptions on model behavior and time series structure. Model-generated time series exhibit progressively concentrated distributions under recursive forecasting, leading to uncertainty contraction. We provide empirical validation of the hypothesis across diverse datasets. Building on this insight, we introduce the Uncertainty Contraction Estimator (UCE), a white-box detector that aggregates uncertainty metrics over successive prefixes to identify TSLM-generated time series. Extensive experiments on 32 datasets show that UCE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, offering a reliable and generalizable solution for detecting model-generated time series."}

PhysWorld addresses this limitation by coupling video generation with physical world reconstruction. Given a single image and a task command, our method generates task-conditioned videos and reconstructs the underlying physical world from the videos, and the generated video motions are grounded into physically accurate actions through object-centric residual reinforcement learning with the physical world model.

Current alignment efforts primarily target explicit risks such as bias, hate speech, and violence.

Hence, we proposed MENTOR: A MEtacognition-driveN self-evoluTion framework for uncOvering and mitigating implicit Risks in LLMs on Domain Tasks. To address the limitations of labor-intensive human evaluation, we introduce a novel metacognitive self-assessment tool. This enables LLMs to reflect on potential value misalignments in their responses using strategies like perspective-taking and consequential thinking. We also release a supporting dataset of 9,000 risk queries spanning education, finance, and management to enhance domain-specific risk identification. Subsequently, based on the outcomes of metacognitive reflection, the framework dynamically generates supplementary rule knowledge graphs that extend predefined static rule trees. This enables models to actively apply validated rules to future similar challenges, establishing a continuous self-evolution cycle that enhances generalization by reducing maintenance costs and inflexibility of static systems. Finally, we employ activation steering during inference to guide LLMs in following the rules, a cost-effective method to robustly enhance enforcement across diverse contexts. Experimental results show MENTOR's effectiveness: In defensive testing across three vertical domains, the framework substantially reduces semantic attack success rates, enabling a new level of implicit risk mitigation for LLMs. Furthermore, metacognitive assessment not only aligns closely with baseline human evaluators but also delivers more thorough and insightful analysis of LLMs value alignment."}

Various student models collaboratively learn simple LLM features along with different dimensions, with each model responsible for a distinct feature to achieve knowledge distillation. Furthermore, CMM introduces an Hájek-MoE to integrate the output of the student models by investigating the contribution of different models in a kernel function-generated common feature space. Extensive experimental results on four real-world market datasets demonstrate the superiority of CMM over the current distillation method and RL-based market-making strategies."}

Artificial intelligence may aid in pre-screening. Purpose: To evaluate the DINOv2-based Medical Slice Transformer (MST) for ruling out significant findings (Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System [BI-RADS] >=4) in contrast-enhanced and non-contrast-enhanced abbreviated breast MRI. Materials and Methods: This institutional review board approved retrospective study included 1,847 single-breast MRI examinations (377 BI-RADS >=4) from an in-house dataset and 924 from an external validation dataset (Duke). Four abbreviated protocols were tested: T1-weighted early subtraction (T1sub), diffusion-weighted imaging with b=1500 s/mm2 (DWI1500), DWI1500+T2-weighted (T2w), and T1sub+T2w. Performance was assessed at 90%, 95%, and 97.5% sensitivity using five-fold cross-validation and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) analysis. AUC differences were compared with the DeLong test. False negatives were characterized, and attention maps of true positives were rated in the external dataset. Results: A total of 1,448 female patients (mean age, 49 +/- 12 years) were included. T1sub+T2w achieved an AUC of 0.77 +/- 0.04; DWI1500+T2w, 0.74 +/- 0.04 (p=0.15). At 97.5% sensitivity, T1sub+T2w had the highest specificity (19% +/- 7%), followed by DWI1500+T2w (17% +/- 11%). Missed lesions had a mean diameter <10 mm at 95% and 97.5% thresholds for both T1sub and DWI1500, predominantly non-mass enhancements. External validation yielded an AUC of 0.77, with 88% of attention maps rated good or moderate. Conclusion: At 97.5% sensitivity, the MST framework correctly triaged cases without BI-RADS >=4, achieving 19% specificity for contrast-enhanced and 17% for non-contrast-enhanced MRI. Further research is warranted before clinical implementation."}

Current action recognition models, often relying on RGB video, learn superficial correlations between patterns and action labels, so they struggle to capture underlying physical interaction dynamics and human poses in complex scenes. We propose a model architecture that grounds action recognition in physical space by fusing two powerful, complementary representations: V-JEPA 2's contextual, predictive world dynamics and CoMotion's explicit, occlusion-tolerant human pose data. Our model is validated on both the InHARD and UCF-19-Y-OCC benchmarks for general action recognition and high-occlusion action recognition, respectively. Our model outperforms three other baselines, especially within complex, occlusive scenes.

The core challenge of AHT is to develop an ego agent that can predict and adapt to unknown teammates on the fly. Conventional RL-based approaches optimize a single expected return, which often causes policies to collapse into a single dominant behavior, thus failing to capture the multimodal cooperation patterns inherent in AHT. In this work, we introduce PADiff, a diffusion-based approach that captures agent's multimodal behaviors, unlocking its diverse cooperation modes with teammates. However, standard diffusion models lack the ability to predict and adapt in highly non-stationary AHT scenarios. To address this limitation, we propose a novel diffusion-based policy that integrates critical predictive information about teammates into the denoising process. Extensive experiments across three cooperation environments demonstrate that PADiff outperforms existing AHT methods significantly."}

However, current automated methods often rely on resource-heavy Large Language Models (LLMs) or static knowledge graphs and struggle with two fundamental challenges in real-world clinical data: (1) missing modalities, such as incomplete clinical context , and (2) feature entanglement, where mixed modality-specific and shared information leads to suboptimal fusion and clinically unfaithful hallucinated findings. To address these challenges, we propose the DiA-gnostic VLVAE, which achieves robust radiology reporting through Disentangled Alignment. Our framework is designed to be resilient to missing modalities by disentangling shared and modality-specific features using a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) based Vision-Language Variational Autoencoder (VLVAE). A constrained optimization objective enforces orthogonality and alignment between these latent representations to prevent suboptimal fusion. A compact LLaMA-X decoder then uses these disentangled representations to generate reports efficiently. On the IU X-Ray and MIMIC-CXR datasets, DiA has achieved competetive BLEU@4 scores of 0.266 and 0.134, respectively. Experimental results show that the proposed method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models."}

Recently, CBFs represented as neural networks have shown great promise due to their expressiveness and applicability to a broad class of dynamics and safety constraints. However, verifying that a trained neural network is indeed a valid CBF is a computational bottleneck that limits the size of the networks that can be used. To overcome this limitation, we present a novel framework for verifying neural CBFs based on piecewise linear upper and lower bounds on the conditions required for a neural network to be a CBF. Our approach is rooted in linear bound propagation (LBP) for neural networks, which we extend to compute bounds on the gradients of the network. Combined with McCormick relaxation, we derive linear upper and lower bounds on the CBF conditions, thereby eliminating the need for computationally expensive verification procedures. Our approach applies to arbitrary control-affine systems and a broad range of nonlinear activation functions. To reduce conservatism, we develop a parallelizable refinement strategy that adaptively refines the regions over which these bounds are computed. Our approach scales to larger neural networks than state-of-the-art verification procedures for CBFs, as demonstrated by our numerical experiments."}

While prior work has focused on detection accuracy, it overlooks the importance of helping users understand the reasoning behind factual judgments and develop future resilience. The debate transcripts generated during MAD offer a rich but underutilized resource for transparent reasoning. In this study, we introduce ED2D, an evidence-based MAD framework that extends previous approach by incorporating factual evidence retrieval. More importantly, ED2D is designed not only as a detection framework but also as a persuasive multi-agent system aimed at correcting user beliefs and discouraging misinformation sharing. We compare the persuasive effects of ED2D-generated debunking transcripts with those authored by human experts. Results demonstrate that ED2D outperforms existing baselines across three misinformation detection benchmarks. When ED2D generates correct predictions, its debunking transcripts exhibit persuasive effects comparable to those of human experts; However, when ED2D misclassifies, its accompanying explanations may inadvertently reinforce users'misconceptions, even when presented alongside accurate human explanations. Our findings highlight both the promise and the potential risks of deploying MAD systems for misinformation intervention. We further develop a public community website to help users explore ED2D, fostering transparency, critical thinking, and collaborative fact-checking."}

Even though deep learning models have demonstrated potential, standard convolutional architectures frequently fall short in capturing enough global context, resulting in segmentations that are anatomically inconsistent. To overcome these drawbacks, we suggest a flexible, conditional Denoising Diffusion Model that combines an enhanced UNet-based generative decoder with a Vision Transformer (ViT) encoder for global feature extraction. We introduce three primary innovations: 1) an Adaptive Conditioning Bridge (ACB) for efficient, multi-scale fusion of semantic features; 2) a novel Topological Denoising Consistency (TDC) loss component that regularizes training by penalizing structural inconsistencies during denoising; and 3) a dual-head architecture that leverages the denoising objective as a powerful regularizer, enabling a lightweight auxiliary head to perform rapid and accurate inference on smaller datasets and a noise prediction head. Our framework establishes a new state-of-the-art on public breast ultrasound datasets, achieving Dice scores of 0.96 on BUSI, 0.90 on BrEaST and 0.97 on BUS-UCLM. Comprehensive ablation studies empirically validate that the model components are critical for achieving these results and for producing segmentations that are not only accurate but also anatomically plausible."}

We introduce GHOST, a hierarchical framework that optimally solves the GCS-TSP by combining combinatorial tour search with convex trajectory optimization. GHOST systematically explores tours on a complete graph induced by the GCS, using a novel abstract-path-unfolding algorithm to compute admissible lower bounds that guide best-first search at both the high level (over tours) and the low level (over feasible GCS paths realizing the tour). These bounds provide strong pruning power, enabling efficient search while avoiding unnecessary convex optimization calls. We prove that GHOST guarantees optimality and present a bounded-suboptimal variant for time-critical scenarios. Experiments show that GHOST is orders-of-magnitude faster than unified mixed-integer convex programming baselines for simple cases and uniquely handles complex trajectory planning problems involving high-order continuity constraints and an incomplete GCS."}

We introduce IterResearch, a novel iterative deep-research paradigm that reformulates long-horizon research as a Markov Decision Process with strategic workspace reconstruction. By maintaining an evolving report as memory and periodically synthesizing insights, our approach preserves consistent reasoning capacity across arbitrary exploration depths. We further develop Efficiency-Aware Policy Optimization (EAPO), a reinforcement learning framework that incentivizes efficient exploration through geometric reward discounting and enables stable distributed training via adaptive downsampling. Extensive experiments demonstrate that IterResearch achieves substantial improvements over existing open-source agents with average +14.5pp across six benchmarks and narrows the gap with frontier proprietary systems. Remarkably, our paradigm exhibits unprecedented interaction scaling, extending to 2048 interactions with dramatic performance gains (from 3.5\\% to 42.5\\%), and serves as an effective prompting strategy, improving frontier models by up to 19.2pp over ReAct on long-horizon tasks.

We introduce DEEPPERSONA, a scalable generative engine for synthesizing narrative-complete synthetic personas through a two-stage, taxonomy-guided method. First, we algorithmically construct the largest-ever human-attribute taxonomy, comprising over hundreds of hierarchically organized attributes, by mining thousands of real user-ChatGPT conversations. Second, we progressively sample attributes from this taxonomy, conditionally generating coherent and realistic personas that average hundreds of structured attributes and roughly 1 MB of narrative text, two orders of magnitude deeper than prior works. Intrinsic evaluations confirm significant improvements in attribute diversity (32 percent higher coverage) and profile uniqueness (44 percent greater) compared to state-of-the-art baselines. Extrinsically, our personas enhance GPT-4.1-mini's personalized question answering accuracy by 11.6 percent on average across ten metrics and substantially narrow (by 31.7 percent) the gap between simulated LLM citizens and authentic human responses in social surveys. Our generated national citizens reduced the performance gap on the Big Five personality test by 17 percent relative to LLM-simulated citizens.

Unintended subjects often appear outside the layouts, generated images can be out-of-distribution and contain unnatural artifacts, or attributes bleed across subjects, leading to incorrect visual outputs. In this work, we propose MALeR, a method that addresses each of these challenges.

Featurebased image stitching algorithms are commonly used but can suffer from errors and ambiguities in feature detection and matching. To address this, several approaches have been proposed, including using bundle adjustment techniques or direct image alignment. In this paper, we present a novel method that uses a combination of IMU data and computer vision techniques for stitching images captured by a UAV. Our method involves several steps such as estimating the displacement and rotation of the UAV between consecutive images, correcting for perspective distortion, and computing a homography matrix. We then use a standard image stitching algorithm to align and blend the images together. Our proposed method leverages the additional information provided by the IMU data, corrects for various sources of distortion, and can be easily integrated into existing UAV workflows. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our method, outperforming some of the existing feature-based image stitching algorithms in terms of accuracy and reliability, particularly in challenging scenarios such as large displacements, rotations, and variations in camera pose."}

This study explores distributed deep learning for denoising chest X-ray images from the NIH Chest X-ray14 dataset, using additive Gaussian noise as a lightweight obfuscation technique. We implement and evaluate U-Net and U-Net++ architectures under single-GPU, standard multi-GPU (DataParallel), and optimized multi-GPU training configurations using PyTorch's DistributedDataParallel (DDP) and Automatic Mixed Precision (AMP). Our results show that U-Net++ consistently delivers superior denoising performance, achieving competitive Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR) and Structured Similarity Index Method (SSIM) scores, though with less performance in Learned Perceptual Image Patch Similarity (LPIPS) compared to U-Net under low and moderate noise levels. This indicates U-Net++'s enhanced structural fidelity and low perceptual similarity. Meanwhile, our optimized training pipeline reduces training time by over 60% for both models compared to single-GPU training, and outperforms standard DataParallel by over 40%, with only a minor accuracy drop for both models (trading some accuracy for speed).

FLASH integrates two key innovations: (i) Frequency-Aware Window Attention that combines local spatial attention with global frequency-domain analysis via FFT, capturing both fine-grained geometry and periodic scanning patterns at log-linear complexity. (ii) Adaptive Multi-Scale Fusion that replaces conventional skip connections with learned position-specific feature aggregation, enhanced by CBAM attention for dynamic feature selection. Extensive experiments on KITTI demonstrate that FLASH achieves state-of-the-art performance across all evaluation metrics, surpassing even uncertainty-enhanced baselines that require multiple forward passes.

When a downstream scenario demands a model that meets specific resource constraints, this weight chain can be expanded to the target model size without additional computation.

However, safety regulations and operational constraints in operating rooms (ORs) limit embodied agents from freely perceiving and interacting in realistic settings. Digital twins provide high-fidelity, risk-free environments for exploration and training. How we may create photorealistic and dynamic digital representations of ORs that capture relevant spatial, visual, and behavioral complexity remains unclear. We introduce TwinOR, a framework for constructing photorealistic, dynamic digital twins of ORs for embodied AI research. The system reconstructs static geometry from pre-scan videos and continuously models human and equipment motion through multi-view perception of OR activities. The static and dynamic components are fused into an immersive 3D environment that supports controllable simulation and embodied exploration. The proposed framework reconstructs complete OR geometry with centimeter level accuracy while preserving dynamic interaction across surgical workflows, enabling realistic renderings and a virtual playground for embodied AI systems. In our experiments, TwinOR simulates stereo and monocular sensor streams for geometry understanding and visual localization tasks. Models such as FoundationStereo and ORB-SLAM3 on TwinOR-synthesized data achieve performance within their reported accuracy on real indoor datasets, demonstrating that TwinOR provides sensor-level realism sufficient for perception and localization challenges. By establishing a real-to-sim pipeline for constructing dynamic, photorealistic digital twins of OR environments, TwinOR enables the safe, scalable, and data-efficient development and benchmarking of embodied AI, ultimately accelerating the deployment of embodied AI from sim-to-real."}

This article introduces MiVID, a lightweight, self-supervised, diffusion-based framework for video interpolation. Our model eliminates the need for explicit motion estimation by combining a 3D U-Net backbone with transformer-style temporal attention, trained under a hybrid masking regime that simulates occlusions and motion uncertainty. The use of cosine-based progressive masking and adaptive loss scheduling allows our network to learn robust spatiotemporal representations without any high-frame-rate supervision. Our framework is evaluated on UCF101-7 and DAVIS-7 datasets. MiVID is trained entirely on CPU using the datasets and 9-frame video segments, making it a low-resource yet highly effective pipeline.

However, existing methods face three critical challenges: Inaccurate Graph Construction, caused by LLM hallucination; Poor Reasoning Ability, caused by failing to generate explicit reasons telling LLM why certain chunks were selected; and Inadequate Answering, which only partially answers the query due to the inadequate LLM reasoning, making their performance lag behind NaiveRAG on certain tasks. To address these issues, we propose AGRAG, an advanced graph-based retrieval-augmented generation framework. When constructing the graph, AGRAG substitutes the widely used LLM entity extraction method with a statistics-based method, avoiding hallucination and error propagation. When retrieval, AGRAG formulates the graph reasoning procedure as the Minimum Cost Maximum Influence (MCMI) subgraph generation problem, where we try to include more nodes with high influence score, but with less involving edge cost, to make the generated reasoning paths more comprehensive. We prove this problem to be NP-hard, and propose a greedy algorithm to solve it. The MCMI subgraph generated can serve as explicit reasoning paths to tell LLM why certain chunks were retrieved, thereby making the LLM better focus on the query-related part contents of the chunks, reducing the impact of noise, and improving AGRAG's reasoning ability. Furthermore, compared with the simple tree-structured reasoning paths, our MCMI subgraph can allow more complex graph structures, such as cycles, and improve the comprehensiveness of the generated reasoning paths."}

Over the past decade, dominant VPR methods (e.g., NetVLAD) have followed a paradigm that first extracts the patch features/tokens of the input image using a backbone, and then aggregates these patch features into a global descriptor via an aggregator. This backbone-plus-aggregator paradigm has achieved overwhelming dominance in the CNN era and remains widely used in transformer-based models. In this paper, however, we argue that a dedicated aggregator is not necessary in the transformer era, that is, we can obtain robust global descriptors only with the backbone. Specifically, we introduce some learnable aggregation tokens, which are prepended to the patch tokens before a particular transformer block. All these tokens will be jointly processed and interact globally via the intrinsic self-attention mechanism, implicitly aggregating useful information within the patch tokens to the aggregation tokens. Finally, we only take these aggregation tokens from the last output tokens and concatenate them as the global representation. Although implicit aggregation can provide robust global descriptors in an extremely simple manner, where and how to insert additional tokens, as well as the initialization of tokens, remains an open issue worthy of further exploration. To this end, we also propose the optimal token insertion strategy and token initialization method derived from empirical studies. Experimental results show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods on several VPR datasets with higher efficiency and ranks 1st on the MSLS challenge leaderboard.

It has been observed that the presence of invalid depth areas alters the frequency distribution pattern. In this work, we propose a Spatio-Spectral Mutual Learning framework (S2ML) to harmonize the advantages of both spatial and frequency domains for depth completion. Specifically, we consider the distinct properties of amplitude and phase spectra and devise a dedicated spectral fusion module.

This design not only enables real-time streaming, but also inherently supports adaptive bitrate control based on network condition without any extra training.

GANs are often unstable to train and do not provide the transport trajectory information -- yet such trajectories are useful in applications such as single-cell evolution analysis and robot route planning. This work introduces diversified flow matching (DFM), an ODE-based framework for DDM. Adapting flow matching (FM) to enforce a unified translation function as in DDM is challenging, as FM learns the translation function's velocity rather than the translation function itself. A custom bilevel optimization-based training loss, a nonlinear interpolant, and a structural reformulation are proposed to address these challenges, offering a tangible implementation.

We formalize this process within a Multiple-Try Metropolis (MTM) framework, proving convergence to the reward-aligned distribution. Unlike prior methods that assume the current state is already aligned with the reward distribution and only guide the subsequent transition, our approach explicitly refines each state in situ, progressively steering it toward the optimal intermediate distribution.

We propose Lookahead Unmasking (LookUM), which addresses these concerns by reformulating sampling as path selection over all possible unmasking orders without the need for an external reward model. Our framework couples (i) a path generator that proposes paths by sampling from pools of unmasking sets with (ii) a verifier that computes the uncertainty of the proposed paths and performs importance sampling to subsequently select the final paths. Empirically, erroneous unmasking measurably inflates sequence level uncertainty, and our method exploits this to avoid error-prone trajectories. We validate our framework across six benchmarks, such as mathematics, planning, and coding, and demonstrate consistent performance improvements. LookUM requires only two to three paths to achieve peak performance, demonstrating remarkably efficient path selection. The consistent improvements on both LLaDA and post-trained LLaDA 1.5 are particularly striking: base LLaDA with LookUM rivals the performance of RL-tuned LLaDA 1.5, while LookUM further enhances LLaDA 1.5 itself showing that uncertainty based verification provides orthogonal benefits to reinforcement learning and underscoring the versatility of our framework.

In this paper, we investigate how in-context learning enables state-of-the-art VLMs to perform few-shot object detection when large annotated datasets are unavailable, as is often the case with microscopic images. We introduce the Micro-OD benchmark, a curated collection of 252 images specifically curated for in-context learning, with bounding-box annotations spanning 11 cell types across four sources, including two in-lab expert-annotated sets. We systematically evaluate eight VLMs under few-shot conditions and compare variants with and without implicit test-time reasoning tokens. We further implement a hybrid Few-Shot Object Detection (FSOD) pipeline that combines a detection head with a VLM-based few-shot classifier, which enhances the few-shot performance of recent VLMs on our benchmark. Across datasets, we observe that zero-shot performance is weak due to the domain gap; however, few-shot support consistently improves detection, with marginal gains achieved after six shots. We observe that models with reasoning tokens are more effective for end-to-end localization, whereas simpler variants are more suitable for classifying pre-localized crops.

To overcome these limitations, we introduce a hybrid deep learning framework that combines convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with vision transformers (ViTs), thereby leveraging both local feature extraction and global contextual reasoning. The architecture employs a CNN-based encoder-decoder to preserve structural details, while a transformer module enhances global awareness through self-attention.

To address this need, Online Continual Learning (OCL) mechanisms have been proposed, allowing models to update their knowledge incrementally as new data become available while preserving previously acquired information. However, existing OCL approaches for sensor-based HAR are computationally intensive and require extensive labeled samples to represent new changes. Recently, pre-trained model-based (PTM-based) OCL approaches have shown significant improvements in performance and efficiency for computer vision applications. These methods achieve strong generalization capabilities by pre-training complex models on large datasets, followed by fine-tuning on downstream tasks for continual learning. However, applying PTM-based OCL approaches to sensor-based HAR poses significant challenges due to the inherent heterogeneity of HAR datasets and the scarcity of labeled data in post-deployment scenarios. This paper introduces PTRN-HAR, the first successful application of PTM-based OCL to sensor-based HAR. Unlike prior PTM-based OCL approaches, PTRN-HAR pre-trains the feature extractor using contrastive loss with a limited amount of data. This extractor is then frozen during the streaming stage. Furthermore, it replaces the conventional dense classification layer with a relation module network. Our design not only significantly reduces the resource consumption required for model training while maintaining high performance, but also improves data efficiency by reducing the amount of labeled data needed for effective continual learning, as demonstrated through experiments on three public datasets, outperforming the state-of-the-art.

In this paper, we propose LFlow (Latent Refinement via Flows), a training-free framework for solving linear inverse problems via pretrained latent flow priors. LFlow leverages the efficiency of flow matching to perform ODE sampling in latent space along an optimal path. This latent formulation further allows us to introduce a theoretically grounded posterior covariance, derived from the optimal vector field, enabling effective flow guidance.

However, it remains a challenge to model the interactions between histology images and gene expressions for effective ST enhancement. This study presents a cross-modal cross-content contrastive diffusion framework, called C3-Diff, for ST enhancement with histology images as guidance. In C3-Diff, we firstly analyze the deficiency of traditional contrastive learning paradigm, which is then refined to extract both modal-invariant and content-invariant features of ST maps and histology images. Further, to overcome the problem of low sequencing sensitivity in ST maps, we perform nosing-based information augmentation on the surface of feature unit hypersphere. Finally, we propose a dynamic cross-modal imputation-based training strategy to mitigate ST data scarcity. We tested C3-Diff by benchmarking its performance on four public datasets, where it achieves significant improvements over competing methods.

However, processing high-resolution imagery in real time presents significant challenges due to the computational demands of feature extraction, matching, and bundle adjustment (BA). Conventional BA methods either downsample images, sacrificing important details, or require extensive processing time, making them unsuitable for time-critical missions. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel real-time BA framework that operates directly on fullresolution UAV imagery without downsampling. Our lightweight, onboard-compatible approach divides each image into user-defined patches (e.g., NxN grids, default 150x150 pixels) and dynamically tracks them across frames using UAV GNSS/IMU data and a coarse, globally available digital surface model (DSM). This ensures spatial consistency for robust feature extraction and matching between patches. Overlapping relationships between images are determined in real time using UAV navigation system, enabling the rapid selection of relevant neighbouring images for localized BA. By limiting optimization to a sliding cluster of overlapping images, including those from adjacent flight strips, the method achieves real-time performance while preserving the accuracy of global BA. The proposed algorithm is designed for seamless integration into the DLR Modular Aerial Camera System (MACS), supporting largearea mapping in real time for disaster response, infrastructure monitoring, and coastal protection. Validation on MACS datasets with 50MP images demonstrates that the method maintains precise camera orientations and high-fidelity mapping across multiple strips, running full bundle adjustment in under 2 seconds without GPU acceleration."}

Traditional convolutional methods rely on limited receptive fields and require extremely deep networks to model global spatial relationships. These limitations motivate the need for alternative approaches that incorporate physical priors to guide feature evolution during restoration. In this paper, we propose a progressive training framework that integrates physics-informed PDE dynamics into state-of-the-art restoration architectures. By leveraging advection-diffusion equations to model feature evolution, our approach naturally captures the directional flow characteristics of motion blur while enabling principled global spatial modeling. Our PDE-enhanced deblurring models achieve superior restoration quality with minimal overhead, adding only approximately 1\\% to inference GMACs while providing consistent improvements in perceptual quality across multiple state-of-the-art architectures. Comprehensive experiments on standard motion deblurring benchmarks demonstrate that our physics-informed approach improves PSNR and SSIM significantly across four diverse architectures, including FFTformer, NAFNet, Restormer, and Stripformer. These results validate that incorporating mathematical physics principles through PDE-based global layers can enhance deep learning-based image restoration, establishing a promising direction for physics-informed neural network design in computer vision applications."}

In this paper, we address this essential problem by formulating the generation process as learning an optimal, direct transport trajectory between the distribution of the current rendering and the desired target distribution, thereby enabling high-quality generation with smaller Classifier-free Guidance (CFG) values. At first, we theoretically establish SDS as a simplified instance of the Schrödinger Bridge framework. We prove that SDS employs the reverse process of an Schrödinger Bridge, which, under specific conditions (e.g., a Gaussian noise as one end), collapses to SDS's score function of the pre-trained diffusion model. Based upon this, we introduce Trajectory-Centric Distillation (TraCe), a novel text-to-3D generation framework, which reformulates the mathematically trackable framework of Schrödinger Bridge to explicitly construct a diffusion bridge from the current rendering to its text-conditioned, denoised target, and trains a LoRA-adapted model on this trajectory's score dynamics for robust 3D optimization. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that TraCe consistently achieves superior quality and fidelity to state-of-the-art techniques."}

TMM-NN implements this through a lightweight, query-specific trigger patch. The patch is added to the query image, and the network is weakly ``backdoored'' so that any input with the patch is steered toward a dummy class. Images similar to the query need only a slight shift and are classified as the dummy class with high probability, while dissimilar ones are less affected. By ranking candidates by this confidence, TMM-NN retrieves the most semantically related neighbours. Robustness analysis and benchmark experiments confirm this trigger-based ranking outperforms traditional metrics under noise and across diverse tasks."}

Through variational optimization, we recover a latent velocity field that explicitly governs the temporal dynamics of SST. Building upon ODE, we introduce an Energy Exchanges Integrator (EEI)-inspired by ocean heat budget equations-to account for external forcing factors. Thus, the variations in the components of these factors provide deeper insights into SST dynamics. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SSTODE achieves state-of-the-art performances in global and regional SST forecasting benchmarks.

Concurrently, deep learning (DL) models have demonstrated promise in image-based ovarian lesion characterization. This study evaluates radiologist performance applying O-RADS v2022, compares it to leading convolutional neural network (CNN) and Vision Transformer (ViT) models, and investigates the diagnostic gains achieved by hybrid human-AI frameworks. Methods: In this single-center, retrospective cohort study, a total of 512 adnexal mass images from 227 patients (110 with at least one malignant cyst) were included. Sixteen DL models, including DenseNets, EfficientNets, ResNets, VGGs, Xception, and ViTs, were trained and validated. A hybrid model integrating radiologist O-RADS scores with DL-predicted probabilities was also built for each scheme. Results: Radiologist-only O-RADS assessment achieved an AUC of 0.683 and an overall accuracy of 68.0%. CNN models yielded AUCs of 0.620 to 0.908 and accuracies of 59.2% to 86.4%, while ViT16-384 reached the best performance, with an AUC of 0.941 and an accuracy of 87.4%. Hybrid human-AI frameworks further significantly enhanced the performance of CNN models; however, the improvement for ViT models was not statistically significant (P-value >0.05). Conclusions: DL models markedly outperform radiologist-only O-RADS v2022 assessment, and the integration of expert scores with AI yields the highest diagnostic accuracy and discrimination. Hybrid human-AI paradigms hold substantial potential to standardize pelvic ultrasound interpretation, reduce false positives, and improve detection of high-risk lesions."}

In this work, we introduce a new reasoning data generation framework spanning diverse skills and levels of complexity with over 1M high-quality synthetic vision-centric questions. The dataset also includes preference data and instruction prompts supporting both offline and online RL. Our synthesis framework proceeds in two stages: (1) scale; and (2) complexity. Reasoning traces are then synthesized through a two-stage process that leverages VLMs and reasoning LLMs, producing CoT traces for VLMs that capture the richness and diverse cognitive behaviors found in frontier reasoning models. Remarkably, we show that finetuning Qwen2.5-VL-7B on our data outperforms all open-data baselines across all evaluated vision-centric benchmarks, and even surpasses strong closed-data models such as MiMo-VL-7B-RL on V* Bench, CV-Bench and MMStar-V. Perhaps most surprising, despite being entirely vision-centric, our data transfers positively to text-only reasoning (MMLU-Pro) and audio reasoning (MMAU), demonstrating its effectiveness. Similarly, despite not containing videos or embodied visual data, we observe notable gains when evaluating on a single-evidence embodied QA benchmark (NiEH). Finally, we use our data to analyze the entire VLM post-training pipeline. Our empirical analysis highlights that (i) SFT on high-quality data with non-linear reasoning traces is essential for effective online RL, (ii) staged offline RL matches online RL's performance while reducing compute demands, and (iii) careful SFT on high quality data can substantially improve out-of-domain, cross-modality transfer."}

(ii) a narrow scope on molecular-level tasks that restricts progress in chemical reasoning. In this work, we propose \\textbf{TinyChemVL}, an efficient and powerful chemical VLM that leverages visual token reduction and reaction-level tasks to improve model efficiency and reasoning capacity.

Directly predicting reaction products from molecular images poses a non-trivial challenge, as it requires models to integrate both recognition and reasoning capacities. Our results demonstrate that with only 4B parameters, TinyChemVL achieves superior performance on both molecular and reaction tasks while demonstrating faster inference and training speeds compared to existing models. Notably, TinyChemVL outperforms ChemVLM while utilizing only 1/16th of the visual tokens.

Our preliminary empirical results indicate that the image modality exactly contributes less to MMD. Upon this idea, we propose a new MMD method named RETSIMD. Specifically, we suppose that each text can be divided into several segments, and each text segment describes a partial scene that can be presented by an image. Accordingly, we split the text into a sequence of segments, and feed these segments into a pre-trained text-to-image generator to augment a sequence of images. We further incorporate two auxiliary objectives concerning text-image and image-label mutual information, and further post-train the generator over an auxiliary text-to-image generation benchmark dataset. Additionally, we propose a graph structure by defining three heuristic relationships between images, and use a graph neural network to generate the fused features.

While SAEs provide crucial insights into LLM explanations, their practical adoption faces a fundamental challenge: better interpretability demands that SAEs' hidden layers have high dimensionality to satisfy sparsity constraints, resulting in prohibitive training and inference costs. Recent Mixture of Experts (MoE) approaches attempt to address this by partitioning SAEs into narrower expert networks with gated activation, thereby reducing computation. In a well-designed MoE, each expert should focus on learning a distinct set of features. However, we identify a \\textit{critical limitation} in MoE-SAE: Experts often fail to specialize, which means they frequently learn overlapping or identical features. To deal with it, we propose two key innovations: (1) Multiple Expert Activation that simultaneously engages semantically weighted expert subsets to encourage specialization, and (2) Feature Scaling that enhances diversity through adaptive high-frequency scaling.

The priority function, in particular, accepts traffic features as input and then outputs a priority for each traffic signal phase, which subsequently directs the phase transition. For effective search, we propose a concise yet expressive priority function representation. This helps mitigate the combinatorial explosion of the action space in MCTS. Additionally, a probabilistic structural rollout strategy is introduced to leverage structural patterns from previously discovered high-quality priority functions, guiding the rollout process.

To fill this gap, we propose Physics-Informed Deformable Gaussian Splatting (PIDG), which treats each Gaussian particle as a Lagrangian material point with time-varying constitutive parameters and is supervised by 2D optical flow via motion projection. Specifically, we adopt static-dynamic decoupled 4D decomposed hash encoding to reconstruct geometry and motion efficiently.

Existing generative-model-based approaches, particularly diffusion-model approaches that directly learn the posterior, may suffer from inflexibility -- they require conditioning signals during training, support only a fixed number of input views, and need complete retraining for different measurements. Recent diffusion-based methods have attempted to address this by combining prior models with likelihood updates, but they rely on heuristic fixed step sizes for the likelihood update that lead to slow convergence and suboptimal reconstruction quality. We advance this line of approach by integrating our novel Forward Curvature-Matching (FCM) update method with diffusion sampling. Our method dynamically determines optimal step sizes using only forward automatic differentiation and finite-difference curvature estimates, enabling precise optimization of the likelihood update. This formulation enables high-fidelity reconstruction from both single-view and multi-view inputs, and supports various input modalities through simple operator substitution -- all without retraining.

However, in many AI for social impact applications, the presence of an intervention that affects the outcome can bias the evaluation. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) randomly assign interventions, allowing data from the control group to be used for unbiased model evaluation. However, this approach is inefficient because it ignores data from the treatment group. Given the complexity and cost often associated with RCTs, making the most use of the data is essential. Thus, we investigate model evaluation strategies that leverage all data from an RCT. First, we theoretically quantify the estimation bias that arises from naïvely aggregating performance estimates from treatment and control groups, and derive the condition under which this bias leads to incorrect model selection. Leveraging these theoretical insights, we propose nuisance parameter weighting (NPW), an unbiased model evaluation approach that reweights data from the treatment group to mimic the distributions of samples that would or would not experience the outcome under no intervention. Using synthetic and real-world datasets, we demonstrate that our proposed evaluation approach consistently yields better model selection than the standard approach, which ignores data from the treatment group, across various intervention effect and sample size settings.

However, the reduced numerical precision of FP8 poses challenges for stable and accurate training. Current frameworks preserve training performance using mixed-granularity quantization, i.e., applying per-group quantization for activations and per-tensor/block quantization for weights. While effective, per-group quantization requires scaling along the inner dimension of matrix multiplication, introducing additional dequantization overhead. Moreover, these frameworks often rely on just-in-time scaling to dynamically adjust scaling factors based on the current data distribution. However, this online quantization is inefficient for FP8 training, as it involves multiple memory reads and writes that negate the performance benefits of FP8. To overcome these limitations, we propose MOSS, a novel FP8 training framework that ensures both efficiency and numerical stability. MOSS introduces two key innovations: (1) a two-level microscaling strategy for quantizing sensitive activations, which balances precision and dequantization cost by combining a high-precision global scale with compact, power-of-two local scales; and (2) automatic scaling for weights in linear layers, which eliminates the need for costly max-reduction operations by predicting and adjusting scaling factors during training. Leveraging these techniques, MOSS enables efficient FP8 training of a 7B parameter model, achieving performance comparable to the BF16 baseline while achieving up to 34% higher training throughput."}

Point clouds from airborne and ground-based laser scanning are currently the most suitable data source to rapidly derive such information at scale. Recent advancements in deep learning improved segmenting and classifying individual trees and identifying semantic tree components. However, deep learning models typically require large amounts of annotated training data which limits further improvement. Producing dense, high-quality annotations for 3D point clouds, especially in complex forests, is labor-intensive and challenging to scale. We explore strategies to reduce dependence on large annotated datasets using self-supervised and transfer learning architectures. Our objective is to improve performance across three tasks: instance segmentation, semantic segmentation, and tree classification using realistic and operational training sets. Our findings indicate that combining self-supervised learning with domain adaptation significantly enhances instance segmentation compared to training from scratch (AP50 +16.98%), self-supervised learning suffices for semantic segmentation (mIoU +1.79%), and hierarchical transfer learning enables accurate classification of unseen species (Jaccard +6.07%). To simplify use and encourage uptake, we integrated the tasks into a unified framework, streamlining the process from raw point clouds to tree delineation, structural analysis, and species classification. Pretrained models reduce energy consumption and carbon emissions by ~21%. This open-source contribution aims to accelerate operational extraction of individual tree information from laser scanning point clouds to support forestry, biodiversity, and carbon mapping."}

Local attention reduces complexity by restricting attention to neighborhoods. Block-sparse kernels can further improve the efficiency of local attention, but conventional local attention patterns often fail to deliver significant speedups because tokens within a window are not contiguous in the 1D sequence. This work proposes a novel method for constructing windows and neighborhoods based on the Hilbert curve. Image tokens are first reordered along a Hilbert curve, and windows and neighborhoods are then formed on the reordered 1D sequence. From a block-sparse perspective, this strategy significantly increases block sparsity and can be combined with existing block-sparse kernels to improve the efficiency of 2D local attention. Experiments show that the proposed Hilbert Window Attention and Hilbert Slide Attention can accelerate window attention and slide attention by about $4\\times$ and $18\\times$, respectively. To assess practicality, the strategy is instantiated as the Hilbert Window Transformer and the Hilbert Neighborhood Transformer, both of which achieve end-to-end speedups with minimal accuracy loss. Overall, combining Hilbert-guided local attention with block-sparse kernels offers a general and practical approach to enhancing the efficiency of 2D local attention for images.

Handwriting-often disrupted in prodromal AD-provides a non-invasive and cost-effective window into subtle motor and cognitive decline. Existing handwriting-based AD studies, mostly relying on online trajectories and hand-crafted features, have not systematically examined how task type influences diagnostic performance and cross-task generalization. Meanwhile, large-scale vision language models have demonstrated remarkable zero or few-shot anomaly detection in natural images and strong adaptability across medical modalities such as chest X-ray and brain MRI. However, handwriting-based disease detection remains largely unexplored within this paradigm. To close this gap, we introduce a lightweight Cross-Layer Fusion Adapter framework that repurposes CLIP for handwriting-based AD screening. CLFA implants multi-level fusion adapters within the visual encoder to progressively align representations toward handwriting-specific medical cues, enabling prompt-free and efficient zero-shot inference. Using this framework, we systematically investigate cross-task generalization-training on a specific handwriting task and evaluating on unseen ones-to reveal which task types and writing patterns most effectively discriminate AD. Extensive analyses further highlight characteristic stroke patterns and task-level factors that contribute to early AD identification, offering both diagnostic insights and a benchmark for handwriting-based cognitive assessment."}

This results in an underutilization of rich patterns from the global history. To bridge this gap, we propose Predicting the Future by Retrieving the Past (PFRP), a novel approach that explicitly integrates global historical data to enhance forecasting accuracy. Specifically, we construct a Global Memory Bank (GMB) to effectively store and manage global historical patterns. A retrieval mechanism is then employed to extract similar patterns from the GMB, enabling the generation of global predictions. By adaptively combining these global predictions with the outputs of any local prediction model, PFRP produces more accurate and interpretable forecasts.

To mitigate this, concept erasure methods have been developed to remove undesirable concepts from pre-trained models. However, existing methods remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks that can regenerate the erased content. Moreover, achieving robust erasure often degrades the model's generative quality for safe, unrelated concepts, creating a difficult trade-off between safety and performance. To address this challenge, we introduce Classifier-Guided Concept Erasure (CGCE), an efficient plug-and-play framework that provides robust concept erasure for diverse generative models without altering their original weights. CGCE uses a lightweight classifier operating on text embeddings to first detect and then refine prompts containing undesired concepts. This approach is highly scalable, allowing for multi-concept erasure by aggregating guidance from several classifiers. By modifying only unsafe embeddings at inference time, our method prevents harmful content generation while preserving the model's original quality on benign prompts. Extensive experiments show that CGCE achieves state-of-the-art robustness against a wide range of red-teaming attacks. Our approach also maintains high generative utility, demonstrating a superior balance between safety and performance. We showcase the versatility of CGCE through its successful application to various modern T2I and T2V models, establishing it as a practical and effective solution for safe generative AI."}

Recently, to improve its performance and make it work more like a pathologist, several MIL approaches based on the use of multiple-resolution images have been proposed, delivering often higher performance than those that use single-resolution images. Despite impressive recent developments of multiple-resolution MIL, previous approaches only focus on improving performance, thereby lacking research on well-calibrated MIL that clinical experts can rely on for trustworthy diagnostic results. In this study, we propose Uncertainty-Focused Calibrated MIL (UFC-MIL), which more closely mimics the pathologists' examination behaviors while providing calibrated diagnostic predictions, using multiple images with different resolutions. UFC-MIL includes a novel patch-wise loss that learns the latent patterns of instances and expresses their uncertainty for classification. Also, the attention-based architecture with a neighbor patch aggregation module collects features for the classifier.

It also attains a 10% reduction in pre-training time per epoch, further underscoring its superior pre-training efficiency."}

Applications like human action anticipation that require fusing multifarious sensor data are hindered by both feature and modality collapse. However, existing methods attempt to counter feature collapse and modality collapse separately. This is because there is no unifying framework that efficiently addresses feature and modality collapse in conjunction. In this paper, we posit the utility of effective rank as an informative measure that can be utilized to quantify and counter both the representation collapses. We propose \\textit{Rank-enhancing Token Fuser}, a theoretically grounded fusion framework that selectively blends less informative features from one modality with complementary features from another modality. We show that our method increases the effective rank of the fused representation. To address modality collapse, we evaluate modality combinations that mutually increase each others' effective rank. We show that depth maintains representational balance when fused with RGB, avoiding modality collapse. We validate our method on action anticipation, where we present \\texttt{R3D}, a depth-informed fusion framework. Extensive experiments on NTURGBD, UTKinect, and DARai demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods by up to 3.74\\%.

We introduce EIDSeg, the first large-scale semantic segmentation dataset specifically for post-earthquake social media imagery. The dataset comprises 3,266 images from nine major earthquakes (2008-2023), annotated across five classes of infrastructure damage: Undamaged Building, Damaged Building, Destroyed Building, Undamaged Road, and Damaged Road. We propose a practical three-phase cross-disciplinary annotation protocol with labeling guidelines that enables consistent segmentation by non-expert annotators, achieving over 70% inter-annotator agreement.

To address these challenges, we propose a novel cross-modal registration framework composed of two key modules: the Iterative Agents Selection (IAS) module and the Reliable Agents Interaction (RAI) module. IAS enhances structural feature awareness with phase maps and employs reinforcement learning principles to efficiently select reliable agents. RAI then leverages these selected agents to guide cross-modal interactions, effectively reducing mismatches and improving overall robustness.

To tackle these challenges, we propose Inpaint360GS, a flexible 360° editing framework based on 3DGS that supports multi-object removal and high-fidelity inpainting in 3D space. By distilling 2D segmentation into 3D and leveraging virtual camera views for contextual guidance, our method enables accurate object-level editing and consistent scene completion.

Artificial intelligence may aid in pre-screening. Purpose: To evaluate the DINOv2-based Medical Slice Transformer (MST) for ruling out significant findings (Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System [BI-RADS] >=4) in contrast-enhanced and non-contrast-enhanced abbreviated breast MRI. Materials and Methods: This institutional review board approved retrospective study included 1,847 single-breast MRI examinations (377 BI-RADS >=4) from an in-house dataset and 924 from an external validation dataset (Duke). Four abbreviated protocols were tested: T1-weighted early subtraction (T1sub), diffusion-weighted imaging with b=1500 s/mm2 (DWI1500), DWI1500+T2-weighted (T2w), and T1sub+T2w. Performance was assessed at 90%, 95%, and 97.5% sensitivity using five-fold cross-validation and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) analysis. AUC differences were compared with the DeLong test. False negatives were characterized, and attention maps of true positives were rated in the external dataset. Results: A total of 1,448 female patients (mean age, 49 +/- 12 years) were included. T1sub+T2w achieved an AUC of 0.77 +/- 0.04; DWI1500+T2w, 0.74 +/- 0.04 (p=0.15). At 97.5% sensitivity, T1sub+T2w had the highest specificity (19% +/- 7%), followed by DWI1500+T2w (17% +/- 11%). Missed lesions had a mean diameter <10 mm at 95% and 97.5% thresholds for both T1sub and DWI1500, predominantly non-mass enhancements. External validation yielded an AUC of 0.77, with 88% of attention maps rated good or moderate. Conclusion: At 97.5% sensitivity, the MST framework correctly triaged cases without BI-RADS >=4, achieving 19% specificity for contrast-enhanced and 17% for non-contrast-enhanced MRI.

Preprint", "summary": "Video large language models (Video LLMs) have recently achieved strong performance on tasks such as captioning, summarization, and question answering. Many models and training methods explicitly encourage continuity across events to enhance narrative coherence. While this improves fluency, it also introduces an inductive bias that prioritizes storyline consistency over strict grounding in visual evidence. We identify this bias, which we call narrative prior, as a key driver of two errors: hallucinations, where non-existent events are introduced or existing ones are misinterpreted, and omissions, where factual events are suppressed because they are misaligned with surrounding context. To systematically evaluate narrative prior-induced errors, we introduce NOAH, a large-scale benchmark that constructs composite videos by inserting clips from other sources into target videos. By varying semantic similarity and insertion position, our benchmark enables controlled and scalable analysis of narrative priors. We design one captioning task with tailored metrics and three QA tasks - Existence, Temporal, and Narrative - yielding more than 60K evaluation samples. Extensive experiments yield three key findings: (i) most Video LLMs exhibit hallucinations and omissions driven by narrative priors, (ii) the patterns of these errors vary across architectures and depend on event similarity and insertion position, and (iii) reliance on narrative priors intensifies under sampling with fewer frames, amplifying errors when event continuity is weak. We establish NOAH as the first standardized evaluation of narrative prior-induced hallucination and omission in Video LLMs, providing a foundation for developing more reliable and trustworthy models.

However, current automated methods often rely on resource-heavy Large Language Models (LLMs) or static knowledge graphs and struggle with two fundamental challenges in real-world clinical data: (1) missing modalities, such as incomplete clinical context , and (2) feature entanglement, where mixed modality-specific and shared information leads to suboptimal fusion and clinically unfaithful hallucinated findings. To address these challenges, we propose the DiA-gnostic VLVAE, which achieves robust radiology reporting through Disentangled Alignment. Our framework is designed to be resilient to missing modalities by disentangling shared and modality-specific features using a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) based Vision-Language Variational Autoencoder (VLVAE). A constrained optimization objective enforces orthogonality and alignment between these latent representations to prevent suboptimal fusion. A compact LLaMA-X decoder then uses these disentangled representations to generate reports efficiently. On the IU X-Ray and MIMIC-CXR datasets, DiA has achieved competetive BLEU@4 scores of 0.266 and 0.134, respectively. Experimental results show that the proposed method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models."}

It spans tasks from foundational recognition and detection to high-level character reasoning and narrative construction, supported by dense annotations for characters, poses, and depth. Beyond that, we evaluate state-of-the-art proprietary models, including GPT-4o and Gemini-2.5, and open-source models such as Qwen2.5-VL, revealing substantial performance deficits across core tasks of our benchmarks and underscoring that comic understanding remains an unsolved challenge. To enhance VLMs' capabilities in this domain, we systematically investigate post-training strategies, including supervised fine-tuning on solutions (SFT-S), supervised fine-tuning on reasoning trajectories (SFT-R), and reinforcement learning (RL). Beyond that, inspired by the emerging \"Thinking with Images\" paradigm, we propose Region-Aware Reinforcement Learning (RARL) for VLMs, which trains models to dynamically attend to relevant regions through zoom-in operations. We observe that when applied to the Qwen2.5-VL model, RL and RARL yield significant gains in low-level entity recognition and high-level storyline ordering, paving the way for more accurate and efficient VLM applications in the comics domain."}

Current sports benchmarks either cover single sports or lack the detailed reasoning chains and precise visual grounding needed to robustly evaluate these core capabilities in a multi-sport context. To address this gap, we introduce SportR, the first multi-sports large-scale benchmark designed to train and evaluate MLLMs on the fundamental reasoning required for sports intelligence. Our benchmark provides a dataset of 5,017 images and 2,101 videos. To enable granular evaluation, we structure our benchmark around a progressive hierarchy of question-answer (QA) pairs designed to probe reasoning at increasing depths - from simple infraction identification to complex penalty prediction. For the most advanced tasks requiring multi-step reasoning, such as determining penalties or explaining tactics, we provide 7,118 high-quality, human-authored Chain of Thought (CoT) annotations. In addition, our benchmark incorporates both image and video modalities and provides manual bounding box annotations to test visual grounding in the image part directly. Extensive experiments demonstrate the profound difficulty of our benchmark. State-of-the-art baseline models perform poorly on our most challenging tasks.

Recently, Mamba has demonstrated a powerful potential for modeling long-range dependencies with linear complexity, providing a promising solution to MMIF. Unfortunately, Mamba lacks full spatial and frequency perceptions, which are very important for MMIF. Moreover, employing Image Reconstruction (IR) as an auxiliary task has been proven beneficial for MMIF. However, a primary challenge is how to leverage IR efficiently and effectively. To address the above issues, we propose a novel framework named Spatial-Frequency Enhanced Mamba Fusion (SFMFusion) for MMIF. More specifically, we first propose a three-branch structure to couple MMIF and IR, which can retain complete contents from source images. Then, we propose the Spatial-Frequency Enhanced Mamba Block (SFMB), which can enhance Mamba in both spatial and frequency domains for comprehensive feature extraction.

However, most existing approaches treat these domains as independent tasks, overlooking their physiological interplay and shared imaging biomarkers. We propose an Explainable Cross-Disease Reasoning Framework that enables interpretable cardiopulmonary risk assessment from a single LDCT scan. The framework introduces an agentic reasoning process that emulates clinical diagnostic thinking-first perceiving pulmonary findings, then reasoning through established medical knowledge, and finally deriving a cardiovascular judgment with explanatory rationale. It integrates three synergistic components: a pulmonary perception module that summarizes lung abnormalities, a knowledge-guided reasoning module that infers their cardiovascular implications, and a cardiac representation module that encodes structural biomarkers. Their outputs are fused to produce a holistic cardiovascular risk prediction that is both accurate and physiologically grounded. Experiments on the NLST cohort demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves state-of-the-art performance for CVD screening and mortality prediction, outperforming single-disease and purely image-based baselines. Beyond quantitative gains, the framework provides human-verifiable reasoning that aligns with cardiological understanding, revealing coherent links between pulmonary abnormalities and cardiac stress mechanisms. Overall, this work establishes a unified and explainable paradigm for cardiovascular analysis from LDCT, bridging the gap between image-based prediction and mechanism-based medical interpretation."}

While classical methods rely on optical flow and learning-based models assume access to dense ground-truth, both struggle with occlusions, domain shifts, and ambiguous motion. This article introduces MiVID, a lightweight, self-supervised, diffusion-based framework for video interpolation. Our model eliminates the need for explicit motion estimation by combining a 3D U-Net backbone with transformer-style temporal attention, trained under a hybrid masking regime that simulates occlusions and motion uncertainty. The use of cosine-based progressive masking and adaptive loss scheduling allows our network to learn robust spatiotemporal representations without any high-frame-rate supervision. Our framework is evaluated on UCF101-7 and DAVIS-7 datasets. MiVID is trained entirely on CPU using the datasets and 9-frame video segments, making it a low-resource yet highly effective pipeline. Despite these constraints, our model achieves optimal results at just 50 epochs, competitive with several supervised baselines.This work demonstrates the power of self-supervised diffusion priors for temporally coherent frame synthesis and provides a scalable path toward accessible and generalizable VFI systems."}

We present the first frequency-space perspective to analyze this issue and identify two key challenges: (1) models are easily biased toward source-specific knowledge encoded in the low-frequency components of source data, and (2) the sparsity of target data hinders the learning of high-frequency, domain-generalizable features. To address these challenges, we propose \\textbf{FreqGRL}, a novel CD-FSL framework that mitigates the impact of data imbalance in the frequency space.

We further design a High-Frequency Enhancement (HFE) module that filters out low-frequency components and performs learning directly on high-frequency features in the frequency space to improve cross-domain generalization. Additionally, a Global Frequency Filter (GFF) is incorporated to suppress noisy or irrelevant frequencies and emphasize informative ones, mitigating overfitting risks under limited target supervision.

In this paper, we put forward Random Batch Attention (RBA), a linear self-attention mechanism, which has theoretical support of the ability to maintain its expressivity. Random Batch Attention has several significant strengths as follows: (1) Random Batch Attention has linear time complexity.

HiMo-CLIP introduces two key components: a hierarchical decomposition (HiDe) module that extracts latent semantic components from long-form text via in-batch PCA, enabling flexible, batch-aware alignment across different semantic granularities, and a monotonicity-aware contrastive loss (MoLo) that jointly aligns global and component-level representations, encouraging the model to internalize semantic ordering and alignment strength as a function of textual completeness.These components work in concert to produce structured, cognitively-aligned cross-modal representations.

However, existing methods typically suffer from at least one of the following limitations, hindering their practical deployment: (1) lack of visual realism in generated anomalies; (2) dependence on large amounts of real images; and (3) use of memory-intensive, heavyweight model architectures. To overcome these limitations, we propose AnoStyler, a lightweight yet effective method that frames zero-shot anomaly generation as text-guided style transfer. Given a single normal image along with its category label and expected defect type, an anomaly mask indicating the localized anomaly regions and two-class text prompts representing the normal and anomaly states are generated using generalizable category-agnostic procedures. A lightweight U-Net model trained with CLIP-based loss functions is used to stylize the normal image into a visually realistic anomaly image, where anomalies are localized by the anomaly mask and semantically aligned with the text prompts. Extensive experiments on the MVTec-AD and VisA datasets show that AnoStyler outperforms existing anomaly generation methods in generating high-quality and diverse anomaly images. Furthermore, using these generated anomalies helps enhance anomaly detection performance."}

These limitations motivate the definition of a novel problem and the development of targeted modeling solutions. To address these challenges, we formalize a novel problem: Supply Chain Resilience Inference (SCRI), defined as predicting supply chain resilience using hypergraph topology and observed inventory trajectories without explicit dynamic equations. To solve this problem, we propose the Supply Chain Resilience Inference Hypergraph Network (SC-RIHN), a novel hypergraph-based model leveraging set-based encoding and hypergraph message passing to capture multi-party firm-product interactions.

Although this decoupling strategy simplifies the learning process, it inherently ignores the geometric collaborative constraints between different attributes, resulting in the lack of geometric consistency prior, thereby leading to suboptimal performance. To address this issue, we propose novel Spatial-Projection Alignment (SPAN) with two pivotal components: (i). Spatial Point Alignment enforces an explicit global spatial constraint between the predicted and ground-truth 3D bounding boxes, thereby rectifying spatial drift caused by decoupled attribute regression. (ii). 3D-2D Projection Alignment ensures that the projected 3D box is aligned tightly within its corresponding 2D detection bounding box on the image plane, mitigating projection misalignment overlooked in previous works. To ensure training stability, we further introduce a Hierarchical Task Learning strategy that progressively incorporates spatial-projection alignment as 3D attribute predictions refine, preventing early stage error propagation across attributes.

While Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods have become a standard for this, they face a fundamental dilemma in continual learning. Reusing a single set of PEFT parameters for new tasks often leads to catastrophic forgetting of prior knowledge. Conversely, allocating distinct parameters for each task prevents forgetting but results in a linear growth of the model's size and fails to facilitate knowledge transfer between related tasks. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel adaptive PEFT method referred to as \\textit{Mixtures of SubExperts (MoSEs)}, a novel continual learning framework designed for minimal forgetting and efficient scalability. MoSEs integrate a sparse Mixture of SubExperts into the transformer layers, governed by a task-specific routing mechanism. This architecture allows the model to isolate and protect knowledge within dedicated SubExperts, thereby minimizing parameter interference and catastrophic forgetting. Crucially, the router can adaptively select and combine previously learned sparse parameters for new tasks, enabling effective knowledge transfer while ensuring that the model's capacity grows sublinearly. We evaluate MoSEs on the comprehensive TRACE benchmark datasets. Our experiments demonstrate that MoSEs significantly outperform conventional continual learning approaches in both knowledge retention and scalability to new tasks, achieving state-of-the-art performance with substantial memory and computational savings."}

In this paper, we propose a novel Mixed RWKV-Transformer (MRT) architecture that encodes images into more compact 1-D latent representations by synergistically integrating the complementary strengths of linear-attention-based RWKV and self-attention-based Transformer models. Specifically, MRT partitions each image into fixed-size windows, utilizing RWKV modules to capture global dependencies across windows and Transformer blocks to model local redundancies within each window. The hierarchical attention mechanism enables more efficient and compact representation learning in the 1-D domain. To further enhance compression efficiency, we introduce a dedicated RWKV Compression Model (RCM) tailored to the structure characteristics of the intermediate 1-D latent features in MRT. Extensive experiments on standard image compression benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our approach. The proposed MRT framework consistently achieves superior reconstruction quality at bitrates below 0.02 bits per pixel (bpp). Quantitative results based on the DISTS metric show that MRT significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art 2-D architecture GLC, achieving bitrate savings of 43.75%, 30.59% on the Kodak and CLIC2020 test datasets, respectively."}

With the release of the Kaggle Meta Code and Kaggle Meta Datasets, we now have a unique opportunity to explore these competitions, technologies, and real-world applications of Machine Learning and AI. And so in this study, we take a closer look at 15 years of data science on Kaggle - through metadata, shared code, community discussions, and the competitions themselves. We explore Kaggle's growth, its impact on the data science community, uncover hidden technological trends, analyze competition winners, how Kagglers approach problems in general, and more. We do this by analyzing millions of kernels and discussion threads to perform both longitudinal trend analysis and standard exploratory data analysis. Our findings show that Kaggle is a steadily growing platform with increasingly diverse use cases, and that Kagglers are quick to adapt to new trends and apply them to real-world challenges, while producing - on average - models with solid generalization capabilities.

However, without a global understanding of both subjects and background, recognizing actions in such samples remains challenging because of the background distractions. Receptance Weighted Key Value (RWKV), which learns interaction between various dimensions, shows promise for global modeling. While directly applying RWKV to wide-angle FSAR may fail to highlight subjects due to excessive background information. Additionally, temporal relation degraded by frames with similar backgrounds is difficult to reconstruct, further impacting performance. Therefore, we design the CompOund SegmenTation and Temporal REconstructing RWKV (Otter). Specifically, the Compound Segmentation Module~(CSM) is devised to segment and emphasize key patches in each frame, effectively highlighting subjects against background information. The Temporal Reconstruction Module (TRM) is incorporated into the temporal-enhanced prototype construction to enable bidirectional scanning, allowing better reconstruct temporal relation. Furthermore, a regular prototype is combined with the temporal-enhanced prototype to simultaneously enhance subject emphasis and temporal modeling, improving wide-angle FSAR performance.

Our key insight is that Masked AutoEncoder (MAE), trained to reconstruct masked patches conditioned on visible context, naturally encodes semantic consistency expectations. We formalize this reconstruction process probabilistically, computing conditional Negative Log-Likelihood (NLL, p(masked | visible)) to quantify local semantic anomalies. By aggregating these patch-level statistics with global MAE features through learned fusion, CINEMAE achieves strong cross-generator generalization.

Recently, the integration of flow matching generative models into image restoration has garnered significant attention, owing to their powerful prior modeling capabilities. In this work, we incorporate such generative priors into a Plug-and-Play (PnP) framework based on proximal splitting, where the proximal operator associated with the regularizer is replaced by a time-dependent denoiser derived from the generative model. While existing PnP methods have achieved notable success in inverse problems with smooth squared $\\ell_2$ data fidelity--typically associated with Gaussian noise--their applicability to more general data fidelity terms remains underexplored. To address this, we propose a general and efficient PnP algorithm inspired by the primal-dual hybrid gradient (PDHG) method. Our approach is computationally efficient, memory-friendly, and accommodates a wide range of fidelity terms. In particular, it supports both $\\ell_1$ and $\\ell_2$ norm-based losses, enabling robustness to non-Gaussian noise types such as Poisson and impulse noise. We validate our method on several image restoration tasks, including denoising, super-resolution, deblurring, and inpainting, and demonstrate that $\\ell_1$ and $\\ell_2$ fidelity terms outperform the conventional squared $\\ell_2$ loss in the presence of non-Gaussian noise."}

Current centralized traffic management schemes invade user location privacy and further entrench traffic disparity by offering disadvantaged route suggestions, whereas current federated learning frameworks do not consider fairness constraints in multi-objective traffic settings. This study presents a privacy-preserving federated learning framework, termed FedFair-Traffic, that jointly and simultaneously optimizes travel efficiency, traffic fairness, and differential privacy protection. This is the first attempt to integrate three conflicting objectives to improve urban transportation systems. The proposed methodology enables collaborative learning between related vehicles with data locality by integrating Graph Neural Networks with differential privacy mechanisms ($ε$-privacy guarantees) and Gini coefficient-based fair constraints using multi-objective optimization. The framework uses federated aggregation methods of gradient clipping and noise injection to provide differential privacy and optimize Pareto-efficient solutions for the efficiency-fairness tradeoff. Real-world comprehensive experiments on the METR-LA traffic dataset showed that FedFair-Traffic can reduce the average travel time by 7\\% (14.2 minutes) compared with their centralized baselines, promote traffic fairness by 73\\% (Gini coefficient, 0.78), and offer high privacy protection (privacy score, 0.8) with an 89\\% reduction in communication overhead.

The method aims to simplify color correction by adjusting the Hue (H), Saturation (S), and Value (V) components independently. This approach resolves the inherent color coupling problems in traditional methods. Our model adopts a two-stage architecture: First, a Chroma-Aware Spectral Tokenizer (CAST) converts the input image from RGB space to HSV space and independently encodes the Hue (H) and Value (V) channels into a set of semantic tokens describing the Purple flare status; second, the HSV-LUT module takes these tokens as input and dynamically generates independent correction curves (1D-LUTs) for the three channels H, S, and V. To effectively train and validate our model, we built the first large-scale purple flare dataset with diverse scenes. We also proposed new metrics and a loss function specifically designed for this task. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model not only significantly outperforms existing methods in visual effects but also achieves state-of-the-art performance on all quantitative metrics."}

To address the issues of unstable pose estimation and scene representation distortion caused by geometric texture inconsistency in large outdoor scenes with weak or repetitive textures, we approach the problem from two aspects: pose estimation and scene representation. For pose estimation, we leverage LiDAR-IMU Odometry to provide prior poses for cameras in large-scale environments. These prior pose constraints are incorporated into COLMAP's triangulation process, with pose optimization performed via bundle adjustment. Ensuring consistency between pixel data association and prior poses helps maintain both robustness and accuracy. For scene representation, we introduce normal vector constraints and effective rank regularization to enforce consistency in the direction and shape of Gaussian primitives. These constraints are jointly optimized with the existing photometric loss to enhance the map quality. We evaluate our approach using both public and self-collected datasets. In terms of pose optimization, our method requires only one-third of the time while maintaining accuracy and robustness across both datasets. In terms of scene representation, the results show that our method significantly outperforms conventional 3DGS pipelines.

We present ConeGS, an image-space-informed densification framework that is independent of existing scene geometry state. ConeGS first creates a fast Instant Neural Graphics Primitives (iNGP) reconstruction as a geometric proxy to estimate per-pixel depth. During the subsequent 3DGS optimization, it identifies high-error pixels and inserts new Gaussians along the corresponding viewing cones at the predicted depth values, initializing their size according to the cone diameter. A pre-activation opacity penalty rapidly removes redundant Gaussians, while a primitive budgeting strategy controls the total number of primitives, either by a fixed budget or by adapting to scene complexity, ensuring high reconstruction quality. Experiments show that ConeGS consistently enhances reconstruction quality and rendering performance across Gaussian budgets, with especially strong gains under tight primitive constraints where efficient placement is crucial."}

Yet, dense disparity supervision is nearly impossible due to anatomical constraints, typically limiting annotations to only a few image-level labels acquired before the endoscope enters deep body cavities. Teacher-Student Learning (TSL) offers a promising solution by leveraging a teacher trained on sparse labels to generate pseudo labels and associated confidence maps from abundant unlabeled surgical videos. However, existing TSL methods are confined to image-level supervision, providing only spatial confidence and lacking temporal consistency estimation. This absence of spatio-temporal reliability results in unstable disparity predictions and severe flickering artifacts across video frames. To overcome these challenges, we propose TiS-TSL, a novel time-switchable teacher-student learning framework for video stereo matching under minimal supervision. At its core is a unified model that operates in three distinct modes: Image-Prediction (IP), Forward Video-Prediction (FVP), and Backward Video-Prediction (BVP), enabling flexible temporal modeling within a single architecture. Enabled by this unified model, TiS-TSL adopts a two-stage learning strategy. The Image-to-Video (I2V) stage transfers sparse image-level knowledge to initialize temporal modeling. The subsequent Video-to-Video (V2V) stage refines temporal disparity predictions by comparing forward and backward predictions to calculate bidirectional spatio-temporal consistency. This consistency identifies unreliable regions across frames, filters noisy video-level pseudo labels, and enforces temporal coherence.

As variants continue to appear, assessing the perceptual quality of 3D objects reconstructed with different GS-based methods remains an open challenge. To address this issue, we first propose a unified multi-distance subjective quality assessment method that closely mimics human viewing behavior for objects reconstructed with GS-based methods in actual applications, thereby better collecting perceptual experiences. Based on it, we also construct a novel GS quality assessment dataset named MUGSQA, which is constructed considering multiple uncertainties of the input data. These uncertainties include the quantity and resolution of input views, the view distance, and the accuracy of the initial point cloud. Moreover, we construct two benchmarks: one to evaluate the robustness of various GS-based reconstruction methods under multiple uncertainties, and the other to evaluate the performance of existing quality assessment metrics.

Detecting and mitigating hallucinations is challenging when ground-truth references are unavailable and model internals are inaccessible. This paper proposes a novel self-contained low-rank approach to automatically rank multiple candidate captions generated by multiple VLMs based on their hallucination levels, using only the captions themselves without requiring external references or model access. By constructing a sentence-embedding matrix and decomposing it into a low-rank consensus component and a sparse residual, we use the residual magnitude to rank captions: selecting the one with the smallest residual as the most hallucination-free. Experiments on the NuScenes dataset demonstrate that our approach achieves 87% selection accuracy in identifying hallucination-free captions, representing a 19% improvement over the unfiltered baseline and a 6-10% improvement over multi-agent debate method. The sorting produced by sparse error magnitudes shows strong correlation with human judgments of hallucinations, validating our scoring mechanism. Additionally, our method, which can be easily parallelized, reduces inference time by 51-67% compared to debate approaches, making it practical for real-time autonomous driving applications."}

Third, we introduce a \\textbf{diffusion noise initialization strategy (IC-Init)}. By enforcing explicit constraints on background coherence and motion continuity during inference-time noise search, we achieve better identity preservation and refine motion dynamics compared to the current autoregressive strategy.

However, generating these explanations for multivariate time series presents challenges due to their complex, multi-dimensional nature. Traditional Nearest Unlike Neighbor-based methods typically substitute subsequences in a queried time series with influential subsequences from an NUN, which is not always realistic in real-world scenarios due to the rigid direct substitution. Counterfactual with Residual Generative Adversarial Networks-based methods aim to address this by learning from the distribution of observed data to generate synthetic counterfactual explanations. However, these methods primarily focus on minimizing the cost from the queried time series to the counterfactual explanations and often neglect the importance of distancing the counterfactual explanation from the decision boundary. This oversight can result in explanations that no longer qualify as counterfactual if minor changes occur within the model. To generate a more robust counterfactual explanation, we introduce TriShGAN, under the CounteRGAN framework enhanced by the incorporation of triplet loss. This unsupervised learning approach uses distance metric learning to encourage the counterfactual explanations not only to remain close to the queried time series but also to capture the feature distribution of the instance with the desired outcome, thereby achieving a better balance between minimal cost and robustness. Additionally, we integrate a Shapelet Extractor that strategically selects the most discriminative parts of the high-dimensional queried time series to enhance the sparsity of counterfactual explanation and efficiency of the training process."}

Current approaches, however, remain constrained by the scarcity of high-quality stimulus-brain response pairs and the inherent semantic mismatch between neural representations and visual content. Inspired by perceptual variability and co-adaptive strategy of the biological systems, we propose a novel self-supervised architecture, named NeuroBridge, which integrates Cognitive Prior Augmentation (CPA) with Shared Semantic Projector (SSP) to promote effective cross-modality alignment. Specifically, CPA simulates perceptual variability by applying asymmetric, modality-specific transformations to both EEG signals and images, enhancing semantic diversity. Unlike previous approaches, SSP establishes a bidirectional alignment process through a co-adaptive strategy, which mutually aligns features from two modalities into a shared semantic space for effective cross-modal learning. NeuroBridge surpasses previous state-of-the-art methods under both intra-subject and inter-subject settings. In the intra-subject scenario, it achieves the improvements of 12.3% in top-1 accuracy and 10.2% in top-5 accuracy, reaching 63.2% and 89.9% respectively on a 200-way zero-shot retrieval task.

However, we show that this dyadic framing can obscure underlying disparities across subgroups, allowing systemic biases to go undetected. Moreover, we argue that demographic parity does not meet desired properties for fairness assessment in ranking-based tasks such as link prediction. We formalize the limitations of existing fairness evaluations and propose a framework that enables a more expressive assessment.

However, their reliability remains a challenge, especially in long-horizon tasks, since they often produce overconfident yet wrong outputs. Conformal Prediction (CP) has been leveraged to address this issue by wrapping LLM outputs into prediction sets that contain the correct action with a user-defined confidence. When the prediction set is a singleton, the planner executes that action; otherwise, it requests help from a user. This has led to LLM-based planners that can ensure plan correctness with a user-defined probability. However, as LLMs are trained in an uncertainty-agnostic manner, without awareness of prediction sets, they tend to produce unnecessarily large sets, particularly at higher confidence levels, resulting in frequent human interventions limiting autonomous deployment. To address this, we introduce CoFineLLM (Conformal Finetuning for LLMs), the first CP-aware finetuning framework for LLM-based planners that explicitly reduces prediction-set size and, in turn, the need for user interventions. We evaluate our approach on multiple language-instructed robot planning problems and show consistent improvements over uncertainty-aware and uncertainty-agnostic finetuning baselines in terms of prediction-set size, and help rates. Finally, we demonstrate robustness of our method to out-of-distribution scenarios in hardware experiments."}

One of the main challenges is to stitch together multiple images into a single high-resolution image that covers a large area. Featurebased image stitching algorithms are commonly used but can suffer from errors and ambiguities in feature detection and matching. To address this, several approaches have been proposed, including using bundle adjustment techniques or direct image alignment. In this paper, we present a novel method that uses a combination of IMU data and computer vision techniques for stitching images captured by a UAV. Our method involves several steps such as estimating the displacement and rotation of the UAV between consecutive images, correcting for perspective distortion, and computing a homography matrix. We then use a standard image stitching algorithm to align and blend the images together. Our proposed method leverages the additional information provided by the IMU data, corrects for various sources of distortion, and can be easily integrated into existing UAV workflows. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our method, outperforming some of the existing feature-based image stitching algorithms in terms of accuracy and reliability, particularly in challenging scenarios such as large displacements, rotations, and variations in camera pose."}

However, the effectiveness of traditional GNNs degrades on heterophilic graphs, where connected nodes often belong to different labels or properties. While recent work has introduced mechanisms to improve GNN performance under heterophily, certain key limitations still exist. Most existing models apply a fixed aggregation depth across all nodes, overlooking the fact that nodes may require different propagation depths based on their local homophily levels and neighborhood structures. Moreover, many methods are tailored to either homophilic or heterophilic settings, lacking the flexibility to generalize across both regimes. To address these challenges, we develop a theoretical framework that links local structural and label characteristics to information propagation dynamics at the node level. Our analysis shows that optimal aggregation depth varies across nodes and is critical for preserving class-discriminative information. Guided by this insight, we propose a novel adaptive-depth GNN architecture that dynamically selects node-specific aggregation depths using theoretically grounded metrics. Our method seamlessly adapts to both homophilic and heterophilic patterns within a unified model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach consistently enhances the performance of standard GNN backbones across diverse benchmarks."}

To achieve this, a pervasive paradigm is to leverage the rich vision-semantic priors of large vision-language models (VLMs). However, the fundamental question persists: How do VLAs effectively inherit the prior knowledge from VLMs? To address this critical question, we introduce a diagnostic benchmark, GrinningFace, an emoji tabletop manipulation task where the robot arm is asked to place objects onto printed emojis corresponding to language instructions. This task design is particularly revealing -- knowledge associated with emojis is ubiquitous in Internet-scale datasets used for VLM pre-training, yet emojis themselves are largely absent from standard robotics datasets. Consequently, they provide a clean proxy: successful task completion indicates effective transfer of VLM priors to embodied control. We implement this diagnostic task in both simulated environment and a real robot, and compare various promising techniques for knowledge transfer. Specifically, we investigate the effects of parameter-efficient fine-tuning, VLM freezing, co-training, predicting discretized actions, and predicting latent actions. Through systematic evaluation, our work not only demonstrates the critical importance of preserving VLM priors for the generalization of VLA but also establishes guidelines for future research in developing truly generalizable embodied AI systems."}

We provide the first comprehensive analysis of this phenomenon through a novel analytical framework termed as ``distillation dynamics\", combining frequency spectrum analysis, information entropy metrics, and activation magnitude tracking. Our investigation reveals that ViTs exhibit a distinctive U-shaped information processing pattern: initial compression followed by expansion. We identify the root cause of negative transfer in feature distillation: a fundamental representational paradigm mismatch between teacher and student models. Through frequency-domain analysis, we show that teacher models employ distributed, high-dimensional encoding strategies in later layers that smaller student models cannot replicate due to limited channel capacity. This mismatch causes late-layer feature alignment to actively harm student performance. Our findings reveal that successful knowledge transfer in ViTs requires moving beyond naive feature mimicry to methods that respect these fundamental representational constraints, providing essential theoretical guidance for designing effective ViTs compression strategies.

The framework introduces an agentic reasoning process that emulates clinical diagnostic thinking-first perceiving pulmonary findings, then reasoning through established medical knowledge, and finally deriving a cardiovascular judgment with explanatory rationale. It integrates three synergistic components: a pulmonary perception module that summarizes lung abnormalities, a knowledge-guided reasoning module that infers their cardiovascular implications, and a cardiac representation module that encodes structural biomarkers. Their outputs are fused to produce a holistic cardiovascular risk prediction that is both accurate and physiologically grounded. Experiments on the NLST cohort demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves state-of-the-art performance for CVD screening and mortality prediction, outperforming single-disease and purely image-based baselines. Beyond quantitative gains, the framework provides human-verifiable reasoning that aligns with cardiological understanding, revealing coherent links between pulmonary abnormalities and cardiac stress mechanisms.

We address this limitation by training the first open-source text-to-image model on long structured captions, where every training sample is annotated with the same set of fine-grained attributes. This design maximizes expressive coverage and enables disentangled control over visual factors.

To facilitate this task, we first present the Multimodal Multi-disease Medical Diagnosis Segmentation (M3DS) dataset, containing diverse multimodal multi-disease medical images paired with their corresponding segmentation masks and diagnosis chain-of-thought, created via an automated diagnosis chain-of-thought generation pipeline. Moreover, we propose Sim4Seg, a novel framework that improves the performance of diagnosis segmentation by taking advantage of the Region-Aware Vision-Language Similarity to Mask (RVLS2M) module. To improve overall performance, we investigate a test-time scaling strategy for MDS tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms the baselines in both segmentation and diagnosis."}

This work introduces a two-stage system to address these compositional limitations. The first stage employs a Large Language Model (LLM) to generate a structured layout from a list of objects. The second stage uses a layout-conditioned diffusion model to synthesize a photorealistic image adhering to this layout. We find that task decomposition is critical for LLM-based spatial planning; by simplifying the initial generation to core objects and completing the layout with rule-based insertion, we improve object recall from 57.2% to 99.9% for complex scenes. For image synthesis, we compare two leading conditioning methods: ControlNet and GLIGEN. After domain-specific finetuning on table-setting datasets, we identify a key trade-off: ControlNet preserves text-based stylistic control but suffers from object hallucination, while GLIGEN provides superior layout fidelity at the cost of reduced prompt-based controllability. Our end-to-end system successfully generates images with specified object counts and plausible spatial arrangements, demonstrating the viability of a decoupled approach for compositionally controlled synthesis."}

In contrast, soft robotic simulation frameworks remain scarce and are seldom adopted by the soft robotics community. This gap stems partly from the lack of easy-to-use, general-purpose frameworks and partly from the high computational cost of accurately simulating continuum mechanics, which often renders policy learning infeasible. In this work, we demonstrate that rapid soft robot policy learning is indeed achievable via implicit time-stepping. Our simulator of choice, DisMech, is a general-purpose, fully implicit soft-body simulator capable of handling both soft dynamics and frictional contact. We further introduce delta natural curvature control, a method analogous to delta joint position control in rigid manipulators, providing an intuitive and effective means of enacting control for soft robot learning. To highlight the benefits of implicit time-stepping and delta curvature control, we conduct extensive comparisons across four diverse soft manipulator tasks against one of the most widely used soft-body frameworks, Elastica. With implicit time-stepping, parallel stepping of 500 environments achieves up to 6x faster speeds for non-contact cases and up to 40x faster for contact-rich scenarios. Finally, a comprehensive sim-to-sim gap evaluation--training policies in one simulator and evaluating them in another--demonstrates that implicit time-stepping provides a rare free lunch: dramatic speedups achieved without sacrificing accuracy."}

To address this challenge, we propose the adaptive Morph Patch Transformer (MPT), a novel architecture specifically designed for aortic vascular segmentation. Specifically, MPT introduces an adaptive patch partitioning strategy that dynamically generates morphology-aware patches aligned with complex vascular structures. This strategy can preserve semantic integrity of complex vascular structures within individual patches. Moreover, a Semantic Clustering Attention (SCA) method is proposed to dynamically aggregate features from various patches with similar semantic characteristics. This method enhances the model's capability to segment vessels of varying sizes, preserving the integrity of vascular structures.

In this experiment, we classify colorless microplastic particles (50-300 $μ$m) by illuminating them with linearly polarized laser light and capturing their reflected signals using a polarization-sensitive camera. This reflection-based technique successfully circumvents the transmission-based interference issues that plague many conventional methods when applied in water. Using a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) for image-based classification, we successfully identified three common polymer types, high-density polyethylene, low-density polyethylene, and polypropylene, achieving a peak mean classification accuracy of 80% on the test dataset. A subsequent feature hierarchy analysis demonstrated that the CNN's decision-making process relies mainly on the microstructural integrity and internal texture (polarization patterns) of the particle rather than its macroshape. Critically, we found that the Angle of Linear Polarization (AOLP) signal is significantly more robust against contextual noise than the Degree of Linear Polarization (DOLP) signal. While the AOLP-based classification achieved superior overall performance, its strength lies in distinguishing between the two polyethylene plastics, showing a lower confusion rate between high-density and low-density polyethylene. Conversely, the DOLP signal demonstrated slightly worse overall classification results but excels at accurately identifying the polypropylene class, which it isolated with greater success than AOLP."}

Conventional parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques, such as Adapters and LoRA, typically break symmetry, making them incompatible with those equivariant architectures. ELoRA, recently proposed, is the first equivariant PEFT method. It achieves improved parameter efficiency and performance on many benchmarks. However, the relatively high degrees of freedom it retains within each tensor order can still perturb pretrained feature distributions and ultimately degrade performance. To address this, we present Magnitude-Modulated Equivariant Adapter (MMEA), a novel equivariant fine-tuning method which employs lightweight scalar gating to modulate feature magnitudes on a per-order and per-multiplicity basis. We demonstrate that MMEA preserves strict equivariance and, across multiple benchmarks, consistently improves energy and force predictions to state-of-the-art levels while training fewer parameters than competing approaches. These results suggest that, in many practical scenarios, modulating channel magnitudes is sufficient to adapt equivariant models to new chemical environments without breaking symmetry, pointing toward a new paradigm for equivariant PEFT design."}

Secondly, generalized textual features contain both 2D and 3D descriptive information, thereby capturing an additional dimension of details compared to singular 2D or 3D visual features. This characteristic leads to cross-dimensional interference when refining visual features under text guidance. To overcome these challenges, we propose Mono3DVG-EnSD, a novel framework that integrates two key components: the CLIP-Guided Lexical Certainty Adapter (CLIP-LCA) and the Dimension-Decoupled Module (D2M). The CLIP-LCA dynamically masks high-certainty keywords while retaining low-certainty implicit spatial descriptions, thereby forcing the model to develop a deeper understanding of spatial relationships in captions for object localization. Meanwhile, the D2M decouples dimension-specific (2D/3D) textual features from generalized textual features to guide corresponding visual features at same dimension, which mitigates cross-dimensional interference by ensuring dimensionally-consistent cross-modal interactions.

SCARE comprises three core components: (1) Sequence Lens Projector (SLP) that logarithmically compresses time-series data while preserving boundary information across bins, (2) Efficient Bitwise Attention (EBA) module that replaces costly multiplications with bitwise operations via binary hash codes, and (3) Hash optimization strategy that ensures stable training without auxiliary loss terms.

However, existing post-training paradigms tend to neglect two critical aspects: (1) The lack of quantifiable difficulty metrics capable of strategically screening samples for post-training optimization. (2) Suboptimal post-training paradigms that fail to jointly optimize perception and reasoning capabilities. To address this gap, we propose two novel difficulty-aware sampling strategies: Progressive Image Semantic Masking (PISM) quantifies sample hardness through systematic image degradation, while Cross-Modality Attention Balance (CMAB) assesses cross-modal interaction complexity via attention distribution analysis. Leveraging these metrics, we design a hierarchical training framework that incorporates both GRPO-only and SFT+GRPO hybrid training paradigms, and evaluate them across six benchmark datasets.

In response, we propose ALIGN, a novel framework that jointly trains a classifier and a masker in an iterative manner. The masker learns to produce soft, task-relevant masks that highlight informative regions, while the classifier is optimized for both prediction accuracy and alignment between its saliency maps and the learned masks. By leveraging high-quality masks as guidance, ALIGN improves both interpretability and generalizability, showing its superiority across various settings.

Specifically, we use a rank-1 LoRA to create a minimal parameter adapter for Qwen-2.5-32B-Instruct which recovers 73-90% of reasoning-benchmark performance compared to a full parameter finetune. We find that the activations of this LoRA are as interpretable as MLP neurons, and fire for reasoning-specific behaviors. Finally, we train a sparse autoencoder on the entire activation state of this LoRA and identify fine-grained and monosemantic features.

Experiments demonstrate that our proposed method achieves outstanding performance across multiple text classification tasks.

In this paper, we present a lightweight and domain-adapted framework that brings structure and biological relevance into MAE-based learning through a wavelet-informed patch selection strategy.

A common technique in VAE-based collaborative filtering (CF) consists in applying binary input masking to user interaction vectors, which improves performance but remains underexplored theoretically. In this work, we analyze how collaboration arises in VAE-based CF and show it is governed by latent proximity: we derive a latent sharing radius that informs when an SGD update on one user strictly reduces the loss on another user, with influence decaying as the latent Wasserstein distance increases. We further study the induced geometry: with clean inputs, VAE-based CF primarily exploits \\emph{local} collaboration between input-similar users and under-utilizes global collaboration between far-but-related users. We compare two mechanisms that encourage \\emph{global} mixing and characterize their trade-offs: (1) $β$-KL regularization directly tightens the information bottleneck, promoting posterior overlap but risking representational collapse if too large; (2) input masking induces stochastic geometric contractions and expansions, which can bring distant users onto the same latent neighborhood but also introduce neighborhood drift. To preserve user identity while enabling global consistency, we propose an anchor regularizer that aligns user posteriors with item embeddings, stabilizing users under masking and facilitating signal sharing across related items.

We introduce TrueCity, the first urban semantic segmentation benchmark with cm-accurate annotated real-world point clouds, semantic 3D city models, and annotated simulated point clouds representing the same city.

To solve this task, we adopt the masking and prompt learning strategy and propose a novel framework called Mask-Aware Sleep Staging (MASS). Specifically, we design a multi-level masking strategy to promote effective feature modeling under partial and irregular observations. To mitigate the loss of contextual information introduced by masking, we further propose a hierarchical prompt learning mechanism that aggregates unmasked data into a global prompt, serving as a semantic anchor for guiding both patch-level and epoch-level feature modeling.

Existing methods typically presuppose perfect priors or can only handle specific, pre-identified error types.

This decline arises because most of them rely on inflexible and biased thresholding strategies that may conflict with the data distribution. To overcome these limitations, we propose to harmonizes knowledge and data through prior alignment and conflict resolution. First, we assess the credibility of imperfect structural constraints through a surrogate model, which then guides a sparse penalization term measuring the loss between the learned and constrained adjacency matrices. We theoretically prove that, under ideal assumption, the knowledge-driven objective aligns with the data-driven objective. Furthermore, to resolve conflicts when this assumption is violated, we introduce a multi-task learning framework optimized via multi-gradient descent, jointly minimizing both objectives. Our proposed method is robust to both linear and nonlinear settings. Extensive experiments, conducted under diverse noise conditions and structural equation model types, demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our method under imperfect structural constraints."}

However, recent studies reveal that point cloud classifiers are vulnerable to structured adversarial perturbations and geometric corruptions, posing risks to their deployment in safety-critical scenarios. Existing certified defenses limit point-wise perturbations but overlook subtle geometric distortions that preserve individual points yet alter the overall structure, potentially leading to misclassification. In this work, we propose FreqCert, a novel certification framework that departs from conventional spatial domain defenses by shifting robustness analysis to the frequency domain, enabling structured certification against global L2-bounded perturbations. FreqCert first transforms the input point cloud via the graph Fourier transform (GFT), then applies structured frequency-aware subsampling to generate multiple sub-point clouds. Each sub-cloud is independently classified by a standard model, and the final prediction is obtained through majority voting, where sub-clouds are constructed based on spectral similarity rather than spatial proximity, making the partitioning more stable under L2 perturbations and better aligned with the object's intrinsic structure. We derive a closed-form lower bound on the certified L2 robustness radius and prove its tightness under minimal and interpretable assumptions, establishing a theoretical foundation for frequency domain certification. Extensive experiments on the ModelNet40 and ScanObjectNN datasets demonstrate that FreqCert consistently achieves higher certified accuracy and empirical accuracy under strong perturbations. Our results suggest that spectral representations provide an effective pathway toward certifiable robustness in 3D point cloud recognition."}

However, their broad knowledge capacity raises growing concerns about privacy leakage, toxicity mitigation, and intellectual property violations. Machine Unlearning (MU) offers a practical solution by selectively forgetting targeted knowledge while preserving overall model utility. When applied to MLLMs, existing neuron-editing-based MU approaches face two fundamental challenges: (1) forgetting becomes inconsistent across modalities because existing point-wise attribution methods fail to capture the structured, layer-by-layer information flow that connects different modalities; and (2) general knowledge performance declines when sensitive neurons that also support important reasoning paths are pruned, as this disrupts the model's ability to generalize. To alleviate these limitations, we propose a multimodal influential neuron path editor (MIP-Editor) for MU. Our approach introduces modality-specific attribution scores to identify influential neuron paths responsible for encoding forget-set knowledge and applies influential-path-aware neuron-editing via representation misdirection. This strategy also enables effective and coordinated forgetting across modalities while preserving the model's general capabilities. Experimental results demonstrate that MIP-Editor achieves a superior unlearning performance on multimodal tasks, with a maximum forgetting rate of 87.75% and up to 54.26% improvement in general knowledge retention. On textual tasks, MIP-Editor achieves up to 80.65% forgetting and preserves 77.9% of general performance. Codes are available at https://github.com/PreckLi/MIP-Editor."}

Conventional defense mechanisms struggle to address the evolving landscape of multifaceted attack patterns. Through systematic analysis of existing defenses, we identify that their unsatisfactory performance primarily originates from an entangled feature space, where adversarial attacks can be performed easily. To this end, we present 3D-ANC, a novel approach that capitalizes on the Neural Collapse (NC) mechanism to orchestrate discriminative feature learning. In particular, NC depicts where last-layer features and classifier weights jointly evolve into a simplex equiangular tight frame (ETF) arrangement, establishing maximally separable class prototypes. However, leveraging this advantage in 3D recognition confronts two substantial challenges: (1) prevalent class imbalance in point cloud datasets, and (2) complex geometric similarities between object categories. To tackle these obstacles, our solution combines an ETF-aligned classification module with an adaptive training framework consisting of representation-balanced learning (RBL) and dynamic feature direction loss (FDL). 3D-ANC seamlessly empowers existing models to develop disentangled feature spaces despite the complexity in 3D data distribution. Comprehensive evaluations state that 3D-ANC significantly improves the robustness of models with various structures on two datasets.

Unlike standard transformer architectures that operate in a purely feedforward manner during inference, FH-RL enables internal recurrence without external looping, allowing prior latent states to be dynamically re-entered into the ongoing computation stream. We conduct controlled experiments sweeping the reentry gain $γ$ and evaluate emergent internal dynamics using three novel metrics: the Information Reentry Ratio (IRR), Eigen-Spectrum Recursion Index (ESRI), and Representational Drift Periodicity (RDP). Results show that reentry quantity increases proportionally with~$γ$, while the learned feedback matrix $W_r$ remains bounded and becomes more structured at moderate gains. Critically, a stable reflective band emerges around $γ\\approx 0.10-0.20$, where internal feedback is maximally expressive yet spectrally stable: IRR rises smoothly, ESRI remains near zero, and RDP exhibits consistent low-frequency cycles. These findings provide quantitative evidence that reflective, thought-like internal processing can arise from a principled balance between feedback amplification and homeostatic regulation, linking modern fast-weight architectures to theories of cortical reentry and recursive cognition."}

This paper investigates a novel and practical adversarial threat scenario: attacking downstream models or MLLMs fine-tuned from open-source VFMs, without requiring access to the victim task, training data, model query, and architecture. In contrast to conventional transfer-based attacks that rely on task-aligned surrogate models, we demonstrate that adversarial vulnerabilities can be exploited directly from the VFMs. To this end, we propose the Transferable Video Attack (TVA), a temporal-aware adversarial attack method that leverages the temporal representation dynamics of VFMs to craft effective perturbations. TVA integrates a bidirectional contrastive learning mechanism to maximize the discrepancy between the clean and adversarial features, and introduces a temporal consistency loss that exploits motion cues to enhance the sequential impact of perturbations. TVA avoids the need to train expensive surrogate models or access to domain-specific data, thereby offering a more practical and efficient attack strategy. Extensive experiments across 24 video-related tasks demonstrate the efficacy of TVA against downstream models and MLLMs, revealing a previously underexplored security vulnerability in the deployment of video models."}

To address this, we propose CRDA (Curriculum Reinforcement-Learning Data Augmentation), a novel framework guiding detectors to progressively master multi-domain forgery features from simple to complex. CRDA synthesizes augmented samples via a configurable pool of forgery operations and dynamically generates adversarial samples tailored to the detector's current learning state. Central to our approach is integrating reinforcement learning (RL) and causal inference. An RL agent dynamically selects augmentation actions based on detector performance to efficiently explore the vast augmentation space, adapting to increasingly challenging forgeries. Simultaneously, the agent introduces action space variations to generate heterogeneous forgery patterns, guided by causal inference to mitigate spurious correlations-suppressing task-irrelevant biases and focusing on causally invariant features. This integration ensures robust generalization by decoupling synthetic augmentation patterns from the model's learned representations.

Yet, dense disparity supervision is nearly impossible due to anatomical constraints, typically limiting annotations to only a few image-level labels acquired before the endoscope enters deep body cavities. Teacher-Student Learning (TSL) offers a promising solution by leveraging a teacher trained on sparse labels to generate pseudo labels and associated confidence maps from abundant unlabeled surgical videos. However, existing TSL methods are confined to image-level supervision, providing only spatial confidence and lacking temporal consistency estimation. This absence of spatio-temporal reliability results in unstable disparity predictions and severe flickering artifacts across video frames. To overcome these challenges, we propose TiS-TSL, a novel time-switchable teacher-student learning framework for video stereo matching under minimal supervision. At its core is a unified model that operates in three distinct modes: Image-Prediction (IP), Forward Video-Prediction (FVP), and Backward Video-Prediction (BVP), enabling flexible temporal modeling within a single architecture. Enabled by this unified model, TiS-TSL adopts a two-stage learning strategy. The Image-to-Video (I2V) stage transfers sparse image-level knowledge to initialize temporal modeling. The subsequent Video-to-Video (V2V) stage refines temporal disparity predictions by comparing forward and backward predictions to calculate bidirectional spatio-temporal consistency. This consistency identifies unreliable regions across frames, filters noisy video-level pseudo labels, and enforces temporal coherence.

To fill this gap, we make the key observation that latent diffusion models (LDMs), though successful in other modalities, have not been effectively leveraged for radar-based 3D generation due to a lack of compatible representations and conditioning strategies. We introduce RaLD, a framework that bridges this gap by integrating scene-level frustum-based LiDAR autoencoding, order-invariant latent representations, and direct radar spectrum conditioning. These insights lead to a more compact and expressive generation process.

These fixed label names can be unavailable, unreliable at scale, or become less relevant due to in-distribution shifts after deployment. Towards truly unsupervised OOD detection, we utilize widely available text corpora for positive label mining, bypassing the need for positives. In this paper, we utilize widely available text corpora for positive label mining under a general concept mining paradigm. Within this framework, we propose ClusterMine, a novel positive label mining method. ClusterMine is the first method to achieve state-of-the-art OOD detection performance without access to positive labels. It extracts positive concepts from a large text corpus by combining visual-only sample consistency (via clustering) and zero-shot image-text consistency. Our experimental study reveals that ClusterMine is scalable across a plethora of CLIP models and achieves state-of-the-art robustness to covariate in-distribution shifts.

Current approaches, however, remain constrained by the scarcity of high-quality stimulus-brain response pairs and the inherent semantic mismatch between neural representations and visual content. Inspired by perceptual variability and co-adaptive strategy of the biological systems, we propose a novel self-supervised architecture, named NeuroBridge, which integrates Cognitive Prior Augmentation (CPA) with Shared Semantic Projector (SSP) to promote effective cross-modality alignment. Specifically, CPA simulates perceptual variability by applying asymmetric, modality-specific transformations to both EEG signals and images, enhancing semantic diversity. Unlike previous approaches, SSP establishes a bidirectional alignment process through a co-adaptive strategy, which mutually aligns features from two modalities into a shared semantic space for effective cross-modal learning. NeuroBridge surpasses previous state-of-the-art methods under both intra-subject and inter-subject settings. In the intra-subject scenario, it achieves the improvements of 12.3% in top-1 accuracy and 10.2% in top-5 accuracy, reaching 63.2% and 89.9% respectively on a 200-way zero-shot retrieval task.

Current popular strategies adopt multilayer perceptron (MLP) as the backbone, supplemented by additional modules to enhance the network ability to handle context information, which is a known limitation of MLPs. In contrast, we introduce a novel perspective for capturing correspondence context information without extra design modules. To this end, we design a two-view correspondence pruning network called LeCoT, which can naturally leverage global context information at different stages. Specifically, the core design of LeCoT is the Spatial-Channel Fusion Transformer block, a newly proposed component that efficiently utilizes both spatial and channel global context information among sparse correspondences. In addition, we integrate the proposed prediction block that utilizes correspondence features from intermediate stages to generate a probability set, which acts as guiding information for subsequent learning phases, allowing the network to more effectively capture robust global context information. Notably, this prediction block progressively refines the probability set, thereby mitigating the issue of information loss that is common in the traditional one. Extensive experiments prove that the proposed LeCoT outperforms state-of-the-art methods in correspondence pruning, relative pose estimation, homography estimation, visual localization, and $3$D~reconstruction tasks.

Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) presents a promising solution, achieving performance comparable to full fine-tuning by updating only a small number of adaptation weights per layer. Traditional PEFT methods typically rely on a single expert, where the adaptation weight is a low-rank matrix. However, for complex tasks, the data's inherent diversity poses a significant challenge for such models, as a single adaptation weight cannot adequately capture the features of all samples. To address this limitation, we explore how to integrate multiple small adaptation experts into a compact structure to defeat a large adapter. Specifically, we propose Tucker Adaptation (TuckA), a method with four key properties: (i) We use Tucker decomposition to create a compact 3D tensor where each slice naturally serves as an expert. The low-rank nature of this decomposition ensures that the number of parameters scales efficiently as more experts are added. (ii) We introduce a hierarchical strategy that organizes these experts into groups at different granularities, allowing the model to capture both local and global data patterns. (iii) We develop an efficient batch-level routing mechanism, which reduces the router's parameter size by a factor of $L$ compared to routing at every adapted layer (where $L$ is the number of adapted layers) (iv) We propose data-aware initialization to achieve loss-free expert load balancing based on theoretical analysis. Extensive experiments on benchmarks in natural language understanding, image classification, and mathematical reasoning speak to the efficacy of TuckA, offering a new and effective solution to the PEFT problem."}

These insights motivate DeepBooTS, a novel end-to-end dual-stream residual-decreasing boosting method that progressively reconstructs the intrinsic signal. In our design, each block of a deep model becomes an ensemble of learners with an auxiliary output branch forming a highway to the final prediction. The block-wise outputs correct the residuals of previous blocks, leading to a learning-driven decomposition of both inputs and targets. This method enhances versatility and interpretability while substantially improving robustness to concept drift.

However, current research tends to focus narrowly on single-object prompts with limited contextual diversity. In reality, each object or attribute within a prompt can contribute to bias. For example, the prompt \"an assistant wearing a pink hat\" may reflect female-inclined biases associated with a pink hat. The neglected joint effects of the semantic binding in the prompts cause significant failures in current debiasing approaches. This work initiates a preliminary investigation on how bias manifests under semantic binding, where contextual associations between objects and attributes influence generative outcomes. We demonstrate that the underlying bias distribution can be amplified based on these associations. Therefore, we introduce a bias adherence score that quantifies how specific object-attribute bindings activate bias. To delve deeper, we develop a training-free context-bias control framework to explore how token decoupling can facilitate the debiasing of semantic bindings. This framework achieves over 10% debiasing improvement in compositional generation tasks. Our analysis of bias scores across various attribute-object bindings and token decorrelation highlights a fundamental challenge: reducing bias without disrupting essential semantic relationships. These findings expose critical limitations in current debiasing approaches when applied to semantically bound contexts, underscoring the need to reassess prevailing bias mitigation strategies."}

This fundamental weakness leads to noisy, unstable anomaly scores with a poor signal-to-noise ratio, hindering reliable detection. To address this, we propose Constrained Gaussian-Noise Optimization and Smoothing (COGNOS), a universal, model-agnostic enhancement framework that tackles this issue at its source. COGNOS introduces a novel Gaussian-White Noise Regularization strategy during training, which directly constrains the model's output residuals to conform to a Gaussian white noise distribution. This engineered statistical property creates the ideal precondition for our second contribution: a Kalman Smoothing Post-processor that provably operates as a statistically optimal estimator to denoise the raw anomaly scores. The synergy between these two components allows COGNOS to robustly separate the true anomaly signal from random fluctuations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that COGNOS is highly effective, delivering an average F-score uplift of 57.9% when applied to 12 diverse backbone models across multiple real-world benchmark datasets. Our work reveals that directly regularizing output statistics is a powerful and generalizable strategy for significantly improving anomaly detection systems."}

However, generative modeling for HSIs presents several challenges. Due to their high spectral dimensionality, HSIs are too memory-intensive for direct input into conventional diffusion models. Furthermore, general generative models lack an understanding of the topological and geometric structures of ground objects in remote sensing imagery. In addition, most diffusion models optimize loss functions at the noise level, leading to a non-intuitive convergence behavior and suboptimal generation quality for complex data. To address these challenges, we propose a Geometric Enhanced Wavelet-based Diffusion Model (GEWDiff), a novel framework for reconstructing hyperspectral images at 4-times super-resolution. A wavelet-based encoder-decoder is introduced that efficiently compresses HSIs into a latent space while preserving spectral-spatial information. To avoid distortion during generation, we incorporate a geometry-enhanced diffusion process that preserves the geometric features. Furthermore, a multi-level loss function was designed to guide the diffusion process, promoting stable convergence and improved reconstruction fidelity. Our model demonstrated state-of-the-art results across multiple dimensions, including fidelity, spectral accuracy, visual realism, and clarity."}

We rely on an information-theoretic metric, Policy Entropy, to measure policy uncertainty throughout training. Preliminary results show a clear epoch-wise DD curve; the policy's entrance into the second descent region correlates with a sustained, significant reduction in Policy Entropy. This entropic decay suggests that over-parameterization acts as an implicit regularizer, guiding the policy towards robust, flatter minima in the loss landscape. These findings establish DD as a factor in DRL and provide an information-based mechanism for designing agents that are more general, transferable, and robust."}

Moreover, different tasks favor distinct feature representations, making it difficult for a single model to perform end-to-end inference across multiple tasks while maintaining accuracy comparable to that of single-task models. To alleviate these issues, we present the HENet and HENet++ framework for multi-task 3D perception and end-to-end autonomous driving.

Furthermore, our framework simultaneously extracts both dense and sparse features, providing more suitable representations for different tasks, reducing cumulative errors, and delivering more comprehensive information to the planning module. The proposed architecture maintains compatibility with various existing 3D feature extraction methods and supports multimodal inputs.

Several methods have attempted to address this issue by assigning sampling weights to each data domain using heuristics or approximations. As a first step toward a deeper understanding of the role of data mixing, this work revisits the problem by studying two kinds of weights: sampling weights, which control how much each domain contributes in a batch, and loss weights, which scale the loss from each domain during training. Through a rigorous study of linear regression, we show that these two weights play complementary roles. First, they can reduce the variance of gradient estimates in iterative methods such as stochastic gradient descent (SGD). Second, they can improve generalization performance by reducing the generalization gap. We provide both theoretical and empirical support for these claims. We further study the joint dynamics of sampling weights and loss weights, examining how they can be combined to capture both contributions."}

This highlights the urgent need for continuously updating AI-generated image detectors to adapt to new generators. To overcome low efficiency and catastrophic forgetting in detector updates, we propose LiteUpdate, a lightweight framework for updating AI-generated image detectors. LiteUpdate employs a representative sample selection module that leverages image confidence and gradient-based discriminative features to precisely select boundary samples. This approach improves learning and detection accuracy on new distributions with limited generated images, significantly enhancing detector update efficiency. Additionally, LiteUpdate incorporates a model merging module that fuses weights from multiple fine-tuning trajectories, including pre-trained, representative, and random updates. This balances the adaptability to new generators and mitigates the catastrophic forgetting of prior knowledge. Experiments demonstrate that LiteUpdate substantially boosts detection performance in various detectors. Specifically, on AIDE, the average detection accuracy on Midjourney improved from 87.63% to 93.03%, a 6.16% relative increase."}

However, unlike natural language corpora, RL trajectories are sparse and reward-driven, making standard self-attention inefficient because it distributes weight uniformly across all past tokens rather than emphasizing the few transitions critical for control. To address this, we introduce structured inductive priors into the self-attention mechanism of the dynamics head: (i) per-head memory-length priors that constrain attention to task-specific windows, and (ii) distributional priors that learn smooth Gaussian weightings over past state-action pairs. We integrate these mechanisms into UniZero, a model-based RL agent with a Transformer-based world model that supports planning under partial observability. Experiments on the Atari 100k benchmark show that most efficiency gains arise from the Gaussian prior, which smoothly allocates attention to informative transitions, while memory-length priors often truncate useful signals with overly restrictive cut-offs. In particular, Gaussian Attention achieves a 77% relative improvement in mean human-normalized scores over UniZero. These findings suggest that in partially observable RL domains with non-stationary temporal dependencies, discrete memory windows are difficult to learn reliably, whereas smooth distributional priors flexibly adapt across horizons and yield more robust data efficiency. Overall, our results demonstrate that encoding structured temporal priors directly into self-attention improves the prioritization of informative histories for dynamics modeling under partial observability."}

However, such a CLIP-based metric is vulnerable for its delicate multimodal alignment. In this work, we propose \\textbf{FoCLIP}, a feature-space misalignment framework for fooling CLIP-based image quality metric. Based on the stochastic gradient descent technique, FoCLIP integrates three key components to construct fooling examples: feature alignment as the core module to reduce image-text modality gaps, the score distribution balance module and pixel-guard regularization, which collectively optimize multimodal output equilibrium between CLIPscore performance and image quality. Such a design can be engineered to maximize the CLIPscore predictions across diverse input prompts, despite exhibiting either visual unrecognizability or semantic incongruence with the corresponding adversarial prompts from human perceptual perspectives. Experiments on ten artistic masterpiece prompts and ImageNet subsets demonstrate that optimized images can achieve significant improvement in CLIPscore while preserving high visual fidelity. In addition, we found that grayscale conversion induces significant feature degradation in fooling images, exhibiting noticeable CLIPscore reduction while preserving statistical consistency with original images. Inspired by this phenomenon, we propose a color channel sensitivity-driven tampering detection mechanism that achieves 91% accuracy on standard benchmarks. In conclusion, this work establishes a practical pathway for feature misalignment in CLIP-based multimodal systems and the corresponding defense method."}

These limitations hinder their ability to capture the sharp, high-frequency signals that often define tabular structure, especially under limited labeled samples. While self-supervised learning (SSL) offers promise in such settings, it remains challenging in tabular domains due to the lack of effective data augmentations. We propose a hybrid autoencoder that combines a neural encoder with an oblivious soft decision tree (OSDT) encoder, each guided by its own stochastic gating network that performs sample-specific feature selection. Together, these structurally different encoders and model-specific gating networks implement model-based augmentation, producing complementary input views tailored to each architecture. The two encoders, trained with a shared decoder and cross-reconstruction loss, learn distinct yet aligned representations that reflect their respective inductive biases. During training, the OSDT encoder (robust to noise and effective at modeling localized, high-frequency structure) guides the neural encoder toward representations more aligned with tabular data. At inference, only the neural encoder is used, preserving flexibility and SSL compatibility. Spectral analysis highlights the distinct inductive biases of each encoder. Our method achieves consistent gains in low-label classification and regression across diverse tabular datasets, outperforming deep and tree-based supervised baselines."}

A critical flaw in existing methods is that the poison rate required for a successful attack induces a proportional, and thus noticeable, drop in Clean Accuracy (CA), undermining their stealthiness. This paper presents a new paradigm for clean-image attacks that minimizes this accuracy degradation by optimizing the trigger itself. We introduce Generative Clean-Image Backdoors (GCB), a framework that uses a conditional InfoGAN to identify naturally occurring image features that can serve as potent and stealthy triggers. By ensuring these triggers are easily separable from benign task-related features, GCB enables a victim model to learn the backdoor from an extremely small set of poisoned examples, resulting in a CA drop of less than 1%. Our experiments demonstrate GCB's remarkable versatility, successfully adapting to six datasets, five architectures, and four tasks, including the first demonstration of clean-image backdoors in regression and segmentation. GCB also exhibits resilience against most of the existing backdoor defenses."}

However, directly integrating protein sequences poses challenges due to the redundancy and noise in large-scale protein-ligand datasets. To address these limitations, we propose \\textbf{S$^2$Drug}, a two-stage framework that explicitly incorporates protein \\textbf{S}equence information and 3D \\textbf{S}tructure context in protein-ligand contrastive representation learning. In the first stage, we perform protein sequence pretraining on ChemBL using an ESM2-based backbone, combined with a tailored data sampling strategy to reduce redundancy and noise on both protein and ligand sides. In the second stage, we fine-tune on PDBBind by fusing sequence and structure information through a residue-level gating module, while introducing an auxiliary binding site prediction task. This auxiliary task guides the model to accurately localize binding residues within the protein sequence and capture their 3D spatial arrangement, thereby refining protein-ligand matching.

This study introduces a remote sensing-driven framework to quantify WASH accessibility-specifically to water pumps, latrines, and bathing cubicles-in the Rohingya camps of Cox's Bazar, one of the world's most densely populated displacement settings. Detecting refugee shelters in such emergent camps presents substantial challenges, primarily due to their dense spatial configuration and irregular geometric patterns. Using sub-meter satellite images, we develop a semi-supervised segmentation framework that achieves an F1-score of 76.4% in detecting individual refugee shelters. Applying the framework across multi-year data reveals declining WASH accessibility, driven by rapid refugee population growth and reduced facility availability, rising from 25 people per facility in 2022 to 29.4 in 2025. Gender-disaggregated analysis further shows that women and girls experience reduced accessibility, in scenarios with inadequate safety-related segregation in WASH facilities. These findings suggest the importance of demand-responsive allocation strategies that can identify areas with under-served populations-such as women and girls-and ensure that limited infrastructure serves the greatest number of people in settings with fixed or shrinking budgets.

While reminiscent of denoising autoencoders, our approach differs in two key aspects. First, instead of unstructured i.i.d.\\ noise, we apply structured, spatially coherent perturbations that make the task a hybrid of segmentation and inpainting. Second, and counterintuitively, we add and preserve Gaussian noise on top of the occlusions, which acts as a Tikhonov regularizer anchoring the Jacobian of the reconstruction function toward identity. This identity-anchored regularization stabilizes reconstruction and further improves both detection and segmentation accuracy.

However, current research tends to focus narrowly on single-object prompts with limited contextual diversity. In reality, each object or attribute within a prompt can contribute to bias. For example, the prompt \"an assistant wearing a pink hat\" may reflect female-inclined biases associated with a pink hat. The neglected joint effects of the semantic binding in the prompts cause significant failures in current debiasing approaches. This work initiates a preliminary investigation on how bias manifests under semantic binding, where contextual associations between objects and attributes influence generative outcomes. We demonstrate that the underlying bias distribution can be amplified based on these associations. Therefore, we introduce a bias adherence score that quantifies how specific object-attribute bindings activate bias. To delve deeper, we develop a training-free context-bias control framework to explore how token decoupling can facilitate the debiasing of semantic bindings. This framework achieves over 10% debiasing improvement in compositional generation tasks. Our analysis of bias scores across various attribute-object bindings and token decorrelation highlights a fundamental challenge: reducing bias without disrupting essential semantic relationships.

In addition, most diffusion models optimize loss functions at the noise level, leading to a non-intuitive convergence behavior and suboptimal generation quality for complex data. To address these challenges, we propose a Geometric Enhanced Wavelet-based Diffusion Model (GEWDiff), a novel framework for reconstructing hyperspectral images at 4-times super-resolution. A wavelet-based encoder-decoder is introduced that efficiently compresses HSIs into a latent space while preserving spectral-spatial information. To avoid distortion during generation, we incorporate a geometry-enhanced diffusion process that preserves the geometric features.

With latent variables drawn from a tractable probability density function that can be further constrained, these models enable continuous and semantically rich exploration of the output space by navigating their latent spaces. Structured latent representations are typically obtained through the joint minimization of regularization loss functions. In variational information bottleneck models, reconstruction loss and Kullback-Leibler Divergence (KLD) are often linearly combined with an auxiliary Attribute-Regularization (AR) loss. However, balancing KLD and AR turns out to be a very delicate matter. When KLD dominates over AR, generative models tend to lack controllability; when AR dominates over KLD, the stochastic encoder is encouraged to violate the standard normal prior. We explore this trade-off in the context of symbolic music generation with explicit control over continuous musical attributes. We show that existing approaches struggle to jointly minimize both regularization objectives, whereas suitable attribute transformations can help achieve both controllability and regularization of the target latent dimensions."}

However, current Video-LLMs still face challenges with long real-world videos. Recent methods have introduced a retrieval mechanism that retrieves query-relevant KV caches for question answering, enhancing the efficiency and accuracy of long real-world videos. However, the compression and retrieval of KV caches are still not fully explored. In this paper, we propose \\textbf{StreamKV}, a training-free framework that seamlessly equips Video-LLMs with advanced KV cache retrieval and compression. Compared to previous methods that used uniform partitioning, StreamKV dynamically partitions video streams into semantic segments, which better preserves semantic information. For KV cache retrieval, StreamKV calculates a summary vector for each segment to retain segment-level information essential for retrieval. For KV cache compression, StreamKV introduces a guidance prompt designed to capture the key semantic elements within each segment, ensuring only the most informative KV caches are retained for answering questions. Moreover, StreamKV unifies KV cache retrieval and compression within a single module, performing both in a layer-adaptive manner, thereby further improving the effectiveness of streaming video question answering. Extensive experiments on public StreamingVQA benchmarks demonstrate that StreamKV significantly outperforms existing Online Video-LLMs, achieving superior accuracy while substantially improving both memory efficiency and computational latency.

However, existing methodologies primarily rely on musical context or natural language as the main modality of interacting with the generative process, which may not be ideal for expert users who seek precise fader-like control over specific musical attributes. In this work, we explore the application of denoising diffusion processes as plug-and-play latent constraints for unconditional symbolic music generation models. We focus on a framework that leverages a library of small conditional diffusion models operating as implicit probabilistic priors on the latents of a frozen unconditional backbone. While previous studies have explored domain-specific use cases, this work, to the best of our knowledge, is the first to demonstrate the versatility of such an approach across a diverse array of musical attributes, such as note density, pitch range, contour, and rhythm complexity. Our experiments show that diffusion-driven constraints outperform traditional attribute regularization and other latent constraints architectures, achieving significantly stronger correlations between target and generated attributes while maintaining high perceptual quality and diversity."}

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is sensitive to acute ischemic stroke and is a common diagnostic method for stroke. However, manual lesion segmentation performed by experts is tedious, time-consuming, and prone to observer inconsistency. Automatic medical image analysis methods have been proposed to overcome this challenge. However, previous approaches have relied on hand-crafted features that may not capture the irregular and physiologically complex shapes of ischemic stroke lesions. In this study, we present a novel framework for quickly and automatically segmenting ischemic stroke lesions on various MRI sequences, including T1-weighted, T2-weighted, DWI, and FLAIR. The proposed methodology is validated on the ISLES 2015 Brain Stroke sequence dataset, where we trained our model using the Res-Unet architecture twice: first, with pre-existing weights, and then without, to explore the benefits of transfer learning. Evaluation metrics, including the Dice score and sensitivity, were computed across 3D volumes. Finally, a Majority Voting Classifier was integrated to amalgamate the outcomes from each axis, resulting in a comprehensive segmentation method. Our efforts culminated in achieving a Dice score of 80.5\\% and an accuracy of 74.03\\%, showcasing the efficacy of our segmentation approach."}

Traditional methods typically rely on logical labels, such as binary indicators (e.g., \"yes/no\") that specify whether an instance belongs to a given category. However, in practical applications, label annotations often involve significant uncertainty due to factors such as data noise, inherent ambiguity in the observed entities, and the subjectivity of human annotators. Therefore, representing labels using simplistic binary logic can obscure valuable information and limit the expressiveness of label learning models. To overcome this limitation, this paper introduces the concept of fuzzy labels, grounded in fuzzy set theory, to better capture and represent label uncertainty. We further propose an efficient fuzzy labeling method that mines and generates fuzzy labels from the original data, thereby enriching the label space with more informative and nuanced representations. Based on this foundation, we present fuzzy-label-enhanced algorithms for both single-label and multi-label learning, using the classical K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and multi-label KNN algorithms as illustrative examples. Experimental results indicate that fuzzy labels can more effectively characterize the real-world labeling information and significantly enhance the performance of label learning models."}

Specifically, VADER first applies an Anomaly Scorer to assign per-frame anomaly scores, followed by a Context-AwarE Sampling (CAES) strategy to capture the causal context of each anomalous event. A Relation Feature Extractor and a COntrastive Relation Encoder (CORE) jointly model dynamic object interactions, producing compact relational representations for downstream reasoning.

YoNoSplat predicts local Gaussians and camera poses for each view, which are aggregated into a global representation using either predicted or provided poses. To overcome the inherent difficulty of jointly learning 3D Gaussians and camera parameters, we introduce a novel mixing training strategy. This approach mitigates the entanglement between the two tasks by initially using ground-truth poses to aggregate local Gaussians and gradually transitioning to a mix of predicted and ground-truth poses, which prevents both training instability and exposure bias. We further resolve the scale ambiguity problem by a novel pairwise camera-distance normalization scheme and by embedding camera intrinsics into the network. Moreover, YoNoSplat also predicts intrinsic parameters, making it feasible for uncalibrated inputs.

In light of such data constraints, we explore an inference-time scaling approach using a domain-adapted CLIP-based verifier for enhanced infrared image generation quality. We adapt FLUX.1-dev, a state-of-the-art text-to-image diffusion model, to the infrared domain by finetuning it on a small sample of infrared images using parameter-efficient techniques. The trained verifier is then employed during inference to guide the diffusion sampling process toward higher quality infrared generations that better align with input text prompts. Empirically, we find that our approach leads to consistent improvements in generation quality, reducing FID scores on the KAIST Multispectral Pedestrian Detection Benchmark dataset by 10% compared to unguided baseline samples.

Previous image-based streaming diffusion models have powered efficient and creative live streaming products but have hit limits on temporal consistency due to the foundation of image-based designs. Recent advances in video diffusion have markedly improved temporal consistency and sampling efficiency for offline generation. However, offline generation systems primarily optimize throughput by batching large workloads. In contrast, live online streaming operates under strict service-level objectives (SLOs): time-to-first-frame must be minimal, and every frame must meet a per-frame deadline with low jitter. Besides, scalable multi-GPU serving for real-time streams remains largely unresolved so far. To address this, we present StreamDiffusionV2, a training-free pipeline for interactive live streaming with video diffusion models. StreamDiffusionV2 integrates an SLO-aware batching scheduler and a block scheduler, together with a sink-token--guided rolling KV cache, a motion-aware noise controller, and other system-level optimizations. Moreover, we introduce a scalable pipeline orchestration that parallelizes the diffusion process across denoising steps and network layers, achieving near-linear FPS scaling without violating latency guarantees. The system scales seamlessly across heterogeneous GPU environments and supports flexible denoising steps (e.g., 1--4), enabling both ultra-low-latency and higher-quality modes. Without TensorRT or quantization, StreamDiffusionV2 renders the first frame within 0.5s and attains 58.28 FPS with a 14B-parameter model and 64.52 FPS with a 1.3B-parameter model on four H100 GPUs, making state-of-the-art generative live streaming practical and accessible--from individual creators to enterprise-scale platforms."}

We then embed each motion into a latent vector and train a shared motion decoder to learn the distribution of motions represented by a structured and compact motion representation, i.e., neural key point trajectories.

While these expressive models do not yet match the peak performance of state-of-the-art Transformers, their potential has been largely untapped due to prohibitively slow training and low hardware utilization. Existing parallelization methods force a fundamental conflict governed by the chunksize hyperparameter: large chunks boost speed but degrade performance, necessitating a fixed, suboptimal compromise. To solve this challenge, we introduce TNT, a novel training paradigm that decouples training efficiency from inference performance through a two-stage process. Stage one is an efficiency-focused pre-training phase utilizing a hierarchical memory. A global module processes large, hardware-friendly chunks for long-range context, while multiple parallel local modules handle fine-grained details. Crucially, by periodically resetting local memory states, we break sequential dependencies to enable massive context parallelization. Stage two is a brief fine-tuning phase where only the local memory modules are adapted to a smaller, high-resolution chunksize, maximizing accuracy with minimal overhead. Evaluated on Titans and TTT models, TNT achieves a substantial acceleration in training speed-up to 17 times faster than the most accurate baseline configuration - while simultaneously improving model accuracy. This improvement removes a critical scalability barrier, establishing a practical foundation for developing expressive RNNs and facilitating future work to close the performance gap with Transformers."}

How we may create photorealistic and dynamic digital representations of ORs that capture relevant spatial, visual, and behavioral complexity remains unclear. We introduce TwinOR, a framework for constructing photorealistic, dynamic digital twins of ORs for embodied AI research. The system reconstructs static geometry from pre-scan videos and continuously models human and equipment motion through multi-view perception of OR activities. The static and dynamic components are fused into an immersive 3D environment that supports controllable simulation and embodied exploration. The proposed framework reconstructs complete OR geometry with centimeter level accuracy while preserving dynamic interaction across surgical workflows, enabling realistic renderings and a virtual playground for embodied AI systems. In our experiments, TwinOR simulates stereo and monocular sensor streams for geometry understanding and visual localization tasks. Models such as FoundationStereo and ORB-SLAM3 on TwinOR-synthesized data achieve performance within their reported accuracy on real indoor datasets, demonstrating that TwinOR provides sensor-level realism sufficient for perception and localization challenges.

Yet, developing downstream vision models for infrared applications is hindered by the scarcity of high-quality annotated data, due to the specialized expertise required for infrared annotation. While synthetic infrared image generation has the potential to accelerate model development by providing large-scale, diverse training data, training foundation-level generative diffusion models in the infrared domain has remained elusive due to limited datasets. In light of such data constraints, we explore an inference-time scaling approach using a domain-adapted CLIP-based verifier for enhanced infrared image generation quality. We adapt FLUX.1-dev, a state-of-the-art text-to-image diffusion model, to the infrared domain by finetuning it on a small sample of infrared images using parameter-efficient techniques. The trained verifier is then employed during inference to guide the diffusion sampling process toward higher quality infrared generations that better align with input text prompts. Empirically, we find that our approach leads to consistent improvements in generation quality, reducing FID scores on the KAIST Multispectral Pedestrian Detection Benchmark dataset by 10% compared to unguided baseline samples.

Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO) addresses this by optimizing for the worst-case risk within a neighborhood of the training distribution. However, conventional methods depend on a single, global robustness budget, which can lead to overly conservative models or a misallocation of robustness. We propose a variance-driven, adaptive, sample-level DRO (Var-DRO) framework that automatically identifies high-risk training samples and assigns a personalized robustness budget to each based on its online loss variance. Our formulation employs two-sided, KL-divergence-style bounds to constrain the ratio between adversarial and empirical weights for every sample. This results in a linear inner maximization problem over a convex polytope, which admits an efficient water-filling solution. To stabilize training, we introduce a warmup phase and a linear ramp schedule for the global cap on per-sample budgets, complemented by label smoothing for numerical robustness. Evaluated on CIFAR-10-C (corruptions), our method achieves the highest overall mean accuracy compared to ERM and KL-DRO. On Waterbirds, Var-DRO improves overall performance while matching or surpassing KL-DRO. On the original CIFAR-10 dataset, Var-DRO remains competitive, exhibiting the modest trade-off anticipated when prioritizing robustness. The proposed framework is unsupervised (requiring no group labels), straightforward to implement, theoretically sound, and computationally efficient."}

In this work, we extend self-evaluation techniques to multi-step tasks, testing two intuitive approaches: holistic scoring and step-by-step scoring. Using two multi-step benchmark datasets, we show that stepwise evaluation generally outperforms holistic scoring in detecting potential errors, with up to 15% relative increase in AUC-ROC.

While recent work highlights the role of exploration and entropy stability in improving pass@K, empirical evidence points to a paradox: RLVR and ORM/PRM typically reinforce existing tree-like reasoning paths rather than expanding the reasoning scope, raising the question of why exploration helps at all if no new patterns emerge.\n  To reconcile this paradox, we adopt the perspective of Kim et al. (2025), viewing easy (e.g., simplifying a fraction) versus hard (e.g., discovering a symmetry) reasoning steps as low- versus high-probability Markov transitions, and formalize post-training dynamics through Multi-task Tree-structured Markov Chains (TMC). In this tractable model, pretraining corresponds to tree expansion, while post-training corresponds to chain-of-thought reweighting. We show that several phenomena recently observed in empirical studies arise naturally in this setting: (1) RLVR induces a squeezing effect, reducing reasoning entropy and forgetting some correct paths; (2) population rewards of ORM/PRM encourage consistency rather than accuracy, thereby favoring common patterns; and (3) certain rare, high-uncertainty reasoning paths by the base model are responsible for solving hard problem instances.\n  Together, these explain why exploration -- even when confined to the base model's reasoning scope -- remains essential: it preserves access to rare but crucial reasoning traces needed for difficult cases, which are squeezed out by RLVR or unfavored by inference scaling. Building on this, we further show that exploration strategies such as rejecting easy instances and KL regularization help preserve rare reasoning traces. Empirical simulations corroborate our theoretical results."}

In this paper, we propose MARAuder's Map, a novel framework for real-time activity recognition from raw, unsegmented sensor streams. Our method projects sensor activations onto the physical floorplan to generate trajectory-aware, image-like sequences that capture the spatial flow of human movement. These representations are processed by a hybrid deep learning model that jointly captures spatial structure and temporal dependencies. To enhance temporal awareness, we introduce a learnable time embedding module that encodes contextual cues such as hour-of-day and day-of-week. Additionally, an attention-based encoder selectively focuses on informative segments within each observation window, enabling accurate recognition even under cross-activity transitions and temporal ambiguity. Extensive experiments on multiple real-world smart home datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms strong baselines, offering a practical solution for real-time HAR in ambient sensor environments."}

Through an analysis of error propagation across diffusion timesteps, we reveal that these approximation errors can accumulate exponentially, severely impairing output quality. Motivated by this insight, we propose Iterative Error Correction (IEC), a novel test-time method that mitigates inference-time errors by iteratively refining the model's output. IEC is theoretically proven to reduce error propagation from exponential to linear growth, without requiring any retraining or architectural changes. IEC can seamlessly integrate into the inference process of existing diffusion models, enabling a flexible trade-off between performance and efficiency. Extensive experiments show that IEC consistently improves generation quality across various datasets, efficiency techniques, and model architectures, establishing it as a practical and generalizable solution for test-time enhancement of efficient diffusion models."}

We mathematically prove how the algebraic structure of state-tracking problems governs the degree of extrapolation of the learned CoT. Specifically, our theory characterizes the length generalization of transformers through the mechanism of attention concentration, linking the retrieval robustness of the attention layer to the state-tracking task structure of long-context reasoning. Moreover, for transformers with limited reasoning length, we prove that a recursive self-training scheme can progressively extend the range of solvable problem lengths. To our knowledge, we provide the first optimization guarantee that constant-depth transformers provably learn $\\mathsf{NC}^1$-complete problems with CoT, significantly going beyond prior art confined in $\\mathsf{TC}^0$, unless the widely held conjecture $\\mathsf{TC}^0 \\neq \\mathsf{NC}^1$ fails.

To harness enhanced performance gain with respect to model complexity, we propose a novel neural network pruning approach utilizing Hessian-vector products that approximate crucial curvature information in the loss function, which significantly reduces the computation demands. By employing a power iteration method, our algorithm effectively identifies and preserves the essential information, ensuring a balanced trade-off between model accuracy and computational efficiency.

Our novel pose tracking approach termed ArtReg (stands for Articulated Registration) integrates visuo-tactile point clouds in an unscented Kalman Filter formulation in the SE(3) Lie Group for point cloud registration. ArtReg is used to detect possible articulated joints in objects using purposeful manipulation maneuvers such as pushing or hold-pulling with a two-robot team. Furthermore, we leverage ArtReg to develop a closed-loop controller for goal-driven manipulation of articulated objects to move the object into the desired pose configuration. We have extensively evaluated our approach on various types of unknown objects through real robot experiments. We also demonstrate the robustness of our method by evaluating objects with varying center of mass, low-light conditions, and with challenging visual backgrounds. Furthermore, we benchmarked our approach on a standard dataset of articulated objects and demonstrated improved performance in terms of pose accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods. Our experiments indicate that robust and accurate pose tracking leveraging visuo-tactile information enables robots to perceive and interact with unseen complex articulated objects (with revolute or prismatic joints)."}

Accepted at NeurIPS 2025 Workshops on SPACE in Vision, Language, and Embodied AI (SpaVLE), Embodied World Models for Decision Making (EWM), Aligning Reinforcement Learning Experimentalists and Theorists (ARLET), and Scaling Environments for Agents (SEA)", "summary": "Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in vision-language tasks, but they continue to struggle with spatial understanding. Existing spatial MLLMs often rely on explicit 3D inputs or architecture-specific modifications, and remain constrained by large-scale datasets or sparse supervision. To address these limitations, we introduce SpatialThinker, a 3D-aware MLLM trained with RL to integrate structured spatial grounding with multi-step reasoning. The model simulates human-like spatial perception by constructing a scene graph of task-relevant objects and spatial relations, and reasoning towards an answer via dense spatial rewards. SpatialThinker consists of two key contributions: (1) a data synthesis pipeline that generates STVQA-7K, a high-quality spatial VQA dataset, and (2) online RL with a multi-objective dense spatial reward enforcing spatial grounding. SpatialThinker-7B outperforms supervised fine-tuning and the sparse RL baseline on spatial understanding and real-world VQA benchmarks, nearly doubling the base-model gain compared to sparse RL, and surpassing GPT-4o. These results showcase the effectiveness of combining spatial supervision with reward-aligned reasoning in enabling robust 3D spatial understanding with limited data and advancing MLLMs towards human-level visual reasoning."}

Detecting and mitigating hallucinations is challenging when ground-truth references are unavailable and model internals are inaccessible. This paper proposes a novel self-contained low-rank approach to automatically rank multiple candidate captions generated by multiple VLMs based on their hallucination levels, using only the captions themselves without requiring external references or model access. By constructing a sentence-embedding matrix and decomposing it into a low-rank consensus component and a sparse residual, we use the residual magnitude to rank captions: selecting the one with the smallest residual as the most hallucination-free. Experiments on the NuScenes dataset demonstrate that our approach achieves 87% selection accuracy in identifying hallucination-free captions, representing a 19% improvement over the unfiltered baseline and a 6-10% improvement over multi-agent debate method. The sorting produced by sparse error magnitudes shows strong correlation with human judgments of hallucinations, validating our scoring mechanism. Additionally, our method, which can be easily parallelized, reduces inference time by 51-67% compared to debate approaches, making it practical for real-time autonomous driving applications."}

Yet, how to effectively use these models for closed-loop symbolic planning remains largely unexplored. Because they operate as black boxes, LLMs and VLMs can produce unpredictable or costly errors, making their use in high-level robotic planning especially challenging. In this work, we investigate how to use VLMs as closed-loop symbolic planners for robotic applications from a control-theoretic perspective. Concretely, we study how the control horizon and warm-starting impact the performance of VLM symbolic planners. We design and conduct controlled experiments to gain insights that are broadly applicable to utilizing VLMs as closed-loop symbolic planners, and we discuss recommendations that can help improve the performance of VLM symbolic planners."}

Accepted by IROS 2025", "summary": "Efficient, accurate, and flexible relative localization is crucial in air-ground collaborative tasks. However, current approaches for robot relative localization are primarily realized in the form of distributed multi-robot SLAM systems with the same sensor configuration, which are tightly coupled with the state estimation of all robots, limiting both flexibility and accuracy. To this end, we fully leverage the high capacity of Unmanned Ground Vehicle (UGV) to integrate multiple sensors, enabling a semi-distributed cross-modal air-ground relative localization framework. In this work, both the UGV and the Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) independently perform SLAM while extracting deep learning-based keypoints and global descriptors, which decouples the relative localization from the state estimation of all agents. The UGV employs a local Bundle Adjustment (BA) with LiDAR, camera, and an IMU to rapidly obtain accurate relative pose estimates. The BA process adopts sparse keypoint optimization and is divided into two stages: First, optimizing camera poses interpolated from LiDAR-Inertial Odometry (LIO), followed by estimating the relative camera poses between the UGV and UAV. Additionally, we implement an incremental loop closure detection algorithm using deep learning-based descriptors to maintain and retrieve keyframes efficiently. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves outstanding performance in both accuracy and efficiency. Unlike traditional multi-robot SLAM approaches that transmit images or point clouds, our method only transmits keypoint pixels and their descriptors, effectively constraining the communication bandwidth under 0.3 Mbps.

Most existing robotic multitask models rely on dense embeddings that entangle both object and background cues, raising concerns about both efficiency and interpretability. In contrast, we study object-relation-centric representations as a pathway to more structured, efficient, and explainable visuomotor control. Our contributions are two-fold. First, we introduce LIBERO+, a fine-grained benchmark dataset designed to enable and evaluate object-relation reasoning in robotic manipulation. Unlike prior datasets, LIBERO+ provides object-centric annotations that enrich demonstrations with box- and mask-level labels as well as instance-level temporal tracking, supporting compact and interpretable visuomotor representations. Second, we propose SlotVLA, a slot-attention-based framework that captures both objects and their relations for action decoding. It uses a slot-based visual tokenizer to maintain consistent temporal object representations, a relation-centric decoder to produce task-relevant embeddings, and an LLM-driven module that translates these embeddings into executable actions. Experiments on LIBERO+ demonstrate that object-centric slot and object-relation slot representations drastically reduce the number of required visual tokens, while providing competitive generalization. Together, LIBERO+ and SlotVLA provide a compact, interpretable, and effective foundation for advancing object-relation-centric robotic manipulation."}

This has led to incremental improvements without a deep understanding of the current failures. While it is straightforward to look at situations where the model fails, it is hard to understand the underlying reason. This motivates us to conduct a systematic study, where inputs to the model are perturbed and the predictions observed. We introduce PlanT 2.0, a lightweight, object-centric planning transformer designed for autonomous driving research in CARLA. The object-level representation enables controlled analysis, as the input can be easily perturbed (e.g., by changing the location or adding or removing certain objects), in contrast to sensor-based models. To tackle the scenarios newly introduced by the challenging CARLA Leaderboard 2.0, we introduce multiple upgrades to PlanT, achieving state-of-the-art performance on Longest6 v2, Bench2Drive, and the CARLA validation routes. Our analysis exposes insightful failures, such as a lack of scene understanding caused by low obstacle diversity, rigid expert behaviors leading to exploitable shortcuts, and overfitting to a fixed set of expert trajectories. Based on these findings, we argue for a shift toward data-centric development, with a focus on richer, more robust, and less biased datasets. We open-source our code and model at https://github.com/autonomousvision/plant2."}
