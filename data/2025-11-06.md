### [1] [Cropland Mapping using Geospatial Embeddings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02923)
*Ivan Zvonkov,Gabriel Tseng,Inbal Becker-Reshef,Hannah Kerner*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Geospatial embeddings (Presto, AlphaEarth) can improve cropland mapping in Togo by simplifying workflows and achieving high-accuracy classification, aiding assessments of land-use change and climate impact.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate, up-to-date land cover maps are essential for understanding land-use change, a key driver of climate change; geospatial embeddings offer a potentially efficient, scalable approach that remains underexplored in real-world mapping.

Method: Produce cropland maps for Togo using geospatial embeddings from Presto and AlphaEarth and evaluate classification performance and workflow efficiency.

Result: Geospatial embeddings enable high-accuracy cropland classification and simplify workflows, supporting better assessments of land-use change and its climate impacts.

Conclusion: Geospatial embeddings are a valuable addition to cropland mapping workflows, offering accuracy and efficiency for monitoring land-use change and its climate consequences.

Abstract: Accurate and up-to-date land cover maps are essential for understanding land
use change, a key driver of climate change. Geospatial embeddings offer a more
efficient and accessible way to map landscape features, yet their use in
real-world mapping applications remains underexplored. In this work, we
evaluated the utility of geospatial embeddings for cropland mapping in Togo. We
produced cropland maps using embeddings from Presto and AlphaEarth. Our
findings show that geospatial embeddings can simplify workflows, achieve
high-accuracy cropland classification and ultimately support better assessments
of land use change and its climate impacts.

### [2] [Generative Hints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02933)
*Andy Dimnaku,Abdullah Yusuf Kavranoğlu,Yaser Abu-Mostafa*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Generative hints propose using a generative model to create unlabeled virtual examples and enforce known invariances (hints) across the entire input space, in a semi-supervised way, outperforming standard data augmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Data augmentation captures invariances only for transformations of labeled training data, leaving gaps in the whole input space. There is value in enforcing invariances across the input distribution using unlabeled data.

Method: Train a generative model on the training set to approximate the input distribution and produce unlabeled virtual examples. Train the target model with both the classification loss on labeled data and a hint objective on the virtual examples, effectively semi-supervised learning to enforce desired invariances.

Result: Generative hints consistently outperform standard data augmentation for the same property across datasets, architectures, and losses, with up to 1.78% absolute improvement in top-1 accuracy on fine-grained benchmarks (0.63% average) and about 1.286% average improvement on CheXpert X-ray data.

Conclusion: Enforcing invariances via unlabeled virtual examples and a hint objective yields robust, data-efficient improvements over traditional augmentation, generalizing across tasks and architectures.

Abstract: Data augmentation is widely used in vision to introduce variation and
mitigate overfitting, through enabling models to learn invariant properties,
such as spatial invariance. However, these properties are not fully captured by
data augmentation alone, since it attempts to learn the property on
transformations of the training data only. We propose generative hints, a
training methodology that directly enforces known invariances in the entire
input space. Our approach leverages a generative model trained on the training
set to approximate the input distribution and generate unlabeled images, which
we refer to as virtual examples. These virtual examples are used to enforce
functional properties known as hints. In generative hints, although the
training dataset is fully labeled, the model is trained in a semi-supervised
manner on both the classification and hint objectives, using the unlabeled
virtual examples to guide the model in learning the desired hint. Across
datasets, architectures, and loss functions, generative hints consistently
outperform standard data augmentation when learning the same property. On
popular fine-grained visual classification benchmarks, we achieved up to 1.78%
top-1 accuracy improvement (0.63% on average) over fine-tuned models with data
augmentation and an average performance boost of 1.286% on the CheXpert X-ray
dataset.

### [3] [ProM3E: Probabilistic Masked MultiModal Embedding Model for Ecology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02946)
*Srikumar Sastry,Subash Khanal,Aayush Dhakal,Jiayu Lin,Dan Cher,Phoenix Jarosz,Nathan Jacobs*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ProM3E is a probabilistic masked multimodal embedding model for any-to-any generation in ecology, enabling missing-modality inference, embedding-space modality inversion, and improved cross-modal retrieval with strong representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ecology data are inherently multimodal and often incomplete. A probabilistic, flexible framework that can infer missing modalities, decide what to fuse, and support robust retrieval is valuable for ecological analysis and representation learning.

Method: The model performs masked modality reconstruction in embedding space to infer missing modalities from a few context modalities. It supports inference of modality inversion in the embedding space, analyzes fusion feasibility via its probabilistic nature, and uses these features to propose a cross-modal retrieval strategy that blends inter- and intra-modal similarities. Hidden representations are also leveraged for linear probing to assess representation quality.

Result: ProM3E achieves superior performance across retrieval tasks and demonstrates enhanced representation learning capabilities. The authors also announce code and data release for reproducibility.

Conclusion: ProM3E provides a flexible, end-to-end probabilistic framework for ecology multimodal learning that enables any-to-any generation, modality inference, fusion analysis, and improved retrieval and representations.

Abstract: We introduce ProM3E, a probabilistic masked multimodal embedding model for
any-to-any generation of multimodal representations for ecology. ProM3E is
based on masked modality reconstruction in the embedding space, learning to
infer missing modalities given a few context modalities. By design, our model
supports modality inversion in the embedding space. The probabilistic nature of
our model allows us to analyse the feasibility of fusing various modalities for
given downstream tasks, essentially learning what to fuse. Using these features
of our model, we propose a novel cross-modal retrieval approach that mixes
inter-modal and intra-modal similarities to achieve superior performance across
all retrieval tasks. We further leverage the hidden representation from our
model to perform linear probing tasks and demonstrate the superior
representation learning capability of our model. All our code, datasets and
model will be released at https://vishu26.github.io/prom3e.

### [4] [EvtSlowTV -- A Large and Diverse Dataset for Event-Based Depth Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02953)
*Sadiq Layi Macaulay,Nimet Kaygusuz,Simon Hadfield*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Large-scale YouTube-derived 13B-event dataset (EvtSlowTV) for self-supervised event-based depth learning, improving generalization without frame-based annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Small annotated event datasets limit real-world generalization; a large, naturalistic HDR data source is needed to exploit the asynchronous, HDR benefits of event cameras.

Method: Curate EvtSlowTV from publicly available YouTube footage across diverse conditions; use a self-supervised learning framework on raw event streams, preserving asynchronous data and avoiding frame-based annotations.

Result: EvtSlowTV is an order of magnitude larger than existing datasets; training with it improves generalization to complex scenes and motions in depth estimation; demonstrates suitability of self-supervised learning with HDR event data.

Conclusion: EvtSlowTV enables scalable, naturalistic HDR-aware event-based depth learning without frame-based labels, bridging the gap to real-world deployment.

Abstract: Event cameras, with their high dynamic range (HDR) and low latency, offer a
promising alternative for robust depth estimation in challenging environments.
However, many event-based depth estimation approaches are constrained by
small-scale annotated datasets, limiting their generalizability to real-world
scenarios. To bridge this gap, we introduce EvtSlowTV, a large-scale event
camera dataset curated from publicly available YouTube footage, which contains
more than 13B events across various environmental conditions and motions,
including seasonal hiking, flying, scenic driving, and underwater exploration.
EvtSlowTV is an order of magnitude larger than existing event datasets,
providing an unconstrained, naturalistic setting for event-based depth
learning. This work shows the suitability of EvtSlowTV for a self-supervised
learning framework to capitalise on the HDR potential of raw event streams. We
further demonstrate that training with EvtSlowTV enhances the model's ability
to generalise to complex scenes and motions. Our approach removes the need for
frame-based annotations and preserves the asynchronous nature of event data.

### [5] [Hybrid Convolution and Vision Transformer NAS Search Space for TinyML Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02992)
*Mikhael Djajapermana,Moritz Reiber,Daniel Mueller-Gritschneder,Ulf Schlichtmann*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduces a CNN-ViT hybrid NAS search space with a novel pooling block to yield efficient, accurate tinyML architectures; CIFAR-10 results beat ResNet-based tinyML under same size constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hybrid CNN-ViT models can outperform pure CNN or ViT but are computationally heavy. The paper aims to design a search space tailored for tinyML to learn compact hybrids that capture local and global information while reducing feature map size.

Method: Design a searchable NAS space that includes hybrid CNN-ViT blocks to capture local/global information and a Pooling block with searchable pooling layers for efficient reduction. Use NAS to discover architectures and evaluate on CIFAR-10, comparing against ResNet-based tinyML baselines under tight model size constraints.

Result: The proposed search space yields hybrid CNN-ViT architectures that achieve superior accuracy and faster inference than ResNet-based tinyML models when constrained by small model sizes on CIFAR-10.

Conclusion: The CNN-ViT hybrid NAS search space proves effective for discovering compact, efficient architectures suitable for tinyML, with the Pooling block contributing to feature-map efficiency and overall gains in accuracy and speed.

Abstract: Hybrids of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Vision Transformer (ViT)
have outperformed pure CNN or ViT architecture. However, since these
architectures require large parameters and incur large computational costs,
they are unsuitable for tinyML deployment. This paper introduces a new hybrid
CNN-ViT search space for Neural Architecture Search (NAS) to find efficient
hybrid architectures for image classification. The search space covers hybrid
CNN and ViT blocks to learn local and global information, as well as the novel
Pooling block of searchable pooling layers for efficient feature map reduction.
Experimental results on the CIFAR10 dataset show that our proposed search space
can produce hybrid CNN-ViT architectures with superior accuracy and inference
speed to ResNet-based tinyML models under tight model size constraints.

### [6] [SCALE-VLP: Soft-Weighted Contrastive Volumetric Vision-Language Pre-training with Spatial-Knowledge Semantics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02996)
*Ailar Mahdizadeh,Puria Azadi Moghadam,Xiangteng He,Shahriar Mirabbasi,Panos Nasiopoulos,Leonid Sigal*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SCALE-VLP is a soft-weighted vision-language pre-training framework for CT data that preserves volumetric anatomy and leverages radiology knowledge to enable better cross-task and cross-domain generalization with limited supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLM work on medical data treats volumes as independent 2D slices and relies on binary supervision, which loses spatial structure and domain semantics. There is a need to exploit volumetric semantics and radiological knowledge to improve alignment and generalization across tasks and domains.

Method: Introduce SCALE-VLP, a soft-weighted contrastive pre-training framework that (1) encodes volumetric spatial semantics to maintain anatomical structure, and (2) injects domain-aware, knowledge-infused semantics (e.g., radiological ontologies) to guide vision-language alignment. The model is evaluated on retrieval, report generation, and classification, with strong cross-task transfer and zero-shot cross-domain ability.

Result: SCALE-VLP achieves up to 4.3x higher top-1 CT-report retrieval, improves abnormality classification by 10 points, and reaches ROUGE-L 0.44 and BERT-F1 0.89 for report generation. It also shows consistent gains in zero-shot, out-of-domain datasets, indicating robust cross-task and cross-domain generalization without further fine-tuning.

Conclusion: By integrating volumetric spatial semantics and domain knowledge into a soft-weighted contrastive pre-training framework, SCALE-VLP yields structurally consistent and semantically grounded CT representations that generalize across tasks and domains under limited supervision.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong cross-modal
capabilities, yet most work remains limited to 2D data and assumes binary
supervision (i.e., positive vs. negative pairs), overlooking the continuous and
structured dependencies present in volumetric data such as CT. Existing
approaches often treat volumetric scans as independent 2D slices, compromising
spatial coherence and underutilizing rich clinical semantics. We propose
SCALE-VLP, a soft-weighted contrastive vision-language pre-training framework
that integrates (i) volumetric spatial semantics to preserve anatomical
structure and (ii) domain-aware, knowledge-infused semantics (e.g.,
radiological ontologies) to guide alignment. This yields structurally
consistent and semantically grounded representations under limited supervision,
demonstrating strong cross-task transferability (retrieval, report generation,
and classification), and cross-domain generalizability with consistent gains
without further fine-tuning. In particular, compared to the previous state of
the art, SCALE-VLP achieves up to 4.3x higher top-1 CT-report retrieval,
improves abnormality classification by 10 points, and reaches ROUGE-L 0.44 and
BERT-F1 0.89 for report generation. Further, in zero-shot evaluation on an
out-of-domain external dataset, we observe consistent gains, indicating the
cross-task and cross-domain generalization ability of SCALE-VLP.

### [7] [Learning with less: label-efficient land cover classification at very high spatial resolution using self-supervised deep learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03004)
*Dakota Hester,Vitor S. Martins,Lucas B. Ferreira,Thainara M. A. Lima*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Self-supervised pretraining with BYOL on unlabeled 1-m imagery enables high-accuracy 8-class land cover mapping with only 1,000 annotations, via transfer to multiple segmentation architectures and ensembling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Label scarcity and high costs of obtaining large-scale, high-resolution training data hinder widespread deployment of meter-scale land cover mapping; a label-efficient approach is needed.

Method: Pretrain a ResNet-101 encoder with Bootstrap Your Own Latent (BYOL) using 377,921 unlabeled 1-m color-infrared patches (256x256). Transfer pretrained weights to multiple segmentation models (FCN, U-Net, Attention U-Net, DeepLabV3+, UPerNet, PAN) and fine-tune on small labeled sets (250, 500, 750 patches) with cross-validation. Ensemble the best U-Net variants for final 1-m, 8-class mapping over >123 billion pixels in Mississippi.

Result: Achieved 87.14% overall accuracy and 75.58% macro F1 score on the test/validation setup. Demonstrated robust mapping of open water and forests; remaining challenges in distinguishing cropland, herbaceous, and barren land.

Conclusion: Self-supervised learning substantially reduces labeled-data requirements, enabling high-resolution land cover mapping at scale across large areas.

Abstract: Deep learning semantic segmentation methods have shown promising performance
for very high 1-m resolution land cover classification, but the challenge of
collecting large volumes of representative training data creates a significant
barrier to widespread adoption of such models for meter-scale land cover
mapping over large areas. In this study, we present a novel label-efficient
approach for statewide 1-m land cover classification using only 1,000 annotated
reference image patches with self-supervised deep learning. We use the
"Bootstrap Your Own Latent" pre-training strategy with a large amount of
unlabeled color-infrared aerial images (377,921 256x256 1-m pixel patches) to
pre-train a ResNet-101 convolutional encoder. The learned encoder weights were
subsequently transferred into multiple deep semantic segmentation architectures
(FCN, U-Net, Attention U-Net, DeepLabV3+, UPerNet, PAN), which were then
fine-tuned using very small training dataset sizes with cross-validation (250,
500, 750 patches). Among the fine-tuned models, we obtained the 87.14% overall
accuracy and 75.58% macro F1 score using an ensemble of the best performing
U-Net models for comprehensive 1-m, 8-class land cover mapping, covering more
than 123 billion pixels over the state of Mississippi, USA. Detailed
qualitative and quantitative analysis revealed accurate mapping of open water
and forested areas, while highlighting challenges in accurate delineation
between cropland, herbaceous, and barren land cover types. These results show
that self-supervised learning is an effective strategy for reducing the need
for large volumes of manually annotated data, directly addressing a major
limitation to high spatial resolution land cover mapping at scale.

### [8] [A Foundation Model for Brain MRI with Dynamic Modality Integration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03014)
*Minh Sao Khue Luu,Bair N. Tuchinov*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A single, adaptable foundation model for brain MRI that handles multiple imaging sequences and missing modalities via a learnable modality embedding, conditional normalization, and masked autoencoding, trained self-supervised on ~60k multi-center MRIs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To eliminate the need for separate modality-specific models, enable robust analysis when sequences are missing or unseen, and improve representation diversity and stability across centers.

Method: One encoder with learnable modality embeddings; conditional layer normalization; masked autoencoder objective accounting for missing modalities; variance-covariance regularizer to stabilize features and boost diversity; self-supervised reconstruction and modality imputation; trained on ~60k multi-center MRIs; learnable modality embedding guides feature extraction; code and pretrained models available at the provided GitHub.

Result: Preliminary results indicate feasibility of the approach; detailed performance metrics are not provided yet; evaluation on brain tumor and multiple sclerosis segmentation and lesion classification is planned under various modality settings; code and pretrained models are available.

Conclusion: A unified foundation-model approach for multi-modal brain MRI that adapts to missing or unseen sequences and eliminates the need for modality-specific models; further, comprehensive validation across tasks, modalities, and centers is needed to establish effectiveness.

Abstract: We present a foundation model for brain MRI that can work with different
combinations of imaging sequences. The model uses one encoder with learnable
modality embeddings, conditional layer normalization, and a masked autoencoding
objective that accounts for missing modalities. A variance-covariance
regularizer is applied to stabilize feature learning and improve representation
diversity. This design removes the need for separate models for each modality
and allows the network to adapt when some sequences are missing or unseen. It
is trained on about 60,000 multi-center MRIs using self-supervised
reconstruction and modality imputation to learn flexible representations. A
learnable modality embedding guides feature extraction so the encoder can
adjust to different inputs. We describe our planned evaluation on brain tumor
and multiple sclerosis segmentation, as well as lesion classification, under
various modality settings. Preliminary results show that the method works
feasibly, and further experiments are planned to study its performance in more
detail. All code and pretrained models are available at

### [9] [SLIP: Structural-aware Language-Image Pretraining for Vision-Language Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03019)
*Wenbo Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Structure-aware Vision-Language Pretraining (SLIP) adds relational supervision to standard VLP by combining a structural contrastive loss with graph-based neighbor relations, enabled by a new large multimodal co-purchase graph; it outperforms CLIP on zero/few-shot cross-modal tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard VLP treats image-text pairs as independent samples and ignores relational structures present in real domains (e.g., product co-purchase graphs). The idea draws on neuroscience about cognitive maps and relational knowledge.

Method: Introduce a structural contrastive loss to align image and text modalities while modeling relationships among neighboring entities in a structured graph. Build a large Amazon Product Co-purchase Multimodal Graph Dataset to enable structured cross-modality supervision at scale.

Result: SLIP consistently outperforms CLIP on cross-modal retrieval and classification in zero-shot and few-shot settings.

Conclusion: Incorporating relational supervision via structured graphs enhances cross-modal alignment and generalization; dataset enables scalable application of such supervision.

Abstract: Vision-Language Pretraining (VLP) has achieved remarkable success across
various downstream tasks, but such gains are largely driven by scaling up on
training data. Yet, literature methods treat image-text pairs as isolated
training examples; this neglects the rich relational structure naturally
present in many domains, such as e-commerce product co-purchase graphs and
social recommendation networks. Inspired by neuroscientific evidence that human
encodes knowledge as relationship cognitive maps, we introduce Structure-aware
Language-Image Pretraining (SLIP). SLIP integrates a structural contrastive
loss to align modalities while also modeling relationships between neighboring
entities in a structured graph. To support this paradigm, we construct a
large-scale Amazon Product Co-purchase Multimodal Graph Dataset, enabling
structured cross-modality supervision at scale. Experiment results show that
SLIP consistently outperforms CLIP on cross-modal retrieval and classification
tasks in both zero-shot and few-shot settings, showing the value of relational
supervision for cross-modal alignment.

### [10] [From Propagation to Prediction: Point-level Uncertainty Evaluation of MLS Point Clouds under Limited Ground Truth](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03053)
*Ziyang Xu,Olaf Wysocki,Christoph Holst*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A learning-based framework for MLS point clouds to estimate point-level uncertainty without ground truth (GT). It uses optimal neighborhood estimation and geometric features, and compares XGBoost to Random Forest, achieving comparable accuracy with ~3x speed-up, suggesting uncertainty is learnable.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ground-truth uncertainty evaluation in MLS is costly or infeasible in real-world applications. A data-driven approach could enable efficient uncertainty assessment to support high-precision tasks (Scan-to-BIM, deformation analysis, 3D modeling).

Method: Integrates optimal neighborhood estimation with geometric feature extraction on MLS data. Trains XGBoost and compares to Random Forest for predicting point-level uncertainty quantified by the C2C distance. Real-world MLS dataset used to assess feasibility and efficiency.

Result: XGBoost achieved fully comparable accuracy to Random Forest while being about three times faster. The framework is feasible, and geometric features can predict point-level uncertainty as measured by C2C distance, providing initial evidence for a learnable uncertainty in MLS point clouds.

Conclusion: MLS point cloud uncertainty is learnable. The study introduces a novel learning-based approach for uncertainty evaluation that reduces reliance on costly GT and offers a path toward efficient, data-driven uncertainty assessment.

Abstract: Evaluating uncertainty is critical for reliable use of Mobile Laser Scanning
(MLS) point clouds in many high-precision applications such as Scan-to-BIM,
deformation analysis, and 3D modeling. However, obtaining the ground truth (GT)
for evaluation is often costly and infeasible in many real-world applications.
To reduce this long-standing reliance on GT in uncertainty evaluation research,
this study presents a learning-based framework for MLS point clouds that
integrates optimal neighborhood estimation with geometric feature extraction.
Experiments on a real-world dataset show that the proposed framework is
feasible and the XGBoost model delivers fully comparable accuracy to Random
Forest while achieving substantially higher efficiency (about 3 times faster),
providing initial evidence that geometric features can be used to predict
point-level uncertainty quantified by the C2C distance. In summary, this study
shows that MLS point clouds' uncertainty is learnable, offering a novel
learning-based viewpoint towards uncertainty evaluation research.

### [11] [A Plug-and-Play Framework for Volumetric Light-Sheet Image Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03093)
*Yi Gong,Xinyuan Zhang,Jichen Chai,Yichen Ding,Yifei Lou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A high-performance CS-LSM framework for fast, low-phototoxic 3D cardiac imaging, using DMD-based compressed acquisition and Plug-and-Play ADMM with flexible denoisers, plus temporal z-slice regularization; demonstrates robust reconstruction under high compression in zebrafish hearts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome the trade-off between spatial and temporal resolution in live cardiac imaging under low-light conditions, enabling fast, 3D imaging with reduced phototoxicity.

Method: Combine light-sheet microscopy with compressive sensing; perform random binary mask coding via a DMD to acquire compressed fluorescence; use Plug-and-Play ADMM with denoisers (Tikhonov, TV, BM3D); add temporal regularization to enforce smoothness across adjacent z-slices; validate on zebrafish heart imaging under high compression.

Result: Reconstruction preserves cellular structures with high denoising and image clarity; robustness under high compression; validated in real-world high-speed, low-light imaging.

Conclusion: The framework is effective and robust for fast, low-phototoxic 3D cardiac imaging, offering adaptable denoising and temporal regularization to maintain structural fidelity under compression.

Abstract: Cardiac contraction is a rapid, coordinated process that unfolds across
three-dimensional tissue on millisecond timescales. Traditional optical imaging
is often inadequate for capturing dynamic cellular structure in the beating
heart because of a fundamental trade-off between spatial and temporal
resolution. To overcome these limitations, we propose a high-performance
computational imaging framework that integrates Compressive Sensing (CS) with
Light-Sheet Microscopy (LSM) for efficient, low-phototoxic cardiac imaging. The
system performs compressed acquisition of fluorescence signals via random
binary mask coding using a Digital Micromirror Device (DMD). We propose a
Plug-and-Play (PnP) framework, solved using the alternating direction method of
multipliers (ADMM), which flexibly incorporates advanced denoisers, including
Tikhonov, Total Variation (TV), and BM3D. To preserve structural continuity in
dynamic imaging, we further introduce temporal regularization enforcing
smoothness between adjacent z-slices. Experimental results on zebrafish heart
imaging under high compression ratios demonstrate that the proposed method
successfully reconstructs cellular structures with excellent denoising
performance and image clarity, validating the effectiveness and robustness of
our algorithm in real-world high-speed, low-light biological imaging scenarios.

### [12] [ISC-Perception: A Hybrid Computer Vision Dataset for Object Detection in Novel Steel Assembly](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03098)
*Miftahur Rahman,Samuel Adebayo,Dorian A. Acevedo-Mejia,David Hester,Daniel McPolin,Karen Rafferty,Debra F. Laefer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ISC-Perception introduces a hybrid ISC dataset combining CAD renders, game-engine scenes, and limited real photos to enable automatic labeling of synthetic data for ISC component detection; it improves detector performance and reduces labeling effort.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bridge the data gap for construction robotics perception caused by the lack of dedicated ISC datasets and safety/privacy constraints on collecting real site imagery, enabling rapid detector development.

Method: Create ISC-Perception dataset with 10,000 images using procedurally rendered CAD content, photorealistic game-engine scenes, and a small set of real photos; automatically label the synthetic portion; quantify human effort (30.5 h vs 166.7 h); evaluate detectors trained on this data against baselines trained on synthetic-only or photorealistic-only data; test on a 1,200-frame bench. 

Result: Detectors trained on ISC-Perception achieve mAP@IoU 0.50 of 0.756, outperforming synthetic-only or photorealistic-only baselines; bench-test mAP@0.50/mAP@[0.50:0.95] of 0.943/0.823 on 1,200 frames; demonstrates substantial data-efficiency gains and reduced labeling effort.

Conclusion: ISC-Perception bridges the data gap for construction-robotics perception, enabling rapid development of custom ISC detectors, and is freely available for research and industrial use upon request.

Abstract: The Intermeshed Steel Connection (ISC) system, when paired with robotic
manipulators, can accelerate steel-frame assembly and improve worker safety by
eliminating manual assembly. Dependable perception is one of the initial stages
for ISC-aware robots. However, this is hampered by the absence of a dedicated
image corpus, as collecting photographs on active construction sites is
logistically difficult and raises safety and privacy concerns. In response, we
introduce ISC-Perception, the first hybrid dataset expressly designed for ISC
component detection. It blends procedurally rendered CAD images, game-engine
photorealistic scenes, and a limited, curated set of real photographs, enabling
fully automatic labelling of the synthetic portion. We explicitly account for
all human effort to produce the dataset, including simulation engine and scene
setup, asset preparation, post-processing scripts and quality checks; our total
human time to generate a 10,000-image dataset was 30.5,h versus 166.7,h for
manual labelling at 60,s per image (-81.7%). A manual pilot on a representative
image with five instances of ISC members took 60,s (maximum 80,s), anchoring
the manual baseline. Detectors trained on ISC-Perception achieved a mean
Average Precision at IoU 0.50 of 0.756, substantially surpassing models trained
on synthetic-only or photorealistic-only data. On a 1,200-frame bench test, we
report mAP@0.50/mAP@[0.50:0.95] of 0.943/0.823. By bridging the data gap for
construction-robotics perception, ISC-Perception facilitates rapid development
of custom object detectors and is freely available for research and industrial
use upon request.

### [13] [DentalSplat: Dental Occlusion Novel View Synthesis from Sparse Intra-Oral Photographs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03099)
*Yiyi Miao,Taoyu Wu,Tong Chen,Sihao Li,Ji Jiang,Youpeng Yang,Angelos Stefanidis,Limin Yu,Jionglong Su*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DentalSplat enables 3D reconstruction and novel view synthesis from three sparse orthodontic images using priors, scale-adaptive pruning, and optical-flow constraints to improve rendering fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Orthodontic telemedicine often has sparse viewpoints and unknown camera poses; there is a need for robust 3D reconstruction from limited data.

Method: Initialize point cloud via a prior-guided dense stereo model; apply scale-adaptive pruning to accelerate training and improve quality; incorporate optical flow constraints and gradient regularization in extremely sparse cases.

Result: On a dataset of 950 clinical cases and 195 video scenarios, DentalSplat achieves superior novel view synthesis quality for dental occlusion visualization and outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: DentalSplat effectively handles sparse input scenarios, improving 3D reconstruction fidelity for orthodontic visualization and enabling practical remote assessment.

Abstract: In orthodontic treatment, particularly within telemedicine contexts,
observing patients' dental occlusion from multiple viewpoints facilitates
timely clinical decision-making. Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting
(3DGS) have shown strong potential in 3D reconstruction and novel view
synthesis. However, conventional 3DGS pipelines typically rely on densely
captured multi-view inputs and precisely initialized camera poses, limiting
their practicality. Orthodontic cases, in contrast, often comprise only three
sparse images, specifically, the anterior view and bilateral buccal views,
rendering the reconstruction task especially challenging. The extreme sparsity
of input views severely degrades reconstruction quality, while the absence of
camera pose information further complicates the process. To overcome these
limitations, we propose DentalSplat, an effective framework for 3D
reconstruction from sparse orthodontic imagery. Our method leverages a
prior-guided dense stereo reconstruction model to initialize the point cloud,
followed by a scale-adaptive pruning strategy to improve the training
efficiency and reconstruction quality of 3DGS. In scenarios with extremely
sparse viewpoints, we further incorporate optical flow as a geometric
constraint, coupled with gradient regularization, to enhance rendering
fidelity. We validate our approach on a large-scale dataset comprising 950
clinical cases and an additional video-based test set of 195 cases designed to
simulate real-world remote orthodontic imaging conditions. Experimental results

### [14] [Image-Intrinsic Priors for Integrated Circuit Defect Detection and Novel Class Discovery via Self-Supervised Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03120)
*Botong. Zhao,Xubin. Wang,Shujing. Lyu,Yue. Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: IC DefectNCD introduces a support-set-free framework for defect detection and novel class discovery in IC SEM images, leveraging Image Intrinsic Priors through a tri-part architecture (normal-info guided detection, adaptive binarization, and defect-info guided classification) to achieve robust detection and unseen defect classification on real-world data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current IC defect detection relies on heavy annotations (supervised) or unstable unsupervised clustering due to missing priors; unseen/rare defects are poorly handled. There is a need for a priors-driven, annotation-efficient method that can discover new defect categories and work across fabrication stages.

Method: 1) Self Normal Information Guided IC Defect Detection: learnable normal information extractor aggregates representative normal features; reconstruction residuals coarsely localize defects. 2) Adaptive binarization to stabilize subimages focusing on core defective areas, handling saliency variations across defects. 3) Self Defect Information Guided IC Defect Classification: soft mask guided attention within a teacher-student model injects spatial defect priors, improving sensitivity to defects and enabling recognition of unseen defects.

Result: Validated on a real-world dataset spanning three fabrication stages and 15 defect types. Demonstrates robust performance in both defect detection and unseen defect classification.

Conclusion: The approach offers a robust, annotation-efficient path for defect detection and novel defect discovery in IC manufacturing, leveraging intrinsic priors to improve localization, stability, and recognition of unseen defects across multiple fabrication stages.

Abstract: Integrated circuit manufacturing is highly complex, comprising hundreds of
process steps. Defects can arise at any stage, causing yield loss and
ultimately degrading product reliability. Supervised methods require extensive
human annotation and struggle with emergent categories and rare, data scarce
defects. Clustering-based unsupervised methods often exhibit unstable
performance due to missing priors. We propose IC DefectNCD, a support set free
framework that leverages Image Intrinsic Priors in IC SEM images for defect
detection and novel class discovery. We first develop Self Normal Information
Guided IC Defect Detection, aggregating representative normal features via a
learnable normal information extractor and using reconstruction residuals to
coarsely localize defect regions. To handle saliency variations across defects,
we introduce an adaptive binarization strategy that produces stable subimages
focused on core defective areas. Finally, we design Self Defect Information
Guided IC Defect Classification, which incorporates a soft mask guided
attention mechanism to inject spatial defect priors into the teacher student
model. This enhances sensitivity to defective regions, suppresses background
interference, and enables recognition and classification of unseen defects. We
validate the approach on a real world dataset spanning three key fabrication
stages and covering 15 defect types. Experiments demonstrate robust performance
on both defect detection and unseen defect classification.

*Hongbo Lan,Zhenlin An,Haoyu Li,Vaibhav Singh,Longfei Shangguan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Sysname accelerates vision-guided physical property reasoning with algorithmic and system optimizations, delivering large end-to-end latency reductions (from minutes to seconds) and competitive accuracy, enabling gaze-driven augmented reality in cluttered environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable real-time, robust physical-property reasoning from vision for augmented cognition, overcoming multi-minute batch processing and real-world clutter in AR contexts.

Method: Key optimizations include rapid geometric 3D reconstruction, efficient semantic feature fusion, and parallel view encoding, plus integration with gaze-tracking to localize the object of interest for AR glasses. Evaluations are performed on the ABO dataset and real-world case studies (Meta Aria Glasses in IKEA).

Result: End-to-end latency drops from 10–20 minutes to under 6 seconds; 62.9x–287.2x speedups; physics-property estimation (e.g., mass) on par or better than baselines; superior material segmentation and voxel-level inference versus two SOTA baselines; robust property estimations with fewer views in real-world scenarios.

Conclusion: Sysname demonstrates real-world viability of fast vision-guided physical property reasoning for augmented cognition, with gaze-guided localization enabling robust performance in cluttered environments and practical deployment in smart glasses.

Abstract: This paper introduces \sysname, a system that accelerates vision-guided
physical property reasoning to enable augmented visual cognition. \sysname
minimizes the run-time latency of this reasoning pipeline through a combination
of both algorithmic and systematic optimizations, including rapid geometric 3D
reconstruction, efficient semantic feature fusion, and parallel view encoding.
Through these simple yet effective optimizations, \sysname reduces the
end-to-end latency of this reasoning pipeline from 10--20 minutes to less than
6 seconds. A head-to-head comparison on the ABO dataset shows that \sysname
achieves this 62.9$\times$--287.2$\times$ speedup while not only reaching
on-par (and sometimes slightly better) object-level physical property
estimation accuracy(e.g. mass), but also demonstrating superior performance in
material segmentation and voxel-level inference than two SOTA baselines. We
further combine gaze-tracking with \sysname to localize the object of interest
in cluttered, real-world environments, streamlining the physical property
reasoning on smart glasses. The case study with Meta Aria Glasses conducted at
an IKEA furniture store demonstrates that \sysname achives consistently high
performance compared to controlled captures, providing robust property
estimations even with fewer views in real-world scenarios.

### [16] [Deploying Rapid Damage Assessments from sUAS Imagery for Disaster Response](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03132)
*Thomas Manzini,Priyankari Perali,Robin R. Murphy*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: First operational AI/ML system for sUAS-based building damage assessment deployed in real disasters (Hurricanes Debby and Helene), processing 415 buildings in about 18 minutes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the data avalanche from disaster sUAS imagery by enabling automated, real-time damage assessment; fills a gap between satellite-imagery research and practical sUAS deployment; aims to reduce the workload on subject-matter experts during emergencies.

Method: Developed models trained on the largest known post-disaster sUAS dataset (21,716 building damage labels) and conducted operational training with 91 disaster practitioners; the best-performing model was deployed during Hurricanes Debby and Helene to assess buildings in the affected area.

Result: Operational deployment evaluated 415 buildings in ~18 minutes, demonstrating feasibility, throughput, and real-world utility; provides empirical evidence and practical lessons for future AI/ML disaster-response systems.

Conclusion: This work documents real-world use of AI/ML for sUAS-based damage assessment, offering lessons learned and guidance to the AI/ML research and user communities to advance practice and readiness for future disasters.

Abstract: This paper presents the first AI/ML system for automating building damage
assessment in uncrewed aerial systems (sUAS) imagery to be deployed
operationally during federally declared disasters (Hurricanes Debby and
Helene). In response to major disasters, sUAS teams are dispatched to collect
imagery of the affected areas to assess damage; however, at recent disasters,
teams collectively delivered between 47GB and 369GB of imagery per day,
representing more imagery than can reasonably be transmitted or interpreted by
subject matter experts in the disaster scene, thus delaying response efforts.
To alleviate this data avalanche encountered in practice, computer vision and
machine learning techniques are necessary. While prior work has been deployed
to automatically assess damage in satellite imagery, there is no current state
of practice for sUAS-based damage assessment systems, as all known work has
been confined to academic settings. This work establishes the state of practice
via the development and deployment of models for building damage assessment
with sUAS imagery. The model development involved training on the largest known
dataset of post-disaster sUAS aerial imagery, containing 21,716 building damage
labels, and the operational training of 91 disaster practitioners. The best
performing model was deployed during the responses to Hurricanes Debby and
Helene, where it assessed a combined 415 buildings in approximately 18 minutes.
This work contributes documentation of the actual use of AI/ML for damage
assessment during a disaster and lessons learned to the benefit of the AI/ML
research and user communities.

### [17] [Finetuning-Free Personalization of Text to Image Generation via Hypernetworks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03156)
*Sagar Shrestha,Gopal Sharma,Luowei Zhou,Suren Kumar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Fine-tuning-free personalization for text-to-image diffusion using hypernetworks that predict LoRA-adapted weights from subject images; end-to-end training with regularization; HM-CFG for improved sampling; achieves strong personalization without per-subject tuning on CelebA-HQ, AFHQ-v2, DreamBench.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcomes inefficiency and scalability limits of per-subject fine-tuning methods (e.g., DreamBooth) and costly adapters/enlarged backbones; aims for open-category personalization without fine-tuning at test time.

Method: Train hypernetworks that map subject images to LoRA-adapted weights, with an end-to-end objective and simple output regularization; introduce HM-CFG to mix base model and personalized components during sampling.

Result: Demonstrates strong personalization performance across CelebA-HQ, AFHQ-v2, DreamBench; stable training; avoids per-subject optimization at test time; improved compositional generalization.

Conclusion: Hypernetworks offer a scalable and effective path for open-category personalization, combining fidelity and prompt alignment without expensive fine-tuning; HM-CFG enhances inference-time compositionality.

Abstract: Personalizing text-to-image diffusion models has traditionally relied on
subject-specific fine-tuning approaches such as
DreamBooth~\cite{ruiz2023dreambooth}, which are computationally expensive and
slow at inference. Recent adapter- and encoder-based methods attempt to reduce
this overhead but still depend on additional fine-tuning or large backbone
models for satisfactory results. In this work, we revisit an orthogonal
direction: fine-tuning-free personalization via Hypernetworks that predict
LoRA-adapted weights directly from subject images. Prior hypernetwork-based
approaches, however, suffer from costly data generation or unstable attempts to
mimic base model optimization trajectories. We address these limitations with
an end-to-end training objective, stabilized by a simple output regularization,
yielding reliable and effective hypernetworks. Our method removes the need for
per-subject optimization at test time while preserving both subject fidelity
and prompt alignment. To further enhance compositional generalization at
inference time, we introduce Hybrid-Model Classifier-Free Guidance (HM-CFG),
which combines the compositional strengths of the base diffusion model with the
subject fidelity of personalized models during sampling. Extensive experiments
on CelebA-HQ, AFHQ-v2, and DreamBench demonstrate that our approach achieves
strong personalization performance and highlights the promise of hypernetworks
as a scalable and effective direction for open-category personalization.

*Yun-Chen Lin,Jiayuan Huang,Hanyuan Zhang,Sergi Kavtaradze,Matthew J. Clarkson,Mobarak I. Hoque*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A depth-guided dual-encoder liver landmark segmentation method that fuses RGB-depth via cross-attention, powered by SRFT-GaLore for efficient fine-tuning, achieving state gains on L3D and strong generalization on LLSD.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address accurate detection and delineation of anatomical structures in laparoscopic liver surgery under 2D video constraints, by fusing RGB and depth cues and adapting large vision models to surgical domains.

Method: A dual-encoder framework using SAM2 (RGB) and DA2 (depth) encoders, with SRFT-GaLore, a low-rank gradient projection that replaces SVD with Subsampled Randomized Fourier Transform for efficient fine-tuning of high-dimensional attention layers. A cross-attention fusion module combines RGB and depth features. External validation uses a new LLSD dataset; evaluation on L3D shows Dice and ASSD gains; cross-dataset testing shows robustness.

Result: On the public L3D dataset, the method achieves a 4.85% improvement in Dice Similarity Coefficient and an 11.78-point reduction in Average Symmetric Surface Distance over the D2GPLand baseline. On LLSD, the model maintains competitive performance and significantly outperforms SAM-based baselines, indicating strong cross-dataset generalization.

Conclusion: The SRFT-GaLore-enhanced dual-encoder framework enables scalable and precise segmentation in real-time, depth-constrained laparoscopic liver surgery, with robust cross-dataset generalization.

Abstract: Accurate detection and delineation of anatomical structures in medical
imaging are critical for computer-assisted interventions, particularly in
laparoscopic liver surgery where 2D video streams limit depth perception and
complicate landmark localization. While recent works have leveraged monocular
depth cues for enhanced landmark detection, challenges remain in fusing RGB and
depth features and in efficiently adapting large-scale vision models to
surgical domains. We propose a depth-guided liver landmark segmentation
framework integrating semantic and geometric cues via vision foundation
encoders. We employ Segment Anything Model V2 (SAM2) encoder to extract RGB
features and Depth Anything V2 (DA2) encoder to extract depth-aware features.
To efficiently adapt SAM2, we introduce SRFT-GaLore, a novel low-rank gradient
projection method that replaces the computationally expensive SVD with a
Subsampled Randomized Fourier Transform (SRFT). This enables efficient
fine-tuning of high-dimensional attention layers without sacrificing
representational power. A cross-attention fusion module further integrates RGB
and depth cues. To assess cross-dataset generalization, we also construct a new
Laparoscopic Liver Surgical Dataset (LLSD) as an external validation benchmark.
On the public L3D dataset, our method achieves a 4.85% improvement in Dice
Similarity Coefficient and a 11.78-point reduction in Average Symmetric Surface
Distance compared to the D2GPLand. To further assess generalization capability,
we evaluate our model on LLSD dataset. Our model maintains competitive
performance and significantly outperforms SAM-based baselines, demonstrating
strong cross-dataset robustness and adaptability to unseen surgical
environments. These results demonstrate that our SRFT-GaLore-enhanced
dual-encoder framework enables scalable and precise segmentation under
real-time, depth-constrained surgical settings.

*Shreyas C. Dhake,Jiayuan Huang,Runlong He,Danyal Z. Khan,Evangelos B. Mazomenos,Sophia Bano,Hani J. Marcus,Danail Stoyanov,Matthew J. Clarkson,Mobarak I. Hoque*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduces PitVQA-Anticipation dataset and SurgAnt-ViVQA model for forward-looking surgical VQA, enabling prediction of future phase/steps/instruments/duration; demonstrates improvement via temporal modeling and gated cross-attention, with trade-offs in frame budgets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Surgical VQA currently focuses on static frames; there is a need for proactive reasoning to support real-time workflow in challenging endonasal transsphenoidal pituitary surgery where visibility is limited and workflow changes rapidly.

Method: Create PitVQA-Anticipation dataset (33.5 hours of video, 734,769 QA pairs) across four tasks: predicting future phase, next step, upcoming instrument, and remaining duration. Propose SurgAnt-ViVQA, a video-language model that adapts a large language model using a GRU Gated Temporal Cross-Attention module. A bidirectional GRU encodes frame-to-frame dynamics, and an adaptive gate injects visual context into the language stream at the token level. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning customizes the language backbone to the surgical domain. Evaluate on PitVQA-Anticipation and EndoVis datasets; ablations show temporal recurrence and gated fusion drive gains; frame budget study shows 8 frames maximize fluency while 32 frames improve numeric time estimation.

Result: SurgAnt-ViVQA surpasses strong image- and video-based baselines; temporal recurrence and gated fusion are key contributors to performance gains; frame budget indicates a trade-off between linguistic fluency and numeric time estimation, with 8 frames optimal for fluency and 32 frames aiding time estimation albeit with BLEU trade-off.

Conclusion: Temporal modeling is essential for reliable, future-aware surgical assistance; PitVQA-Anticipation provides a comprehensive benchmark for proactive surgical VQA and underscores the importance of targeted temporal modeling.

Abstract: Anticipating forthcoming surgical events is vital for real-time assistance in
endonasal transsphenoidal pituitary surgery, where visibility is limited and
workflow changes rapidly. Most visual question answering (VQA) systems reason
on isolated frames with static vision language alignment, providing little
support for forecasting next steps or instrument needs. Existing surgical VQA
datasets likewise center on the current scene rather than the near future. We
introduce PitVQA-Anticipation, the first VQA dataset designed for forward
looking surgical reasoning. It comprises 33.5 hours of operative video and
734,769 question answer pairs built from temporally grouped clips and expert
annotations across four tasks: predicting the future phase, next step, upcoming
instrument, and remaining duration. We further propose SurgAnt-ViVQA, a video
language model that adapts a large language model using a GRU Gated Temporal
Cross-Attention module. A bidirectional GRU encodes frame to frame dynamics,
while an adaptive gate injects visual context into the language stream at the
token level. Parameter efficient fine tuning customizes the language backbone
to the surgical domain. SurgAnt-ViVQA tested upon on PitVQA-Anticipation and
EndoVis datasets, surpassing strong image and video based baselines. Ablations
show that temporal recurrence and gated fusion drive most of the gains. A frame
budget study indicates a trade-off: 8 frames maximize fluency, whereas 32
frames slightly reduce BLEU but improve numeric time estimation. By pairing a
temporally aware encoder with fine grained gated cross-attention, SurgAnt-ViVQA
advances surgical VQA from retrospective description to proactive anticipation.
PitVQA-Anticipation offers a comprehensive benchmark for this setting and
highlights the importance of targeted temporal modeling for reliable, future
aware surgical assistance.

diagnosed with various malignancies. The dataset primarily includes common
cancers such as lung cancer, liver cancer, breast cancer, prostate cancer, and

*Kuei-Chun Kao,Hsu Tzu-Yin,Yunqi Hong,Ruochen Wang,Cho-Jui Hsieh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduces QG-CoC, a zero-shot prompting method for multi-image reasoning with arbitrary image counts, addressing fine-grained perception and cross-image reasoning gaps in MLLMs; shows competitive results and robustness where prior prompts fail.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prevalent prompting methods are tailored to single or constrained multi-image scenarios; there is a gap in understanding and improving general multi-image perception and reasoning in MLLMs. The work aims to analyze limitations and propose a general solution.

Method: Proposes Question-Guided Chain-of-Captions (QG-CoC), a zero-shot prompting framework that guides the model to generate a chain of relevant captions tied to the posed question, enabling integrated perception and reasoning across any number of images. Evaluated on multiple open-source and closed-source MLLMs on multi-image and single-image benchmarks.

Result: QG-CoC achieves competitive performance across tasks and provides robust improvements in challenging multi-image scenarios where previous prompts underperform.

Conclusion: Demonstrates the viability of question-guided, chain-of-caption prompting as a general solution for multi-image reasoning in MLLMs and highlights the need for further research into fine-grained cross-image integration.

Abstract: Recently, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) encounter two key issues
in multi-image contexts: (1) a lack of fine-grained perception across disparate
images, and (2) a diminished capability to effectively reason over and
synthesize information from multiple visual inputs. However, while various
prompting methods aim to describe visual content, many existing studies focus
primarily on single-image settings or specific, constrained scenarios. This
leaves a critical gap in understanding and addressing how MLLMs tackle more
general and complex multi-image reasoning tasks. Thus, we first extensively
investigate how current prompting methods perceive fine-grained visual details
and process visual information when dealing with multiple images. Our findings
reveal that existing prompting methods fall short in attending to needed clues
and seamlessly integrating perception and reasoning. Inspired by the findings,
we propose a new zero-shot prompting method, Question-Guided Chain-of-Captions
(QG-CoC), a generalized prompting approach that effectively handles problems
with an arbitrary number of images. We evaluate our method on various
open-source and closed-source MLLMs for multi-image and single-image
benchmarks. Experimental results indicate that QG-CoC demonstrates competitive
performance across tasks and exhibits robust improvements in the challenging
scenarios where existing prompting methods fail.

*Ruting Cheng,Boyuan Feng,Yijiang Zheng,Chuhui Qiu,Aizierjiang Aiersilan,Joaquin A. Calderon,Wentao Zhao,Qing Pan,James K. Hahn*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes MvBody, a multi-view Transformer for CS risk using self-reported data and 3D body scans; achieves 84.62% accuracy and AUC 0.724; uses metric learning and Integrated Gradients for explanations; identifies key risk factors including pre-pregnancy weight, age, obstetric history, prior CS, and head/shoulder body shape.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need for CS risk assessment in resource-limited or home settings where in-hospital models rely on unavailable data; aims to enable early, reliable prenatal risk prediction with affordable 3D scans.

Method: Develops a multi-view Transformer (MvBody) trained on self-reported medical data plus 3D optical body scans collected 31–38 weeks gestation; incorporates metric learning loss to improve efficiency and generalizability in data-scarce environments; compares with common ML models and 3D analysis methods; uses Integrated Gradients for explanations.

Result: Outperforms baselines, achieving 84.62% accuracy and AUC-ROC 0.724 on an independent test set; reveals key predictive factors: pre-pregnancy weight, maternal age, obstetric history, previous CS, and body shape around the head and shoulders.

Conclusion: Demonstrates feasibility of 3D body-shape–based CS risk assessment suitable for resource-limited settings; potential for deployment with affordable devices; emphasizes transparency via attribution methods.

Abstract: Accurately assessing the risk of cesarean section (CS) delivery is critical,
especially in settings with limited medical resources, where access to
healthcare is often restricted. Early and reliable risk prediction allows
better-informed prenatal care decisions and can improve maternal and neonatal
outcomes. However, most existing predictive models are tailored for in-hospital
use during labor and rely on parameters that are often unavailable in
resource-limited or home-based settings. In this study, we conduct a pilot
investigation to examine the feasibility of using 3D body shape for CS risk
assessment for future applications with more affordable general devices. We
propose a novel multi-view-based Transformer network, MvBody, which predicts CS
risk using only self-reported medical data and 3D optical body scans obtained
between the 31st and 38th weeks of gestation. To enhance training efficiency
and model generalizability in data-scarce environments, we incorporate a metric
learning loss into the network. Compared to widely used machine learning models
and the latest advanced 3D analysis methods, our method demonstrates superior
performance, achieving an accuracy of 84.62% and an Area Under the Receiver
Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC-ROC) of 0.724 on the independent test set.
To improve transparency and trust in the model's predictions, we apply the
Integrated Gradients algorithm to provide theoretically grounded explanations
of the model's decision-making process. Our results indicate that pre-pregnancy
weight, maternal age, obstetric history, previous CS history, and body shape,
particularly around the head and shoulders, are key contributors to CS risk
prediction.

### [23] [Diffusion-Guided Mask-Consistent Paired Mixing for Endoscopic Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03219)
*Pengyu Jie,Wanquan Liu,Rui He,Yihui Wen,Deyu Meng,Chenqiang Gao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A diffusion-guided paired augmentation method called MCPMix with Real-Anchored Learnable Annealing (RLA) improves endoscopic segmentation by generating paired real/synthetic samples under the same mask and mixing appearances while preserving labels, yielding a continuum of augmented data that bridges synthetic and real domains and achieves state-of-the-art results across multiple datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard augmentation for dense prediction suffers from mask misalignment in mixing (soft label ambiguity) and diffusion synthesis creates domain shifts and neglects mask-conditioned structure. There is a need to jointly leverage mixing and diffusion with label-preserving control to improve generalization.

Method: Create paired real and diffusion-produced synthetic images under the same mask. Use the pair as input for Mask-Consistent Paired Mixing (MCPMix) that mixes only appearance; supervision uses original hard mask. Produce a continuum of mixed samples bridging real and synthetic appearances with shared geometry. Apply Real-Anchored Learnable Annealing (RLA) to adaptively adjust mixing strength and the loss weight of mixed samples over training to re-anchor optimization to real data.

Result: On Kvasir-SEG, PICCOLO, CVC-ClinicDB, private NPC-LES, and ISIC 2017, the method achieves state-of-the-art segmentation performance and consistent gains over baselines, demonstrating robust, generalizable endoscopic segmentation.

Conclusion: Coupling label-preserving mixing with diffusion-driven diversity, guided by adaptive re-anchoring, yields robust, domain-generalizable endoscopic segmentation across diverse datasets.

Abstract: Augmentation for dense prediction typically relies on either sample mixing or
generative synthesis. Mixing improves robustness but misaligned masks yield
soft label ambiguity. Diffusion synthesis increases apparent diversity but,
when trained as common samples, overlooks the structural benefit of mask
conditioning and introduces synthetic-real domain shift. We propose a paired,
diffusion-guided paradigm that fuses the strengths of both. For each real
image, a synthetic counterpart is generated under the same mask and the pair is
used as a controllable input for Mask-Consistent Paired Mixing (MCPMix), which
mixes only image appearance while supervision always uses the original hard
mask. This produces a continuous family of intermediate samples that smoothly
bridges synthetic and real appearances under shared geometry, enlarging
diversity without compromising pixel-level semantics. To keep learning aligned
with real data, Real-Anchored Learnable Annealing (RLA) adaptively adjusts the
mixing strength and the loss weight of mixed samples over training, gradually
re-anchoring optimization to real data and mitigating distributional bias.
Across Kvasir-SEG, PICCOLO, CVC-ClinicDB, a private NPC-LES cohort, and ISIC
2017, the approach achieves state-of-the-art segmentation performance and
consistent gains over baselines. The results show that combining
label-preserving mixing with diffusion-driven diversity, together with adaptive
re-anchoring, yields robust and generalizable endoscopic segmentation.

TL;DR: A lightweight SR framework (T-PMambaSR) that combines window-based self-attention with Progressive Mamba and an Adaptive High-Frequency Refinement Module to achieve better performance with linear complexity, improving on Transformer- and Mamba-based SR methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the quadratic computational cost of Transformer-based SR and the lack of fine-grained, multi-scale interactions in Mamba-based approaches, aiming for more efficient, richer feature representations.

Method: Integrates window-based self-attention with Progressive Mamba to enable interactions among receptive fields across scales, creating a fine-grained modeling paradigm with linear complexity; introduces AHFRM to recover high-frequency details lost during processing.

Result: Extensive experiments show that T-PMambaSR progressively enhances receptive field and expressiveness, achieving better performance than recent Transformer- or Mamba-based methods at lower computational cost.

Conclusion: T-PMambaSR provides improved SR performance with linear complexity and efficient feature representation; the approach outperforms peers while demanding less computation, with code to be released after acceptance.

Abstract: Recently, Mamba-based super-resolution (SR) methods have demonstrated the
ability to capture global receptive fields with linear complexity, addressing
the quadratic computational cost of Transformer-based SR approaches. However,
existing Mamba-based methods lack fine-grained transitions across different
modeling scales, which limits the efficiency of feature representation. In this
paper, we propose T-PMambaSR, a lightweight SR framework that integrates
window-based self-attention with Progressive Mamba. By enabling interactions
among receptive fields of different scales, our method establishes a
fine-grained modeling paradigm that progressively enhances feature
representation with linear complexity. Furthermore, we introduce an Adaptive
High-Frequency Refinement Module (AHFRM) to recover high-frequency details lost
during Transformer and Mamba processing. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
T-PMambaSR progressively enhances the model's receptive field and
expressiveness, yielding better performance than recent Transformer- or
Mamba-based methods while incurring lower computational cost. Our codes will be
released after acceptance.

*Liwei Luo,Shuaitengyuan Li,Dongwei Ren,Qilong Wang,Pengfei Zhu,Qinghua Hu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DMPO decouples low-level representation and high-level discriminative power in early stages of multi-stage predictors, using a lightweight bypass and high-order statistics-based predictor with a two-phase loss schedule to improve inference efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Inference efficiency is crucial for deploying large-scale pre-trained models. Early exiting with multi-stage predictors helps, but it is challenging for early stages to provide both low-level foundational features and high-level discriminative features for early predictors.

Method: Introduce a lightweight bypass module for shallow feature decomposition in multi-stage predictors, develop a high-order statistics-based predictor for early stages to boost discriminative ability, and apply a decoupled two-phase loss optimization that first emphasizes deep-stage discriminative ability while preserving early-stage representation, then shifts emphasis to improving early-stage discriminative power.

Result: Experiments on diverse datasets and backbones show DMPO outperforms baselines in reducing computational cost while maintaining or improving accuracy.

Conclusion: DMPO effectively decouples representative and discriminative abilities in early stages through architectural design and decoupled optimization, enabling more inference-efficient models without sacrificing performance.

Abstract: Recently, remarkable progress has been made in large-scale pre-trained model
tuning, and inference efficiency is becoming more crucial for practical
deployment. Early exiting in conjunction with multi-stage predictors, when
cooperated with a parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategy, offers a
straightforward way to achieve an inference-efficient model. However, a key
challenge remains unresolved: How can early stages provide low-level
fundamental features to deep stages while simultaneously supplying high-level
discriminative features to early-stage predictors? To address this problem, we
propose a Decoupled Multi-Predictor Optimization (DMPO) method to effectively
decouple the low-level representative ability and high-level discriminative
ability in early stages. First, in terms of architecture, we introduce a
lightweight bypass module into multi-stage predictors for functional
decomposition of shallow features from early stages, while a high-order
statistics-based predictor is developed for early stages to effectively enhance
their discriminative ability. To reasonably train our multi-predictor
architecture, a decoupled optimization is proposed to allocate two-phase loss
weights for multi-stage predictors during model tuning, where the initial
training phase enables the model to prioritize the acquisition of
discriminative ability of deep stages via emphasizing representative ability of
early stages, and the latter training phase drives discriminative ability
towards earlier stages as much as possible. As such, our DMPO can effectively
decouple representative and discriminative abilities in early stages in terms
of architecture design and model optimization. Experiments across various
datasets and pre-trained backbones demonstrate that DMPO clearly outperforms
its counterparts when reducing computational cost.

### [26] [Generative deep learning for foundational video translation in ultrasound](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03255)
*Nikolina Tomic Roshni Bhatnagar,Sarthak Jain,Connor Lau,Tien-Yu Liu,Laura Gambini,Rima Arnaout*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Presents a two-network generative model for ultrasound CFD–greyscale video translation using pixel-wise, adversarial, and perceptual losses to balance sub-modalities; achieves high similarity to real videos and passes DL tasks and clinician evaluation, with generalization beyond heart imaging.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address data imbalance and missingness across ultrasound sub-modalities (greyscale and color flow Doppler) that hinder deep learning, by translating and balancing modalities to expand retrospective data utility.

Method: Two networks: one for reconstructing anatomical structures and one for denoising, trained on 54,975 videos and tested on 8,368. Uses pixel-wise, adversarial, and perceptual losses to translate CFD and greyscale video, with evaluation on DL classification/segmentation and blinded clinician assessment.

Result: Average SSIM ~0.91 (±0.04–0.05) between synthetic and ground-truth videos. DL tasks perform comparably on synthetic vs real data, with F1 scores ≈0.90 (real) and 0.89 (synthetic); Dice score for synthetic vs real segmentation ≈0.97. Clinicians distinguished real vs synthetic with ~54% accuracy (chance level). Model generalizes to ultrasound beyond heart imaging (SSIM ~0.91 in other domains).

Conclusion: Synthetic CFD–greyscale ultrasound videos are realistic and can augment retrospective datasets, broadening the dataset design toolbox for medical imaging.

Abstract: Deep learning (DL) has the potential to revolutionize image acquisition and
interpretation across medicine, however, attention to data imbalance and
missingness is required. Ultrasound data presents a particular challenge
because in addition to different views and structures, it includes several
sub-modalities-such as greyscale and color flow doppler (CFD)-that are often
imbalanced in clinical studies. Image translation can help balance datasets but
is challenging for ultrasound sub-modalities to date. Here, we present a
generative method for ultrasound CFD-greyscale video translation, trained on
54,975 videos and tested on 8,368. The method developed leveraged pixel-wise,
adversarial, and perceptual loses and utilized two networks: one for
reconstructing anatomic structures and one for denoising to achieve realistic
ultrasound imaging. Average pairwise SSIM between synthetic videos and ground
truth was 0.91+/-0.04. Synthetic videos performed indistinguishably from real
ones in DL classification and segmentation tasks and when evaluated by blinded
clinical experts: F1 score was 0.9 for real and 0.89 for synthetic videos; Dice
score between real and synthetic segmentation was 0.97. Overall clinician
accuracy in distinguishing real vs synthetic videos was 54+/-6% (42-61%),
indicating realistic synthetic videos. Although trained only on heart videos,
the model worked well on ultrasound spanning several clinical domains (average
SSIM 0.91+/-0.05), demonstrating foundational abilities. Together, these data
expand the utility of retrospectively collected imaging and augment the dataset
design toolbox for medical imaging.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap where existing models struggle to balance global context modeling and long-range dependency reasoning within practical compute budgets in medical segmentation.

Method: Proposes a U-Mamba architecture that combines Mamba-based state-space modules for long-range interactions with Heat Conduction Operators (HCOs) in bottlenecks to simulate frequency-domain thermal diffusion, enabling enhanced semantic abstraction.

Result: Experimental results on multimodal abdominal CT and MRI datasets show consistent improvement over strong baselines, validating effectiveness and generalizability.

Conclusion: Blending state-space dynamics with heat-based global diffusion offers a scalable, interpretable solution for medical segmentation tasks.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation has been significantly advanced by deep learning
architectures, notably U-Net variants. However, existing models struggle to
achieve efficient global context modeling and long-range dependency reasoning
under practical computational budgets simultaneously. In this work, we propose
a novel hybrid architecture utilizing U-Mamba with Heat Conduction Equation.
Our model combines Mamba-based state-space modules for efficient long-range
reasoning with Heat Conduction Operators (HCOs) in the bottleneck layers,
simulating frequency-domain thermal diffusion for enhanced semantic
abstraction. Experimental results on multimodal abdominal CT and MRI datasets
demonstrate that the proposed model consistently outperforms strong baselines,
validating its effectiveness and generalizability. It suggest that blending

### [28] [IEC3D-AD: A 3D Dataset of Industrial Equipment Components for Unsupervised Point Cloud Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03267)
*Bingyang Guo,Hongjie Li,Ruiyun Yu,Hanzhe Liang,Jinbao Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes IEC3D-AD, a high-fidelity point-cloud dataset for industrial components, and GMANet, a 3D-AD framework that synthesizes geometry-based samples and tightens normal/abnormal feature separation to boost detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D-AD datasets miss complex real-world defects in industrial settings; there is a need for higher-resolution data with granular defect annotations collected from actual production lines to improve detection performance for components like bearings, rings, and bolts.

Method: 1) Build IEC3D-AD from real production lines with improved point-cloud resolution and detailed defect annotations; 2) Introduce GMANet, a 3D-AD paradigm that generates synthetic point clouds guided by geometric morphological analysis; 3) Apply spatial discrepancy optimization to reduce the margin and increase overlap between normal and abnormal point-level features.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate that GMANet is effective on IEC3D-AD and generalizes to other datasets, indicating improved capability for challenging 3D anomaly detection in industrial contexts.

Conclusion: IEC3D-AD and GMANet address limitations of prior datasets and methods, enabling more accurate and robust 3D anomaly detection for industrial equipment components, with promising applicability to real production environments.

Abstract: 3D anomaly detection (3D-AD) plays a critical role in industrial
manufacturing, particularly in ensuring the reliability and safety of core
equipment components. Although existing 3D datasets like Real3D-AD and MVTec
3D-AD offer broad application support, they fall short in capturing the
complexities and subtle defects found in real industrial environments. This
limitation hampers precise anomaly detection research, especially for
industrial equipment components (IEC) such as bearings, rings, and bolts. To
address this challenge, we have developed a point cloud anomaly detection
dataset (IEC3D-AD) specific to real industrial scenarios. This dataset is
directly collected from actual production lines, ensuring high fidelity and
relevance. Compared to existing datasets, IEC3D-AD features significantly
improved point cloud resolution and defect annotation granularity, facilitating
more demanding anomaly detection tasks. Furthermore, inspired by generative
2D-AD methods, we introduce a novel 3D-AD paradigm (GMANet) on IEC3D-AD. This
paradigm generates synthetic point cloud samples based on geometric
morphological analysis, then reduces the margin and increases the overlap
between normal and abnormal point-level features through spatial discrepancy
optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method
on both IEC3D-AD and other datasets.

### [29] [Unified Long Video Inpainting and Outpainting via Overlapping High-Order Co-Denoising](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03272)
*Shuangquan Lyu,Steven Mao,Yue Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A unified, parameter-efficient method for arbitrarily long video inpainting/outpainting using LoRA fine-tuning of Wan 2.1 diffusion model, with overlap-and-blend temporal co-denoising to ensure long-range consistency, outperforming Wan 2.1 and VACE on PSNR/SSIM/LPIPS with seamless long videos.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the dual challenges of generating long videos and achieving high controllability in video inpainting/outpainting, while avoiding fixed-length limitations, stitching artifacts, and drift that plague prior methods.

Method: Fine-tune a large pre-trained video diffusion model (Wan 2.1) with LoRA for masked region video synthesis; implement an overlap-and-blend temporal co-denoising strategy using high-order solvers to maintain cross-frame consistency over long sequences; extend text-to-video diffusion for arbitrarily long, spatially edited videos.

Result: Demonstrates ability to edit or add objects over hundreds of frames with higher quality (PSNR/SSIM) and perceptual realism (LPIPS) than baseline methods (Wan 2.1 and VACE); achieves long-range video editing with minimal overhead and better parameter efficiency.

Conclusion: The proposed approach enables practical, high-fidelity long-range video editing and inpainting/outpainting without seams or drift, addressing fixed-length and stitching artifacts while maintaining efficiency.

Abstract: Generating long videos remains a fundamental challenge, and achieving high
controllability in video inpainting and outpainting is particularly demanding.
To address both of these challenges simultaneously and achieve controllable
video inpainting and outpainting for long video clips, we introduce a novel and
unified approach for long video inpainting and outpainting that extends
text-to-video diffusion models to generate arbitrarily long, spatially edited
videos with high fidelity. Our method leverages LoRA to efficiently fine-tune a
large pre-trained video diffusion model like Alibaba's Wan 2.1 for masked
region video synthesis, and employs an overlap-and-blend temporal co-denoising
strategy with high-order solvers to maintain consistency across long sequences.
In contrast to prior work that struggles with fixed-length clips or exhibits
stitching artifacts, our system enables arbitrarily long video generation and
editing without noticeable seams or drift. We validate our approach on
challenging inpainting/outpainting tasks including editing or adding objects
over hundreds of frames and demonstrate superior performance to baseline
methods like Wan 2.1 model and VACE in terms of quality (PSNR/SSIM), and
perceptual realism (LPIPS). Our method enables practical long-range video
editing with minimal overhead, achieved a balance between parameter efficient
and superior performance.

*Minghao Fu,Guo-Hua Wang,Tianyu Cui,Qing-Guo Chen,Zhao Xu,Weihua Luo,Kaifu Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Diffusion-SDPO stabilizes diffusion-model alignment by adaptively scaling the loser gradient, guaranteeing non-increasing error on the preferred output and yielding improvements over standard Diffusion-DPO across preference and alignment metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard Diffusion-DPO can inadvertently hurt both winner and loser outputs when increasing the preference margin, leading to degraded preferred outputs despite larger margins.

Method: Introduce Diffusion-SDPO with a safeguarded update: compute a closed-form gradient scaling coefficient (first-order) that scales the loser gradient based on its alignment with the winner gradient, preserving the winner.

Result: Empirical gains over baseline preference-learning methods on automated preference, aesthetic, and prompt alignment metrics across standard text-to-image benchmarks; method is model-agnostic and adds only marginal overhead; code released.

Conclusion: Diffusion-SDPO provides a simple, broadly compatible, and theoretically grounded improvement to DPO-based alignment for diffusion models, reducing risk of degrading preferred outputs while improving overall alignment performance.

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models deliver high-quality images, yet aligning them
with human preferences remains challenging. We revisit diffusion-based Direct
Preference Optimization (DPO) for these models and identify a critical
pathology: enlarging the preference margin does not necessarily improve
generation quality. In particular, the standard Diffusion-DPO objective can
increase the reconstruction error of both winner and loser branches.
Consequently, degradation of the less-preferred outputs can become sufficiently
severe that the preferred branch is also adversely affected even as the margin
grows. To address this, we introduce Diffusion-SDPO, a safeguarded update rule
that preserves the winner by adaptively scaling the loser gradient according to
its alignment with the winner gradient. A first-order analysis yields a
closed-form scaling coefficient that guarantees the error of the preferred
output is non-increasing at each optimization step. Our method is simple,
model-agnostic, broadly compatible with existing DPO-style alignment frameworks
and adds only marginal computational overhead. Across standard text-to-image
benchmarks, Diffusion-SDPO delivers consistent gains over preference-learning
baselines on automated preference, aesthetic, and prompt alignment metrics.

*Mauro Orazio Drago,Luca Carlini,Pelinsu Celebi Balyemez,Dennis Pierantozzi,Chiara Lena,Cesare Hassan,Danail Stoyanov,Elena De Momi,Sophia Bano,Mobarak I. Hoque*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SurgViVQA introduces a temporally-aware surgical VideoQA model with a masked video-text encoder and an LLM, plus REAL-Colon-VQA dataset; shows improved keyword accuracy over baselines and robustness to question variations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current surgical VideoQA relies on static image features and lacks temporal annotations, hindering understanding of dynamic procedures.

Method: Proposes Masked Video-Text Encoder to fuse video and question features and capture motion and tool–tissue interactions; uses a fine-tuned LLM to generate answers; curates REAL-Colon-VQA with motion-related and out-of-template questions; evaluates on REAL-Colon-VQA and EndoVis18-VQA; conducts perturbation robustness tests.

Result: SurgViVQA outperforms image-based VQA baselines, achieving +11% keyword accuracy on REAL-Colon-VQA and +9% on EndoVis18-VQA (vs PitVQA); shows robustness to rephrasings via perturbation study.

Conclusion: SurgViVQA and REAL-Colon-VQA establish a framework for temporally-aware understanding in surgical VideoQA, enabling better interpretation of dynamic procedural contexts; code and data released.

Abstract: Video Question Answering (VideoQA) in the surgical domain aims to enhance
intraoperative understanding by enabling AI models to reason over temporally
coherent events rather than isolated frames. Current approaches are limited to
static image features, and available datasets often lack temporal annotations,
ignoring the dynamics critical for accurate procedural interpretation. We
propose SurgViVQA, a surgical VideoQA model that extends visual reasoning from
static images to dynamic surgical scenes. It uses a Masked Video--Text Encoder
to fuse video and question features, capturing temporal cues such as motion and
tool--tissue interactions, which a fine-tuned large language model (LLM) then
decodes into coherent answers. To evaluate its performance, we curated
REAL-Colon-VQA, a colonoscopic video dataset that includes motion-related
questions and diagnostic attributes, as well as out-of-template questions with
rephrased or semantically altered formulations to assess model robustness.
Experimental validation on REAL-Colon-VQA and the public EndoVis18-VQA dataset
shows that SurgViVQA outperforms existing image-based VQA benchmark models,
particularly in keyword accuracy, improving over PitVQA by +11\% on
REAL-Colon-VQA and +9\% on EndoVis18-VQA. A perturbation study on the questions
further confirms improved generalizability and robustness to variations in
question phrasing. SurgViVQA and the REAL-Colon-VQA dataset provide a framework
for temporally-aware understanding in surgical VideoQA, enabling AI models to
interpret dynamic procedural contexts more effectively. Code and dataset

### [33] [UniAVGen: Unified Audio and Video Generation with Asymmetric Cross-Modal Interactions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03334)
*Guozhen Zhang,Zixiang Zhou,Teng Hu,Ziqiao Peng,Youliang Zhang,Yi Chen,Yuan Zhou,Qinglin Lu,Limin Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UniAVGen is a unified cross-modal framework for joint audio-video generation with dual-branch diffusion Transformers, asymmetric cross-modal interaction, and face-aware modulation. It enables joint tasks (generation, continuation, dubbing, audio-driven synthesis) with improved lip-sync, timbre, and emotion consistency using far fewer training samples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current open-source audio-video generation methods suffer from weak cross-modal modeling, causing lip synchronization issues and semantic misalignment. A cohesive cross-modal latent space and robust cross-modal interaction are needed to improve synchronization and semantic consistency.

Method: UniAVGen uses a dual-branch joint synthesis architecture with two parallel Diffusion Transformers to create a cohesive cross-modal latent space. It introduces an Asymmetric Cross-Modal Interaction mechanism that enables bidirectional, temporally aligned cross-attention for precise spatiotemporal synchronization. A Face-Aware Modulation module prioritizes salient regions during interaction. Modality-Aware Classifier-Free Guidance is added to explicitly amplify cross-modal correlation signals. The model supports unified tasks including joint audio-video generation and continuation, video-to-audio dubbing, and audio-driven video synthesis.

Result: Experiments show improved audio-video synchronization, timbre consistency, and emotion consistency, achieved with far fewer training samples (1.3M vs. 30.1M) compared to baselines.

Conclusion: UniAVGen provides a robust, unified framework for joint audio-video generation that enables multiple tasks within a single model, delivering better cross-modal alignment and data efficiency.

Abstract: Due to the lack of effective cross-modal modeling, existing open-source
audio-video generation methods often exhibit compromised lip synchronization
and insufficient semantic consistency. To mitigate these drawbacks, we propose
UniAVGen, a unified framework for joint audio and video generation. UniAVGen is
anchored in a dual-branch joint synthesis architecture, incorporating two
parallel Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) to build a cohesive cross-modal latent
space. At its heart lies an Asymmetric Cross-Modal Interaction mechanism, which
enables bidirectional, temporally aligned cross-attention, thus ensuring
precise spatiotemporal synchronization and semantic consistency. Furthermore,
this cross-modal interaction is augmented by a Face-Aware Modulation module,
which dynamically prioritizes salient regions in the interaction process. To
enhance generative fidelity during inference, we additionally introduce
Modality-Aware Classifier-Free Guidance, a novel strategy that explicitly
amplifies cross-modal correlation signals. Notably, UniAVGen's robust joint
synthesis design enables seamless unification of pivotal audio-video tasks
within a single model, such as joint audio-video generation and continuation,
video-to-audio dubbing, and audio-driven video synthesis. Comprehensive
experiments validate that, with far fewer training samples (1.3M vs. 30.1M),
UniAVGen delivers overall advantages in audio-video synchronization, timbre
consistency, and emotion consistency.

### [34] [Decoupling Augmentation Bias in Prompt Learning for Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03367)
*Gahyeon Kim,Sohee Kim,Seokju Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AAPL introduces adversarial prompt embeddings to disentangle augmentation-induced superficial visual variations from semantic features, enhancing prompt learning for vision-language models and improving generalization across few-shot, zero-shot, cross-dataset, and domain shifts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prompt-learning methods like CoOp/CoCoOp can overfit to seen classes and ignore semantically meaningful visual cues, particularly under unseen categories. Image-based augmentation remains underexplored for prompts; we need a mechanism to steer prompts toward discriminative, category-relevant features.

Method: Propose Adding Attributes to Prompt Learning (AAPL) by inserting adversarial token embeddings into the soft prompt that learn to suppress augmentation-induced superficial variations while preserving semantics. Train with image-level augmentations that inject attribute-specific changes, and optimize prompts to maximize alignment with true class semantics while minimizing sensitivity to superficial changes. Study interactions with soft prompt frameworks and perform ablation studies on eleven benchmarks.

Result: AAPL consistently outperforms existing methods across few-shot, zero-shot, cross-dataset, and domain generalization settings on eleven datasets; supports learning prompts focused on visually discriminative features; code released at provided GitHub.

Conclusion: Decoupling augmentation-induced superficial variability from semantic representations via adversarial prompts improves generalization in prompt-based vision-language models; image-level attribute augmentations can be leveraged effectively to guide prompt learning.

Abstract: Recent advances in large-scale vision and language models have led to
significant progress in zero-shot learning tasks. Methods such as CoOp and
CoCoOp have shown that replacing handcrafted prompts with learnable vectors,
known as prompt learning, can result in improved performance. However, these
models often struggle to generalize to entirely unseen categories. While
traditional zero-shot learning techniques benefit from various data
augmentation strategies, prompt learning has primarily focused on text-based
modifications, leaving the potential of image-based augmentation largely
unexplored. In this work, we explore how image-level augmentations,
particularly those that introduce attribute-specific variations, can support
and enhance prompt learning. Our analysis examines the interaction between
these augmentations and soft prompt frameworks, revealing their potential to
improve generalization. We also identify a limitation in existing methods, such
as CoCoOp, which do not provide explicit guidance for learning prompts that
focus on semantically meaningful visual features. To address this, we propose
Adding Attributes to Prompt Learning, AAPL, a novel method that introduces
adversarial token embeddings to decouple superficial visual variations
introduced by augmentation from class-relevant semantic representations. This
decoupling enables the learned prompts to concentrate on visually
discriminative features that align with the target categories. We conduct
comprehensive experiments on eleven benchmark datasets, and AAPL consistently
outperforms existing methods across few-shot, zero-shot, cross-dataset, and
domain generalization settings. Our source code is publicly available at:

*Nikolai Herrmann,Marcella C. Zijta,Stefan Klein,Régine P. M. Steegers-Theunissen,Rene M. H. Wijnen,Bernadette S. de Bakker,Melek Rousian,Wietske A. P. Bastiaansen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PCA-based automated 3D embryo alignment from segmentation masks using four candidate orientations and three selection strategies (Pearson heuristic, atlas NCC, Random Forest), achieving ~98% accuracy on 2166 images from 1043 pregnancies in early gestation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enable standardized embryo alignment in 3D ultrasound to improve standard plane detection, landmark visualization, and cross-scan comparison, particularly in the first trimester where variability in orientation can hinder analysis.

Method: Apply PCA to the embryo segmentation mask to extract principal axes and derive four candidate orientations. Select the standard orientation using one of three strategies: (1) Pearson correlation-based shape heuristic, (2) atlas-based image matching via normalized cross-correlation, (3) a Random Forest classifier. Majority vote across strategies yields final alignment.

Result: PCA correctly extracted the principal axes in 99.0% of images. Correct orientation selected by Pearson heuristic 97.4%, atlas-based 95.8%, Random Forest 98.4%. Majority vote accuracy 98.5%. Validated on 2166 images from 1043 pregnancies (7+0 to 12+6 weeks). Code available at the provided GitLab link.

Conclusion: The pipeline achieves high accuracy for consistent embryonic alignment in the first trimester, enabling scalable analysis in clinical and research settings; implementation is open-source to support reproducibility.

Abstract: Standardized alignment of the embryo in three-dimensional (3D) ultrasound
images aids prenatal growth monitoring by facilitating standard plane
detection, improving visualization of landmarks and accentuating differences
between different scans. In this work, we propose an automated method for
standardizing this alignment. Given a segmentation mask of the embryo,
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is applied to the mask extracting the
embryo's principal axes, from which four candidate orientations are derived.
The candidate in standard orientation is selected using one of three
strategies: a heuristic based on Pearson's correlation assessing shape, image
matching to an atlas through normalized cross-correlation, and a Random Forest
classifier. We tested our method on 2166 images longitudinally acquired 3D
ultrasound scans from 1043 pregnancies from the Rotterdam Periconceptional
Cohort, ranging from 7+0 to 12+6 weeks of gestational age. In 99.0% of images,
PCA correctly extracted the principal axes of the embryo. The correct candidate
was selected by the Pearson Heuristic, Atlas-based and Random Forest in 97.4%,
95.8%, and 98.4% of images, respectively. A Majority Vote of these selection
methods resulted in an accuracy of 98.5%. The high accuracy of this pipeline
enables consistent embryonic alignment in the first trimester, enabling
scalable analysis in both clinical and research settings. The code is publicly

### [36] [Generalizing Shape-from-Template to Topological Changes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03459)
*Kevin Manogue,Tomasz M Schang,Dilara Kuş,Jonas Müller,Stefan Zachow,Agniva Sengupta*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduces a topological-change-aware Shape-from-Template (SfT) method that handles tearing/cutting during deformation by iteratively partitioning the template and minimizing an energy balancing physical plausibility and reprojection consistency, outperforming baselines on synthetic and real data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SfT methods struggle when deformations involve topological changes (tears, cuts). There is a need for a principled framework that can accommodate changes in topology during reconstruction of deformable surfaces.

Method: Initialize with a classical SfT solution and iteratively adapt the template by partitioning its spatial domain. The adaptation minimizes an energy functional that jointly enforces physical plausibility of the deformation and reprojection consistency with the image data, enabling topological changes to be represented.

Result: The approach robustly captures a wide range of topological events (tears and cuts) on bounded 2D surfaces and constitutes the first general framework for topological-change-aware SfT. Experiments on synthetic and real data show consistent performance gains over baseline methods.

Conclusion: The paper establishes a general framework for topological-change-aware SfT and demonstrates its effectiveness in handling topology-changing deformations, supported by empirical evidence on synthetic and real datasets.

Abstract: Reconstructing the surfaces of deformable objects from correspondences
between a 3D template and a 2D image is well studied under Shape-from-Template
(SfT) methods; however, existing approaches break down when topological changes
accompany the deformation. We propose a principled extension of SfT that
enables reconstruction in the presence of such changes. Our approach is
initialized with a classical SfT solution and iteratively adapts the template
by partitioning its spatial domain so as to minimize an energy functional that
jointly encodes physical plausibility and reprojection consistency. We
demonstrate that the method robustly captures a wide range of practically
relevant topological events including tears and cuts on bounded 2D surfaces,
thereby establishing the first general framework for topological-change-aware
SfT. Experiments on both synthetic and real data confirm that our approach
consistently outperforms baseline methods.

Motivation: Current parametric human body models rely on costly 3D scans and narrow demographic scope; need open, interpretable, and demographically grounded models to support diverse tasks.

Method: Define a continuous, interpretable shape space controlled by phenotype parameters (gender, age, height, weight) that drive blendshapes across ages, types, and proportions; calibrate shape statistics with WHO population data; generate Anny and Anny-One dataset; demonstrate mm-accurate scan fitting and competitive HMR performance; open-source under Apache 2.0.

Result: Anny provides realistic, demographically grounded shape variation in a single model; mm-accurate scan fitting; HMR trained on Anny matches performance of scan-based models; Anny-One contains 800k photorealistic humans; open release.

Conclusion: Anny offers a simple, fully differentiable, open foundation for 3D human modeling that is broadly representative and controllable, enabling robust data generation and HMR without reliance on proprietary scans.

Abstract: Parametric body models are central to many human-centric tasks, yet existing
models often rely on costly 3D scans and learned shape spaces that are
proprietary and demographically narrow. We introduce Anny, a simple, fully
differentiable, and scan-free human body model grounded in anthropometric
knowledge from the MakeHuman community. Anny defines a continuous,
interpretable shape space, where phenotype parameters (e.g. gender, age,
height, weight) control blendshapes spanning a wide range of human forms --
across ages (from infants to elders), body types, and proportions. Calibrated
using WHO population statistics, it provides realistic and demographically
grounded human shape variation within a single unified model. Thanks to its
openness and semantic control, Anny serves as a versatile foundation for 3D
human modeling -- supporting millimeter-accurate scan fitting, controlled
synthetic data generation, and Human Mesh Recovery (HMR). We further introduce
Anny-One, a collection of 800k photorealistic humans generated with Anny,
showing that despite its simplicity, HMR models trained with Anny can match the
performance of those trained with scan-based body models, while remaining
interpretable and broadly representative. The Anny body model and its code are
released under the Apache 2.0 license, making Anny an accessible foundation for
human-centric 3D modeling.

### [38] [Signal Intensity-weighted coordinate channels improve learning stability and generalisation in 1D and 2D CNNs in localisation tasks on biomedical signals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03645)
*Vittal L. Rao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a signal intensity-weighted coordinate representation that scales coordinate channels by local signal intensity, embedding intensity-position coupling as a simple, modality-agnostic inductive bias for localisation in biomedical data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Coordinate-based approaches like CoordConv enable learning absolute positions, but they neglect the interaction between spatial/temporal position and local signal intensity. This work argues for coupling intensity and position to improve localisation across modalities.

Method: Introduce channels weighted by local signal intensity as an alternative to pure coordinate channels. Evaluate on two tasks: (i) 20-second two-lead ECG morphological-transition timing, (ii) nuclei-centre coordinate regression in SiPaKMeD cytological images. Compare convergence and generalisation against conventional coordinate channels across 1D and 2D signals.

Result: The intensity-weighted coordinate representation yields faster convergence and better generalisation than standard coordinate-channel approaches, in both 1D ECG data and 2D cytology images.

Conclusion: A simple, modality-agnostic inductive bias—intensity-weighted coordinates—improves localisation performance and generalisation across different biomedical signal modalities.

Abstract: Localisation tasks in biomedical data often require models to learn
meaningful spatial or temporal relationships from signals with complex
intensity distributions. A common strategy, exemplified by CoordConv layers, is
to append coordinate channels to convolutional inputs, enabling networks to
learn absolute positions. In this work, we propose a signal intensity-weighted
coordinate representation that replaces the pure coordinate channels with
channels scaled by local signal intensity. This modification embeds an
intensity-position coupling directly in the input representation, introducing a
simple and modality-agnostic inductive bias. We evaluate the approach on two
distinct localisation problems: (i) predicting the time of morphological
transition in 20-second, two-lead ECG signals, and (ii) regressing the
coordinates of nuclear centres in cytological images from the SiPaKMeD dataset.
In both cases, the proposed representation yields faster convergence and higher
generalisation performance relative to conventional coordinate-channel
approaches, demonstrating its effectiveness across both one-dimensional and
two-dimensional biomedical signals.

*Mehdi Sefidgar Dilmaghani,Francis Fowley,Peter Corcoran*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A lightweight 3D CNN for event-based HAR achieving ~94% accuracy with privacy-preserving event cameras; outperforms C3D/ResNet3D/MC3_18 by up to 3% on a composite Toyota Smart Home/ETRI dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Privacy concerns in frame-based HAR, since cameras can capture identifiable information. Event cameras record only changes, offering privacy benefits, and enable edge deployment. The work also tackles class imbalance to improve generalization.

Method: Proposes a compact 3D CNN architecture tailored for event-based data. Employs focal loss with class reweighting and targeted data augmentation. Trained and evaluated on a composite dataset built fromToyota Smart Home and ETRI data.

Result: F1-score of 0.9415 and overall accuracy of 94.17%; performance surpasses benchmark 3D-CNNs (C3D, ResNet3D, MC3_18) by up to 3%.

Conclusion: Demonstrates the potential of event-based deep learning for accurate, efficient, and privacy-aware HAR suitable for real-world edge applications.

Abstract: This paper presents a lightweight three-dimensional convolutional neural
network (3DCNN) for human activity recognition (HAR) using event-based vision
data. Privacy preservation is a key challenge in human monitoring systems, as
conventional frame-based cameras capture identifiable personal information. In
contrast, event cameras record only changes in pixel intensity, providing an
inherently privacy-preserving sensing modality. The proposed network
effectively models both spatial and temporal dynamics while maintaining a
compact design suitable for edge deployment. To address class imbalance and
enhance generalization, focal loss with class reweighting and targeted data
augmentation strategies are employed. The model is trained and evaluated on a
composite dataset derived from the Toyota Smart Home and ETRI datasets.
Experimental results demonstrate an F1-score of 0.9415 and an overall accuracy
of 94.17%, outperforming benchmark 3D-CNN architectures such as C3D, ResNet3D,
and MC3_18 by up to 3%. These results highlight the potential of event-based
deep learning for developing accurate, efficient, and privacy-aware human
action recognition systems suitable for real-world edge applications.

### [40] [Part-Aware Bottom-Up Group Reasoning for Fine-Grained Social Interaction Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03666)
*Dongkeun Kim,Minsu Cho,Suha Kwak*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A part-aware bottom-up framework for fine-grained social interaction detection that uses body-part features and similarity-based reasoning to infer group configurations, achieving state-of-the-art results on the NVI dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing social interaction detection methods rely on holistic representations of individuals and overlook subtle cues (facial expressions, gaze, gestures). They also do not explicitly model interactions between individuals to derive group configurations, leading to ambiguity in interpreting social signals. The work aims to capture localized social signals by leveraging part-level cues and interpersonal relations.

Method: Detect individuals and enhance their features with part-aware cues from body parts; infer group configurations by associating individuals via similarity-based reasoning that accounts for spatial relations and subtle social cues signaling interactions (a bottom-up group reasoning framework).

Result: On the NVI dataset, the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming prior methods.

Conclusion: Part-aware, bottom-up group reasoning using body-part cues and interpersonal relations yields more accurate social interaction detection and clearer group inference than holistic approaches.

Abstract: Social interactions often emerge from subtle, fine-grained cues such as
facial expressions, gaze, and gestures. However, existing methods for social
interaction detection overlook such nuanced cues and primarily rely on holistic
representations of individuals. Moreover, they directly detect social groups
without explicitly modeling the underlying interactions between individuals.
These drawbacks limit their ability to capture localized social signals and
introduce ambiguity when group configurations should be inferred from social
interactions grounded in nuanced cues. In this work, we propose a part-aware
bottom-up group reasoning framework for fine-grained social interaction
detection. The proposed method infers social groups and their interactions
using body part features and their interpersonal relations. Our model first
detects individuals and enhances their features using part-aware cues, and then
infers group configuration by associating individuals via similarity-based
reasoning, which considers not only spatial relations but also subtle social
cues that signal interactions, leading to more accurate group inference.
Experiments on the NVI dataset demonstrate that our method outperforms prior
methods, achieving the new state of the art.

### [41] [Disentangled Concepts Speak Louder Than Words:Explainable Video Action Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03725)
*Jongseo Lee,Wooil Lee,Gyeong-Moon Park,Seong Tae Kim,Jinwoo Choi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DANCE introduces a disentangled, concept-based framework for video action recognition that separates motion dynamics (pose sequences), objects, and scenes to provide clearer explanations while maintaining competitive accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current explainability methods for video action models either rely on saliency, which entangles motion and context, or on language-based approaches that struggle to explain motion itself. There is a need for a framework that explicitly disentangles motion from context to improve interpretability and support debugging.

Method: DANCE uses an ante-hoc concept bottleneck with three concept types: motion dynamics (human pose sequences), objects, and scenes. An LLM automatically extracts object and scene concepts, and the model is trained to predict actions through these concepts only, enabling disentangled explanations. Evaluation is conducted on four datasets (KTH, Penn Action, HAA500, UCF-101) and includes a user study.

Result: DANCE yields significantly clearer explanations and competitive action recognition performance across datasets. The user study supports improved interpretability, and the framework proves beneficial for model debugging, editing, and failure analysis.

Conclusion: DANCE demonstrates that explicit disentanglement of motion, objects, and scenes via a concept bottleneck plus LLM-derived concepts can provide interpretable explanations without sacrificing performance, offering practical value for debugging and refinement of video action models.

Abstract: Effective explanations of video action recognition models should disentangle
how movements unfold over time from the surrounding spatial context. However,
existing methods based on saliency produce entangled explanations, making it
unclear whether predictions rely on motion or spatial context. Language-based
approaches offer structure but often fail to explain motions due to their tacit
nature -- intuitively understood but difficult to verbalize. To address these
challenges, we propose Disentangled Action aNd Context concept-based
Explainable (DANCE) video action recognition, a framework that predicts actions
through disentangled concept types: motion dynamics, objects, and scenes. We
define motion dynamics concepts as human pose sequences. We employ a large
language model to automatically extract object and scene concepts. Built on an
ante-hoc concept bottleneck design, DANCE enforces prediction through these
concepts. Experiments on four datasets -- KTH, Penn Action, HAA500, and UCF-101
-- demonstrate that DANCE significantly improves explanation clarity with
competitive performance. We validate the superior interpretability of DANCE
through a user study. Experimental results also show that DANCE is beneficial
for model debugging, editing, and failure analysis.

*Swadhin Agrawal,Sujoy Bhore,Joseph S. B. Mitchell,P. B. Sujit,Aayush Gohil*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: NP-hard intruder search in orthogonal polygons; proposes three algorithms (space-filling curve, random search, cooperative random search); analyzes trade-offs between number of robots and search time considering geometry.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address robust intruder search with limited sensing in constrained geometric domains; NP-hardness motivates heuristic methods.

Method: Develop and study three algorithmic approaches: space-filling curve-based coverage, randomized search, and cooperative randomized search; evaluate performance trade-offs (robots vs. time) with respect to the geometry of the connected orthogonal search area.

Result: Establishes NP-hardness even for a stationary intruder; proposes space-filling curve, random search, and cooperative random search algorithms; analyzes trade-offs between robot count and completion time with geometry-aware considerations.

Conclusion: Intractability motivates robust heuristic methods; space-filling curve and random-search based strategies appear scalable and robust for searching in connected orthogonal domains; effectiveness depends on geometric properties and resource constraints; a formal performance analysis would guide practical deployment.

Abstract: We consider the problem of searching for an intruder in a geometric domain by
utilizing multiple search robots. The domain is a simply connected orthogonal
polygon with edges parallel to the cartesian coordinate axes. Each robot has a
limited sensing capability. We study the problem for both static and mobile
intruders. It turns out that the problem of finding an intruder is NP-hard,
even for a stationary intruder. Given this intractability, we turn our
attention towards developing efficient and robust algorithms, namely methods
based on space-filling curves, random search, and cooperative random search.
Moreover, for each proposed algorithm, we evaluate the trade-off between the
number of search robots and the time required for the robots to complete the
search process while considering the geometric properties of the connected
orthogonal search area.

### [43] [Toward an Agricultural Operational Design Domain: A Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02937)
*Mirco Felske,Jannik Redenius,Georg Happich,Julius Schöning*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Proposes the Ag-ODD Framework to describe and verify the operational boundaries of autonomous agricultural systems, integrating ASAM Open ODD and CityGML, with an extended 7-Layer Model including a process layer, plus an iterative verification approach; demonstrated by use cases for standardization and scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The agricultural domain presents combined driving and working operations in variable, complex environments; existing ODD concepts are insufficient to capture these unique constraints, hindering consistent development and validation of autonomous agricultural systems.

Method: Introduce the Agricultural ODD (Ag-ODD) Framework consisting of (1) an Ag-ODD description concept that structures environmental and operational parameters using ASAM Open ODD and CityGML, (2) an extended 7-Layer Model (from PEGASUS 6-Layer) with an added process layer to model dynamic agricultural operations, and (3) an iterative verification process that checks the Ag-ODD against logical scenarios derived from the 7-Layer Model to ensure completeness and consistency.

Result: A consistent approach for creating unambiguous and verifiable Ag-ODDs, with demonstrative use cases showing how the framework can standardize and scale environmental descriptions for autonomous agricultural systems.

Conclusion: The Ag-ODD Framework addresses the unique challenges of agricultural automation by enabling standardized, verifiable environmental descriptions that support reliable development, validation, and scalability of autonomous agricultural systems.

Abstract: The agricultural sector increasingly relies on autonomous systems that
operate in complex and variable environments. Unlike on-road applications,
agricultural automation integrates driving and working processes, each of which
imposes distinct operational constraints. Handling this complexity and ensuring
consistency throughout the development and validation processes requires a
structured, transparent, and verified description of the environment. However,
existing Operational Design Domain (ODD) concepts do not yet address the unique
challenges of agricultural applications.
  Therefore, this work introduces the Agricultural ODD (Ag-ODD) Framework,
which can be used to describe and verify the operational boundaries of
autonomous agricultural systems. The Ag-ODD Framework consists of three core
elements. First, the Ag-ODD description concept, which provides a structured
method for unambiguously defining environmental and operational parameters
using concepts from ASAM Open ODD and CityGML. Second, the 7-Layer Model
derived from the PEGASUS 6-Layer Model, has been extended to include a process
layer to capture dynamic agricultural operations. Third, the iterative
verification process verifies the Ag-ODD against its corresponding logical
scenarios, derived from the 7-Layer Model, to ensure the Ag-ODD's completeness
and consistency.
  Together, these elements provide a consistent approach for creating
unambiguous and verifiable Ag-ODD. Demonstrative use cases show how the Ag-ODD
Framework can support the standardization and scalability of environmental
descriptions for autonomous agricultural systems.

*Syed Mostaquim Ali,Taufiq Rahman,Ghazal Farhani,Mohamed H. Zaki,Benoit Anctil,Dominique Charlebois*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Density Aware Chamfer Distance (DCD) best matches real and simulated LiDAR in a VTE; results show similar perception despite geometric differences, highlighting DCD as a robust evaluation metric.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Develop safe autonomous driving by validating Virtual Testing Environments (VTE) against real-world LiDAR data; affordable and safe testing requires robust metrics to ensure VTE realism for perception and geometry.

Method: Systematically evaluate metrics for real-vs-sim LiDAR comparison under varying noise, density, distortion, orientation, and channel settings; identify DCD as top metric; construct a VTE from real LiDAR scans in a controlled static scene; generate simulated scans with identical poses; compare across perception (semantic segmentation) and geometry (DCD).

Result: DCD performed best across scenarios. Real and simulated scans yielded a similar semantic segmentation output (mIoU = 21% with corrected intensity) and a DCD of 0.63, indicating modest geometric differences; among metrics, DCD showed the strongest correlation with perception outcomes.

Conclusion: DCD is a robust metric for assessing LiDAR realism in VTE against real data. While perception alignment is observed, geometric fidelity shows gaps, suggesting DCD as a preferred metric and room for improving geometric fidelity in VTE.

Abstract: For developing safe Autonomous Driving Systems (ADS), rigorous testing is
required before they are deemed safe for road deployments. Since comprehensive
conventional physical testing is impractical due to cost and safety concerns,
Virtual Testing Environments (VTE) can be adopted as an alternative. Comparing
VTE-generated sensor outputs against their real-world analogues can be a strong
indication that the VTE accurately represents reality. Correspondingly, this
work explores a comprehensive experimental approach to finding evaluation
metrics suitable for comparing real-world and simulated LiDAR scans. The
metrics were tested in terms of sensitivity and accuracy with different noise,
density, distortion, sensor orientation, and channel settings. From comparing
the metrics, we found that Density Aware Chamfer Distance (DCD) works best
across all cases. In the second step of the research, a Virtual Testing
Environment was generated using real LiDAR scan data. The data was collected in
a controlled environment with only static objects using an instrumented vehicle
equipped with LiDAR, IMU and cameras. Simulated LiDAR scans were generated from
the VTEs using the same pose as real LiDAR scans. The simulated and LiDAR scans
were compared in terms of model perception and geometric similarity. Actual and
simulated LiDAR scans have a similar semantic segmentation output with a mIoU
of 21\% with corrected intensity and an average density aware chamfer distance
(DCD) of 0.63. This indicates a slight difference in the geometric properties
of simulated and real LiDAR scans and a significant difference between model
outputs. During the comparison, density-aware chamfer distance was found to be
the most correlated among the metrics with perception methods.

*Markus Buchholz,Ignacio Carlucho,Yvan R. Petillot*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: AURA is a collaborative framework integrating LLMs, a high-fidelity digital twin, and human-in-the-loop to detect and respond to anomalies in real time, using two specialized agents (state anomaly characterization and diagnostic reasoning) and a feedback loop to distill expert knowledge into the AI.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Safe deployment of autonomous systems in safety-critical settings requires combining human expertise with AI to handle unforeseen anomalies and to continuously improve the AI through expert knowledge distillation.

Method: Two-agent architecture: (1) a low-level State Anomaly Characterization Agent that monitors telemetry and converts signals into structured natural-language problem descriptions; (2) a high-level Diagnostic Reasoning Agent that engages a human operator in knowledge-grounded dialogue to identify root causes using external sources. A high-fidelity digital twin and LLMs support perception and reasoning. Diagnoses are validated by humans and turned into training examples to refine the low-level perceptual model, creating a loop that distills expert knowledge into the AI.

Result: Proposes a concrete implementation and patterns for trustworthy, continually improving human-robot teams, demonstrating how expert knowledge can be transformed into adaptive AI capabilities.

Conclusion: AURA provides principled operating guidelines for combining AI with human expertise in robotics, illustrating how to build an adaptive partnership rather than a static tool and outlining a path toward trustworthy, evolving autonomy.

Abstract: The safe deployment of autonomous systems in safety-critical settings
requires a paradigm that combines human expertise with AI-driven analysis,
especially when anomalies are unforeseen. We introduce AURA (Autonomous
Resilience Agent), a collaborative framework for anomaly and fault diagnostics
in robotics. AURA integrates large language models (LLMs), a high-fidelity
digital twin (DT), and human-in-the-loop interaction to detect and respond to
anomalous behavior in real time. The architecture uses two agents with clear
roles: (i) a low-level State Anomaly Characterization Agent that monitors
telemetry and converts signals into a structured natural-language problem
description, and (ii) a high-level Diagnostic Reasoning Agent that conducts a
knowledge-grounded dialogue with an operator to identify root causes, drawing
on external sources. Human-validated diagnoses are then converted into new
training examples that refine the low-level perceptual model. This feedback
loop progressively distills expert knowledge into the AI, transforming it from
a static tool into an adaptive partner. We describe the framework's operating
principles and provide a concrete implementation, establishing a pattern for
trustworthy, continually improving human-robot teams.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A model-based robot planning approach trained from play data using a diffusion-based action sampler and MCTS to plan action sequences, executed via MPC, showing improvements over behavior cloning in real tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Policy-based BC is data-hungry and difficult to transfer across tasks; collecting task-specific demonstrations and resets is costly. A data-efficient model-based method that learns from unstructured play data can enable planning and generalization.

Method: Train an action-conditioned visual world model from play data; learn a diffusion-based action sampler (and optional reward model); use the world model + sampler + reward to optimize long action sequences with Monte Carlo Tree Search; execute plans with a zeroth-order Model Predictive Controller.

Result: The action sampler helps mitigate hallucinations of the world model during planning. On three real-world robotic tasks with varying planning/modeling complexity, planning with the proposed approach significantly improves over BC baselines in a standard manipulation test environment.

Conclusion: Planning with a learned world model and diffusion-based action sampler enables data-efficient, effective long-horizon control for real robots, outperforming policy-based BC in the reported tasks.

Abstract: Robots must understand their environment from raw sensory inputs and reason
about the consequences of their actions in it to solve complex tasks. Behavior
Cloning (BC) leverages task-specific human demonstrations to learn this
knowledge as end-to-end policies. However, these policies are difficult to
transfer to new tasks, and generating training data is challenging because it
requires careful demonstrations and frequent environment resets. In contrast to
such policy-based view, in this paper we take a model-based approach where we
collect a few hours of unstructured easy-to-collect play data to learn an
action-conditioned visual world model, a diffusion-based action sampler, and
optionally a reward model. The world model -- in combination with the action
sampler and a reward model -- is then used to optimize long sequences of
actions with a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) planner. The resulting plans are
executed on the robot via a zeroth-order Model Predictive Controller (MPC). We
show that the action sampler mitigates hallucinations of the world model during
planning and validate our approach on 3 real-world robotic tasks with varying
levels of planning and modeling complexity. Our experiments support the
hypothesis that planning leads to a significant improvement over BC baselines
on a standard manipulation test environment.

TL;DR: An open-source framework, libname, converts a low-cost 3D printer into an automated probing setup to collect labeled data for calibrating vision-based tactile sensors (DIGIT and GelSight Mini), enabling CNN-based depth reconstruction, with ablation studies and generalization tests.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Calibration of tactile sensors is essential but currently ad hoc and labor-intensive; automating this process is needed to scale tactile sensing in robotics.

Method: Develop libname; repurpose a 3D printer as a high-volume probing rig to generate labeled tactile data; calibrate DIGIT and GelSight Mini using collected data and train a custom CNN to reconstruct depth maps; run ablation to determine data requirements; test generalization on unseen objects.

Result: Demonstrated accurate depth map reconstruction; ablation study yields practical data-volume guidelines; models generalize to unseen objects; open-source tool to simplify deployment.

Conclusion: Automated tactile calibration with libname can accelerate tactile sensing research and facilitate integration of tactile sensing into robotic systems; promotes broad adoption.

Abstract: Tactile sensing plays a key role in enabling dexterous and reliable robotic
manipulation, but realizing this capability requires substantial calibration to
convert raw sensor readings into physically meaningful quantities. Despite its
near-universal necessity, the calibration process remains ad hoc and
labor-intensive. Here, we introduce \libname{}, an open-source library that
transforms a low-cost 3D printer into an automated probing device capable of
generating large volumes of labeled training data for tactile sensor
calibration. We demonstrate the utility of \libname{} by calibrating two
commercially available vision-based tactile sensors, DIGIT and GelSight Mini,
to reconstruct high-quality depth maps using the collected data and a custom
convolutional neural network. In addition, we perform a data ablation study to
determine how much data is needed for accurate calibration, providing practical
guidelines for researchers working with these specific sensors, and we
benchmark the trained models on previously unseen objects to evaluate
calibration accuracy and generalization performance. By automating tactile
sensor calibration, \libname{} can accelerate tactile sensing research,
simplify sensor deployment, and promote the practical integration of tactile
sensing in robotic platforms.

TL;DR: SENT-Map is a semantically enhanced, JSON-encoded topological map for indoor robotics that enables planning with vision-and-language foundation models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable robust FM-based planning for indoor navigation/manipulation by grounding semantics in a combinable, editable map and preventing infeasible plans by anchoring to existing nodes.

Method: A two-stage process: (1) map the environment with an operator using a Vision-FM to build a SENT-Map in JSON; (2) plan using the SENT-Map and a natural-language query within a foundation model.

Result: Experiments show that semantic enhancement allows even small, locally deployable FMs to successfully plan over indoor environments.

Conclusion: Semantically enriched topological maps like SENT-Map enable FM-driven planning for indoor robotics, expanding the utility of compact FMs and improving plan feasibility through grounding.

Abstract: We introduce SENT-Map, a semantically enhanced topological map for
representing indoor environments, designed to support autonomous navigation and
manipulation by leveraging advancements in foundational models (FMs). Through
representing the environment in a JSON text format, we enable semantic
information to be added and edited in a format that both humans and FMs
understand, while grounding the robot to existing nodes during planning to
avoid infeasible states during deployment. Our proposed framework employs a two
stage approach, first mapping the environment alongside an operator with a
Vision-FM, then using the SENT-Map representation alongside a natural-language
query within an FM for planning. Our experimental results show that
semantic-enhancement enables even small locally-deployable FMs to successfully
plan over indoor environments.

TL;DR: A motion-prior-guided DRL approach enables natural, robust gait learning on a real hexapod, using a priors-based discriminator to shape learning and successful policy transfer without vision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Coordinate multiple legs in a large action exploration space to achieve natural and robust gaits for complex terrains, enabling stable locomotion with a real hexapod.

Method: Generate a dataset of optimized motion priors; train an adversarial discriminator on priors to guide DRL; learn a policy on a hexapod and transfer it to the real robot.

Result: The policy transfers to the real hexapod, producing natural gait patterns and robust locomotion on complex terrains without visual input; claims to be the first RL controller achieving complex-terrain walking on a real hexapod.

Conclusion: Demonstrates the effectiveness of motion-prior-based guidance and adversarial shaping for real-robot legged locomotion, enabling natural, robust gait learning in multi-legged systems.

Abstract: Multi-legged robots offer enhanced stability to navigate complex terrains
with their multiple legs interacting with the environment. However, how to
effectively coordinate the multiple legs in a larger action exploration space
to generate natural and robust movements is a key issue. In this paper, we
introduce a motion prior-based approach, successfully applying deep
reinforcement learning algorithms to a real hexapod robot. We generate a
dataset of optimized motion priors, and train an adversarial discriminator
based on the priors to guide the hexapod robot to learn natural gaits. The
learned policy is then successfully transferred to a real hexapod robot, and
demonstrate natural gait patterns and remarkable robustness without visual
information in complex terrains. This is the first time that a reinforcement
learning controller has been used to achieve complex terrain walking on a real
hexapod robot.

*Rewida Ali,Cristian C. Beltran-Hernandez,Weiwei Wan,Kensuke Harada*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A unified transformer-based policy START integrates LLM-driven planning with sub-task grounded learning for long-horizon deformable-object manipulation (gift wrapping), achieving 97% success by bridging high-level intent and low-level force control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deformable objects pose unpredictable dynamics and require adaptive force control; gift wrapping is a representative long-horizon task demanding precise folds and secure fixation; to enable robust, flexible human-robot collaboration in such contexts.

Method: A learning framework combining an LLM-powered high-level task planner with a low-level hybrid imitation/RL policy. The Sub-task Aware Robotic Transformer (START) learns a unified policy from human demonstrations and explicitly grounds temporal structure with sub-task IDs, enabling long-range dependencies beyond short action chunks; the approach generalizes ACT to long tasks and supports controlled supervision.

Result: Real-world experiments yield 97% success in wrapping tasks; the unified transformer reduces reliance on specialized models, enables supervision, and aligns high-level intent with the fine-grained force control needed for deformable object manipulation.

Conclusion: The START-based framework offers a robust, scalable approach for long-horizon deformable manipulation by fusing planning with grounded, sub-task-aware learning, with potential applicability to other deformable-object tasks beyond gift wrapping.

Abstract: Human-robot cooperation is essential in environments such as warehouses and
retail stores, where workers frequently handle deformable objects like paper,
bags, and fabrics. Coordinating robotic actions with human assistance remains
difficult due to the unpredictable dynamics of deformable materials and the
need for adaptive force control. To explore this challenge, we focus on the
task of gift wrapping, which exemplifies a long-horizon manipulation problem
involving precise folding, controlled creasing, and secure fixation of paper.
Success is achieved when the robot completes the sequence to produce a neatly
wrapped package with clean folds and no tears.
  We propose a learning-based framework that integrates a high-level task
planner powered by a large language model (LLM) with a low-level hybrid
imitation learning (IL) and reinforcement learning (RL) policy. At its core is
a Sub-task Aware Robotic Transformer (START) that learns a unified policy from
human demonstrations. The key novelty lies in capturing long-range temporal
dependencies across the full wrapping sequence within a single model. Unlike
vanilla Action Chunking with Transformer (ACT), typically applied to short
tasks, our method introduces sub-task IDs that provide explicit temporal
grounding. This enables robust performance across the entire wrapping process
and supports flexible execution, as the policy learns sub-goals rather than
merely replicating motion sequences.
  Our framework achieves a 97% success rate on real-world wrapping tasks. We
show that the unified transformer-based policy reduces the need for specialized
models, allows controlled human supervision, and effectively bridges high-level
intent with the fine-grained force control required for deformable object
manipulation.

### [51] [Collaborative Assembly Policy Learning of a Sightless Robot](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03189)
*Zeqing Zhang,Weifeng Lu,Lei Yang,Wei Jing,Bowei Tang,Jia Pan*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A novel RL approach augmented with a human-designed admittance controller improves performance in a pHRC board insertion task over standard admittance control, reducing human effort and contact forces.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In physical human-robot collaboration tasks with blind robots, estimating human intent from force/torque is hard, and RL methods face safety constraints and sparse rewards. There is a need for more proactive robot assistance that reduces human effort in delicate insertion tasks.

Method: Introduce an RL framework that leverages a human-designed admittance controller to guide the robot, enabling more active behavior. Evaluate in simulation and real-world board-in-frame insertion tasks, comparing against admittance control. Metrics include success rate, task completion time, and measured force/torque.

Result: The proposed RL-with-admittance approach outperforms pure admittance control in success rate and shorter task completion time, with a significant reduction in measured force/torque.

Conclusion: Integrating a human-admittance controller within RL improves pHRC performance for board insertion, enhancing safety and efficiency. Results suggest potential generalization to similar physical collaboration tasks; a video of experiments is provided.

Abstract: This paper explores a physical human-robot collaboration (pHRC) task
involving the joint insertion of a board into a frame by a sightless robot and
a human operator. While admittance control is commonly used in pHRC tasks, it
can be challenging to measure the force/torque applied by the human for
accurate human intent estimation, limiting the robot's ability to assist in the
collaborative task. Other methods that attempt to solve pHRC tasks using
reinforcement learning (RL) are also unsuitable for the board-insertion task
due to its safety constraints and sparse rewards. Therefore, we propose a novel
RL approach that utilizes a human-designed admittance controller to facilitate
more active robot behavior and reduce human effort. Through simulation and
real-world experiments, we demonstrate that our approach outperforms admittance
control in terms of success rate and task completion time. Additionally, we
observed a significant reduction in measured force/torque when using our
proposed approach compared to admittance control. The video of the experiments
is available at https://youtu.be/va07Gw6YIog.

### [52] [GUIDES: Guidance Using Instructor-Distilled Embeddings for Pre-trained Robot Policy Enhancement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03400)
*Minquan Gao,Xinyi Li,Qing Yan,Xiaojian Sun,Xiaopan Zhang,Chien-Ming Huang,Jiachen Li*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: GUIDES is a lightweight framework that augments pre-trained robot policies with semantic guidance from foundation models without redesigning architectures, improving success rates and precision in simulation and real robot tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pre-trained robot policies lack the semantic awareness of foundation models; replacing them is costly and risks losing accumulated embodied knowledge.

Method: Use a fine-tuned vision-language model (Instructor) to generate contextual instructions; encode them into guidance embeddings via an auxiliary module; inject into the policy's latent space with brief targeted fine-tuning; at inference, an LLM-based Reflector monitors Instructor confidence and, when low, runs a reasoning loop to analyze history, retrieve examples, and augment context to refine actions.

Result: Validated across RoboCasa simulations with diverse policy architectures, showing substantial improvements in task success rates; real-world UR5 deployment demonstrated improved motion precision for grasping and other sub-tasks.

Conclusion: GUIDES offers a practical, resource-efficient pathway to upgrade existing, validated robot policies by adding semantic guidance rather than replacing them.

Abstract: Pre-trained robot policies serve as the foundation of many validated robotic
systems, which encapsulate extensive embodied knowledge. However, they often
lack the semantic awareness characteristic of foundation models, and replacing
them entirely is impractical in many situations due to high costs and the loss
of accumulated knowledge. To address this gap, we introduce GUIDES, a
lightweight framework that augments pre-trained policies with semantic guidance
from foundation models without requiring architectural redesign. GUIDES employs
a fine-tuned vision-language model (Instructor) to generate contextual
instructions, which are encoded by an auxiliary module into guidance
embeddings. These embeddings are injected into the policy's latent space,
allowing the legacy model to adapt to this new semantic input through brief,
targeted fine-tuning. For inference-time robustness, a large language
model-based Reflector monitors the Instructor's confidence and, when confidence
is low, initiates a reasoning loop that analyzes execution history, retrieves
relevant examples, and augments the VLM's context to refine subsequent actions.
Extensive validation in the RoboCasa simulation environment across diverse
policy architectures shows consistent and substantial improvements in task
success rates. Real-world deployment on a UR5 robot further demonstrates that
GUIDES enhances motion precision for critical sub-tasks such as grasping.
Overall, GUIDES offers a practical and resource-efficient pathway to upgrade,
rather than replace, validated robot policies.

*Vesna Poprcova,Iulia Lefter,Martijn Warnier,Frances Brazier*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Participatory design with mental health researchers elicits core values for socially assistive robots to support social anxiety, highlighting adaptivity, acceptance, and efficacy and stressing a research-led, user-centered, context-aware design approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Social anxiety is common and inadequately treated; advances in social robotics may complement traditional mental health care, but meaningful, acceptable, and helpful robot interventions require understanding the values of stakeholders.

Method: A participatory design workshop involving mental health academic researchers, using creative, reflective, and envisioning activities to systematically elicit values, expectations, needs, and preferences for robot-supported interventions.

Result: Identified key design values—adaptivity, acceptance, and efficacy—along with a demonstrated importance of value elicitation and context-aware, user-centered design in developing socially assistive robots for social anxiety.

Conclusion: A research-led, value-centered design approach is crucial for creating effective socially assistive robots for social anxiety, with future work translating elicited values into concrete design guidelines and iterative development.

Abstract: Social anxiety is a prevalent mental health condition that can significantly
impact overall well-being and quality of life. Despite its widespread effects,
adequate support or treatment for social anxiety is often insufficient.
Advances in technology, particularly in social robotics, offer promising
opportunities to complement traditional mental health. As an initial step
toward developing effective solutions, it is essential to understand the values
that shape what is considered meaningful, acceptable, and helpful. In this
study, a participatory design workshop was conducted with mental health
academic researchers to elicit the underlying values that should inform the
design of socially assistive robots for social anxiety support. Through
creative, reflective, and envisioning activities, participants explored
scenarios and design possibilities, allowing for systematic elicitation of
values, expectations, needs, and preferences related to robot-supported
interventions. The findings reveal rich insights into design-relevant
values-including adaptivity, acceptance, and efficacy-that are core to support
for individuals with social anxiety. This study highlights the significance of
a research-led approach to value elicitation, emphasising user-centred and
context-aware design considerations in the development of socially assistive
robots.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A lightweight, cable-driven dexterous hand (Dex-Hand 021) with proprioceptive force sensing and admittance control achieves high dexterity (19 DoFs) and strong manipulation performance in a 1 kg package, outperforming PID in torque efficiency and enabling numerous grasp tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To replicate human-like dexterity while meeting engineering constraints (size, weight, durability, and force sensing) for industrial robotic manipulation.

Method: Introduce Dex-Hand 021: a five-finger, 12 active and 7 passive DoFs (19 DoFs total dexterity) cable-driven in a 1 kg design; employ proprioceptive force-sensing-based admittance control; evaluate via single-finger load tests, fingertip repeatability, force estimation accuracy, torque comparisons to PID, and execution of 33 GRASP taxonomy motions.

Result: Single-finger load >10 N; fingertip repeatability <0.001 m; force estimation error <0.2 N; joint torques in multi-object grasping reduced by 31.19% vs PID; enhanced force-sensing and overload protection during collisions; capable of both power and precision grasps and complex manipulation tasks (33 GRASP motions).

Conclusion: The work advances lightweight, industrial-grade dexterous hand design and enhances proprioceptive control, contributing to improved robotic manipulation and intelligent manufacturing.

Abstract: The human hand plays a vital role in daily life and industrial applications,
yet replicating its multifunctional capabilities-including motion, sensing, and
coordinated manipulation-with robotic systems remains a formidable challenge.
Developing a dexterous robotic hand requires balancing human-like agility with
engineering constraints such as complexity, size-to-weight ratio, durability,
and force-sensing performance. This letter presents Dex-Hand 021, a
high-performance, cable-driven five-finger robotic hand with 12 active and 7
passive degrees of freedom (DoFs), achieving 19 DoFs dexterity in a lightweight
1 kg design. We propose a proprioceptive force-sensing-based admittance control
method to enhance manipulation. Experimental results demonstrate its superior
performance: a single-finger load capacity exceeding 10 N, fingertip
repeatability under 0.001 m, and force estimation errors below 0.2 N. Compared
to PID control, joint torques in multi-object grasping are reduced by 31.19%,
significantly improves force-sensing capability while preventing overload
during collisions. The hand excels in both power and precision grasps,
successfully executing 33 GRASP taxonomy motions and complex manipulation
tasks. This work advances the design of lightweight, industrial-grade dexterous
hands and enhances proprioceptive control, contributing to robotic manipulation
and intelligent manufacturing.

*Lei Fu,Sahar Salimpour,Leonardo Militano,Harry Edelman,Jorge Peña Queralta,Giovanni Toffetti*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Presents MCP-ROSbags, a server for analyzing ROS/ROS2 bag data with natural language via LLMs/VLMs, featuring a UI to benchmark tool-calling across models; finds large variation in tool-use performance and highlights design factors like tool schemas, arg count, and tool count; code released.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a sparse intersection between agentic embodied AI and robotics data analysis. The work targets enabling natural-language-driven analysis of robot data (ROS bags) to support agentic decision-making and embodied AI workflows; it also contributes a benchmark for tool-calling capabilities across LLMs/VLMs in robotics contexts.

Method: Develop an MCP server capable of analyzing ROS/ROS2 bag data, supporting trajectories, laser scans, transforms, and time-series. Integrates with ROS 2 CLI tools, offers filtering by topics/time, and provides a lightweight UI to benchmark eight LLM/VLM models (proprietary and open-source). Conducts experiments to evaluate tool-calling performance and identify factors affecting success (tool description schemas, argument counts, and total tools).

Result: Empirical results show a marked divide in tool-calling capabilities among models. Kimi K2 and Claude Sonnet 4 achieve superior performance in tool usage. Multiple factors influence success rates, including how tools are described, the number of arguments, and the number of tools available. The work also demonstrates practical tooling for robotics data analysis and releases code under a permissive license.

Conclusion: MCP-ROSbags demonstrates the viability of natural-language-driven analysis of robotics data and highlights critical design considerations for tool-calling in embodied AI contexts. The findings provide actionable guidance for future tool protocol design and model selection, and the codebase enables further research and benchmarking.

Abstract: Agentic AI systems and Physical or Embodied AI systems have been two key
research verticals at the forefront of Artificial Intelligence and Robotics,
with Model Context Protocol (MCP) increasingly becoming a key component and
enabler of agentic applications. However, the literature at the intersection of
these verticals, i.e., Agentic Embodied AI, remains scarce. This paper
introduces an MCP server for analyzing ROS and ROS 2 bags, allowing for
analyzing, visualizing and processing robot data with natural language through
LLMs and VLMs. We describe specific tooling built with robotics domain
knowledge, with our initial release focused on mobile robotics and supporting
natively the analysis of trajectories, laser scan data, transforms, or time
series data. This is in addition to providing an interface to standard ROS 2
CLI tools ("ros2 bag list" or "ros2 bag info"), as well as the ability to
filter bags with a subset of topics or trimmed in time. Coupled with the MCP
server, we provide a lightweight UI that allows the benchmarking of the tooling
with different LLMs, both proprietary (Anthropic, OpenAI) and open-source
(through Groq). Our experimental results include the analysis of tool calling
capabilities of eight different state-of-the-art LLM/VLM models, both
proprietary and open-source, large and small. Our experiments indicate that
there is a large divide in tool calling capabilities, with Kimi K2 and Claude
Sonnet 4 demonstrating clearly superior performance. We also conclude that
there are multiple factors affecting the success rates, from the tool
description schema to the number of arguments, as well as the number of tools
available to the models. The code is available with a permissive license at

### [56] [Indicating Robot Vision Capabilities with Augmented Reality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03550)
*Hong Wang,Ridhima Phatak,James Ocampo,Zhao Han*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Four AR-based FoV indicators (egocentric to allocentric) were evaluated to align lay perceptions of robot vision; allocentric task-space indicator yielded highest accuracy but slower interpretation; deeper-eye-socket ego indicator increased accuracy; high confidence and low workload across indicators; provides six practitioner guidelines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Humans misperceive robots' field of view, leading to failures in human-robot collaboration; need communicative aids to align mental models of robot vision.

Method: Develop four FoV indicators displayed in AR, spanning egocentric to allocentric; conduct a user study (N=41) measuring accuracy, confidence, task efficiency, workload; compare indicators; assess both AR cues and potential physical alteration (eye sockets).

Result: Allocentric task-space indicator achieved highest accuracy with a detectable delay in interpreting the robot's FoV; deep-eye-socket egocentric indicator also improved accuracy; confidence remained high and cognitive load low across indicators.

Conclusion: AR-based FoV indicators and related physical alterations can align humans' mental models of robot vision; provide six practitioner guidelines for applying indicators or alterations.

Abstract: Research indicates that humans can mistakenly assume that robots and humans
have the same field of view (FoV), possessing an inaccurate mental model of
robots. This misperception may lead to failures during human-robot
collaboration tasks where robots might be asked to complete impossible tasks
about out-of-view objects. The issue is more severe when robots do not have a
chance to scan the scene to update their world model while focusing on assigned
tasks. To help align humans' mental models of robots' vision capabilities, we
propose four FoV indicators in augmented reality (AR) and conducted a user
human-subjects experiment (N=41) to evaluate them in terms of accuracy,
confidence, task efficiency, and workload. These indicators span a spectrum
from egocentric (robot's eye and head space) to allocentric (task space).
Results showed that the allocentric blocks at the task space had the highest
accuracy with a delay in interpreting the robot's FoV. The egocentric indicator
of deeper eye sockets, possible for physical alteration, also increased
accuracy. In all indicators, participants' confidence was high while cognitive
load remained low. Finally, we contribute six guidelines for practitioners to
apply our AR indicators or physical alterations to align humans' mental models
with robots' vision capabilities.

### [57] [OneOcc: Semantic Occupancy Prediction for Legged Robots with a Single Panoramic Camera](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03571)
*Hao Shi,Ze Wang,Shangwei Guo,Mengfei Duan,Song Wang,Teng Chen,Kailun Yang,Lin Wang,Kaiwei Wang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: OneOcc is a vision-only panoramic semantic occupancy framework for legged/humanoid robots that fuses dual projections, reasons in dual voxel grids, uses a lightweight hierarchical mixture-of-experts decoder, and includes motion compensation without extra sensors; it achieves state-of-the-art results on two panoramic benchmarks and provides public data/code.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robust 3D semantic occupancy for legged/humanoid robots is hampered by gait-induced motion and 360-degree sensing gaps; existing SSC systems mostly target wheeled platforms with forward sensors, leaving full-surround perception under motion unaddressed. OneOcc aims to close this gap with a vision-only panoramic SSC pipeline and practical transcripts for real robots.

Method: DP-ER: dual-projection fusion leveraging annular panorama and equirectangular unfolding to preserve 360-degree continuity; Bi-Grid Voxelization (BGV) reasoning in Cartesian and cylindrical-polar spaces to reduce discretization bias and sharpen boundaries; lightweight decoder with Hierarchical AMoE-3D for dynamic multi-scale fusion and long-range/occlusion reasoning; plug-and-play Gait Displacement Compensation (GDC) for feature-level motion correction without extra sensors; release of two panoramic occupancy benchmarks: QuadOcc and Human360Occ (H3O).

Result: OneOcc achieves state-of-the-art on QuadOcc, beating strong vision baselines and popular LiDAR baselines; on H3O it achieves +3.83 mIoU (within-city) and +8.08 (cross-city). The modules are lightweight, enabling deployable full-surround perception for legged/humanoid robots; datasets and code will be publicly available.

Conclusion: OneOcc provides a modular, vision-only solution for panoramic SSC tailored to gait-aware robots, addressing motion-induced jitter and 360-degree coverage with efficient components and public benchmarks, potentially accelerating real-world deployment of full-surround perception.

Abstract: Robust 3D semantic occupancy is crucial for legged/humanoid robots, yet most
semantic scene completion (SSC) systems target wheeled platforms with
forward-facing sensors. We present OneOcc, a vision-only panoramic SSC
framework designed for gait-introduced body jitter and 360{\deg} continuity.
OneOcc combines: (i) Dual-Projection fusion (DP-ER) to exploit the annular
panorama and its equirectangular unfolding, preserving 360{\deg} continuity and
grid alignment; (ii) Bi-Grid Voxelization (BGV) to reason in Cartesian and
cylindrical-polar spaces, reducing discretization bias and sharpening
free/occupied boundaries; (iii) a lightweight decoder with Hierarchical AMoE-3D
for dynamic multi-scale fusion and better long-range/occlusion reasoning; and
(iv) plug-and-play Gait Displacement Compensation (GDC) learning feature-level
motion correction without extra sensors. We also release two panoramic
occupancy benchmarks: QuadOcc (real quadruped, first-person 360{\deg}) and
Human360Occ (H3O) (CARLA human-ego 360{\deg} with RGB, Depth, semantic
occupancy; standardized within-/cross-city splits). OneOcc sets new
state-of-the-art (SOTA): on QuadOcc it beats strong vision baselines and
popular LiDAR ones; on H3O it gains +3.83 mIoU (within-city) and +8.08
(cross-city). Modules are lightweight, enabling deployable full-surround
perception for legged/humanoid robots. Datasets and code will be publicly
available at https://github.com/MasterHow/OneOcc.

*Aniol Civit,Antonio Andriella,Carles Sierra,Guillem Alenyà*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Introduces MUP-QBAF for multi-user personalisation in HRI using quantitative bipolar argumentation to resolve conflicting preferences, integrating dynamic robot observations, with a case study mediating caregiver vs. care recipient during frailty assessment and sensitivity analyses; claims a transparent, context-sensitive alternative to data-driven methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fill the gap where multi-user preferences are ignored in HRI; enable dynamic, explainable adaptation in robots amid changing contexts and conflicting stakeholders.

Method: Extend Quantitative Bipolar Argumentation Frameworks to multiple users. Model positive and negative preferences as arguments; iteratively recalculate their strengths as new information and environmental observations arrive; integrate the robot’s observations to adapt over time; provide theoretical properties and a case study.

Result: Case study validation showing the robot mediates conflicting caregiver and care recipient preferences during frailty assessment; sensitivity analysis demonstrates how argument base scores and context influence outcomes; supports transparency and principled conflict resolution.

Conclusion: MUP-QBAF advances multi-user HRI by offering a structured, context-sensitive, and explainable approach to resolving competing preferences, serving as a principled alternative to purely data-driven methods and enabling robots to navigate real-world conflicts.

Abstract: While personalisation in Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) has advanced
significantly, most existing approaches focus on single-user adaptation,
overlooking scenarios involving multiple stakeholders with potentially
conflicting preferences. To address this, we propose the Multi-User Preferences
Quantitative Bipolar Argumentation Framework (MUP-QBAF), a novel multi-user
personalisation framework based on Quantitative Bipolar Argumentation
Frameworks (QBAFs) that explicitly models and resolves multi-user preference
conflicts. Unlike prior work in Argumentation Frameworks, which typically
assumes static inputs, our approach is tailored to robotics: it incorporates
both users' arguments and the robot's dynamic observations of the environment,
allowing the system to adapt over time and respond to changing contexts.
Preferences, both positive and negative, are represented as arguments whose
strength is recalculated iteratively based on new information. The framework's
properties and capabilities are presented and validated through a realistic
case study, where an assistive robot mediates between the conflicting
preferences of a caregiver and a care recipient during a frailty assessment
task. This evaluation further includes a sensitivity analysis of argument base
scores, demonstrating how preference outcomes can be shaped by user input and
contextual observations. By offering a transparent, structured, and
context-sensitive approach to resolving competing user preferences, this work
advances the field of multi-user HRI. It provides a principled alternative to
data-driven methods, enabling robots to navigate conflicts in real-world
environments.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A manifold-constrained Hamilton-Jacobi reachability (HJR) learning framework for decentralized MAMP that enforces task-specific manifold constraints, yielding safe, task-feasible plans without assuming other agents’ policies and scaling to high-dimensional manipulation; outperforms existing constrained planners in experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to perform safe motion planning for multiple agents in dynamic environments while respecting task-imposed manifold constraints (e.g., carrying objects upright), which is challenging in high dimensions and without policy assumptions on others.

Method: Develops a manifold-constrained HJR learning approach to solve HJR problems under manifold constraints; integrates into a decentralized trajectory optimization planner; yields task-aware safety conditions; applicable to high-dimensional multi-agent manipulation.

Result: Experiments show the proposed method outperforms existing constrained motion planners and runs at real-world speeds; demonstrates scalability and task generalization.

Conclusion: The framework enables safe, task-feasible decentralized MAMP across diverse manifold-constrained tasks and scales to high-dimensional settings, broadening applicability to real-world manipulation scenarios.

Abstract: Safe multi-agent motion planning (MAMP) under task-induced constraints is a
critical challenge in robotics. Many real-world scenarios require robots to
navigate dynamic environments while adhering to manifold constraints imposed by
tasks. For example, service robots must carry cups upright while avoiding
collisions with humans or other robots. Despite recent advances in
decentralized MAMP for high-dimensional systems, incorporating manifold
constraints remains difficult. To address this, we propose a
manifold-constrained Hamilton-Jacobi reachability (HJR) learning framework for
decentralized MAMP. Our method solves HJR problems under manifold constraints
to capture task-aware safety conditions, which are then integrated into a
decentralized trajectory optimization planner. This enables robots to generate
motion plans that are both safe and task-feasible without requiring assumptions
about other agents' policies. Our approach generalizes across diverse
manifold-constrained tasks and scales effectively to high-dimensional
multi-agent manipulation problems. Experiments show that our method outperforms
existing constrained motion planners and operates at speeds suitable for
real-world applications. Video demonstrations are available at

Abstract: This paper presents the innovative design and successful deployment of a
pioneering autonomous unmanned aerial system developed for executing the
world's largest mural painted by a drone. Addressing the dual challenges of
maintaining artistic precision and operational reliability under adverse
outdoor conditions such as wind and direct sunlight, our work introduces a
robust system capable of navigating and painting outdoors with unprecedented
accuracy. Key to our approach is a novel navigation system that combines an
infrared (IR) motion capture camera and LiDAR technology, enabling precise
location tracking tailored specifically for largescale artistic applications.
We employ a unique control architecture that uses different regulation in
tangential and normal directions relative to the planned path, enabling precise
trajectory tracking and stable line rendering. We also present algorithms for
trajectory planning and path optimization, allowing for complex curve drawing
and area filling. The system includes a custom-designed paint spraying
mechanism, specifically engineered to function effectively amidst the turbulent
airflow generated by the drone's propellers, which also protects the drone's
critical components from paint-related damage, ensuring longevity and
consistent performance. Experimental results demonstrate the system's
robustness and precision in varied conditions, showcasing its potential for
autonomous large-scale art creation and expanding the functional applications
of robotics in creative fields.

TL;DR: Automata-based motion planning under uncertain semantic labels with scLTL; constructs a product automaton to encode label uncertainty, designs edge rewards, and uses online value iteration for replanning; provides theoretical results and simulations demonstrating effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses motion planning under uncertainty where the environment's semantic labels are probabilistic; seeks to satisfy syntactically co-safe LTL specifications (scLTL) online.

Method: Develops an automata-theoretic framework by constructing a special product automaton that captures uncertainty in semantic labels; assigns rewards to edges; applies value iteration for online replanning.

Result: Theoretical results validating the approach; simulations/experiments demonstrating efficacy in achieving scLTL tasks under label uncertainty.

Conclusion: The proposed automata-based framework effectively handles uncertainty in semantic labels and supports online replanning to satisfy scLTL tasks, with supportive theoretical and empirical evidence.

Abstract: This paper addresses a motion planning problem to achieve
spatio-temporal-logical tasks, expressed by syntactically co-safe linear
temporal logic specifications (scLTL\next), in uncertain environments. Here,
the uncertainty is modeled as some probabilistic knowledge on the semantic
labels of the environment. For example, the task is "first go to region 1, then
go to region 2"; however, the exact locations of regions 1 and 2 are not known
a priori, instead a probabilistic belief is available. We propose a novel
automata-theoretic approach, where a special product automaton is constructed
to capture the uncertainty related to semantic labels, and a reward function is
designed for each edge of this product automaton. The proposed algorithm
utilizes value iteration for online replanning. We show some theoretical
results and present some simulations/experiments to demonstrate the efficacy of
the proposed approach.

TL;DR: Human timing cues in a game are used to design phase-specific robot-arm motions; late-phase withdrawal timing and physical embodiment enhance perceived expressivity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how to translate human expressive timing into robot motion to convey intent and emotion in human–robot interaction.

Method: The study analyzed two human motion types in Geister: natural gameplay (unconscious tendencies) and instructed expressions (intentional cues). It then created phase-specific robot motions by varying movement speed and stop duration, and evaluated observer impressions under two modalities: a physical robot and a recorded video.

Result: Late-phase motion timing, especially during withdrawal, significantly shapes impression formation; physical embodiment enhances the interpretability of motion cues.

Conclusion: Timing cues, particularly late-phase withdrawal, are important for expressive robot motion; physical embodiment improves interpretation; these findings can guide the design of expressive robot motions based on human timing behavior.

Abstract: This study investigates how human motion cues can be used to design
expressive robot-arm movements. Using the imperfect-information game Geister,
we analyzed two types of human piece-moving motions: natural gameplay
(unconscious tendencies) and instructed expressions (intentional cues). Based
on these findings, we created phase-specific robot motions by varying movement
speed and stop duration, and evaluated observer impressions under two
presentation modalities: a physical robot and a recorded video. Results
indicate that late-phase motion timing, particularly during withdrawal, plays
an important role in impression formation and that physical embodiment enhances
the interpretability of motion cues. These findings provide insights for
designing expressive robot motions based on human timing behavior.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional fluid-driven soft grippers depend on external fluid sources, limiting portability and long-term autonomy; there is a need for autonomous, size-selective, stiffness-adaptive manipulation in field environments (underwater, rugged settings).

Method: A fixed-size device with three interconnected bistable snap-through chambers redistributes liquid internally when the top sensing chamber deforms on contact; this hydraulic feedback triggers snap-through expansion of the grasping chambers, enabling stable, size-selective grasping without continuous energy input.

Result: The design achieves stable, size-selective grasping without ongoing energy, along with passive adaptation of gripping pressure to object stiffness; it is source-free and compact, enabling lightweight, stiffness-adaptive manipulation suitable for underwater and field applications.

Conclusion: This work offers a feasible, low-power approach for target-size sampling and manipulation in soft robotics, expanding possibilities for autonomous, field-ready, stiffness-adaptive manipulation.

Abstract: Conventional fluid-driven soft grippers typically depend on external sources,
which limit portability and long-term autonomy. This work introduces a
self-contained soft gripper with fixed size that operates solely through
internal liquid redistribution among three interconnected bistable snap-through
chambers. When the top sensing chamber deforms upon contact, the displaced
liquid triggers snap-through expansion of the grasping chambers, enabling
stable and size-selective grasping without continuous energy input. The
internal hydraulic feedback further allows passive adaptation of gripping
pressure to object stiffness. This source-free and compact design opens new
possibilities for lightweight, stiffness-adaptive fluid-driven manipulation in
soft robotics, providing a feasible approach for targeted size-specific
sampling and operation in underwater and field environments.

### [64] [Evaluating Control Protocols for Untrusted AI Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02997)
*Jon Kutasov,Chloe Loughridge,Yuqi Sun,Henry Sleight,Buck Shlegeris,Tyler Tracy,Joe Benton*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Evaluates AI safety control protocols in SHADE-Arena; blue-team strategies (resampling, deferring on critical actions) improve safety; adaptive red-team strategies can undermine safety, except deferring on critical actions which remains robust.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To ensure safe operation of increasingly capable AI agents by testing and hardening control protocols against both static and adaptive attacks.

Method: Systematic evaluation across agentic environments in SHADE-Arena; test blue-team protocols against a default attack; then develop red-team strategies with increased affordances (attackers know when resampling occurs, can simulate monitors) to probe robustness.

Result: Resampling for incrimination and deferring on critical actions elevate safety from 50% to 96% under default attack; adaptive red-teams reduce safety to 17% against optimized resampling; deferring on critical actions shows strong robustness to even strongest red-team strategies.

Conclusion: Access control and opacity of protocol internals are crucial; some safety protocols can be highly effective but must be guarded against adaptive adversaries; designing robust AI safety requires protecting protocol details and considering attacker knowledge.

Abstract: As AI systems become more capable and widely deployed as agents, ensuring
their safe operation becomes critical. AI control offers one approach to
mitigating the risk from untrusted AI agents by monitoring their actions and
intervening or auditing when necessary. Evaluating the safety of these
protocols requires understanding both their effectiveness against current
attacks and their robustness to adaptive adversaries. In this work, we
systematically evaluate a range of control protocols in SHADE-Arena, a dataset
of diverse agentic environments. First, we evaluate blue team protocols,
including deferral to trusted models, resampling, and deferring on critical
actions, against a default attack policy. We find that resampling for
incrimination and deferring on critical actions perform best, increasing safety
from 50% to 96%. We then iterate on red team strategies against these protocols
and find that attack policies with additional affordances, such as knowledge of
when resampling occurs or the ability to simulate monitors, can substantially
improve attack success rates against our resampling strategy, decreasing safety
to 17%. However, deferring on critical actions is highly robust to even our
strongest red team strategies, demonstrating the importance of denying attack
policies access to protocol internals.

### [65] [PublicAgent: Multi-Agent Design Principles From an LLM-Based Open Data Analysis Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03023)
*Sina Montazeri,Yunhe Feng,Kewei Sha*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Multi-agent PublicAgent framework decomposes data-analysis tasks into specialized agents to improve accessibility and reliability of open data analysis; yields five architecture principles, showing specialization benefits largely independent of model strength.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Open data repositories are hard for non-experts; end-to-end LLM workflows suffer from attention dilution, reasoning interference, and error propagation; need structured agent-based workflow.

Method: Decompose tasks into intent clarification, dataset discovery, analysis, reporting; evaluate across five models and 50 queries; derive five design principles; measure success via 'agent win rates' and variability.

Result: Five design principles established: specialization value independent of model; universal vs conditional agents; agents mitigate specific failure modes; benefits persist across task complexity; model variance necessitates model-aware architecture. Quantitative findings: strongest model still benefits; discovery/analysis win rates 84-96%; analysis variance 42-96% across models; discovery 84-94%; overall agent win rate 97.5%.

Conclusion: Specialization enables advanced analytics and broader NL-driven access to public data; architecture should be designed around operator roles; principles guide when to employ specialization.

Abstract: Open data repositories hold potential for evidence-based decision-making, yet
are inaccessible to non-experts lacking expertise in dataset discovery, schema
mapping, and statistical analysis. Large language models show promise for
individual tasks, but end-to-end analytical workflows expose fundamental
limitations: attention dilutes across growing contexts, specialized reasoning
patterns interfere, and errors propagate undetected. We present PublicAgent, a
multi-agent framework that addresses these limitations through decomposition
into specialized agents for intent clarification, dataset discovery, analysis,
and reporting. This architecture maintains focused attention within agent
contexts and enables validation at each stage. Evaluation across five models
and 50 queries derives five design principles for multi-agent LLM systems.
First, specialization provides value independent of model strength--even the
strongest model shows 97.5% agent win rates, with benefits orthogonal to model
scale. Second, agents divide into universal (discovery, analysis) and
conditional (report, intent) categories. Universal agents show consistent
effectiveness (std dev 12.4%) while conditional agents vary by model (std dev
20.5%). Third, agents mitigate distinct failure modes--removing discovery or
analysis causes catastrophic failures (243-280 instances), while removing
report or intent causes quality degradation. Fourth, architectural benefits
persist across task complexity with stable win rates (86-92% analysis, 84-94%
discovery), indicating workflow management value rather than reasoning
enhancement. Fifth, wide variance in agent effectiveness across models (42-96%
for analysis) requires model-aware architecture design. These principles guide
when and why specialization is necessary for complex analytical workflows while
enabling broader access to public data through natural language interfaces.

TL;DR: ScalingEval introduces a scalable, reproducible benchmark for evaluating LLMs as judges by aligning 36 models through a consensus-driven multi-agent framework; it yields actionable insights on model performance across product categories and latency-cost tradeoffs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable scalable, trustworthy evaluation of LLMs when they act as evaluators, reducing reliance on human annotations and enabling reproducible comparisons across model families.

Method: A multi-agent framework evaluates 36 LLMs (GPT, Gemini, Claude, Llama, etc.) using a consensus-driven protocol. Pattern audits and issue codes are aggregated into ground-truth labels via scalable majority voting. Applied to large-scale complementary-item recommendation, with category-level analysis.

Result: Four key findings: (i) Claude 3.5 Sonnet has highest decision confidence; (ii) Gemini 1.5 Pro best overall across categories; (iii) GPT-4o offers the best latency-accuracy-cost tradeoff; (iv) GPT-OSS 20B leads among open-source models. Strong category consensus in Electronics and Sports; persistent disagreement in Clothing and Food.

Conclusion: ScalingEval provides a reproducible benchmark and protocol for using LLMs as judges, offering guidance on scaling, reliability, and model-family tradeoffs in evaluation pipelines.

Abstract: Evaluating large language models (LLMs) as judges is increasingly critical
for building scalable and trustworthy evaluation pipelines. We present
ScalingEval, a large-scale benchmarking study that systematically compares 36
LLMs, including GPT, Gemini, Claude, and Llama, across multiple product
categories using a consensus-driven evaluation protocol. Our multi-agent
framework aggregates pattern audits and issue codes into ground-truth labels
via scalable majority voting, enabling reproducible comparison of LLM
evaluators without human annotation. Applied to large-scale complementary-item
recommendation, the benchmark reports four key findings: (i) Anthropic Claude
3.5 Sonnet achieves the highest decision confidence; (ii) Gemini 1.5 Pro offers
the best overall performance across categories; (iii) GPT-4o provides the most
favorable latency-accuracy-cost tradeoff; and (iv) GPT-OSS 20B leads among
open-source models. Category-level analysis shows strong consensus in
structured domains (Electronics, Sports) but persistent disagreement in
lifestyle categories (Clothing, Food). These results establish ScalingEval as a
reproducible benchmark and evaluation protocol for LLMs as judges, with
actionable guidance on scaling, reliability, and model family tradeoffs.

### [67] [Epidemiology of Large Language Models: A Benchmark for Observational Distribution Knowledge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03070)
*Drago Plecko,Patrik Okanovic,Torsten Hoefler,Elias Bareinboim*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A benchmark study investigates whether LLMs internally capture empirical real-world probability distributions across domains, and finds they perform poorly, lacking observational distribution knowledge (Pearl's Layer 1). This implies limited interventional and counterfactual capabilities (Layers 2 and 3) per the Causal Hierarchy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To distinguish factual (true/false) knowledge from probabilistic knowledge and to test if LLMs, trained on large text corpora, internalize real-world distributions in high dimensions, which is challenging due to the curse of dimensionality.

Method: The authors introduce the first benchmark for evaluating LLMs on knowledge of probability distributions describing real-world populations, spanning domains like economics, health, education, and social behavior, and analyze results through Pearl's Causal Hierarchy.

Result: LLMs perform poorly overall and do not naturally internalize real-world statistics. They lack knowledge of observational distributions (Layer 1 of the PCH), which implies limited interventional (Layer 2) and counterfactual (Layer 3) knowledge.

Conclusion: LLMs' distributional knowledge is limited; current architectures/surveys do not automatically encode empirical world distributions. The work motivates developing dedicated benchmarks and methods to capture or augment probabilistic and causal knowledge in AI systems.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) systems hold great promise for advancing various
scientific disciplines, and are increasingly used in real-world applications.
Despite their remarkable progress, further capabilities are expected in order
to achieve more general types of intelligence. A critical distinction in this
context is between factual knowledge, which can be evaluated against true or
false answers (e.g., "what is the capital of England?"), and probabilistic
knowledge, reflecting probabilistic properties of the real world (e.g., "what
is the sex of a computer science graduate in the US?"). In this paper, our goal
is to build a benchmark for understanding the capabilities of LLMs in terms of
knowledge of probability distributions describing the real world. Given that
LLMs are trained on vast amounts of text, it may be plausible that they
internalize aspects of these distributions. Indeed, LLMs are touted as powerful
universal approximators of real-world distributions. At the same time,
classical results in statistics, known as curse of dimensionality, highlight
fundamental challenges in learning distributions in high dimensions,
challenging the notion of universal distributional learning. In this work, we
develop the first benchmark to directly test this hypothesis, evaluating
whether LLMs have access to empirical distributions describing real-world
populations across domains such as economics, health, education, and social
behavior. Our results demonstrate that LLMs perform poorly overall, and do not
seem to internalize real-world statistics naturally. When interpreted in the
context of Pearl's Causal Hierarchy (PCH), our benchmark demonstrates that
language models do not contain knowledge on observational distributions (Layer
1 of PCH), and thus the Causal Hierarchy Theorem implies that interventional
(Layer 2) and counterfactual (Layer 3) knowledge of these models is also
limited.

### [68] [SnapStream: Efficient Long Sequence Decoding on Dataflow Accelerators](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03092)
*Jonathan Li,Nasim Farahini,Evgenii Iuliugin,Magnus Vesterlund,Christian Haggstrom,Guangtao Wang,Shubhangi Upasani,Ayush Sachdeva,Rui Li,Faline Fu,Chen Wu,Ayesha Siddiqua,John Long,Tuowen Zhao,Matheen Musaddiq,Hakan Zeffer,Yun Du,Mingran Wang,Qinghua Li,Bo Li,Urmish Thakker,Raghu Prabhakar*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SnapStream is a sparse KV-attention KV-cache compression that achieves ~4x on-chip memory savings with minimal accuracy loss in production-scale LLM inference (128k context) on static-graph pipelines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise of 100B+ parameter LLMs with very long context demands large KV caches on accelerators. While KV-cache techniques (e.g., StreamingLLM, SnapKV) exist, they are rarely adopted in industry due to static-graph frameworks and continuous batching, and the accuracy implications for modern instruction-following models are unclear. This work motivates understanding accuracy and delivering a deployment-ready solution that scales.

Method: Introduce SnapStream, a KV-cache compression method based on sparse KV attention. Evaluate its accuracy impact on Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct and DeepSeek-R1. Demonstrate deployment in a 16-way tensor-parallel DeepSeek-671B run on SambaNova SN40L with 128k context and up to 1832 tokens/s, within real production settings, using static graphs and continuous batching.

Result: SnapStream yields ~4× improvement in on-chip memory usage and only minimal accuracy degradation on LongBench-v2, AIME24, and LiveCodeBench. Real-world deployment shows production-scale feasibility at 128k context and ~1832 tokens/s in a 16-way tensor-parallel setup for a 671B model.

Conclusion: This work claims the first production deployment of sparse KV attention techniques in a system with static graphs and continuous batching, establishing the practicality and scalability of memory-efficient KV caches for long-context LLM inference.

Abstract: The proliferation of 100B+ parameter Large Language Models (LLMs) with 100k+
context length support have resulted in increasing demands for on-chip memory
to support large KV caches. Techniques such as StreamingLLM and SnapKV
demonstrate how to control KV cache size while maintaining model accuracy. Yet,
these techniques are not commonly used within industrial deployments using
frameworks like vLLM or SGLang. The reason is twofold: on one hand, the static
graphs and continuous batching methodology employed by these frameworks make it
difficult to admit modifications to the standard multi-head attention
algorithm, while on the other hand, the accuracy implications of such
techniques on modern instruction-following and reasoning models are not well
understood, obfuscating the need for implementing these techniques. In this
paper, we explore these accuracy implications on Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct and
DeepSeek-R1, and develop SnapStream, a KV cache compression method that can be
deployed at scale. We demonstrate the efficacy of SnapStream in a 16-way
tensor-parallel deployment of DeepSeek-671B on SambaNova SN40L accelerators
running at 128k context length and up to 1832 tokens per second in a real
production setting. SnapStream enables $4\times$ improved on-chip memory usage
and introduces minimal accuracy degradation on LongBench-v2, AIME24 and
LiveCodeBench. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first implementation
of sparse KV attention techniques deployed in a production inference system
with static graphs and continuous batching.

*Katherine C. Kellogg,Bingyang Ye,Yifan Hu,Guergana K. Savova,Byron Wallace,Danielle S. Bitterman*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes capability-based monitoring for generalist LLMs in healthcare to enable cross-task detection of weaknesses by organizing monitoring around shared capabilities rather than downstream tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Task-based monitoring with drift assumptions may miss systemic weaknesses and emergent behaviors in LLMs. Generalist models reuse capabilities across many tasks, so oversight should focus on core capabilities to scale safely in healthcare.

Method: Conceptual framework that organizes monitoring around shared model capabilities (e.g., summarization, reasoning, translation, safety) to enable cross-task detection of weaknesses, long-tail errors, and emergent behaviors; discusses practical considerations for developers, leaders, and professional societies and how to implement such monitoring.

Result: Describes considerations and guidance for implementing capability-based monitoring; argues that this approach provides a scalable foundation for safe, adaptive, and collaborative oversight of LLMs and future generalist AI in healthcare.

Conclusion: Capability-based monitoring is presented as a scalable, practical foundation for ongoing safety and performance oversight of generalist AI in healthcare.

Abstract: The rapid adoption of large language models (LLMs) in healthcare has been
accompanied by scrutiny of their oversight. Existing monitoring approaches,
inherited from traditional machine learning (ML), are task-based and founded on
assumed performance degradation arising from dataset drift. In contrast, with
LLMs, inevitable model degradation due to changes in populations compared to
the training dataset cannot be assumed, because LLMs were not trained for any
specific task in any given population. We therefore propose a new organizing
principle guiding generalist LLM monitoring that is scalable and grounded in
how these models are developed and used in practice: capability-based
monitoring. Capability-based monitoring is motivated by the fact that LLMs are
generalist systems whose overlapping internal capabilities are reused across
numerous downstream tasks. Instead of evaluating each downstream task
independently, this approach organizes monitoring around shared model
capabilities, such as summarization, reasoning, translation, or safety
guardrails, in order to enable cross-task detection of systemic weaknesses,
long-tail errors, and emergent behaviors that task-based monitoring may miss.
We describe considerations for developers, organizational leaders, and
professional societies for implementing a capability-based monitoring approach.
Ultimately, capability-based monitoring will provide a scalable foundation for
safe, adaptive, and collaborative monitoring of LLMs and future generalist
artificial intelligence models in healthcare.

### [70] [miniF2F-Lean Revisited: Reviewing Limitations and Charting a Path Forward](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03108)
*Azim Ospanov,Farzan Farnia,Roozbeh Yousefzadeh*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MiniF2F-v2 addresses misalignment between informal and formal problem statements in miniF2F, achieving 70% end-to-end proof accuracy, by correcting discrepancies and producing fully verified statements; original miniF2F had only 36% pipeline accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diagnose why autoformalization and theorem proving struggle on miniF2F, quantify formal–informal misalignment, and provide a corrected benchmark to better evaluate progress in formal reasoning.

Method: Analyze the end-to-end pipeline (natural-language problem reading, Lean formalization, and proof) on miniF2F; identify failure modes; fix errors, discrepancies, and simplifications; produce miniF2F-v2 with verified statements and proofs; evaluate full theorem-proving pipeline.

Result: Original miniF2F yields about 36% best end-to-end accuracy; misalignment between formal/informal statements accounts for much of the drop; miniF2F-v2 achieves about 70% accuracy for the full pipeline; prior reported accuracies (97% autoformalization and 69% theorem proving) do not translate to end-to-end performance.

Conclusion: A higher-quality benchmark like miniF2F-v2 is valuable for diagnosing failure modes and enabling clearer progress in autoformalization and theorem proving; the dataset shows substantial room for improvement in aligning formal statements with informal ones and in the interaction between autoformalizers and provers.

Abstract: We perform a thorough analysis of the formal and informal statements in the
miniF2F benchmark from the perspective of an AI system that is tasked to
participate in a math Olympiad consisting of the problems in miniF2F. In such
setting, the model has to read and comprehend the problems in natural language,
formalize them in Lean language, then proceed with proving the problems, and it
will get credit for each problem if the formal proof corresponds to the
original informal statement presented to the model. Our evaluation results
reveal that the best accuracy of such pipeline can be about 36% using the SoTA
models in the literature, considerably lower than the individual SoTA
accuracies, 97% and 69% reported in the autoformalization and theorem proving
literature. Analyzing the failure modes, we trace back a considerable portion
of this drop to discrepancies between the formal and informal statements for
more than half of the problems in miniF2F. We proceed with correcting all the
errors, discrepancies and simplifications in formal and informal statements,
and present the miniF2F-v2 with fully verified formal and informal statements
and proofs. Evaluating the full theorem proving pipeline on miniF2F-v2 leads to
the best accuracy of 70%, a significant improvement from the 40% on the
original miniF2F, yet indicating considerable misalignment between the
autoformalization models and theorem provers. Our deep analysis suggests that a
higher quality benchmark can help the community better evaluate progress in the
field of formal reasoning and also better diagnose the failure and success
modes of autoformalization and theorem proving models. Our dataset is available
at https://github.com/roozbeh-yz/miniF2F_v2.

### [71] [Using Multi-modal Large Language Model to Boost Fireworks Algorithm's Ability in Settling Challenging Optimization Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03137)
*Shipeng Cen,Ying Tan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Integrates multi-modal LLMs into the Fireworks Algorithm via a new Critical Part to tackle high-dimensional, non-convex optimization, showing strong performance on TSP and EDA and achieving or surpassing SOTA on many instances.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Optimization problems are increasingly non-convex, high-dimensional, and black-box, making traditional zero-/first-order methods inefficient. The rise of large language models (and multimodal variants) offers rich information and generative capabilities to guide the design of optimization algorithms.

Method: Introduce the Critical Part (CP) to extend the Fireworks Algorithm (FWA) for complex, high-dimensional tasks and leverage multi-modal LLMs to utilize optimization-process information. Apply the framework to two benchmark problems: the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) and Electronic Design Automation (EDA).

Result: Experimental results show that FWAs designed under the proposed framework achieve or surpass state-of-the-art results on many problem instances.

Conclusion: A multimodal LLM-guided optimization design framework, via the CP extension to FWA, can effectively tackle complex optimization tasks and offers a promising direction for algorithm design beyond traditional methods.

Abstract: As optimization problems grow increasingly complex and diverse, advancements
in optimization techniques and paradigm innovations hold significant
importance. The challenges posed by optimization problems are primarily
manifested in their non-convexity, high-dimensionality, black-box nature, and
other unfavorable characteristics. Traditional zero-order or first-order
methods, which are often characterized by low efficiency, inaccurate gradient
information, and insufficient utilization of optimization information, are
ill-equipped to address these challenges effectively. In recent years, the
rapid development of large language models (LLM) has led to substantial
improvements in their language understanding and code generation capabilities.
Consequently, the design of optimization algorithms leveraging large language
models has garnered increasing attention from researchers. In this study, we
choose the fireworks algorithm(FWA) as the basic optimizer and propose a novel
approach to assist the design of the FWA by incorporating multi-modal large
language model(MLLM). To put it simply, we propose the concept of Critical
Part(CP), which extends FWA to complex high-dimensional tasks, and further
utilizes the information in the optimization process with the help of the
multi-modal characteristics of large language models. We focus on two specific
tasks: the \textit{traveling salesman problem }(TSP) and \textit{electronic
design automation problem} (EDA). The experimental results show that FWAs
generated under our new framework have achieved or surpassed SOTA results on
many problem instances.

TL;DR: A safety framework for LLMs addressing input-output risks with four-tier input taxonomy and retrieval-augmented output grounding, achieving high safety metrics and enabling trustworthy deployment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs' security issues hinder trustworthy deployment in critical domains; need systematic safeguards at input and output levels for risk coverage and scenario adaptability.

Method: Input: supervised fine-tuned safety classifier with four-tier taxonomy (Safe, Unsafe, Conditionally Safe, Focused Attention) for query risk identification and handling. Output: Retrieval-Augmented Generation with a fine-tuned interpretation model, grounding in a live knowledge base for traceable, non-fabricated responses.

Result: Risk recall of 99.3% on input taxonomy; higher safety scores on public benchmarks vs TinyR1-Safety-8B; 100% safety score on proprietary high-risk test set; demonstrates strong protective capabilities.

Conclusion: An effective engineering blueprint for high-security, high-trust LLM applications, combining input screening and grounded, traceable outputs.

Abstract: With the widespread application of Large Language Models (LLMs), their
associated security issues have become increasingly prominent, severely
constraining their trustworthy deployment in critical domains. This paper
proposes a novel safety response framework designed to systematically safeguard
LLMs at both the input and output levels. At the input level, the framework
employs a supervised fine-tuning-based safety classification model. Through a
fine-grained four-tier taxonomy (Safe, Unsafe, Conditionally Safe, Focused
Attention), it performs precise risk identification and differentiated handling
of user queries, significantly enhancing risk coverage and business scenario
adaptability, and achieving a risk recall rate of 99.3%. At the output level,
the framework integrates Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with a
specifically fine-tuned interpretation model, ensuring all responses are
grounded in a real-time, trustworthy knowledge base. This approach eliminates
information fabrication and enables result traceability. Experimental results
demonstrate that our proposed safety control model achieves a significantly
higher safety score on public safety evaluation benchmarks compared to the
baseline model, TinyR1-Safety-8B. Furthermore, on our proprietary high-risk
test set, the framework's components attained a perfect 100% safety score,
validating their exceptional protective capabilities in complex risk scenarios.
This research provides an effective engineering pathway for building
high-security, high-trust LLM applications.

TL;DR: A validation framework for formal explainers is proposed and applied to PyXAI, revealing incorrect explanations on most datasets, highlighting the need for rigorous validation of formal XAI tools.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Formal XAI promises theoretical guarantees, but practical validation lags behind; incorrect explanations undermine trust and reliability of these tools.

Method: Introduce a novel methodology to validate formal explainers and apply it to the publicly available PyXAI; evaluate explanations across multiple datasets to detect correctness and reliability.

Result: The analysis uncovers incorrect explanations produced by PyXAI on most datasets examined, supporting the effectiveness of the proposed validation methodology and the need for caution when using formal explainers.

Conclusion: Validation of formal explainers is essential; current tools may produce incorrect explanations in practice; the study calls for more robust validation frameworks and improved explainers.

Abstract: Formal explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) offers unique theoretical
guarantees of rigor when compared to other non-formal methods of
explainability. However, little attention has been given to the validation of
practical implementations of formal explainers. This paper develops a novel
methodology for validating formal explainers and reports on the assessment of
the publicly available formal explainer PyXAI. The paper documents the
existence of incorrect explanations computed by PyXAI on most of the datasets
analyzed in the experiments, thereby confirming the importance of the proposed
novel methodology for the validation of formal explainers.

TL;DR: A three-agent AI framework with knowledge graphs formalizes the engineering design loop, applied to NACA airfoils, to improve efficiency, consistency, and quality, culminating in optimized lift-to-drag.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Engineering design spans multiple domains; traditional methods are resource-intensive; aim to leverage knowledge-driven AI agents and structured graphs to streamline collaboration and refinement.

Method: Three agents: Graph Ontologist builds two airfoil-domain knowledge graphs from literature via LLM; Systems Engineer defines requirements with human guidance and uses knowledge graphs for evaluation; Design Engineer proposes airfoils using graphs and computational tools; iterative feedback loops between Systems Engineer and Design Engineer; manager validates; final optimization targets lift-to-drag ratio.

Result: Demonstrates feasibility and potential benefits of collaborative AI agents with structured knowledge representations; improved efficiency, consistency, and quality in design process; application to 4-digit NACA airfoils with final stage optimization for performance metrics.

Conclusion: The framework shows promise for scalable, knowledge-driven, multi-agent design processes in engineering; can be extended to other domains and more complex criteria.

Abstract: The engineering design process often demands expertise from multiple domains,
leading to complex collaborations and iterative refinements. Traditional
methods can be resource-intensive and prone to inefficiencies. To address this,
we formalize the engineering design process through a multi-agent AI framework
that integrates structured design and review loops. The framework introduces
specialized knowledge-driven agents that collaborate to generate and refine
design candidates. As an exemplar, we demonstrate its application to the
aerodynamic optimization of 4-digit NACA airfoils. The framework consists of
three key AI agents: a Graph Ontologist, a Design Engineer, and a Systems
Engineer. The Graph Ontologist employs a Large Language Model (LLM) to
construct two domain-specific knowledge graphs from airfoil design literature.
The Systems Engineer, informed by a human manager, formulates technical
requirements that guide design generation and evaluation. The Design Engineer
leverages the design knowledge graph and computational tools to propose
candidate airfoils meeting these requirements. The Systems Engineer reviews and
provides feedback both qualitative and quantitative using its own knowledge
graph, forming an iterative feedback loop until a design is validated by the
manager. The final design is then optimized to maximize performance metrics
such as the lift-to-drag ratio. Overall, this work demonstrates how
collaborative AI agents equipped with structured knowledge representations can
enhance efficiency, consistency, and quality in the engineering design process.

Result: Real-world deployment outcomes showing scalable, reliable AI assistants; agile, feedback-driven development enables success even in cold-start scenarios.

Conclusion: Agile, feedback-driven, human-in-the-loop development is effective for building scalable and reliable enterprise AI assistants under constraints.

Abstract: Generative AI assistants offer significant potential to enhance productivity,
streamline information access, and improve user experience in enterprise
contexts. In this work, we present Summit Concierge, a domain-specific AI
assistant developed for Adobe Summit. The assistant handles a wide range of
event-related queries and operates under real-world constraints such as data
sparsity, quality assurance, and rapid deployment. To address these challenges,
we adopt a human-in-the-loop development workflow that combines prompt
engineering, retrieval grounding, and lightweight human validation. We describe
the system architecture, development process, and real-world deployment
outcomes. Our experience shows that agile, feedback-driven development enables
scalable and reliable AI assistants, even in cold-start scenarios.

### [76] [From Five Dimensions to Many: Large Language Models as Precise and Interpretable Psychological Profilers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03235)
*Yi-Fei Liu,Yi-Long Lu,Di He,Hang Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs can accurately infer a full matrix of human personality trait correlations from minimal Big Five input, via a two-stage abstraction: generate natural-language summaries and reason to other scales, achieving R^2>0.89 with human data in zero-shot.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine whether large language models can capture the correlational structure of human psychological traits from minimal quantitative inputs, and to explore the reasoning processes that underlie such inferences.

Method: Prompted multiple LLMs with Big Five responses from 816 individuals to role-play nine other psychological scales. Assessed how well LLMs reproduce inter-scale correlations compared to human data, in zero-shot settings, and analyzed internal reasoning traces revealing a two-stage process (information selection/summary generation, then reasoning to target scales).

Result: LLMs produced inter-scale correlation patterns that align with human data (R^2 > 0.89). Zero-shot performance surpassed semantic-similarity baselines and approached the accuracy of models trained directly on the data. The reasoning trace indicates a two-stage process: (1) information selection to produce natural-language summaries (sufficient-statistics-like); (2) generating target-scale responses from these summaries. Information selection identifies same key factors as trained algorithms but misses item-level weighting within factors. Compressed summaries carry emergent, second-order information; adding them to raw scores improves prediction.

Conclusion: LLMs can precisely predict individual psychological traits from minimal data through abstraction and reasoning, offering a powerful tool for psychological simulation and providing insights into emergent reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Psychological constructs within individuals are widely believed to be
interconnected. We investigated whether and how Large Language Models (LLMs)
can model the correlational structure of human psychological traits from
minimal quantitative inputs. We prompted various LLMs with Big Five Personality
Scale responses from 816 human individuals to role-play their responses on nine
other psychological scales. LLMs demonstrated remarkable accuracy in capturing
human psychological structure, with the inter-scale correlation patterns from
LLM-generated responses strongly aligning with those from human data $(R^2 >
0.89)$. This zero-shot performance substantially exceeded predictions based on
semantic similarity and approached the accuracy of machine learning algorithms
trained directly on the dataset. Analysis of reasoning traces revealed that
LLMs use a systematic two-stage process: First, they transform raw Big Five
responses into natural language personality summaries through information
selection and compression, analogous to generating sufficient statistics.
Second, they generate target scale responses based on reasoning from these
summaries. For information selection, LLMs identify the same key personality
factors as trained algorithms, though they fail to differentiate item
importance within factors. The resulting compressed summaries are not merely
redundant representations but capture synergistic information--adding them to
original scores enhances prediction alignment, suggesting they encode emergent,
second-order patterns of trait interplay. Our findings demonstrate that LLMs
can precisely predict individual participants' psychological traits from
minimal data through a process of abstraction and reasoning, offering both a
powerful tool for psychological simulation and valuable insights into their
emergent reasoning capabilities.

### [77] [Towards Scalable Web Accessibility Audit with MLLMs as Copilots](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03471)
*Ming Gu,Ziwei Wang,Sicen Lai,Zirui Gao,Sheng Zhou,Jiajun Bu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AAA is a scalable, end-to-end web accessibility auditing framework that operationalizes WCAG-EM via a human–AI partnership, introducing GRASP for graph-based multimodal sampling and MaC as a multimodal LLM copilot, plus four benchmarking datasets and experiments showing small LMs can be effective experts when fine-tuned.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Auditing web accessibility is essential for social welfare and justice but current WCAG-EM practices are resource-intensive and not scalable, hindering widespread conformance evaluation.

Method: Introduce GRASP, a graph-based multimodal sampling method that uses embeddings of visual, textual, and relational cues to achieve representative page coverage; develop MaC, a multimodal LLM-based copilot that assists auditors through cross-modal reasoning and task-focused support; provide four novel benchmarking datasets for core audit stages.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate the framework's effectiveness and show that small-scale language models can function as capable experts when properly fine-tuned, enabling scalable auditing.

Conclusion: AAA enables scalable, end-to-end web accessibility auditing through a human–AI partnership, offering practical impact and validating the potential of AI-assisted auditing in real-world settings.

Abstract: Ensuring web accessibility is crucial for advancing social welfare, justice,
and equality in digital spaces, yet the vast majority of website user
interfaces remain non-compliant, due in part to the resource-intensive and
unscalable nature of current auditing practices. While WCAG-EM offers a
structured methodology for site-wise conformance evaluation, it involves great
human efforts and lacks practical support for execution at scale. In this work,
we present an auditing framework, AAA, which operationalizes WCAG-EM through a
human-AI partnership model. AAA is anchored by two key innovations: GRASP, a
graph-based multimodal sampling method that ensures representative page
coverage via learned embeddings of visual, textual, and relational cues; and
MaC, a multimodal large language model-based copilot that supports auditors
through cross-modal reasoning and intelligent assistance in high-effort tasks.
Together, these components enable scalable, end-to-end web accessibility
auditing, empowering human auditors with AI-enhanced assistance for real-world
impact. We further contribute four novel datasets designed for benchmarking
core stages of the audit pipeline. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of our methods, providing insights that small-scale language
models can serve as capable experts when fine-tuned.

*Sebastian Ordyniak,Giacomo Paesani,Mateusz Rychlicki,Stefan Szeider*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper conducts a theoretical, parameterized-complexity analysis of explanation tasks (abductive and contrastive) for transparent ML models, covering local/global variants and model families such as decision trees, decision sets/lists, Boolean circuits, and ensembles, to establish tractability boundaries and guide XAI research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To fill a gap in explainable AI by moving beyond black-box assumptions and providing formal complexity foundations for generating explanations across representative, interpretable models.

Method: A theoretical investigation using parameterized complexity theory to classify the complexity of abductive and contrastive explanations (local and global) for multiple model classes (Decision Trees, Decision Sets, Decision Lists, Boolean Circuits, ensembles).

Result: A taxonomy of complexity results across model families and explanation types, identifying tractable and hard regimes and offering a foundational understanding of when explanations are computationally feasible under parameterizations such as explanation size, model size, or depth.

Conclusion: The work closes a gap in XAI by delivering formal complexity insights that inform the design and evaluation of explainableAI, underlining transparency and accountability as core research goals.

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive theoretical investigation into the
parameterized complexity of explanation problems in various machine learning
(ML) models. Contrary to the prevalent black-box perception, our study focuses
on models with transparent internal mechanisms. We address two principal types
of explanation problems: abductive and contrastive, both in their local and
global variants. Our analysis encompasses diverse ML models, including Decision
Trees, Decision Sets, Decision Lists, Boolean Circuits, and ensembles thereof,
each offering unique explanatory challenges. This research fills a significant
gap in explainable AI (XAI) by providing a foundational understanding of the
complexities of generating explanations for these models. This work provides
insights vital for further research in the domain of XAI, contributing to the
broader discourse on the necessity of transparency and accountability in AI
systems.

*Richard Dewey,Janos Botyanszki,Ciamac C. Moallemi,Andrew T. Zheng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Solly is the first AI agent to achieve elite human play in reduced-format Liar's Poker, trained via self-play with a model-free actor-critic deep RL, excelling in multi-player, beating LLMs, and developing strong bidding strategies while remaining hard to exploit.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To push AI beyond two-player, perfect-information or subdued multi-player poker settings into truly multi-player imperfect-information environments, using Liar's Poker as a testbed to study emergent bidding, strategy, and robustness against exploration-exploitation in self-play.

Method: Self-play training with a model-free, actor-critic deep reinforcement learning algorithm on reduced-format Liar's Poker; no explicit opponent modeling, emphasis on learning robust bidding and randomized play to manage multi-player dynamics; evaluation against elite humans and large language models.

Result: Solly achieved elite human-level performance in both heads-up and multi-player Liar's Poker, with win rates exceeding 50% of hands and favorable equity; outperformed large language models on the same metrics; developed novel bidding strategies and randomized play; not easily exploitable by world-class human players.

Conclusion: Demonstrates that deep reinforcement learning with self-play can master complex multi-agent, imperfect-information domains; highlights emergence of effective bidding strategies and robust play in multi-player settings; suggests potential for applying similar approaches to other strategic multi-agent tasks.

Abstract: AI researchers have long focused on poker-like games as a testbed for
environments characterized by multi-player dynamics, imperfect information, and
reasoning under uncertainty. While recent breakthroughs have matched elite
human play at no-limit Texas hold'em, the multi-player dynamics are subdued:
most hands converge quickly with only two players engaged through multiple
rounds of bidding. In this paper, we present Solly, the first AI agent to
achieve elite human play in reduced-format Liar's Poker, a game characterized
by extensive multi-player engagement. We trained Solly using self-play with a
model-free, actor-critic, deep reinforcement learning algorithm. Solly played
at an elite human level as measured by win rate (won over 50% of hands) and
equity (money won) in heads-up and multi-player Liar's Poker. Solly also
outperformed large language models (LLMs), including those with reasoning
abilities, on the same metrics. Solly developed novel bidding strategies,
randomized play effectively, and was not easily exploitable by world-class
human players.

### [80] [The Contiguous Art Gallery Problem is in Θ(n log n)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02960)
*Sarita de Berg,Jacobus Conradi,Ivor van der Hoog,Eva Rotenberg*

Main category: cs.CG

TL;DR: New result: Contiguous Art Gallery problem can be solved in Theta(n log n) time on the real RAM, with a matching sorting-based lower bound; previously reported O(k n^5 log n) or O(n^6 log n) algorithms were not inherent.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To resolve the true time complexity of the Contiguous Art Gallery problem, a natural variant of the Art Gallery problem, and to determine whether the previously claimed polynomial-time algorithms with high-degree runtimes reflect an inherent barrier.

Method: Develop an O(n log n) time algorithm in the real RAM model; show a speed-up of O(k n^4) compared to prior state-of-the-art; provide a straightforward sorting-based lower bound by reducing from the set intersection problem.

Result: Establishes that Contiguous Art Gallery is Theta(n log n) time solvable in the real RAM model; prior algorithms with higher polynomial factors are not necessary.

Conclusion: The running time is asymptotically optimal under the real RAM model; prior O(k n^5 log n) / O(n^6 log n) results appear non-inherent; the problem admits a near-linear-time algorithm and a matching lower bound via sorting.

Abstract: Recently, a natural variant of the Art Gallery problem, known as the
\emph{Contiguous Art Gallery problem} was proposed. Given a simple polygon $P$,
the goal is to partition its boundary $\partial P$ into the smallest number of
contiguous segments such that each segment is completely visible from some
point in $P$. Unlike the classical Art Gallery problem, which is NP-hard, this
variant is polynomial-time solvable. At SoCG~2025, three independent works
presented algorithms for this problem, each achieving a running time of $O(k
n^5 \log n)$ (or $O(n^6\log n)$), where $k$ is the size of an optimal solution.
Interestingly, these results were obtained using entirely different approaches,
yet all led to roughly the same asymptotic complexity, suggesting that such a
running time might be inherent to the problem.
  We show that this is not the case. In the real RAM-model, the prevalent model
in computational geometry, we present an $O(n \log n)$-time algorithm,
achieving an $O(k n^4)$ factor speed-up over the previous state-of-the-art. We
also give a straightforward sorting-based lower bound by reducing from the set
intersection problem. We thus show that the Contiguous Art Gallery problem is
in $\Theta(n \log n)$.

### [81] [Generalized k-Cell Decomposition for Visibility Planning in Polygons](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03642)
*Yeganeh Bahoo,Sajad Saeedi,Roni Sherman*

Main category: cs.CG

TL;DR: Introduces a k-cell decomposition for pursuit-evasion in polygonal environments using a k-modem that sees through up to k walls. The decomposition keeps the structure of unseen regions (shadows) invariant as the searcher moves within a cell, preventing any shadow events. Extends 0- and 2-visibility by incorporating m-visibility polygons for all even m up to k, with partition lines that robustly divide the environment. Proved correct by three theorems. Enables reliable path planning for intruder detection in simulation and broadens visibility-based robotic surveillance. Computational difficulty lies in computing the k-visibility polygon from each vertex and locating partition-line intersections to form cells.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address pursuit-evasion under visibility constraints in polygonal environments and provide rigorous, robust partitioning that preserves the shadow structure. Extend existing 0- and 2-visibility results to arbitrary even k, with theoretical guarantees (three theorems) and practical implications for surveillance and robotics.

Method: Construct partition lines using m-visibility polygons for all even m in [0, k], and derive the k-visibility polygons from each vertex. Compute intersection points of partition lines to create cells, ensuring that as the searcher moves inside a cell the shadow regions do not change (no appearance, disappearance, merge, or split). Prove correctness of the decomposition via three theorems. Highlight the main computational steps and challenges.

Result: A formal decomposition enabling robust, shadow-invariant path planning for intruder detection in simulated polygonal environments. Demonstrates how higher-order visibility (even k) can be incorporated into systematic environment partitioning, expanding the applicability of visibility-based surveillance strategies.

Conclusion: The paper presents a novel k-cell decomposition method that generalizes prior visibility frameworks (0- and 2-visibility) to arbitrary even k, with theoretical guarantees and practical implications for robotic surveillance. Computational challenges remain in efficiently computing k-visibility polygons and partition-line intersections, suggesting directions for algorithmic improvements and real-world validation.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel $k$-cell decomposition method for
pursuit-evasion problems in polygonal environments, where a searcher is
equipped with a $k$-modem: a device capable of seeing through up to $k$ walls.
The proposed decomposition ensures that as the searcher moves within a cell,
the structure of unseen regions (shadows) remains unchanged, thereby preventing
any geometric events between or on invisible regions, that is, preventing the
appearance, disappearance, merge, or split of shadow regions. The method
extends existing work on $0$- and $2$-visibility by incorporating m-visibility
polygons for all even $0 \le m \le k$, constructing partition lines that enable
robust environment division. The correctness of the decomposition is proved via
three theorems. The decomposition enables reliable path planning for intruder
detection in simulated environments and opens new avenues for visibility-based
robotic surveillance. The difficulty in constructing the cells of the
decomposition consists in computing the $k$-visibility polygon from each vertex
and finding the intersection points of the partition lines to create the cells.

### [82] [FATE: A Formal Benchmark Series for Frontier Algebra of Multiple Difficulty Levels](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02872)
*Jiedong Jiang,Wanyi He,Yuefeng Wang,Guoxiong Gao,Yongle Hu,Jingting Wang,Nailing Guan,Peihao Wu,Chunbo Dai,Liang Xiao,Bin Dong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A new formal-algebra benchmark pair, FATE-H and FATE-X, tests LLMs on research-level mathematical reasoning. Despite 100 problems per component, current models lag drastically (3% pass@64 on FATE-H; 0% on FATE-X). The work separates natural-language reasoning from formalization, analyzes error modes, and finds FATE-X exceeds PhD-level and Mathlib coverage. They propose FATE as a robust benchmark for progress toward advanced formal reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bridge the gap between contest-based math benchmarks (like IMO) and real research-level formal mathematics. Quantify LLM capabilities and error modes in formal algebra to guide development toward advanced formal reasoning.

Method: Introduce two 100-problem components, FATE-H and FATE-X, in abstract and commutative algebra. Span difficulty from undergraduate to beyond PhD qualifying exams. Employ a two-stage evaluation separating natural-language reasoning from formalization. Compare general-purpose models with specialized provers. Classify common formalization errors.

Result: State-of-the-art LLM provers achieve about 3% (pass@64) on FATE-H and 0% on FATE-X. FATE-X exceeds both PhD-level exam coverage and the scope of the Mathlib library. Natural-language reasoning outperforms formalization. Error-analysis reveals systematic gaps; specialized provers may be less reflective than general models during NL reasoning.

Conclusion: FATE provides a robust, challenging benchmark to track progress toward research-level formal mathematical reasoning and to establish essential checkpoints beyond contest math.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive
capabilities in formal theorem proving, particularly on contest-based
mathematical benchmarks like the IMO. However, these contests do not reflect
the depth, breadth, and abstraction of modern mathematical research. To bridge
this gap, we introduce FATE (Formal Algebra Theorem Evaluation), a new
benchmark series in formal algebra designed to chart a course toward advanced
mathematical reasoning. We present two new components, FATE-H and FATE-X, each
with 100 problems in abstract and commutative algebra. The FATE series spans a
difficulty spectrum from undergraduate exercises to problems exceeding PhD
qualifying exams. Notably, FATE-X is the first formal benchmark to surpass both
PhD-level exam difficulty and the coverage of the Mathlib library. Our
evaluations of state-of-the-art LLM provers on this new benchmark reveal a
stark performance gap compared to contest math: the best model achieves only 3%
(pass@64) accuracy on FATE-H and 0% on FATE-X. Our two-stage evaluation reveals
that models' natural-language reasoning is notably more accurate than their
ability to formalize this reasoning. We systematically classify the common
errors that arise during this formalization process. Furthermore, a comparative
study shows that a specialized prover can exhibit less effective reflection
than general-purpose models, reducing its accuracy at the natural-language
stage. We believe FATE provides a robust and challenging benchmark that
establishes essential checkpoints on the path toward research-level formal
mathematical reasoning.

*Junhyung Park,Hyungjin Kim,Seokho Ahn,Young-Duk Seo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces DeepForm, a stochastic deep graph clustering framework for dynamic, real-time group formation in group recommender systems, enabling high-order user information use and adaptive group counts, with no retraining required for reconfiguration; demonstrates improved group quality, efficiency, and recommendation accuracy over baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Group recommender systems typically assume static, predefined groups, limiting real-world applicability. There is a need to form and adjust groups dynamically using richer user signals without incurring retraining costs.

Method: A lightweight graph convolutional network to capture high-order structural signals; stochastic cluster learning for on-the-fly group reconfiguration without retraining; contrastive learning to refine group quality under dynamic changes.

Result: DeepForm achieves superior group formation quality, efficiency, and recommendation accuracy compared with various baselines across multiple datasets.

Conclusion: Dynamic, practical group formation is achievable with DeepForm, which integrates high-order information, real-time clustering, and adaptable group count while maintaining recommendation performance.

Abstract: While prior work on group recommender systems (GRSs) has primarily focused on
improving recommendation accuracy, most approaches assume static or predefined
groups, making them unsuitable for dynamic, real-world scenarios. We reframe
group formation as a core challenge in GRSs and propose DeepForm (Stochastic
Deep Graph Clustering for Practical Group Formation), a framework designed to
meet three key operational requirements: (1) the incorporation of high-order
user information, (2) real-time group formation, and (3) dynamic adjustment of
the number of groups. DeepForm employs a lightweight GCN architecture that
effectively captures high-order structural signals. Stochastic cluster learning
enables adaptive group reconfiguration without retraining, while contrastive
learning refines groups under dynamic conditions. Experiments on multiple
datasets demonstrate that DeepForm achieves superior group formation quality,
efficiency, and recommendation accuracy compared with various baselines.

### [84] [Test-time Adaptation of Tiny Recursive Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02886)
*Ronan Killian McGovern*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A tiny recursive model pre-trained on public ARC tasks can be fine-tuned within ARC Prize compute limits, achieving measurable gains. After pre-training (~10% on the public ARC AGI II set), a 12,500-step post-training run during the competition yielded 6.67% on semi-private evaluation, with full fine-tuning rather than LoRA or task-embedding tricks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Demonstrate that compute constraints in the ARC Prize can be met by starting from a small, pre-trained model and performing full fine-tuning, rather than relying on large, high-cost training regimes.

Method: Pre-train a tiny recursive model on 1,280 public ARC tasks for 700k+ optimizer steps over 48 hours on 4x H100 SXM GPUs to reach ~10% on the public evaluation set. Then perform 12,500 gradient steps during the competition for post-training, achieving 6.67% on semi-private evaluation tasks. The improvement is achieved through full fine-tuning of the tiny model (not LoRA or task-embedding fine-tuning).

Result: Public evaluation score after pre-training: ~10%. Semi-private evaluation score after competition post-training: 6.67%. The approach improves upon earlier TRM results (7.8% public ARC AGI II) but within compute constraints.

Conclusion: Starting from a pre-trained tiny model and applying full fine-tuning within budget can yield non-trivial ARC task performance, offering a compute-efficient pathway relative to larger models and special fine-tuning tricks; however, gains on semi-private evaluations remain modest, highlighting trade-offs between model size, pre-training data, and compute budgets.

Abstract: Prior to the close of the 2025 ARC Prize competition, the leading open source
approach - known as TRM, or Tiny Recursive Models - involved training a 7M
parameter recursive neural network on augmented variants of ARC tasks. That
approach scored approximately 7.8% on the public ARC AGI II evaluation set, but
required a level of compute far in excess of what is allowed during the
competition. This paper shows that, by starting from a tiny recursive model
that has been pre-trained on public ARC tasks, one can efficiently fine-tune on
competition tasks within the allowed compute limits. Specifically, a model was
pre-trained on 1,280 public tasks for 700k+ optimizer steps over 48 hours on
4xH100 SXM GPUs to obtain a ~10% score on the public evaluation set. That model
was then post-trained in just 12,500 gradient steps during the competition to
reach a score of 6.67% on semi-private evaluation tasks. Notably, such
post-training performance is achieved by full-fine tuning of the tiny model,
not LoRA fine-tuning or fine-tuning of task embeddings alone.

TL;DR: An AI-assisted framework to predict Potential Fishing Zones (PFZs) in the North Indian Ocean using oceanographic variables (SST, chlorophyll) to reduce search time and fuel use.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fishermen face uncertainty locating productive fishing grounds; need accurate, region-specific guidance to support sustainable, efficient fishing.

Method: Develop AI-based PFZ prediction using sea surface temperature and chlorophyll concentration, providing actionable, region-specific insights for fishermen.

Result: Preliminary results suggest the framework can reduce search time and fuel consumption and promote efficient resource use in PFZ identification.

Conclusion: The framework shows promise for improving PFZ accuracy and sustainability; further validation and testing across seasons and regions are warranted.

Abstract: The North Indian Ocean, including the Arabian Sea and the Bay of Bengal,
represents a vital source of livelihood for coastal communities, yet fishermen
often face uncertainty in locating productive fishing grounds. To address this
challenge, we present an AI-assisted framework for predicting Potential Fishing
Zones (PFZs) using oceanographic parameters such as sea surface temperature and
chlorophyll concentration. The approach is designed to enhance the accuracy of
PFZ identification and provide region-specific insights for sustainable fishing
practices. Preliminary results indicate that the framework can support
fishermen by reducing search time, lowering fuel consumption, and promoting
efficient resource utilization.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LLM-based poisoning detection and sanitization for HAR in wearable IoT using zero-shot/one-shot/few-shot prompts with role-play and step-by-step reasoning; aims to reduce data curation while enabling real-time robust defense; extensive evaluation shows promising effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Data poisoning threats in HAR systems are rising; conventional defenses require large labeled datasets; need adaptable, lightweight defense for dynamic IoT environments.

Method: Employ large language models to detect and sanitize poisoned HAR data using zero-shot/one-shot/few-shot learning; use role-play prompting to simulate an expert and think-step-by-step reasoning to infer poisoning patterns and propose clean data; evaluate detection accuracy, sanitization quality, latency, and communication cost.

Result: Extensive evaluation demonstrates practical effectiveness: high detection accuracy, good sanitization quality, acceptable latency and communication costs; supports robustness of wearable IoT HAR under poisoning.

Conclusion: LLMs with role-play and step-by-step reasoning can enhance HAR security in IoT without heavy task-specific labeled data; opens path for adaptable, real-time defense, though considerations include model costs and latency in resource-constrained devices.

Abstract: The widespread integration of wearable sensing devices in Internet of Things
(IoT) ecosystems, particularly in healthcare, smart homes, and industrial
applications, has required robust human activity recognition (HAR) techniques
to improve functionality and user experience. Although machine learning models
have advanced HAR, they are increasingly susceptible to data poisoning attacks
that compromise the data integrity and reliability of these systems.
Conventional approaches to defending against such attacks often require
extensive task-specific training with large, labeled datasets, which limits
adaptability in dynamic IoT environments. This work proposes a novel framework
that uses large language models (LLMs) to perform poisoning detection and
sanitization in HAR systems, utilizing zero-shot, one-shot, and few-shot
learning paradigms. Our approach incorporates \textit{role play} prompting,
whereby the LLM assumes the role of expert to contextualize and evaluate sensor
anomalies, and \textit{think step-by-step} reasoning, guiding the LLM to infer
poisoning indicators in the raw sensor data and plausible clean alternatives.
These strategies minimize reliance on curation of extensive datasets and enable
robust, adaptable defense mechanisms in real-time. We perform an extensive
evaluation of the framework, quantifying detection accuracy, sanitization
quality, latency, and communication cost, thus demonstrating the practicality
and effectiveness of LLMs in improving the security and reliability of wearable
IoT systems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Open-source LLM (Llama 3.1-405B) is used to generate structured data-use case labels for publications that use genomic datasets. Introduces an evaluation framework and reports a zero-shot F1 of 0.674. Results show promise but face barriers including data availability, prompt overfitting, compute needs, and costly evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Scale and automate the description of data use cases in the literature to understand how datasets are utilized, reducing manual labeling and the need for labeled training data.

Method: Apply Llama 3.1-405B to generate structured data-use-case labels for publications known to incorporate specific genomic datasets, and introduce a novel evaluation framework to assess effectiveness in a zero-shot data citation classification task with no predefined categories.

Result: The model achieves an F1 score of 0.674 in zero-shot citation classification; findings are promising but constrained by data availability, prompt overfitting, computational infrastructure, and the expense of responsible evaluation.

Conclusion: LLMs can assist in describing data use in scientific publications, but practical barriers remain; future work should improve categorization schemes, data availability, and evaluation rigor.

Abstract: Efforts have increased in recent years to identify associations between
specific datasets and the scientific literature that incorporates them. Knowing
that a given publication cites a given dataset, the next logical step is to
explore how or why that data was used. Advances in recent years with
pretrained, transformer-based large language models (LLMs) offer potential
means for scaling the description of data use cases in the published
literature. This avoids expensive manual labeling and the development of
training datasets for classical machine-learning (ML) systems. In this work we
apply an open-source LLM, Llama 3.1-405B, to generate structured data use case
labels for publications known to incorporate specific genomic datasets. We also
introduce a novel evaluation framework for determining the efficacy of our
methods. Our results demonstrate that the stock model can achieve an F1 score
of .674 on a zero-shot data citation classification task with no previously
defined categories. While promising, our results are qualified by barriers
related to data availability, prompt overfitting, computational infrastructure,
and the expense required to conduct responsible performance evaluation.

TL;DR: Introduces ROGUE-TS Thompson Sampling for nonstationary 'reducing or gaining unknown efficacy' bandits, plus a clipping procedure to balance personalization with population-level learning in MRTs; shows sublinear regret and preserved statistical power on two datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Decision makers face rewards that evolve with time and policy, making it hard to both personalize and estimate population effects. In MRTs, balancing exploration for population learning with individualized recommendations is crucial for detecting treatment effects while preserving participant-specific utility.

Method: Develops ROGUE-TS, a Thompson Sampling algorithm tailored to the ROGUE framework; provides theoretical sublinear regret guarantees; introduces a probability clipping procedure to enforce minimum exploration probability and balance personalization with population learning; validates on two MRT datasets (physical activity promotion and bipolar disorder treatment).

Result: ROGUE-TS achieves sublinear regret and outperforms existing approaches in the experiments; the clipping procedure maintains high statistical power and enables reliable detection of treatment effects without substantially increasing regret.

Conclusion: The framework offers practical guidance for MRT design by balancing personalization with statistical validity under nonstationary efficacy dynamics, enabling reliable population-level inferences while still delivering personalized recommendations.

Abstract: A common challenge for decision makers is selecting actions whose rewards are
unknown and evolve over time based on prior policies. For instance, repeated
use may reduce an action's effectiveness (habituation), while inactivity may
restore it (recovery). These nonstationarities are captured by the Reducing or
Gaining Unknown Efficacy (ROGUE) bandit framework, which models real-world
settings such as behavioral health interventions. While existing algorithms can
compute sublinear regret policies to optimize these settings, they may not
provide sufficient exploration due to overemphasis on exploitation, limiting
the ability to estimate population-level effects. This is a challenge of
particular interest in micro-randomized trials (MRTs) that aid researchers in
developing just-in-time adaptive interventions that have population-level
effects while still providing personalized recommendations to individuals. In
this paper, we first develop ROGUE-TS, a Thompson Sampling algorithm tailored
to the ROGUE framework, and provide theoretical guarantees of sublinear regret.
We then introduce a probability clipping procedure to balance personalization
and population-level learning, with quantified trade-off that balances regret
and minimum exploration probability. Validation on two MRT datasets concerning
physical activity promotion and bipolar disorder treatment shows that our
methods both achieve lower regret than existing approaches and maintain high
statistical power through the clipping procedure without significantly
increasing regret. This enables reliable detection of treatment effects while
accounting for individual behavioral dynamics. For researchers designing MRTs,
our framework offers practical guidance on balancing personalization with
statistical validity.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A unified Digital Twin (DT) and Graph Neural Network (GNN) framework for real-time pavement health monitoring and proactive maintenance, showing improved forecasting on a realistic dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pavement Management Systems (PMS) are largely reactive and struggle with complex spatial dependencies, environmental variability, and non-linear deterioration; there is a need for scalable, data-driven, real-time predictive maintenance.

Method: Model pavement segments as graph nodes/edges; integrate real-time UAV, sensor, and LiDAR data into a Digital Twin; train an inductive GNN to learn deterioration patterns and forecast distress; provide an interactive dashboard and a reinforcement learning module for simulation and adaptive maintenance planning; evaluate on a real-world-inspired dataset with dynamic connectivity; report R2 = 0.3798 and compare favorably to baselines.

Result: R2 of 0.3798 achieved, outperforming baseline regressors; the model captures non-linear deterioration and supports proactive interventions; interactive dashboard and reinforcement learning enable visualization, simulation, and adaptive planning; closed feedback loop for continuous improvement.

Conclusion: DT-GNN integration strengthens forecasting precision for proactive, intelligent, and sustainable pavement management and serves as a foundation for real-world deployment, multi-agent coordination, and smart-city integration.

Abstract: Pavement infrastructure monitoring is challenged by complex spatial
dependencies, changing environmental conditions, and non-linear deterioration
across road networks. Traditional Pavement Management Systems (PMS) remain
largely reactive, lacking real-time intelligence for failure prevention and
optimal maintenance planning. To address this, we propose a unified Digital
Twin (DT) and Graph Neural Network (GNN) framework for scalable, data-driven
pavement health monitoring and predictive maintenance. Pavement segments and
spatial relations are modeled as graph nodes and edges, while real-time UAV,
sensor, and LiDAR data stream into the DT. The inductive GNN learns
deterioration patterns from graph-structured inputs to forecast distress and
enable proactive interventions. Trained on a real-world-inspired dataset with
segment attributes and dynamic connectivity, our model achieves an R2 of
0.3798, outperforming baseline regressors and effectively capturing non-linear
degradation. We also develop an interactive dashboard and reinforcement
learning module for simulation, visualization, and adaptive maintenance
planning. This DT-GNN integration enhances forecasting precision and
establishes a closed feedback loop for continuous improvement, positioning the
approach as a foundation for proactive, intelligent, and sustainable pavement
management, with future extensions toward real-world deployment, multi-agent
coordination, and smart-city integration.

### [90] [Inference-Time Personalized Alignment with a Few User Preference Queries](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02966)
*Victor-Alexandru Pădurean,Parameswaran Kamalaruban,Nachiket Kotalwar,Alkis Gotovos,Adish Singla*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces UserAlign, an inference-time personalized alignment method that uses few pairwise comparisons and logistic-bandit best-arm identification to select the best model response from a fixed pool, enabling fast, personalized alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To align a generative model's outputs to individual user preferences without requiring large numbers of preference queries or explicit textual preferences, enabling efficient real-time personalization.

Method: Formulates the problem as best-arm identification in logistic bandits; uses a fixed pool of generated responses; queries the user with pairwise comparisons; assumes feedback is consistent and noise-free; derives the most preferred response efficiently.

Result: Empirical results across multiple tasks for text and image generation show that UserAlign achieves personalized alignment with few queries, demonstrating fast convergence and robust performance across tasks.

Conclusion: UserAlign provides a practical inference-time solution for personalized alignment with limited user input, leveraging logistic-bandit theory to quickly identify the best response from a fixed pool and generalize across modalities.

Abstract: We study the problem of aligning a generative model's response with a user's
preferences. Recent works have proposed several different formulations for
personalized alignment; however, they either require a large amount of user
preference queries or require that the preference be explicitly specified as a
text input. In this paper, we propose a novel inference-time personalized
alignment method, UserAlign, that elicits the user's preferences with a few
queries as pairwise response comparisons. In particular, UserAlign builds on
the theoretical framework of best-arm identification in logistic bandits and
selects a personalized response from a fixed pool of the model's generated
responses. The key idea is to consider the user's feedback consistent and
noise-free, and incorporate it into the theoretical framework to identify the
best response quickly. Experimental results across several tasks, involving
personalized text and image generation, showcase the effectiveness of UserAlign
in achieving personalized alignment.

*Stergios Plataniotis,Charilaos Akasiadis,Georgios Chalkiadakis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: EVOI-guided exploration in Bootstrapped DQN improves deep exploration and performance in sparse-reward, high-dimensional RL, leveraging head disagreements and without adding hyperparameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Exploration in deep RL with high-dimensional states and sparse rewards remains inefficient with standard noise-based methods. The paper seeks a principled measure of information value to drive exploration.

Method: Two algorithms that incorporate expected value of information (EVOI) into Bootstrapped DQN. EVOI estimates quantify the gain from learning the value of information and are used to assess discrepancies among network heads, guiding exploration toward regions with the most potential. The approach leverages inherent uncertainty from random initialization and requires no additional hyperparameters.

Result: Empirical evaluation on complex, sparse-reward Atari games shows improved performance and better utilization of uncertainty, indicating enhanced deep exploration without extra hyperparameters.

Conclusion: Integrating EVOI into Bootstrapped DQN yields more effective exploration in sparse, high-dimensional environments by exploiting head disagreement and uncertainty, without introducing new hyperparameters.

Abstract: Efficient exploration in deep reinforcement learning remains a fundamental
challenge, especially in environments characterized by high-dimensional states
and sparse rewards. Traditional exploration strategies that rely on random
local policy noise, such as $\epsilon$-greedy and Boltzmann exploration
methods, often struggle to efficiently balance exploration and exploitation. In
this paper, we integrate the notion of (expected) value of information (EVOI)
within the well-known Bootstrapped DQN algorithmic framework, to enhance the
algorithm's deep exploration ability. Specifically, we develop two novel
algorithms that incorporate the expected gain from learning the value of
information into Bootstrapped DQN. Our methods use value of information
estimates to measure the discrepancies of opinions among distinct network
heads, and drive exploration towards areas with the most potential. We evaluate
our algorithms with respect to performance and their ability to exploit
inherent uncertainty arising from random network initialization. Our
experiments in complex, sparse-reward Atari games demonstrate increased
performance, all the while making better use of uncertainty, and, importantly,
without introducing extra hyperparameters.

### [92] [Heterogeneous Metamaterials Design via Multiscale Neural Implicit Representation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03012)
*Hongrui Chen,Liwei Wang,Levent Burak Kara*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A neural-network based multiscale metamaterial design framework learns a continuous two-scale representation to generate compatible heterogeneous unit cells with infinite upsampling, eliminating predefined datasets and improving boundary connectivity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Designing heterogeneous metamaterials is hard due to an enormous design space and strict compatibility between neighboring unit cells; traditional per-cell optimization is expensive and often yields discontinuities; fixed-library data-driven approaches are limited by datasets and require post-processing for seamlessness.

Method: A multiscale neural representation takes both macroscale and microscale coordinates as inputs and outputs an implicit field that encodes multiscale structures with compatible unit cells; training includes a compatibility loss to enforce connectivity; no predefined dataset is required; enables designs at arbitrarily high resolutions for fabrication and simulation.

Result: Demonstrated on mechanical metamaterial design problems including negative Poisson’s ratio and mechanical cloaking, with potential applications in robotics, bioengineering, and aerospace.

Conclusion: The framework jointly addresses design-space coverage and boundary compatibility by learning a continuous multiscale representation, enabling seamless, high-resolution metamaterial designs without a fixed library and with infinite upsampling capabilities.

Abstract: Metamaterials are engineered materials composed of specially designed unit
cells that exhibit extraordinary properties beyond those of natural materials.
Complex engineering tasks often require heterogeneous unit cells to accommodate
spatially varying property requirements. However, designing heterogeneous
metamaterials poses significant challenges due to the enormous design space and
strict compatibility requirements between neighboring cells. Traditional
concurrent multiscale design methods require solving an expensive optimization
problem for each unit cell and often suffer from discontinuities at cell
boundaries. On the other hand, data-driven approaches that assemble structures
from a fixed library of microstructures are limited by the dataset and require
additional post-processing to ensure seamless connections. In this work, we
propose a neural network-based metamaterial design framework that learns a
continuous two-scale representation of the structure, thereby jointly
addressing these challenges. Central to our framework is a multiscale neural
representation in which the neural network takes both global (macroscale) and
local (microscale) coordinates as inputs, outputting an implicit field that
represents multiscale structures with compatible unit cell geometries across
the domain, without the need for a predefined dataset. We use a compatibility
loss term during training to enforce connectivity between adjacent unit cells.
Once trained, the network can produce metamaterial designs at arbitrarily high
resolution, hence enabling infinite upsampling for fabrication or simulation.
We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach on mechanical
metamaterial design, negative Poisson's ratio, and mechanical cloaking problems
with potential applications in robotics, bioengineering, and aerospace.

*Ole Petersen,Marcel Kollovieh,Marten Lienen,Stephan Günnemann*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GraphBSI introduces a one-shot graph generator based on Bayesian Sample Inference (BSI) that refines a distribution over graphs in continuous parameter space, casts BSI as an SDE to preserve marginals, and achieves state-of-the-art results on Moses/GuacaMol.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Discrete, unordered graphs pose challenges for traditional generative models; existing discrete diffusion/flow methods have limitations; a principled approach that handles discrete structures effectively and can leverage continuous optimization is needed.

Method: Proposes GraphBSI: maintains a belief over distribution parameters rather than samples; iteratively refines this belief; models BSI as a stochastic differential equation and derives a noise-controlled family of SDEs; uses score-function approximation to preserve marginals; establishes connections to Bayesian Flow Networks and diffusion models.

Result: Demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on molecular and synthetic graph generation; outperforms existing one-shot graph generative models on Moses and GuacaMol benchmarks.

Conclusion: GraphBSI offers a principled continuous-space inference framework for discrete graphs, enabling effective one-shot graph generation with theoretical links to established diffusion/bayesian-flow frameworks and strong empirical results.

Abstract: Generating graph-structured data is crucial in applications such as molecular
generation, knowledge graphs, and network analysis. However, their discrete,
unordered nature makes them difficult for traditional generative models,
leading to the rise of discrete diffusion and flow matching models. In this
work, we introduce GraphBSI, a novel one-shot graph generative model based on
Bayesian Sample Inference (BSI). Instead of evolving samples directly, GraphBSI
iteratively refines a belief over graphs in the continuous space of
distribution parameters, naturally handling discrete structures. Further, we
state BSI as a stochastic differential equation (SDE) and derive a
noise-controlled family of SDEs that preserves the marginal distributions via
an approximation of the score function. Our theoretical analysis further
reveals the connection to Bayesian Flow Networks and Diffusion models. Finally,
in our empirical evaluation, we demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on
molecular and synthetic graph generation, outperforming existing one-shot graph
generative models on the standard benchmarks Moses and GuacaMol.

*Lingqing Shen,Chi Heem Wong,Misaki Mito,Arnab Chakrabarti*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Residual-corrected adaptive-sensorless monitoring improves container internal temperature and humidity predictions by correcting biases in sensorless models using live telemetry, achieving lower MAEs and RMSEs on a large dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sensorless models lack telemetry integration and suffer from systematic biases; a framework is needed to adapt predictions using live telemetry to provide accurate, reliable monitoring with less connectivity.

Method: Residual correction method: learn and apply residual biases after observing telemetry to adjust sensorless predictions; classifies as adaptive-sensorless monitoring. Trained/evaluated on 3.48 million data points (largest container-sensor dataset in academic research). Holdout evaluation on simulated data; comparisons against baseline sensorless models using MAE and RMSE metrics for temperature and relative humidity.

Result: Adaptive-sensorless models consistently outperform the baseline, achieving average MAEs of 2.24–2.31°C (temp) vs 2.43°C; RH 5.72–7.09% vs 7.99%; RMSE 3.19–3.26°C vs 3.38°C; RH 7.70–9.12% vs 10.0% on holdout simulated data.

Conclusion: Adaptive-sensorless monitoring enables more accurate cargo monitoring, early risk detection, and reduces dependence on full connectivity in global shipping.

Abstract: Monitoring the internal temperature and humidity of shipping containers is
essential to preventing quality degradation during cargo transportation.
Sensorless monitoring -- machine learning models that predict the internal
conditions of the containers using exogenous factors -- shows promise as an
alternative to monitoring using sensors. However, it does not incorporate
telemetry information and correct for systematic errors, causing the
predictions to differ significantly from the live data and confusing the users.
In this paper, we introduce the residual correction method, a general framework
for correcting for systematic biases in sensorless models after observing live
telemetry data. We call this class of models ``adaptive-sensorless''
monitoring. We train and evaluate adaptive-sensorless models on the 3.48
million data points -- the largest dataset of container sensor readings ever
used in academic research -- and show that they produce consistent improvements
over the baseline sensorless models. When evaluated on the holdout set of the
simulated data, they achieve average mean absolute errors (MAEs) of 2.24 $\sim$
2.31$^\circ$C (vs 2.43$^\circ$C by sensorless) for temperature and 5.72 $\sim$
7.09% for relative humidity (vs 7.99% by sensorless) and average root
mean-squared errors (RMSEs) of 3.19 $\sim$ 3.26$^\circ$C for temperature (vs
3.38$^\circ$C by sensorless) and 7.70 $\sim$ 9.12% for relative humidity (vs
10.0% by sensorless). Adaptive-sensorless models enable more accurate cargo
monitoring, early risk detection, and less dependence on full connectivity in
global shipping.

*James C. Bowden,Sergey Levine,Jennifer Listgarten*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes DADO, a decomposability-aware distributional optimization method for discrete design spaces that uses a soft-factorized search distribution and junction-tree factorization with message passing to improve optimization efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In silico design tasks (e.g., proteins, circuits, materials) involve predicting properties with decomposable predictors. Existing distributional optimization methods fail to exploit such structure, making optimization over combinatorial design spaces inefficient.

Method: Introduce Decomposition-Aware Distributional Optimization (DADO), which leverages decomposability defined by a junction tree on design variables. It uses a soft-factorized search distribution (learned generative model) and applies graph message-passing to coordinate optimization across linked factors.

Result: DADO enables more efficient optimization by exploiting decomposability via the junction-tree structure, guiding the search distribution to focus on favorable regions of the design space.

Conclusion: DADO provides a principled framework for exploiting factorization structure in discrete design optimization, potentially broadening applicability to AI-driven science and engineering problems such as protein design, circuit layout, and material discovery.

Abstract: In the era of AI-driven science and engineering, we often want to design
discrete objects in silico according to user-specified properties. For example,
we may wish to design a protein to bind its target, arrange components within a
circuit to minimize latency, or find materials with certain properties. Given a
property predictive model, in silico design typically involves training a
generative model over the design space (e.g., protein sequence space) to
concentrate on designs with the desired properties. Distributional optimization
-- which can be formalized as an estimation of distribution algorithm or as
reinforcement learning policy optimization -- finds the generative model that
maximizes an objective function in expectation. Optimizing a distribution over
discrete-valued designs is in general challenging because of the combinatorial
nature of the design space. However, many property predictors in scientific
applications are decomposable in the sense that they can be factorized over
design variables in a way that could in principle enable more effective
optimization. For example, amino acids at a catalytic site of a protein may
only loosely interact with amino acids of the rest of the protein to achieve
maximal catalytic activity. Current distributional optimization algorithms are
unable to make use of such decomposability structure. Herein, we propose and
demonstrate use of a new distributional optimization algorithm,
Decomposition-Aware Distributional Optimization (DADO), that can leverage any
decomposability defined by a junction tree on the design variables, to make
optimization more efficient. At its core, DADO employs a soft-factorized
"search distribution" -- a learned generative model -- for efficient navigation
of the search space, invoking graph message-passing to coordinate optimization
across linked factors.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A Vision Transformer trained on implied volatility surfaces (augmented with date) can predict the next-30-days realized volatility for an asset, capturing seasonal and nonlinear patterns in options data; results are preliminary but promising.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore whether transformer architectures, particularly Vision Transformer (ViT), can be effectively applied to options data (IV surfaces) to forecast realized volatility, addressing a gap in the literature where such models are underexplored for options.

Method: Train the Vision Transformer (ViT) on the implied volatility surface (with date information) for a single day to predict the asset's realized volatility over the following 30 days; use IV surface as input features and evaluate the ViT's ability to learn seasonal patterns and nonlinearities.

Result: The ViT demonstrates the ability to learn seasonal patterns and nonlinear features from the IV surface, indicating a promising direction for model development in options data forecasting.

Conclusion: Transformer-based models hold promise for options data forecasting, with ViT-based approaches showing feasibility and potential advantages; further work is needed to benchmark against baselines, expand datasets, and refine architectures for broader option-implied volatility forecasting.

Abstract: Recent work in financial machine learning has shown the virtue of complexity:
the phenomenon by which deep learning methods capable of learning highly
nonlinear relationships outperform simpler approaches in financial forecasting.
While transformer architectures like Informer have shown promise for financial
time series forecasting, the application of transformer models for options data
remains largely unexplored. We conduct preliminary studies towards the
development of a transformer model for options data by training the Vision
Transformer (ViT) architecture, typically used in modern image recognition and
classification systems, to predict the realized volatility of an asset over the
next 30 days from its implied volatility surface (augmented with date
information) for a single day. We show that the ViT can learn seasonal patterns
and nonlinear features from the IV surface, suggesting a promising direction
for model development.

TL;DR: First unsupervised metrics for objective-driven interactions between AI agents and humans, using unlabeled data and fine-tuned LLMs to adapt to distributional shifts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Evaluating objective-driven LLM systems is challenging due to unlabeled data, scalability limits on human annotation, and unreliable judges; a need for ground-truth-free evaluation metrics.

Method: Introduce an unsupervised metric suite that labels user goals, measures goal completion, and quantifies LLM uncertainty by exploiting statistical properties of unlabeled interaction data and adapting with fine-tuned LLMs to distribution shifts.

Result: A novel set of unsupervised evaluation metrics for objective-driven interactions, validated on open-domain and task-specific datasets.

Conclusion: These metrics enable evaluation without grounded human responses, offering a scalable approach to monitor and compare LLM-driven interactions.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have seen increasing popularity in enterprise
applications where AI agents and humans engage in objective-driven
interactions. However, these systems are difficult to evaluate: data may be
complex and unlabeled; human annotation is often impractical at scale; custom
metrics can monitor for specific errors, but not previously-undetected ones;
and LLM judges can produce unreliable results. We introduce the first set of
unsupervised metrics for objective-driven interactions, leveraging statistical
properties of unlabeled interaction data and using fine-tuned LLMs to adapt to
distributional shifts. We develop metrics for labeling user goals, measuring
goal completion, and quantifying LLM uncertainty without grounding evaluations
in human-generated ideal responses. Our approach is validated on open-domain
and task-specific interaction data.

*Riccardo Di Sipio,Jairo Diaz-Rodriguez,Luis Serrano*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A geometric interpretation of Transformer models inspired by General Relativity, proposing curvature in embedding space induced by queries/keys, with attention acting as a discrete connection; empirical curvature evidence via visualization, angle statistics, and context-edit deflection experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand Transformer representations through a differential-geometric lens, investigating whether embedding-space curvature governs token trajectories and whether attention induces observable curvature effects.

Method: Map queries/keys to an effective metric on representation space and treat attention as a discrete connection enabling parallel transport of values. Analyze layer-wise evolution as discrete time steps on a curved manifold, and examine backpropagation as a least-action-like principle. Conduct three experiments: (i) visualize a curvature landscape over a full paragraph; (ii) simulate angle distributions and length-to-chord ratios to assess curvature beyond dimensionality/chance; (iii) perform context-edit deflection tests akin to Einstein's eclipse to detect curvature-induced bends.

Result: Curvature-like phenomena observed: local turning angles vary across tokens/layers; angle and length-to-chord statistics show deviations not explained by dimensionality or random chance; controlled context edits produce measurable, consistent deflections in embedding trajectories that align with attention-induced curvature.

Conclusion: If the analogy is accurate, token trajectories bend due to embedding-space curvature rather than following straight lines. The reported curvature visualizations and context-edit deflections support the presence of curvature induced by attention, suggesting a fruitful direction for interpretability and potential architectural considerations.

Abstract: We present a geometric framework for understanding Transformer-based language
models, drawing an explicit analogy to General Relativity. Queries and keys
induce an effective metric on representation space, and attention acts as a
discrete connection that implements parallel transport of value vectors across
tokens. Stacked layers provide discrete time-slices through which token
representations evolve on this curved manifold, while backpropagation plays the
role of a least-action principle that shapes loss-minimizing trajectories in
parameter space. If this analogy is correct, token embeddings should not
traverse straight paths in feature space; instead, their layer-wise steps
should bend and reorient as interactions mediated by embedding space curvature.
To test this prediction, we design experiments that expose both the presence
and the consequences of curvature: (i) we visualize a curvature landscape for a
full paragraph, revealing how local turning angles vary across tokens and
layers; (ii) we show through simulations that excess counts of sharp/flat
angles and longer length-to-chord ratios are not explainable by dimensionality
or chance; and (iii) inspired by Einstein's eclipse experiment, we probe
deflection under controlled context edits, demonstrating measurable,
meaning-consistent bends in embedding trajectories that confirm
attention-induced curvature.

*Martin Carrasco,Olga Zaghen,Erik Bekkers,Bastian Rieck*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces graph homomorphism distortion as a principled, complete measure of similarity between vertex-attributed graphs, with a sampling-based, expectation-guaranteed computation that yields a metric and complete graph embedding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current expressivity assessments for graph neural networks rely on combinatorial/structural properties. The authors seek a principled, similarity-based framework to compare graphs, addressing limitations of traditional measures and the graph canonization problem.

Method: Define a graph homomorphism distortion; prove it fully characterizes graphs and provides a complete embedding. Propose sampling-based computation to circumvent canonization, with an expectation guarantee of completeness, and derive a metric from the distortion.

Result: Theoretically, the distortion completely distinguishes graphs and enables a metric; empirically, it fully distinguishes the BRE(C) dataset even among graphs indistinguishable by up to 4-WL, and outperforms homomorphism-inspired baselines on ZINC-12k.

Conclusion: The framework advances graph characterization beyond combinatorial properties, enabling principled similarity measures and metrics; it also suggests future research directions while acknowledging the persistent graph canonization challenge.

Abstract: For far too long, expressivity of graph neural networks has been measured
\emph{only} in terms of combinatorial properties. In this work we stray away
from this tradition and provide a principled way to measure similarity between
vertex attributed graphs. We denote this measure as the \emph{graph
homomorphism distortion}. We show it can \emph{completely characterize} graphs
and thus is also a \emph{complete graph embedding}. However, somewhere along
the road, we run into the graph canonization problem. To circumvent this
obstacle, we devise to efficiently compute this measure via sampling, which in
expectation ensures \emph{completeness}. Additionally, we also discovered that
we can obtain a metric from this measure. We validate our claims empirically
and find that the \emph{graph homomorphism distortion}: (1.) fully
distinguishes the \texttt{BREC} dataset with up to $4$-WL non-distinguishable
graphs, and (2.) \emph{outperforms} previous methods inspired in homomorphisms
under the \texttt{ZINC-12k} dataset.
  These theoretical results, (and their empirical validation), pave the way for
future characterization of graphs, extending the graph theoretic tradition to
new frontiers.

*Fatemeh Ghaffari,Siddarth Sitaraman,Xutong Liu,Xuchuang Wang,Mohammad Hajiesmaili*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MSUCB is a robust online learning-to-rank algorithm using a mean-of-medians estimator to handle feedback corruption; it retains optimal regret without corruption and degrades gracefully with corruption, showing strong empirical improvements over state-of-the-art.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Click fraud and corrupted feedback in online learning to rank (OLTR) cause misleading signals, degrading user experience and learning performance; robust algorithms are needed to withstand adversarial manipulations.

Method: Introduce MSUCB with a novel mean-of-medians estimator. The estimator behaves like a standard mean when data are clean; under corruption, the median step filters out outliers and corrupted samples. The estimate updates every round, accelerating convergence. The approach yields optimal logarithmic regret without corruption and additive regret tied to total corruption.

Result: Theoretically, MSUCB achieves optimal logarithmic regret in the clean setting and degrades gracefully under corruption with an additive regret term proportional to total corruption. Empirically, it outperforms two state-of-the-art methods on real datasets, achieving 97.35% and 91.60% regret improvements.

Conclusion: MSUCB provides a robust, efficient solution for OLTR under corrupted feedback, preserving performance in the absence of corruption and offering graceful degradation when corruption is present. It demonstrates strong empirical and theoretical performance and suggests broader applicability to cascading bandits with adversarial feedback.

Abstract: Online learning to rank (OLTR) studies how to recommend a short ranked list
of items from a large pool and improves future rankings based on user clicks.
This setting is commonly modeled as cascading bandits, where the objective is
to maximize the likelihood that the user clicks on at least one of the
presented items across as many timesteps as possible. However, such systems are
vulnerable to click fraud and other manipulations (i.e., corruption), where
bots or paid click farms inject corrupted feedback that misleads the learning
process and degrades user experience. In this paper, we propose MSUCB, a robust
algorithm that incorporates a novel mean-of-medians estimator, which to our
knowledge is applied to bandits with corruption setting for the first time.
This estimator behaves like a standard mean in the absence of corruption, so no
cost is paid for robustness. Under corruption, the median step filters out
outliers and corrupted samples, keeping the estimate close to its true value.
Updating this estimate at every round further accelerates empirical convergence
in experiments. Hence, MSUCB achieves optimal logarithmic regret in the absence
of corruption and degrades gracefully under corruptions, with regret increasing
only by an additive term tied to the total corruption. Comprehensive and
extensive experiments on real-world datasets further demonstrate that our
approach consistently outperforms prior methods while maintaining strong
robustness. In particular, it achieves a \(97.35\%\) and a \(91.60\%\) regret
improvement over two state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: Sparse, self-organizing local kernel ensemble (SparKer) using a semi-supervised Neyman–Pearson framework to locally model anomaly likelihood ratios in high-dimensional representations, achieving interpretable, scalable detection with only a few kernels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Anomaly detection in modern AI representations is hampered by misspecified models; there is a need for sparse, local, competitive methods that preserve geometry and efficiently allocate model capacity.

Method: Propose SparKer: a sparse ensemble of Gaussian kernels trained in a semi-supervised Neyman–Pearson framework to model local likelihood ratios; self-organizing to partition representation space around regions of statistical imbalance; demonstrates principles of sparsity, locality, and competition.

Result: Demonstrates that ensembles with only a handful of kernels identify statistically significant anomalous locations within thousands of dimensions; effective across high-dimensional problems including scientific discovery, open-world novelty detection, intrusion detection, and generative-model validation; highlights interpretability, efficiency, and scalability.

Conclusion: The sparsity–locality–competition design enables robust, scalable anomaly detection in high-dimensional representation spaces and is applicable across natural and computer-science domains.

Abstract: Modern artificial intelligence has revolutionized our ability to extract rich
and versatile data representations across scientific disciplines. Yet, the
statistical properties of these representations remain poorly controlled,
causing misspecified anomaly detection (AD) methods to falter. Weak or rare
signals can remain hidden within the apparent regularity of normal data,
creating a gap in our ability to detect and interpret anomalies. We examine
this gap and identify a set of structural desiderata for detection methods
operating under minimal prior information: sparsity, to enforce parsimony;
locality, to preserve geometric sensitivity; and competition, to promote
efficient allocation of model capacity. These principles define a class of
self-organizing local kernels that adaptively partition the representation
space around regions of statistical imbalance. As an instantiation of these
principles, we introduce SparKer, a sparse ensemble of Gaussian kernels trained
within a semi-supervised Neyman--Pearson framework to locally model the
likelihood ratio between a sample that may contain anomalies and a nominal,
anomaly-free reference. We provide theoretical insights into the mechanisms
that drive detection and self-organization in the proposed model, and
demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach on realistic high-dimensional
problems of scientific discovery, open-world novelty detection, intrusion
detection, and generative-model validation. Our applications span both the
natural- and computer-science domains. We demonstrate that ensembles containing
only a handful of kernels can identify statistically significant anomalous
locations within representation spaces of thousands of dimensions, underscoring
both the interpretability, efficiency and scalability of the proposed approach.

### [102] [Scaling Multi-Agent Environment Co-Design with Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03100)
*Hao Xiang Li,Michael Amir,Amanda Prorok*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DiCoDe is a scalable diffusion-based co-design framework for jointly optimizing agent policies and environment configurations. It introduces Projected Universal Guidance (PUG) for constrained environment sampling and a critic distillation mechanism to adapt the diffusion model to evolving policies, yielding higher rewards with far fewer simulations across benchmarks (e.g., 39% higher rewards in warehouse with 66% fewer samples).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Co-design promises better multi-agent system performance across domains, but existing methods struggle with high-dimensional design spaces and sample inefficiency due to moving targets in joint optimization; there is a need for scalable, data-efficient co-design.

Method: Combine guided diffusion to generate environment configurations with a co-design loop; PUG sampling to enforce hard constraints while exploring reward-maximizing environments; critic distillation to transfer RL critic knowledge into the diffusion guidance, enabling adaptivity to changing agent policies; evaluate on warehouse automation, multi-agent pathfinding, and wind farm optimization.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art on challenging benchmarks, e.g., 39% higher rewards in warehouse with 66% fewer simulation samples; consistent improvements across domains, establishing a new standard for agent-environment co-design.

Conclusion: DiCoDe advances co-design toward practical deployment by delivering scalable, sample-efficient joint optimization. The approach lays groundwork for applying co-design in real-world domains and suggests further improvements in diffusion-guided decision making and critic-based knowledge transfer.

Abstract: The agent-environment co-design paradigm jointly optimises agent policies and
environment configurations in search of improved system performance. With
application domains ranging from warehouse logistics to windfarm management,
co-design promises to fundamentally change how we deploy multi-agent systems.
However, current co-design methods struggle to scale. They collapse under
high-dimensional environment design spaces and suffer from sample inefficiency
when addressing moving targets inherent to joint optimisation. We address these
challenges by developing Diffusion Co-Design (DiCoDe), a scalable and
sample-efficient co-design framework pushing co-design towards practically
relevant settings. DiCoDe incorporates two core innovations. First, we
introduce Projected Universal Guidance (PUG), a sampling technique that enables
DiCoDe to explore a distribution of reward-maximising environments while
satisfying hard constraints such as spatial separation between obstacles.
Second, we devise a critic distillation mechanism to share knowledge from the
reinforcement learning critic, ensuring that the guided diffusion model adapts
to evolving agent policies using a dense and up-to-date learning signal.
Together, these improvements lead to superior environment-policy pairs when
validated on challenging multi-agent environment co-design benchmarks including
warehouse automation, multi-agent pathfinding and wind farm optimisation. Our
method consistently exceeds the state-of-the-art, achieving, for example, 39%
higher rewards in the warehouse setting with 66% fewer simulation samples. This
sets a new standard in agent-environment co-design, and is a stepping stone
towards reaping the rewards of co-design in real world domains.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A resource-efficient text analytics pipeline using CTF-IDF and IRLBA to replace deep learning, achieving faster training and inference with only minor accuracy losses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the growing carbon footprint and computational demand of deep learning in text analytics by revisiting classical methods.

Method: Introduce Clement TF-IDF (CTF-IDF) as a modified TF-IDF preprocessing step and apply IRLBA for dimensionality reduction; evaluate classical ML models in a typical text analytics pipeline.

Result: Substantial reductions in time complexity and computational cost; improved accuracy for classical ML methods using CTF-IDF+IRLBA; deep learning may still offer higher accuracy.

Conclusion: Classical ML approaches with resource-aware feature engineering can compete in text analytics, offering efficient alternatives when carbon footprint and resource constraints are critical.

Abstract: The uprising of deep learning methodology and practice in recent years has
brought about a severe consequence of increasing carbon footprint due to the
insatiable demand for computational resources and power. The field of text
analytics also experienced a massive transformation in this trend of
monopolizing methodology. In this paper, the original TF-IDF algorithm has been
modified, and Clement Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (CTF-IDF) has
been proposed for data preprocessing. This paper primarily discusses the
effectiveness of classical machine learning techniques in text analytics with
CTF-IDF and a faster IRLBA algorithm for dimensionality reduction. The
introduction of both of these techniques in the conventional text analytics
pipeline ensures a more efficient, faster, and less computationally intensive
application when compared with deep learning methodology regarding carbon
footprint, with minor compromise in accuracy. The experimental results also
exhibit a manifold of reduction in time complexity and improvement of model
accuracy for the classical machine learning methods discussed further in this
paper.

*Daniel Wang,Evan Markou,Dylan Campbell*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a forward-mode gradient estimator that reduces both bias and variance by manipulating upstream Jacobians; shows potential to scale to large networks, with performance improving as width grows.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the high-variance, bias-prone forward-mode estimates and the storage/computational costs of backprop, enabling scalable gradient estimation.

Method: Manipulate upstream Jacobian matrices when computing guess directions in forward-mode automatic differentiation; analyze bias/variance and tie to low-dimensional gradient structure.

Result: Initial results are promising; the method scales better with network width, suggesting practicality for larger networks.

Conclusion: Bias-variance analyses illuminate why the estimator scales; the method’s effectiveness is linked to the low-dimensional structure of network gradients.

Abstract: While backpropagation--reverse-mode automatic differentiation--has been
extraordinarily successful in deep learning, it requires two passes (forward
and backward) through the neural network and the storage of intermediate
activations. Existing gradient estimation methods that instead use forward-mode
automatic differentiation struggle to scale beyond small networks due to the
high variance of the estimates. Efforts to mitigate this have so far introduced
significant bias to the estimates, reducing their utility. We introduce a
gradient estimation approach that reduces both bias and variance by
manipulating upstream Jacobian matrices when computing guess directions. It
shows promising results and has the potential to scale to larger networks,
indeed performing better as the network width is increased. Our understanding
of this method is facilitated by analyses of bias and variance, and their
connection to the low-dimensional structure of neural network gradients.

*Jiameng Chen,Yida Xiong,Kun Li,Hongzhi Zhang,Xiantao Cai,Wenbin Hu,Jia Wu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Physics-informed diffusion for antibody design (FP-AbDiff) enforces Fokker-Planck dynamics to ensure dynamical consistency, achieving state-of-the-art performance on RAbD and de novo CDR-H3 design metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current generative antibody models suffer from dynamical inconsistency and poor generalization due to limited data and bias.

Method: Impose Fokker-Planck Equation residual loss on the mixed geometry manifold (R^3 x SO(3)) within a SE(3)-equivariant diffusion framework, combining physics-informed regularization with deep biological priors.

Result: State-of-the-art on RAbD; CDR-H3 RMSD ~0.99 Å; 25% improvement vs AbX; Contact AA Recovery 39.91%; six-CDR co-design shows ~15% RMSD reduction and full-chain AA Recovery 45.67%.

Conclusion: Aligning generative dynamics with physical laws improves robustness and generalizability for faithful, viable antibody design.

Abstract: Computational antibody design holds immense promise for therapeutic
discovery, yet existing generative models are fundamentally limited by two core
challenges: (i) a lack of dynamical consistency, which yields physically
implausible structures, and (ii) poor generalization due to data scarcity and
structural bias. We introduce FP-AbDiff, the first antibody generator to
enforce Fokker-Planck Equation (FPE) physics along the entire generative
trajectory. Our method minimizes a novel FPE residual loss over the mixed
manifold of CDR geometries (R^3 x SO(3)), compelling locally-learned denoising
scores to assemble into a globally coherent probability flow. This
physics-informed regularizer is synergistically integrated with deep biological
priors within a state-of-the-art SE(3)-equivariant diffusion framework.
Rigorous evaluation on the RAbD benchmark confirms that FP-AbDiff establishes a
new state-of-the-art. In de novo CDR-H3 design, it achieves a mean Root Mean
Square Deviation of 0.99 {\AA} when superposing on the variable region, a 25%
improvement over the previous state-of-the-art model, AbX, and the highest
reported Contact Amino Acid Recovery of 39.91%. This superiority is underscored
in the more challenging six-CDR co-design task, where our model delivers
consistently superior geometric precision, cutting the average full-chain Root
Mean Square Deviation by ~15%, and crucially, achieves the highest full-chain
Amino Acid Recovery on the functionally dominant CDR-H3 loop (45.67%). By
aligning generative dynamics with physical laws, FP-AbDiff enhances robustness
and generalizability, establishing a principled approach for physically
faithful and functionally viable antibody design.

### [106] [Periodic Skill Discovery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03187)
*Jonghae Park,Daesol Cho,Jusuk Lee,Dongseok Shim,Inkyu Jang,H. Jin Kim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PSD discovers periodic skills in unsupervised RL by mapping states to a circular latent space, enabling diverse periodic behaviors across timescales and improving downstream task performance (e.g., hurdling); it also enhances existing skill discovery methods by broadening the repertoire.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many robotic tasks, especially locomotion, exhibit periodic behaviors across varying timescales. Existing unsupervised skill discovery methods often ignore periodicity by maximizing state-skill mutual information or latent distance, leading to less diverse or non-periodic skills. A method explicitly modeling periodicity can yield more natural, reusable skills.

Method: Train an encoder that maps states to a circular latent space to capture periodicity. Use temporal distance information to encourage learning skills with diverse periods, even from pixel-based observations. PSD can be combined with existing skill discovery methods to broaden the agent's repertoire.

Result: Learned skills exhibit diverse periodic behaviors and achieve strong performance on downstream tasks such as hurdling, even with pixel observations. When integrated with other skill discovery approaches, PSD increases behavioral diversity.

Conclusion: Periodic Skill Discovery provides a principled unsupervised framework for discovering periodic skills, enabling robust, multi-timescale behaviors and expanding the repertoire of learned skills for downstream tasks.

Abstract: Unsupervised skill discovery in reinforcement learning (RL) aims to learn
diverse behaviors without relying on external rewards. However, current methods
often overlook the periodic nature of learned skills, focusing instead on
increasing the mutual dependence between states and skills or maximizing the
distance traveled in latent space. Considering that many robotic tasks --
particularly those involving locomotion -- require periodic behaviors across
varying timescales, the ability to discover diverse periodic skills is
essential. Motivated by this, we propose Periodic Skill Discovery (PSD), a
framework that discovers periodic behaviors in an unsupervised manner. The key
idea of PSD is to train an encoder that maps states to a circular latent space,
thereby naturally encoding periodicity in the latent representation. By
capturing temporal distance, PSD can effectively learn skills with diverse
periods in complex robotic tasks, even with pixel-based observations. We
further show that these learned skills achieve high performance on downstream
tasks such as hurdling. Moreover, integrating PSD with an existing skill
discovery method offers more diverse behaviors, thus broadening the agent's
repertoire. Our code and demos are available at

### [107] [An Augmentation Overlap Theory of Contrastive Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03114)
*Qi Zhang,Yifei Wang,Yisen Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A theoretical study of self-supervised contrastive learning that develops the augmentation overlap perspective: tight bounds under conditional independence, and asymptotically closed bounds when relaxing to augmentation overlap, plus a new unsupervised metric for evaluating representations that correlates with downstream performance without extra modules; code released.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To demystify how contrastive learning works and provide principled bounds and a practical, unsupervised metric that predicts downstream performance, bridging theory and practice.

Method: First derive the tightest bounds under the standard conditional independence assumption. Then relax this assumption to augmentation overlap, deriving asymptotically closed bounds for downstream performance. Introduce augmentation overlap theory, arguing that aggressive augmentations increase support overlap among intra-class samples, so simply aligning positives should cluster intra-class representations. Based on this perspective, propose an unsupervised metric to evaluate representations that correlates with downstream performance without extra modules.

Result: Theoretical bounds are extended from strict conditional independence to augmentation overlap, yielding asymptotically closed bounds for downstream tasks. The augmentation overlap theory provides a mechanism for why contrastive learning works and leads to a practical unsupervised metric for representation quality that aligns with downstream results.

Conclusion: Augmentation overlap offers a principled explanation for the effectiveness of contrastive learning and enables a scalable unsupervised evaluation of representations; the work provides both theoretical guarantees and a practical metric, with code available."

Abstract: Recently, self-supervised contrastive learning has achieved great success on
various tasks. However, its underlying working mechanism is yet unclear. In
this paper, we first provide the tightest bounds based on the widely adopted
assumption of conditional independence. Further, we relax the conditional
independence assumption to a more practical assumption of augmentation overlap
and derive the asymptotically closed bounds for the downstream performance. Our
proposed augmentation overlap theory hinges on the insight that the support of
different intra-class samples will become more overlapped under aggressive data
augmentations, thus simply aligning the positive samples (augmented views of
the same sample) could make contrastive learning cluster intra-class samples
together. Moreover, from the newly derived augmentation overlap perspective, we
develop an unsupervised metric for the representation evaluation of contrastive
learning, which aligns well with the downstream performance almost without
relying on additional modules. Code is available at

TL;DR: Introduces StaDec and DyDec, two frameworks for generating dynamic/static adversarial inputs to test LLM robustness; automated, model-aware attacks with high transferability; code released.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs show strong zero-shot performance but are vulnerable to adversarial inputs. Existing defenses rely on heuristics; a systematic, automatic method to assess robustness across models is needed as LLMs evolve.

Method: Two attack frameworks: Static Deceptor (StaDec) and Dynamic Deceptor (DyDec). They craft subtle, semantically-preserving perturbations that deceive target LLMs, using an automated, LLM-driven pipeline that avoids external heuristics and enables adaptive, cross-model attacks.

Result: Attacks are effective and transferable across unseen models; demonstrates a systematic self-assessment approach for LLM robustness; code and data release.

Conclusion: Offers a reusable framework for ongoing robustness evaluation of LLMs, highlighting the need for defenses against evolving, adaptive adversaries as LLMs advance, and providing tools to automate adversarial testing.

Abstract: LLMs can provide substantial zero-shot performance on diverse tasks using a
simple task prompt, eliminating the need for training or fine-tuning. However,
when applying these models to sensitive tasks, it is crucial to thoroughly
assess their robustness against adversarial inputs. In this work, we introduce
Static Deceptor (StaDec) and Dynamic Deceptor (DyDec), two innovative attack
frameworks designed to systematically generate dynamic and adaptive adversarial
examples by leveraging the understanding of the LLMs. We produce subtle and
natural-looking adversarial inputs that preserve semantic similarity to the
original text while effectively deceiving the target LLM. By utilizing an
automated, LLM-driven pipeline, we eliminate the dependence on external
heuristics. Our attacks evolve with the advancements in LLMs and demonstrate
strong transferability across models unknown to the attacker. Overall, this
work provides a systematic approach for the self-assessment of an LLM's
robustness. We release our code and data at

### [109] [Test Time Adaptation Using Adaptive Quantile Recalibration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03148)
*Paria Mehrbod,Pedro Vianna,Geraldin Nanfack,Guy Wolf,Eugene Belilovsky*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Adaptive Quantile Recalibration (AQR) is a test-time adaptation method that aligns per-channel activation quantiles to adapt to distribution shifts, is architecture-agnostic across BatchNorm, GroupNorm, and LayerNorm, unsupervised, requires no retraining, and robust to varying batch sizes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional test-time adaptation methods often rely on target-domain priors or require retraining, and batch-normalization-based updates may fail to capture complex activation distributions and are limited to specific normalization layers. There is a need for a practical, architecture-agnostic, unsupervised TTA method that robustly handles distribution tails and works under varying batch sizes.

Method: AQR recalibrates pre-activation distributions by aligning per-channel quantiles. It captures the full shape of activation distributions and is compatible with BN, GN, and LN. It uses source-domain statistics computed during training and employs a robust tail calibration strategy to maintain stability under different batch sizes, enabling unsupervised test-time adaptation without retraining.

Result: Empirical evaluation on CIFAR-10-C, CIFAR-100-C, and ImageNet-C across multiple architectures shows that AQR provides robust adaptation and outperforms existing test-time adaptation baselines.

Conclusion: AQR offers a practical, architecture-agnostic solution for unsupervised test-time adaptation, effective across diverse normalization schemes and data shifts, with strong potential for deployment in dynamic real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Domain adaptation is a key strategy for enhancing the generalizability of
deep learning models in real-world scenarios, where test distributions often
diverge significantly from the training domain. However, conventional
approaches typically rely on prior knowledge of the target domain or require
model retraining, limiting their practicality in dynamic or
resource-constrained environments. Recent test-time adaptation methods based on
batch normalization statistic updates allow for unsupervised adaptation, but
they often fail to capture complex activation distributions and are constrained
to specific normalization layers. We propose Adaptive Quantile Recalibration
(AQR), a test-time adaptation technique that modifies pre-activation
distributions by aligning quantiles on a channel-wise basis. AQR captures the
full shape of activation distributions and generalizes across architectures
employing BatchNorm, GroupNorm, or LayerNorm. To address the challenge of
estimating distribution tails under varying batch sizes, AQR incorporates a
robust tail calibration strategy that improves stability and precision. Our
method leverages source-domain statistics computed at training time, enabling
unsupervised adaptation without retraining models. Experiments on CIFAR-10-C,
CIFAR-100-C, and ImageNet-C across multiple architectures demonstrate that AQR
achieves robust adaptation across diverse settings, outperforming existing
test-time adaptation baselines. These results highlight AQR's potential for
deployment in real-world scenarios with dynamic and unpredictable data
distributions.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Forecast2Anomaly (F2A) tunes Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) with a joint forecast-anomaly loss and augments them with a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) module to enable zero-shot anomaly prediction across diverse datasets, without model updates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Anomaly prediction in multivariate time series is critical for preempting failures and reducing costs, but existing methods are often system-specific and do not generalize to evolving anomaly patterns. TSFMs have strong generalization for forecasting but are underutilized for anomaly prediction.

Method: 1) A joint forecast-anomaly loss to fine-tune TSFMs so they accurately forecast future signals even at anomalous time points. 2) A Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) module that retrieves historically relevant horizons and conditions predictions on them, enabling adaptation to distributional shifts at inference without updating the model.

Result: Extensive experiments across 16 diverse datasets and multiple TSFM backbones show that F2A consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, providing a scalable zero-shot anomaly prediction solution.

Conclusion: F2A bridges robust TSFM zero-shot forecasting and zero-shot anomaly prediction, offering a scalable framework for real-world anomaly forecasting in evolving systems.

Abstract: Forecasting anomalies (anomaly prediction) in multivariate time series from
different real-world, dynamic, and complex systems is vital for preempting
critical failures, leading to a substantial minimization in operational costs
and human labor. Yet, existing methods are limited to specific systems while
failing to generalize to evolving anomaly patterns over time. In contrast,
pretrained Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) have recently demonstrated
strong generalization and zero-shot forecasting capabilities. However, their
potential remains untapped for anomaly prediction, a task fundamentally
different from forecasting normal behavior. Thus, we present Forecast2Anomaly
(F2A), a novel framework that empowers TSFMs with anomaly prediction abilities
through two key innovations. First, we propose a joint forecast-anomaly loss
that fine-tunes TSFMs to accurately forecast future signals even at anomalous
time points. Second, we introduce a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) module
that retrieves historically relevant horizons and conditions predictions on
them. This component dynamically adapts to distributional shifts at inference
time, enabling F2A to track evolving anomalies without requiring model updates.
By combining targeted fine-tuning with dynamic retrieval, F2A bridges the gap
between robust TSFM zero-shot forecasting and zero-shot anomaly prediction.
Extensive experiments across 16 diverse datasets and multiple TSFM backbones
show that F2A consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, offering a
scalable, zero-shot anomaly prediction solution for real-world applications.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: UnCLe is a deep learning framework for dynamic causal discovery that uses a pair of Uncoupler and Recoupler networks to learn time-varying causal relationships from time series via perturbation-based error analysis; it outperforms baselines and uniquely captures evolving causality in synthetic and real data (e.g., human motion).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world systems exhibit causality that changes over time; static causal graphs fail to model temporal dynamics; there is a need for scalable, time-resolved causal graphs to understand evolving mechanisms.

Method: Introduce UnCLe with two networks: Uncoupler disentangles inputs into semantic representations; Recoupler learns inter-variable dependencies through auto-regressive Dependency Matrices. Dynamic causal influences are inferred by analyzing datapoint-wise prediction errors caused by temporal perturbations. The approach aims for scalability and accurate representation of time-varying causality.

Result: Extensive experiments show UnCLe outperforms state-of-the-art static causal discovery baselines and uniquely captures evolving temporal causality in synthetic and real-world dynamic systems, such as human motion.

Conclusion: UnCLe offers a promising, scalable approach to uncover time-varying causal mechanisms and can yield time-resolved causal graphs for complex phenomena.

Abstract: Uncovering cause-effect relationships from observational time series is
fundamental to understanding complex systems. While many methods infer static
causal graphs, real-world systems often exhibit dynamic causality-where
relationships evolve over time. Accurately capturing these temporal dynamics
requires time-resolved causal graphs. We propose UnCLe, a novel deep learning
method for scalable dynamic causal discovery. UnCLe employs a pair of Uncoupler
and Recoupler networks to disentangle input time series into semantic
representations and learns inter-variable dependencies via auto-regressive
Dependency Matrices. It estimates dynamic causal influences by analyzing
datapoint-wise prediction errors induced by temporal perturbations. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that UnCLe not only outperforms state-of-the-art
baselines on static causal discovery benchmarks but, more importantly, exhibits
a unique capability to accurately capture and represent evolving temporal
causality in both synthetic and real-world dynamic systems (e.g., human
motion). UnCLe offers a promising approach for revealing the underlying,
time-varying mechanisms of complex phenomena.

*Mingtao Zhang,Guoli Yang,Zhanxing Zhu,Mengzhu Wang,Xiaoying Bai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A linear-time attention mechanism built on entropy equality; uses an efficient linear-complexity entropy approximation for dot-product-based attention, achieving competitive forecasting with less memory/time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quadratic complexity of standard attention hinders scalability for long sequences; want scalable attention for time-series/spatio-temporal data; also challenge the claim that nonlinearity of softmax is the main benefit; propose that balanced weight distribution suffices.

Method: The authors show that entropy, as a strictly concave function on the probability simplex, implies structural similarity for distributions with aligned rankings and similar entropy. They design a linear-time entropy computation for dot-product-derived distributions and build a linear attention mechanism based on entropy equality.

Result: Empirical validation on four spatio-temporal datasets shows competitive or superior forecasting performance while substantially reducing memory usage and computation time.

Conclusion: Attention effectiveness in spatio-temporal modeling may derive from producing moderate, well-balanced weight distributions; linear entropy-based attention provides scalable, efficient alternative with strong empirical performance.

Abstract: Attention mechanisms have been extensively employed in various applications,
including time series modeling, owing to their capacity to capture intricate
dependencies; however, their utility is often constrained by quadratic
computational complexity, which impedes scalability for long sequences. In this
work, we propose a novel linear attention mechanism designed to overcome these
limitations. Our approach is grounded in a theoretical demonstration that
entropy, as a strictly concave function on the probability simplex, implies
that distributions with aligned probability rankings and similar entropy values
exhibit structural resemblance. Building on this insight, we develop an
efficient approximation algorithm that computes the entropy of
dot-product-derived distributions with only linear complexity, enabling the
implementation of a linear attention mechanism based on entropy equality.
Through rigorous analysis, we reveal that the effectiveness of attention in
spatio-temporal time series modeling may not primarily stem from the
non-linearity of softmax but rather from the attainment of a moderate and
well-balanced weight distribution. Extensive experiments on four
spatio-temporal datasets validate our method, demonstrating competitive or
superior forecasting performance while achieving substantial reductions in both
memory usage and computational time.

*Feng Wu,Tsai Hor Chan,Fuying Wang,Guosheng Yin,Lequan Yu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A copula-driven multimodal framework models the joint distribution across modalities using Gaussian mixture marginals, enabling efficient marginal alignment and missing-modality generation with superior results on MIMIC datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multimodal fusion often relies on simple concatenation or Kronecker products, which fail to capture complex, higher-order interactions between modalities. There is a need to model the joint distribution of latent representations and handle missing modalities; copulas offer a flexible way to link marginals and the joint distribution.

Method: Assume Gaussian mixture distributions for each modality and employ a copula to construct the joint distribution across modalities. Learn the marginals and copula parameters to align modalities and capture complex interactions, enabling generation/imputation for missing modalities. Evaluate on public MIMIC datasets with code release.

Result: The proposed approach achieves superior performance compared with competing methods on MIMIC datasets, demonstrating effective modeling of inter-modal interactions and improved handling of missing modalities.

Conclusion: A copula-based joint distribution framework is a promising direction for multimodal learning, providing a flexible mechanism to align marginals and capture higher-order interactions, with practical benefits for missing-modality prediction and representation learning.

Abstract: Various data modalities are common in real-world applications (e.g.,
electronic health records, medical images and clinical notes in healthcare). It
is essential to develop multimodal learning methods to aggregate various
information from multiple modalities. The main challenge is how to
appropriately align and fuse the representations of different modalities into a
joint distribution. Existing methods mainly rely on concatenation or the
Kronecker product, oversimplifying the interaction structure between modalities
and indicating a need to model more complex interactions. Additionally, the
joint distribution of latent representations with higher-order interactions is
underexplored. Copula is a powerful statistical structure for modelling the
interactions among variables, as it naturally bridges the joint distribution
and marginal distributions of multiple variables. We propose a novel
copula-driven multimodal learning framework, which focuses on learning the
joint distribution of various modalities to capture the complex interactions
among them. The key idea is to interpret the copula model as a tool to align
the marginal distributions of the modalities efficiently. By assuming a
Gaussian mixture distribution for each modality and a copula model on the joint
distribution, our model can generate accurate representations for missing
modalities. Extensive experiments on public MIMIC datasets demonstrate the
superior performance of our model over other competitors. The code is available
at https://github.com/HKU-MedAI/CMCM.

TL;DR: Adapt probabilistic U-Net for climate downscaling; compare afCRPS vs WMSE-MS-SSIM across three settings; WMSE-MS-SSIM helps extremes in some cases, afCRPS captures spatial variability across scales.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Climate models are expensive and output coarse resolutions. Statistical downscaling with uncertainty estimation is needed for impact studies, motivating a probabilistic approach.

Method: Use a probabilistic U‑Net with a deterministic U‑Net backbone and a variational latent space. Evaluate four training objectives (afCRPS and WMSE-MS-SSIM) across three downscaling settings for precipitation and temperature from 16x coarser resolution.

Result: WMSE-MS-SSIM delivers strong performance for extremes under certain settings; afCRPS better captures spatial variability across scales.

Conclusion: Choice of objective matters: WMSE-MS-SSIM is good for extremes in some settings, while afCRPS captures spatial variability across scales; indicates a trade-off depending on downstream goals.

Abstract: Climate models are limited by heavy computational costs, often producing
outputs at coarse spatial resolutions, while many climate change impact studies
require finer scales. Statistical downscaling bridges this gap, and we adapt
the probabilistic U-Net for this task, combining a deterministic U-Net backbone
with a variational latent space to capture aleatoric uncertainty. We evaluate
four training objectives, afCRPS and WMSE-MS-SSIM with three settings for
downscaling precipitation and temperature from $16\times$ coarser resolution.
Our main finding is that WMSE-MS-SSIM performs well for extremes under certain
settings, whereas afCRPS better captures spatial variability across scales.

### [115] [A Quantized VAE-MLP Botnet Detection Model: A Systematic Evaluation of Quantization-Aware Training and Post-Training Quantization Strategies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03201)
*Hassan Wasswa,Hussein Abbass,Timothy Lynar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A VAE-MLP classifier using an 8-D latent representation, quantized with PTQ or QAT, achieves substantial device-level efficiency gains for IoT botnet detection with minimal accuracy loss (PTQ) or modest accuracy decline (QAT).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: IoT botnet attacks are increasing, and state-of-the-art DL detectors are too heavy for constrained IoT devices. Quantization promises lightweight, faster inference and smaller model sizes; this study compares QAT and PTQ on real IoT datasets.

Method: Train an MLP classifier on 8-D latent features from a pretrained VAE encoder. Evaluate two quantization strategies—Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) and Post-Training Quantization (PTQ)—on two IoT botnet datasets (N-BaIoT and CICIoT2022) assessing detection accuracy, storage, and inference latency.

Result: PTQ achieved a 6x speedup and 21x size reduction with only marginal accuracy loss; QAT yielded a 3x speedup and 24x compression but caused a stronger drop in detection accuracy.

Conclusion: Quantization, especially PTQ, is practical for device-level IoT botnet detection, offering favorable speed/size gains with minimal accuracy impact compared with QAT.

Abstract: In an effort to counter the increasing IoT botnet-based attacks,
state-of-the-art deep learning methods have been proposed and have achieved
impressive detection accuracy. However, their computational intensity restricts
deployment on resource-constrained IoT devices, creating a critical need for
lightweight detection models. A common solution to this challenge is model
compression via quantization. This study proposes a VAE-MLP model framework
where an MLP-based classifier is trained on 8-dimensional latent vectors
derived from the high-dimensional train data using the encoder component of a
pretrained variational autoencoder (VAE). Two widely used quantization
strategies--Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) and Post-Training Quantization
(PTQ)--are then systematically evaluated in terms of their impact on detection
performance, storage efficiency, and inference latency using two benchmark IoT
botnet datasets--N-BaIoT and CICIoT2022. The results revealed that, with
respect to detection accuracy, the QAT strategy experienced a more noticeable
decline,whereas PTQ incurred only a marginal reduction compared to the original
unquantized model. Furthermore, PTQ yielded a 6x speedup and 21x reduction in
size, while QAT achieved a 3x speedup and 24x compression, demonstrating the
practicality of quantization for device-level IoT botnet detection.

*Miguel Costa,Arthur Vandervoort,Martin Drews,Karyn Morrissey,Francisco C. Pereira*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RL-driven Integrated Assessment Model to optimize urban flood adaptation for long-term QoL; preliminary results indicate improved performance over baselines; publicly available framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Urban flooding is worsening with climate change, reducing QoL. Planning under uncertainty is challenging; reinforcement learning offers a way to discover adaptive pathways in dynamic, uncertain urban systems.

Method: An Integrated Assessment Model (IAM) combining rainfall projections, a flood model, a transport accessibility model, and a quality-of-life index is used. Reinforcement learning identifies climate adaptation pathways that maximize long-term QoL. The framework is openly available.

Result: Preliminary results suggest the RL-based approach can learn optimal adaptation measures and outperforms other realistic and real-world planning strategies.

Conclusion: The approach shows promise for deriving effective, long-horizon adaptation strategies; the publicly available framework enables replication and extension.

Abstract: Urban flooding is expected to increase in frequency and severity as a
consequence of climate change, causing wide-ranging impacts that include a
decrease in urban Quality of Life (QoL). Meanwhile, policymakers must devise
adaptation strategies that can cope with the uncertain nature of climate change
and the complex and dynamic nature of urban flooding. Reinforcement Learning
(RL) holds significant promise in tackling such complex, dynamic, and uncertain
problems. Because of this, we use RL to identify which climate adaptation
pathways lead to a higher QoL in the long term. We do this using an Integrated
Assessment Model (IAM) which combines a rainfall projection model, a flood
model, a transport accessibility model, and a quality of life index. Our
preliminary results suggest that this approach can be used to learn optimal
adaptation measures and it outperforms other realistic and real-world planning
strategies. Our framework is publicly available:

*Philipp Reis,Philipp Rigoll,Christian Steinhauser,Jacob Langner,Eric Sax*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FCDC turns data collection into a closed-loop control problem to adaptively retain data using online probabilistic models and feedback signals, improving balance and reducing storage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Data-centric AI is hindered by open-loop data collection that creates redundancy; improving data quality/diversity through feedback-driven collection is essential.

Method: Introduce FCDC; online probabilistic model to track current data distribution; regulate sample retention via feedback signals (likelihood, Mahalanobis distance); maintains exploration-exploitation balance; tested on synthetic and real data stream.

Result: Demonstrates controllability on synthetic data; real data stream yields 25.9% more balanced datasets and 39.8% storage reduction.

Conclusion: Data collection can be actively controlled; transforms collection into a self-regulating, feedback-driven core of data-centric AI.

Abstract: Modern AI systems are increasingly constrained not by model capacity but by
the quality and diversity of their data. Despite growing emphasis on
data-centric AI, most datasets are still gathered in an open-loop manner which
accumulates redundant samples without feedback from the current coverage. This
results in inefficient storage, costly labeling, and limited generalization. To
address this, this paper introduces \ac{FCDC}, a paradigm that formulates data
collection as a closed-loop control problem. \ac{FCDC} continuously
approximates the state of the collected data distribution using an online
probabilistic model and adaptively regulates sample retention using based on
feedback signals such as likelihood and Mahalanobis distance. Through this
feedback mechanism, the system dynamically balances exploration and
exploitation, maintains dataset diversity, and prevents redundancy from
accumulating over time. Besides showcasing the controllability of \ac{FCDC} on
a synthetic dataset, experiments on a real data stream show that \ac{FCDC}
produces more balanced datasets by $\SI{25.9}{\percent}$ while reducing data
storage by $\SI{39.8}{\percent}$. These results demonstrate that data
collection itself can be actively controlled, transforming collection from a
passive pipeline stage into a self-regulating, feedback-driven process at the
core of data-centric AI.

### [118] [A unified physics-informed generative operator framework for general inverse problems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03241)
*Gang Bao,Yaohua Zang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A physics-informed generative neural operator (IGNO) for inverse PDE problems that learns latent representations of coefficients and decodes PDE solutions without labeled data, using PDE residuals and normalizing-flow acceleration; robust to noise and discontinuities; outperforms SOTA and generalizes to out-of-distribution targets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Solve inverse PDE problems under sparse/noisy measurements and high-dimensional or discontinuous coefficients, where existing DL methods either need labeled data or are restricted to specific measurement types, limiting practicality.

Method: Unifies inverse problems from point measurements and operator-valued data. Encodes high-dimensional, possibly discontinuous coefficients into a low-dimensional latent space; neural operator decoders reconstruct coefficients and PDE solutions. Training relies on physics constraints via PDE residuals; inversion uses gradient-based optimization in latent space, accelerated by an a priori normalizing flow model.

Result: IGNO consistently achieves accurate, stable, and scalable inversion under severe noise across diverse problems, including discontinuous coefficients from solution-based measurements and EIT with operator-based measurements. It outperforms state-of-the-art methods and generalizes to out-of-distribution targets.

Conclusion: IGNO provides a unified and powerful framework for tackling challenging inverse problems across computational science domains.

Abstract: Solving inverse problems governed by partial differential equations (PDEs) is
central to science and engineering, yet remains challenging when measurements
are sparse, noisy, or when the underlying coefficients are high-dimensional or
discontinuous. Existing deep learning approaches either require extensive
labeled datasets or are limited to specific measurement types, often leading to
failure in such regimes and restricting their practical applicability. Here, a
novel generative neural operator framework, IGNO, is introduced to overcome
these limitations. IGNO unifies the solution of inverse problems from both
point measurements and operator-valued data without labeled training pairs.
This framework encodes high-dimensional, potentially discontinuous coefficient
fields into a low-dimensional latent space, which drives neural operator
decoders to reconstruct both coefficients and PDE solutions. Training relies
purely on physics constraints through PDE residuals, while inversion proceeds
via efficient gradient-based optimization in latent space, accelerated by an a
priori normalizing flow model. Across a diverse set of challenging inverse
problems, including recovery of discontinuous coefficients from solution-based
measurements and the EIT problem with operator-based measurements, IGNO
consistently achieves accurate, stable, and scalable inversion even under
severe noise. It consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art method under
varying noise levels and demonstrates strong generalization to
out-of-distribution targets. These results establish IGNO as a unified and
powerful framework for tackling challenging inverse problems across
computational science domains.

### [119] [GMoPE:A Prompt-Expert Mixture Framework for Graph Foundation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03251)
*Zhibin Wang,Zhixing Zhang,Shuqi Wang,Xuanting Xie,Zhao Kang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GMoPE introduces a graph Mixture-of-Experts with prompt-based learning and soft orthogonality to enable diverse, subdomain-specific expertise; it achieves strong transfer performance with prompt-only fine-tuning, reducing adaptation cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Graph neural networks struggle to generalize across diverse domains and tasks due to negative transfer, scalability issues, and high adaptation costs. There is a need for scalable, generalizable graph foundation models that can adapt efficiently across tasks.

Method: Integrate Mixture-of-Experts with graph prompts (prompt vectors per expert) and structure-aware MoE routing. Apply soft orthogonality constraints across prompt vectors to diversify experts and prevent collapse. Use prompt-only fine-tuning to reduce spatiotemporal complexity during transfer.

Result: GMoPE outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and achieves performance comparable to full parameter fine-tuning while requiring only a fraction of adaptation overhead across multiple downstream tasks and pretraining strategies.

Conclusion: GMoPE offers a principled, scalable framework for building generalizable and efficient graph foundation models by combining MoE, graph prompts, and diversity-promoting constraints.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated impressive performance on
task-specific benchmarks, yet their ability to generalize across diverse
domains and tasks remains limited. Existing approaches often struggle with
negative transfer, scalability issues, and high adaptation costs. To address
these challenges, we propose GMoPE (Graph Mixture of Prompt-Experts), a novel
framework that seamlessly integrates the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture
with prompt-based learning for graphs. GMoPE leverages expert-specific prompt
vectors and structure-aware MoE routing to enable each expert to specialize in
distinct subdomains and dynamically contribute to predictions. To promote
diversity and prevent expert collapse, we introduce a soft orthogonality
constraint across prompt vectors, encouraging expert specialization and
facilitating a more balanced expert utilization. Additionally, we adopt a
prompt-only fine-tuning strategy that significantly reduces spatiotemporal
complexity during transfer. We validate GMoPE through extensive experiments
under various pretraining strategies and multiple downstream tasks. Results
show that GMoPE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and
achieves performance comparable to full parameter fine-tuning-while requiring
only a fraction of the adaptation overhead. Our work provides a principled and
scalable framework for advancing generalizable and efficient graph foundation
models.

### [120] [Climate Adaptation with Reinforcement Learning: Economic vs. Quality of Life Adaptation Pathways](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03243)
*Miguel Costa,Arthur Vandervoort,Martin Drews,Karyn Morrissey,Francisco C. Pereira*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Reinforcement Learning within an Integrated Assessment Model (IAM) is used to explore flood adaptation under climate uncertainty, comparing policies that prioritize quality of life (QoL) versus economic impacts. Findings: prioritising QoL increases total adaptation spending and yields a more even geographic distribution; normative choices significantly shape policy outcomes. An open-source framework is provided for replication.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address long-term uncertainty in flood risk and surface the impact of explicit normative choices on adaptation policy, while offering a flexible method to compare policy objectives.

Method: Integrate rainfall and flood modeling with a reinforcement learning agent inside an IAM. The agent selects adaptation actions (e.g., spending/investments) under uncertainty and evaluates outcomes via QoL, transportation, and infrastructure damage metrics. Compare policy objectives by varying the objective function (QoL-first vs economic-first).

Result: QoL-prioritized policies lead to higher total adaptation spending and a more even distribution of spending across the study area, indicating normative assumptions materially alter policy outcomes.

Conclusion: RL-enabled IAM is a useful framework for exploring adaptation under climate uncertainty and for explicitly comparing normative policy priorities; the authors provide an open-source implementation for replication and further research.

Abstract: Climate change will cause an increase in the frequency and severity of flood
events, prompting the need for cohesive adaptation policymaking. Designing
effective adaptation policies, however, depends on managing the uncertainty of
long-term climate impacts. Meanwhile, such policies can feature important
normative choices that are not always made explicit. We propose that
Reinforcement Learning (RL) can be a useful tool to both identify adaptation
pathways under uncertain conditions while it also allows for the explicit
modelling (and consequent comparison) of different adaptation priorities (e.g.
economic vs. wellbeing). We use an Integrated Assessment Model (IAM) to link
together a rainfall and flood model, and compute the impacts of flooding in
terms of quality of life (QoL), transportation, and infrastructure damage. Our
results show that models prioritising QoL over economic impacts results in more
adaptation spending as well as a more even distribution of spending over the
study area, highlighting the extent to which such normative assumptions can
alter adaptation policy. Our framework is publicly available:

### [121] [Extending Fair Null-Space Projections for Continuous Attributes to Kernel Methods](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03304)
*Felix Störck,Fabian Hinder,Barbara Hammer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Generalizes iterative null-space projection to kernel methods for continuous protected attributes, enabling fair SVR with kernel embeddings and showing competitive results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fairness research is largely discrete; continuous protected attributes in regression (continuous fairness) are underexplored. This work extends fairness tooling to regression with continuous attributes via kernel methods.

Method: Generalize iterative null-space projection to kernel embeddings, creating a model- and fairness-score-agnostic method for kernel representations applicable to continuous protected attributes; apply with Support Vector Regression and compare to contemporary methods across datasets.

Result: Demonstrates competitive or improved performance across multiple datasets relative to contemporary methods, and extends continuous fairness to kernel-based regression.

Conclusion: Extends the fairness toolkit to continuous protected attributes in kernel regression; broadens applicability of null-space projection; SVR integration is effective.

Abstract: With the on-going integration of machine learning systems into the everyday
social life of millions the notion of fairness becomes an ever increasing
priority in their development. Fairness notions commonly rely on protected
attributes to assess potential biases. Here, the majority of literature focuses
on discrete setups regarding both target and protected attributes. The
literature on continuous attributes especially in conjunction with regression
-- we refer to this as \emph{continuous fairness} -- is scarce. A common
strategy is iterative null-space projection which as of now has only been
explored for linear models or embeddings such as obtained by a non-linear
encoder. We improve on this by generalizing to kernel methods, significantly
extending the scope. This yields a model and fairness-score agnostic method for
kernel embeddings applicable to continuous protected attributes. We demonstrate
that our novel approach in conjunction with Support Vector Regression (SVR)
provides competitive or improved performance across multiple datasets in
comparisons to other contemporary methods.

### [122] [Decoupled Entropy Minimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03256)
*Jing Ma,Hanlin Li,Xiang Xiang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AdaDEM decouples entropy minimization into two opposing forces—CADF that pushes for dominant classes and MEC that calibrates marginal entropy—to address reward collapse and easy-class bias. It replaces GMC with MEC and normalizes CADF, achieving superior performance over DEM* across imperfectly supervised tasks in noisy/dynamic environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classical entropy minimization is limited by a coupled formulation that can cause reward collapse (overemphasis on high-certainty samples) and easy-class bias (misalignment between predicted and label distributions). A decoupled, adaptive approach could uncover the internal mechanism of EM and improve learning under imperfect supervision.

Method: Reformulate EM into two opposite components: cluster aggregation driving factor (CADF) that rewards dominant classes and yields a peaked distribution, and gradient mitigation calibrator (GMC) that penalizes high-confidence predictions. AdaDEM normalizes the reward from CADF and replaces GMC with a marginal entropy calibrator (MEC). This decoupled, adaptive framework aims to stabilize learning under noisy/dynamic supervision.

Result: AdaDEM outperforms DEM*, an upper-bound variant of classical EM, and achieves superior performance across various imperfectly supervised learning tasks in noisy and dynamic environments.

Conclusion: Decoupling entropy minimization into CADF and MEC effectively mitigates reward collapse and easy-class bias, providing more robust and better-performing learning under imperfect supervision through AdaDEM.

Abstract: Entropy Minimization (EM) is beneficial to reducing class overlap, bridging
domain gap, and restricting uncertainty for various tasks in machine learning,
yet its potential is limited. To study the internal mechanism of EM, we
reformulate and decouple the classical EM into two parts with opposite effects:
cluster aggregation driving factor (CADF) rewards dominant classes and prompts
a peaked output distribution, while gradient mitigation calibrator (GMC)
penalizes high-confidence classes based on predicted probabilities.
Furthermore, we reveal the limitations of classical EM caused by its coupled
formulation: 1) reward collapse impedes the contribution of high-certainty
samples in the learning process, and 2) easy-class bias induces misalignment
between output distribution and label distribution. To address these issues, we
propose Adaptive Decoupled Entropy Minimization (AdaDEM), which normalizes the
reward brought from CADF and employs a marginal entropy calibrator (MEC) to
replace GMC. AdaDEM outperforms DEM*, an upper-bound variant of classical EM,
and achieves superior performance across various imperfectly supervised
learning tasks in noisy and dynamic environments.

### [123] [Diffusion Language Models are Super Data Learners](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03276)
*Jinjie Ni,Qian Liu,Longxu Dou,Chao Du,Zili Wang,Hang Yan,Tianyu Pang,Michael Qizhe Shieh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Diffusion language models (DLMs) can outperform autoregressive (AR) models when data is limited, with the crossover depending on data amount/quality, model size, and architecture. This advantage arises from any-order modeling, iterative bidirectional denoising providing super-dense compute, and built-in Monte Carlo augmentation. Scaling to 1.7B DLM with ~1.5T tokens can beat a strictly matched AR coder; even 1B-parameter DLMs achieve strong results with limited data. Rising validation cross-entropy in training does not necessarily hurt downstream performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understand when diffusion pretraining can outperform autoregressive modeling under data- and compute-constrained regimes, identify the mechanisms driving any observed advantage, and assess scalability and practical implications for language modeling.

Method: Controlled pre-training experiments comparing diffusion language models to autoregressive models across varying data regimes, model sizes, and architectures. Analyze contributions from (1) any-order modeling, (2) iterative bidirectional denoising (super-dense compute), and (3) built-in Monte Carlo augmentation. Evaluate downstream tasks (e.g., HellaSwag, MMLU) and track metrics such as cross-entropy and accuracy under different data constraints and compute budgets.

Result: In data-constrained settings, DLMs consistently surpass AR models when trained for more epochs, with the crossover shifting earlier or later based on data quality/amount, model size, and architecture. The gains stem from the three factors listed above. AR improvements via input/parameter noise are insufficient to close the gap. A 1.7B DLM trained on ~1.5T-token compute over 10B Python tokens outperforms a strictly matched AR coder. A 1B-parameter DLM achieves >56% HellaSwag and >33% MMLU with only 1B tokens, simply by repeating standard pre-training data. Additionally, rising validation cross-entropy does not imply degraded downstream performance in this regime.

Conclusion: Diffusion pretraining offers a robust advantage in data-scarce regimes, and its benefits persist with scale across diverse architectures and data quality. The identified mechanisms—any-order modeling, dense iterative denoising, and Monte Carlo augmentation—help explain the observed gains, suggesting practical pathways to leverage diffusion approaches when data is limited.

Abstract: Under strictly controlled pre-training settings, we observe a Crossover: when
unique data is limited, diffusion language models (DLMs) consistently surpass
autoregressive (AR) models by training for more epochs. The crossover shifts
later with more or higher-quality data, earlier with larger models, and
persists across dense and sparse architectures. We attribute the gains to three
compounding factors: (1) any-order modeling, (2) super-dense compute from
iterative bidirectional denoising, and (3) built-in Monte Carlo augmentation;
input or parameter noise improves AR under data constraint but cannot close the
gap. At scale, a 1.7B DLM trained with a ~1.5T-token compute budget on 10B
unique Python tokens overtakes an AR coder trained with strictly matched
settings. In addition, a 1B-parameter DLM achieves > 56% accuracy on HellaSwag
and > 33% on MMLU using only 1B tokens, without any special tricks, just by
repeating standard pre-training data. We also show that rising validation
cross-entropy does not imply degraded downstream performance in this regime.

*Alexandros Vazaios,Jannis Brugger,Cedric Derstroff,Kristian Kersting,Mira Mezini*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Adaptable HER integrates hindsight experience replay with AlphaZero-like MCTS to address sparse rewards; the framework offers configurable relabeled goals, targets, and trajectory choices, improving learning and surpassing pure supervised or reinforcement learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AlphaZero-style MCTS struggles in sparse reward settings, especially early in training when the network lacks guidance. Hindsight Experience Replay provides learning signals by relabeling trajectories, but its integration with AlphaZero is not fixed. The paper introduces a flexible, adaptable framework to combine HER with AlphaZero to improve learning in classical search problems.

Method: Proposes Adaptable HER (abbrv. \ours{}), a framework that integrates HER with AlphaZero and allows easy adjustment of HER properties: relabeled goals, policy targets, and trajectory selection. The framework is validated on tasks including equation discovery.

Result: The study shows that having the ability to modify HER properties yields benefits and outperforms pure supervised learning or reinforcement learning baselines.

Conclusion: Adaptable HER provides a flexible, effective way to enhance AlphaZero-like search in sparse-reward classical problems; adjustable relabeling strategies can lead to superior performance across domains such as equation discovery.

Abstract: AlphaZero-like Monte Carlo Tree Search systems, originally introduced for
two-player games, dynamically balance exploration and exploitation using neural
network guidance. This combination makes them also suitable for classical
search problems. However, the original method of training the network with
simulation results is limited in sparse reward settings, especially in the
early stages, where the network cannot yet give guidance. Hindsight Experience
Replay (HER) addresses this issue by relabeling unsuccessful trajectories from
the search tree as supervised learning signals. We introduce Adaptable HER
(\ours{}), a flexible framework that integrates HER with AlphaZero, allowing
easy adjustments to HER properties such as relabeled goals, policy targets, and
trajectory selection. Our experiments, including equation discovery, show that
the possibility of modifying HER is beneficial and surpasses the performance of
pure supervised or reinforcement learning.

TL;DR: Adaptive rate limiting for cloud microservices using a hybrid DQN-A3C RL approach to optimize throughput and latency under high load; validated in Kubernetes with substantial gains and production deployment benefits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional rate-limiting algorithms struggle with dynamic traffic and varying load; there is a need for adaptive strategies that can balance throughput and service latency in microservice environments.

Method: Model rate-limiting decisions as a Markov Decision Process and employ a hybrid reinforcement learning architecture combining Deep Q-Network (DQN) and Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic (A3C) algorithms. The system monitors microservice state and learns policies through environmental interaction in a Kubernetes cluster.

Result: Experiments show 23.7% throughput improvement and 31.4% reduction in P99 latency under high load compared to fixed-threshold methods. A 90-day production deployment handling ~500 million daily requests achieved 82% fewer service degradation incidents and 68% fewer manual interventions.

Conclusion: An RL-based adaptive rate-limiting strategy can significantly improve throughput and latency performance and reduce operational incidents in cloud-native microservices, validating practical applicability in production environments.

Abstract: As cloud computing and microservice architectures become increasingly
prevalent, API rate limiting has emerged as a critical mechanism for ensuring
system stability and service quality. Traditional rate limiting algorithms,
such as token bucket and sliding window, while widely adopted, struggle to
adapt to dynamic traffic patterns and varying system loads. This paper proposes
an adaptive rate limiting strategy based on deep reinforcement learning that
dynamically balances system throughput and service latency. We design a hybrid
architecture combining Deep Q-Network (DQN) and Asynchronous Advantage
Actor-Critic (A3C) algorithms, modeling the rate limiting decision process as a
Markov Decision Process. The system continuously monitors microservice states
and learns optimal rate limiting policies through environmental interaction.
Extensive experiments conducted in a Kubernetes cluster environment demonstrate
that our approach achieves 23.7% throughput improvement and 31.4% P99 latency
reduction compared to traditional fixed-threshold strategies under high-load
scenarios. Results from a 90-day production deployment handling 500 million
daily requests validate the practical effectiveness of the proposed method,
with 82% reduction in service degradation incidents and 68% decrease in manual
interventions.

*Rob Romijnders,Gabriele Cesa,Christos Louizos,Kumar Pratik,Arash Behboodi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Probabilistic multi-reference alignment (MRA) can be improved by marginalizing relative poses as nuisance variables to remove global symmetries, enabling decentralized algorithms that reduce cubic complexity via cycle consistency and achieve lower reconstruction error.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Aligning and reconstructing signals from misaligned observations is central across fields (cryo-EM, computer vision, wireless). Global symmetries hinder scalability and convergence in MRA; a scalable, convergent method is needed.

Method: Model MRA probabilistically and treat relative poses as nuisance variables to marginalize them. Propose two decentralized algorithms that bypass centralized cubic-scaling by enforcing cycle consistency, enabling direct solutions and faster convergence.

Result: Both algorithms achieve lower reconstruction error across various experiments and provide significant computational savings by avoiding cubic scaling, with improved convergence.

Conclusion: Marginalizing relative poses to remove global symmetries yields more direct solutions for MRA. A decentralized, cycle-consistent approach reduces complexity and improves performance, applicable to broad MRA contexts including cryo-EM and wireless communications.

Abstract: From molecular imaging to wireless communications, the ability to align and
reconstruct signals from multiple misaligned observations is crucial for system
performance. We study the problem of multi-reference alignment (MRA), which
arises in many real-world problems, such as cryo-EM, computer vision, and, in
particular, wireless communication systems. Using a probabilistic approach to
model MRA, we find a new algorithm that uses relative poses as nuisance
variables to marginalize out -- thereby removing the global symmetries of the
problem and allowing for more direct solutions and improved convergence. The
decentralization of this approach enables significant computational savings by
avoiding the cubic scaling of centralized methods through cycle consistency.
Both proposed algorithms achieve lower reconstruction error across experimental
settings.

### [127] [Graph Neural AI with Temporal Dynamics for Comprehensive Anomaly Detection in Microservices](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03285)
*Qingyuan Zhang,Ning Lyu,Le Liu,Yuxi Wang,Ziyu Cheng,Cancan Hua*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A unified graph neural network and temporal modeling framework for anomaly detection and root-cause tracing in microservice call graphs, achieving strong performance and robustness across dynamic topologies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Microservice architectures generate complex, evolving call graphs where anomalies can propagate through dependencies. Traditional methods struggle to jointly model structure and time, hindering accurate detection and tracing.

Method: Represent the microservice call chain as a directed graph with multidimensional node/edge features. Apply graph convolution to capture structural dependencies among services, followed by gated recurrent units (GRUs) to model temporal evolution. Use multi-layer stacking and feature concatenation to fuse structural and temporal representations. Compute anomaly scores at node and path levels to enable both local detection and global call-chain tracing of propagation paths.

Result: The framework outperforms baselines on key metrics (AUC, accuracy, recall, F1) and remains stable under dynamic topologies and environmental disturbances, demonstrating effective local anomaly detection and global root-cause tracing, with robust propagation path reconstruction.

Conclusion: This work provides a new technical pathway for anomaly detection in microservices and establishes a methodological foundation for intelligent operations in distributed systems.

Abstract: This study addresses the problem of anomaly detection and root cause tracing
in microservice architectures and proposes a unified framework that combines
graph neural networks with temporal modeling. The microservice call chain is
abstracted as a directed graph, where multidimensional features of nodes and
edges are used to construct a service topology representation, and graph
convolution is applied to aggregate features across nodes and model
dependencies, capturing complex structural relationships among services. On
this basis, gated recurrent units are introduced to model the temporal
evolution of call chains, and multi-layer stacking and concatenation operations
are used to jointly obtain structural and temporal representations, improving
the ability to identify anomaly patterns. Furthermore, anomaly scoring
functions at both the node and path levels are defined to achieve unified
modeling from local anomaly detection to global call chain tracing, which
enables the identification of abnormal service nodes and the reconstruction of
potential anomaly propagation paths. Sensitivity experiments are then designed
from multiple dimensions, including hyperparameters, environmental
disturbances, and data distribution, to evaluate the framework, and results
show that it outperforms baseline methods in key metrics such as AUC, ACC,
Recall, and F1-Score, maintaining high accuracy and stability under dynamic
topologies and complex environments. This research not only provides a new
technical path for anomaly detection in microservices but also lays a
methodological foundation for intelligent operations in distributed systems.

### [128] [Efficient Neural Networks with Discrete Cosine Transform Activations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03531)
*Marc Martinez-Gost,Sara Pepe,Ana Pérez-Neira,Miguel Ángel Lagunas*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Extends Expressive Neural Networks (ENN) with a DCT-based adaptive activation parameterization to enable pruning, interpretability, and efficiency; achieves high accuracy with compact models and can prune up to 40% of activation coefficients.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhance efficiency, interpretability, and pruning capability of ENNs by leveraging the decorrelated, structured DCT parameterization to identify and remove redundant components.

Method: Parameterize neuron activations using Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) coefficients to create a decorrelated, structured representation; develop a pruning strategy that removes less important DCT coefficients with negligible performance loss; validate on classification and implicit neural representation tasks.

Result: Attains state-of-the-art accuracy with a low parameter count; demonstrates that up to 40% of activation coefficients can be pruned safely due to DCT orthogonality and boundedness.

Conclusion: Shows that integrating signal-processing concepts like DCT into neural network design yields a principled trade-off among expressiveness, compactness, and interpretability, with effective pruning capabilities.

Abstract: In this paper, we extend our previous work on the Expressive Neural Network
(ENN), a multilayer perceptron with adaptive activation functions parametrized
using the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT). Building upon previous work that
demonstrated the strong expressiveness of ENNs with compact architectures, we
now emphasize their efficiency, interpretability and pruning capabilities. The
DCT-based parameterization provides a structured and decorrelated
representation that reveals the functional role of each neuron and allows
direct identification of redundant components. Leveraging this property, we
propose an efficient pruning strategy that removes unnecessary DCT coefficients
with negligible or no loss in performance. Experimental results across
classification and implicit neural representation tasks confirm that ENNs
achieve state-of-the-art accuracy while maintaining a low number of parameters.
Furthermore, up to 40% of the activation coefficients can be safely pruned,
thanks to the orthogonality and bounded nature of the DCT basis. Overall, these
findings demonstrate that the ENN framework offers a principled integration of
signal processing concepts into neural network design, achieving a balanced
trade-off between expressiveness, compactness, and interpretability.

*Iason Chrysomallis,Georgios Chalkiadakis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A comprehensive survey of imitation learning advances, proposing a new taxonomy and evaluating strengths, limitations, and future directions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To synthesize rapid IL developments across diverse data regimes, address enduring challenges (generalization, covariate shift, demonstration quality), and provide a coherent taxonomy and evaluation guidance for the field.

Method: Systematic literature review of recent imitation learning work across full state-action, partial, and unlabeled data; critical appraisal of evaluation practices; proposal of a novel, distinct taxonomy; synthesis of trends, applications; outlining challenges and open directions.

Result: Introduction of a novel IL taxonomy distinct from existing categorizations; critical assessment of representative works; synthesis of trends, applications, and evaluation practices; identification of open challenges and directions for future work.

Conclusion: IL continues to grow with deep learning; the proposed taxonomy clarifies the field and guides future research; ongoing challenges include generalization, covariate shift, data efficiency, demonstration quality, and robust evaluation; future work should standardize evaluation practices and address diverse data regimes.

Abstract: Imitation learning (IL) enables agents to acquire skills by observing and
replicating the behavior of one or multiple experts. In recent years, advances
in deep learning have significantly expanded the capabilities and scalability
of imitation learning across a range of domains, where expert data can range
from full state-action trajectories to partial observations or unlabeled
sequences. Alongside this growth, novel approaches have emerged, with new
methodologies being developed to address longstanding challenges such as
generalization, covariate shift, and demonstration quality. In this survey, we
review the latest advances in imitation learning research, highlighting recent
trends, methodological innovations, and practical applications. We propose a
novel taxonomy that is distinct from existing categorizations to better reflect
the current state of the IL research stratum and its trends. Throughout the
survey, we critically examine the strengths, limitations, and evaluation
practices of representative works, and we outline key challenges and open
directions for future research.

### [130] [SORTeD Rashomon Sets of Sparse Decision Trees: Anytime Enumeration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03344)
*Elif Arslan,Jacobus G. M. van der Linden,Serge Hoogendoorn,Marco Rinaldi,Emir Demirović*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SORTD provides scalable, anytime enumeration of Rashomon sets for sparse decision trees, enabling multiple near-optimal trees to improve interpretability and stakeholder-aligned customization without embedding criteria in the objective.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The optimal sparse decision tree is NP-hard to find, and relying on a single best tree limits interpretability and stakeholder alignment. Rashomon sets offer multiple high-performing, diverse trees to support variable importance analysis, explanations, and preference-driven choices (e.g., fairness) without hard-coding criteria into the optimization.

Method: Introduce SORTD, a framework that enumerates trees in the Rashomon set in order of the objective value, delivering anytime results. It supports any separable and totally ordered objective and allows post-evaluation with other separable (and partially ordered) objectives, enabling flexible analysis and selection.

Result: SORTD achieves up to 100x faster runtimes (two orders of magnitude) compared with the state of the art, and can compute Rashomon sets for any separable and totally ordered objective. It also enables post-evaluating the set with other objectives, making Rashomon-set exploration practical for real-world applications.

Conclusion: By enabling scalable, ordered, and post-evaluable Rashomon-set exploration, SORTD makes it feasible to use multiple high-performing trees for explanation, variable importance, and stakeholder-aligned model selection in real-world, high-stakes settings.

Abstract: Sparse decision tree learning provides accurate and interpretable predictive
models that are ideal for high-stakes applications by finding the single most
accurate tree within a (soft) size limit. Rather than relying on a single
"best" tree, Rashomon sets-trees with similar performance but varying
structures-can be used to enhance variable importance analysis, enrich
explanations, and enable users to choose simpler trees or those that satisfy
stakeholder preferences (e.g., fairness) without hard-coding such criteria into
the objective function. However, because finding the optimal tree is NP-hard,
enumerating the Rashomon set is inherently challenging. Therefore, we introduce
SORTD, a novel framework that improves scalability and enumerates trees in the
Rashomon set in order of the objective value, thus offering anytime behavior.
Our experiments show that SORTD reduces runtime by up to two orders of
magnitude compared with the state of the art. Moreover, SORTD can compute
Rashomon sets for any separable and totally ordered objective and supports
post-evaluating the set using other separable (and partially ordered)
objectives. Together, these advances make exploring Rashomon sets more
practical in real-world applications.

### [131] [A Modular, Data-Free Pipeline for Multi-Label Intention Recognition in Transportation Agentic AI Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03363)
*Xiaocai Zhang,Hur Lim,Ke Wang,Zhe Xiao,Jing Wang,Kelvin Lee,Xiuju Fu,Zheng Qin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes DMTC: a data-free, modular pipeline for multi-label intention recognition in transportation using LLM-generated synthetic data, Sentence-T5 embeddings, and online focal-contrastive loss; achieves strong performance and reduces labeling burden; enables intent-aware modular routing in maritime context.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the reliance on large, labeled corpora for fine-grained, multi-label intent recognition in agentic AI for transportation. Reduce labeling costs and improve robustness across scenarios while enabling modular routing of intents.

Method: Three-step pipeline (DMTC): 1) prompt-engineer LLMs to generate diverse synthetic queries across transport scenarios; 2) encode queries with Sentence-T5 to obtain compact semantic embeddings; 3) train a lightweight classifier using online focal-contrastive (OFC) loss to emphasize hard samples and maximize inter-class separability. Evaluated in a maritime transportation setting, compared against state-of-the-art multi-label classifiers and end-to-end SOTA LLM baselines.

Result: DMTC achieves a Hamming loss of 5.35% and an AUC of 95.92%, outperforming state-of-the-art multi-label classifiers and recent end-to-end SOTA LLM-based baselines. Sentence-T5 embeddings improve subset accuracy by at least 3.29% over alternative encoders, and integrating OFC loss yields an additional 0.98% gain over standard contrastive objectives.

Conclusion: The system routes user queries to task-specific modules (e.g., ETA information, traffic risk evaluation) in transportation, enabling fully autonomous, intention-aware agents without costly manual labeling and laying groundwork for practical deployment in agentic AI applications.

Abstract: In this study, a modular, data-free pipeline for multi-label intention
recognition is proposed for agentic AI applications in transportation. Unlike
traditional intent recognition systems that depend on large, annotated corpora
and often struggle with fine-grained, multi-label discrimination, our approach
eliminates the need for costly data collection while enhancing the accuracy of
multi-label intention understanding. Specifically, the overall pipeline, named
DMTC, consists of three steps: 1) using prompt engineering to guide large
language models (LLMs) to generate diverse synthetic queries in different
transport scenarios; 2) encoding each textual query with a Sentence-T5 model to
obtain compact semantic embeddings; 3) training a lightweight classifier using
a novel online focal-contrastive (OFC) loss that emphasizes hard samples and
maximizes inter-class separability. The applicability of the proposed pipeline
is demonstrated in an agentic AI application in the maritime transportation
context. Extensive experiments show that DMTC achieves a Hamming loss of 5.35%
and an AUC of 95.92%, outperforming state-of-the-art multi-label classifiers
and recent end-to-end SOTA LLM-based baselines. Further analysis reveals that
Sentence-T5 embeddings improve subset accuracy by at least 3.29% over
alternative encoders, and integrating the OFC loss yields an additional 0.98%
gain compared to standard contrastive objectives. In conclusion, our system
seamlessly routes user queries to task-specific modules (e.g., ETA information,
traffic risk evaluation, and other typical scenarios in the transportation
domain), laying the groundwork for fully autonomous, intention-aware agents
without costly manual labelling.

### [132] [Learning Under Laws: A Constraint-Projected Neural PDE Solver that Eliminates Hallucinations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03578)
*Mainak Singha*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A physics-constrained neural PDE solver that enforces conservation, Rankine–Hugoniot, entropy, and positivity via differentiable projection, achieving physically admissible solutions with modest overhead and stable long-horizon predictions on Burgers and Euler equations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neural solvers for PDEs often violate fundamental physical laws; there is a need to train models in a way that inherently respects physics rather than relying on post hoc penalties.

Method: Introduce Constraint-Projected Learning (CPL): project network outputs onto the intersection of constraint sets (conservation, Rankine–Hugoniot balance, entropy, positivity) through a differentiable projection; add total-variation damping (TVD) and a rollout curriculum to enforce long-horizon consistency.

Result: Conservation holds at machine precision; total-variation growth vanishes; entropy and error remain bounded; stable, physically lawful solutions achieved without sacrificing accuracy on Burgers and Euler systems.

Conclusion: Instead of hoping neural solvers respect physics, CPL embeds physical admissibility into the learning process, making physics-lawfulness an intrinsic property of the solver.

Abstract: Neural networks can approximate solutions to partial differential equations,
but they often break the very laws they are meant to model-creating mass from
nowhere, drifting shocks, or violating conservation and entropy. We address
this by training within the laws of physics rather than beside them. Our
framework, called Constraint-Projected Learning (CPL), keeps every update
physically admissible by projecting network outputs onto the intersection of
constraint sets defined by conservation, Rankine-Hugoniot balance, entropy, and
positivity. The projection is differentiable and adds only about 10%
computational overhead, making it fully compatible with back-propagation. We
further stabilize training with total-variation damping (TVD) to suppress small
oscillations and a rollout curriculum that enforces consistency over long
prediction horizons. Together, these mechanisms eliminate both hard and soft
violations: conservation holds at machine precision, total-variation growth
vanishes, and entropy and error remain bounded. On Burgers and Euler systems,
CPL produces stable, physically lawful solutions without loss of accuracy.
Instead of hoping neural solvers will respect physics, CPL makes that behavior
an intrinsic property of the learning process.

### [133] [TripleWin: Fixed-Point Equilibrium Pricing for Data-Model Coupled Markets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03368)
*Hongrun Ren,Yun Xiong,Lei You,Yingying Wang,Haixu Xiong,Yangyong Zhu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A unified data-model pricing mechanism for ML markets using a closed-loop, symmetric mechanism with supply/demand mappings; proves standard interference function ensures existence, uniqueness, and convergence of equilibrium; experiments show fairness improvements; code provided.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current ML data/model markets either price data and models separately or rely on broker-centric pipelines, which creates asymmetries and externalities between buyers, sellers, and model producers. A unified, symmetric mechanism is needed to jointly price datasets and models and to account for interactions among multiple buyers and sellers.

Method: Introduce a supply-side mapping that converts dataset payments into buyer-visible model quotations and a demand-side mapping that propagates buyer prices back to datasets via Shapley-based allocation, forming a closed loop that couples buyers, sellers, and their interactions. Model the joint operator as a Standard Interference Function (SIF) to guarantee existence, uniqueness, and global convergence of equilibrium prices. Empirically evaluate convergence speed and fairness against broker-centric and one-sided baselines; provide code.

Result: The joint operator is shown to be a Standard Interference Function (SIF), guaranteeing existence, uniqueness, and global convergence of equilibrium prices. Experiments demonstrate efficient convergence and improved fairness compared with broker-centric and one-sided baselines.

Conclusion: A unified data-model market is proposed that treats dataset and model trading as a single system, enabling symmetric, simultaneous pricing across all participants. The approach provides theoretical guarantees (SIF), practical convergence, and fairness improvements, with open-source code available for replication.

Abstract: The rise of the machine learning (ML) model economy has intertwined markets
for training datasets and pre-trained models. However, most pricing approaches
still separate data and model transactions or rely on broker-centric pipelines
that favor one side. Recent studies of data markets with externalities capture
buyer interactions but do not yield a simultaneous and symmetric mechanism
across data sellers, model producers, and model buyers. We propose a unified
data-model coupled market that treats dataset and model trading as a single
system. A supply-side mapping transforms dataset payments into buyer-visible
model quotations, while a demand-side mapping propagates buyer prices back to
datasets through Shapley-based allocation. Together, they form a closed loop
that links four interactions: supply-demand propagation in both directions and
mutual coupling among buyers and among sellers. We prove that the joint
operator is a standard interference function (SIF), guaranteeing existence,
uniqueness, and global convergence of equilibrium prices. Experiments
demonstrate efficient convergence and improved fairness compared with
broker-centric and one-sided baselines. The code is available on
https://github.com/HongrunRen1109/Triple-Win-Pricing.

*Daniel Perkins,Oscar J. Escobar,Luke Green*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper examines how epsilon-greedy exploration schedules and prioritized experience replay influence DQN learning in finite environments, finding trade-offs between exploration decay, memory prioritization, convergence speed, and achieved rewards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the practical impact of exploration strategies and prioritized memory on DQN performance under resource constraints.

Method: Systematic experiments on finite environments, varying epsilon decay schedules (e.g., linear, exponential, constant) and comparing replay strategies (uniform, no replay, prioritized); multiple simulations to assess robustness.

Result: Epsilon decay shapes learning efficiency and convergence; prioritized experience replay speeds up learning and yields higher returns than uniform or no replay; observing interactions between exploration schedules and memory prioritization; practical guidance for robust DQN training in constrained settings.

Conclusion: Recommend combining well-chosen epsilon schedules with prioritized experience replay, while accounting for computational and memory constraints; suggests further work on biases, hyperparameter dependencies, and broader task regimes.

Abstract: We present a detailed study of Deep Q-Networks in finite environments,
emphasizing the impact of epsilon-greedy exploration schedules and prioritized
experience replay. Through systematic experimentation, we evaluate how
variations in epsilon decay schedules affect learning efficiency, convergence
behavior, and reward optimization. We investigate how prioritized experience
replay leads to faster convergence and higher returns and show empirical
results comparing uniform, no replay, and prioritized strategies across
multiple simulations. Our findings illuminate the trade-offs and interactions
between exploration strategies and memory management in DQN training, offering
practical recommendations for robust reinforcement learning in
resource-constrained settings.

### [135] [Structured Matrix Scaling for Multi-Class Calibration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03685)
*Eugène Berta,David Holzmüller,Michael I. Jordan,Francis Bach*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Post-hoc, logistic-regression-based calibration for binary and multiclass classifiers, backed by structured regularization and preprocessing to control bias-variance; outperforms standard calibration methods and offers open-source implementations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classifier probability estimates are often miscalibrated; temperature scaling is limited in expressiveness. A theoretically grounded, logistic-based calibration for binary and multiclass can provide more accurate probability estimates while remaining tractable for multiclass settings.

Method: Develop parametric recalibration functions using logistic regression, extend to multiclass calibration, and address overfitting via structured regularization, robust preprocessing, and efficient optimization. Compare against standard calibration baselines (temperature, vector, matrix scaling) and provide open-source implementations.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate that managing the bias-variance tradeoff through the proposed regularization and preprocessing yields substantial gains over existing logistic-based calibration techniques and improvements over baselines.

Conclusion: Logistic-based post-hoc calibration, when augmented with structured regularization and thoughtful preprocessing, is an effective and practical alternative to common calibration methods, with accessible open-source implementations.

Abstract: Post-hoc recalibration methods are widely used to ensure that classifiers
provide faithful probability estimates. We argue that parametric recalibration
functions based on logistic regression can be motivated from a simple
theoretical setting for both binary and multiclass classification. This insight
motivates the use of more expressive calibration methods beyond standard
temperature scaling. For multi-class calibration however, a key challenge lies
in the increasing number of parameters introduced by more complex models, often
coupled with limited calibration data, which can lead to overfitting. Through
extensive experiments, we demonstrate that the resulting bias-variance tradeoff
can be effectively managed by structured regularization, robust preprocessing
and efficient optimization. The resulting methods lead to substantial gains
over existing logistic-based calibration techniques. We provide efficient and
easy-to-use open-source implementations of our methods, making them an
attractive alternative to common temperature, vector, and matrix scaling
implementations.

*Mihriban Kocak Balik,Pekka Marttinen,Negar Safinianaini*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: POEMS introduces a probabilistic, unsupervised framework for multiomics integration that preserves non-linear expressiveness while enabling interpretable biomarker discovery through sparse decoding and gating, demonstrated with competitive cancer subtyping.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Integrating multiomics data is essential for understanding diseases, but existing deep models often trade off interpretability for predictive performance (e.g., by linearizing decoders). There's a need for methods that retain nonlinearity while yielding interpretable, biomarker-relevant insights.

Method: POEMS (Product Of Experts for Interpretable Multiomics) is an unsupervised probabilistic model. It maps features to latent factors via sparse connections for interpretability, uses a shared latent space to capture cross-omic associations via a product-of-experts (PoE) framework, and employs a gating network to adaptively report each omic’s influence on representation learning. An efficient sparse decoder reconstructs data with preserved nonlinearity.

Result: In a cancer subtyping case study, POEMS achieves competitive clustering and classification performance while providing a novel set of interpretations, demonstrating that biomarker-based insight and predictive accuracy can coexist in multiomics representation learning.

Conclusion: POEMS offers interpretable, non-linear multiomics integration through sparse decoding and gating, leveraging a PoE-based shared latent space to reveal cross-omic associations and identify biomarkers without sacrificing predictive performance.

Abstract: Integrating different molecular layers, i.e., multiomics data, is crucial for
unraveling the complexity of diseases; yet, most deep generative models either
prioritize predictive performance at the expense of interpretability or enforce
interpretability by linearizing the decoder, thereby weakening the network's
nonlinear expressiveness. To overcome this tradeoff, we introduce POEMS:
Product Of Experts for Interpretable Multiomics Integration using Sparse
Decoding, an unsupervised probabilistic framework that preserves predictive
performance while providing interpretability. POEMS provides interpretability
without linearizing any part of the network by 1) mapping features to latent
factors using sparse connections, which directly translates to biomarker
discovery, 2) allowing for cross-omic associations through a shared latent
space using product of experts model, and 3) reporting contributions of each
omic by a gating network that adaptively computes their influence in the
representation learning. Additionally, we present an efficient sparse decoder.
In a cancer subtyping case study, POEMS achieves competitive clustering and
classification performance while offering our novel set of interpretations,
demonstrating that biomarker based insight and predictive accuracy can coexist
in multiomics representation learning.

*Mohsen Ahmadzadeh,Kaichang Chen,Georges Gielen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Agentic AI framework (AnaFlow) uses multi-agent LLM collaboration for sample-efficient, explainable analog circuit sizing, automating design on two circuits and offering transparent justification beyond traditional BO/RL methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Analog/mixed-signal circuit design is largely handcrafted, requires many simulations and lacks explainability, hindering automation and adoption. A transparent, sample-efficient tool is needed.

Method: A multi-agent workflow with specialized LLM-based agents interprets circuit topology and design goals, iteratively refines sizing parameters, and uses adaptive simulation to control sample usage. The system learns from optimization history to avoid past mistakes, yielding higher efficiency than pure Bayesian optimization or reinforcement learning.

Result: The framework completes the sizing task fully automatically on two circuits of varying complexity, achieving high sample efficiency and providing human-interpretable explanations of design decisions, unlike black-box baselines.

Conclusion: AnaFlow introduces a new paradigm in analog EDA where AI agents act as transparent design assistants, enabling explainable and efficient analog circuit exploration and optimization.

Abstract: Analog/mixed-signal circuits are key for interfacing electronics with the
physical world. Their design, however, remains a largely handcrafted process,
resulting in long and error-prone design cycles. While the recent rise of
AI-based reinforcement learning and generative AI has created new techniques to
automate this task, the need for many time-consuming simulations is a critical
bottleneck hindering the overall efficiency. Furthermore, the lack of
explainability of the resulting design solutions hampers widespread adoption of
the tools. To address these issues, a novel agentic AI framework for
sample-efficient and explainable analog circuit sizing is presented. It employs
a multi-agent workflow where specialized Large Language Model (LLM)-based
agents collaborate to interpret the circuit topology, to understand the design
goals, and to iteratively refine the circuit's design parameters towards the
target goals with human-interpretable reasoning. The adaptive simulation
strategy creates an intelligent control that yields a high sample efficiency.
The AnaFlow framework is demonstrated for two circuits of varying complexity
and is able to complete the sizing task fully automatically, differently from
pure Bayesian optimization and reinforcement learning approaches. The system
learns from its optimization history to avoid past mistakes and to accelerate
convergence. The inherent explainability makes this a powerful tool for analog
design space exploration and a new paradigm in analog EDA, where AI agents
serve as transparent design assistants.

*Alexandru Cioba,Aya Kayal,Laura Toni,Sattar Vakili,Alberto Bernacchia*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Exploiting known symmetries via invariant kernels in kernel-based RL yields improved sample efficiency, with theoretical bounds and empirical gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In many RL problems, environments have inherent group symmetries. Capturing these symmetries as priors should reduce sample complexity and improve learning efficiency.

Method: Introduce a symmetry-aware variant of optimistic least-squares value iteration (LSVI) that uses invariant kernels to encode invariance in rewards and transition dynamics. Derive bounds on information gain and covering numbers for invariant RKHSs, showing how symmetry improves sample efficiency. Validate through experiments on a customized Frozen Lake and a 2D placement design problem.

Result: Theoretical contributions include new bounds on the maximum information gain and covering numbers for invariant RKHSs, quantifying sample efficiency gains from symmetry. Empirical results show that symmetry-aware RL outperforms standard kernel methods on the tested tasks.

Conclusion: Incorporating structural priors like symmetry into RL algorithms can significantly improve sample efficiency, highlighting the value of leveraging known invariances in learning algorithms.

Abstract: In many real-world reinforcement learning (RL) problems, the environment
exhibits inherent symmetries that can be exploited to improve learning
efficiency. This paper develops a theoretical and algorithmic framework for
incorporating known group symmetries into kernel-based RL. We propose a
symmetry-aware variant of optimistic least-squares value iteration (LSVI),
which leverages invariant kernels to encode invariance in both rewards and
transition dynamics. Our analysis establishes new bounds on the maximum
information gain and covering numbers for invariant RKHSs, explicitly
quantifying the sample efficiency gains from symmetry. Empirical results on a
customized Frozen Lake environment and a 2D placement design problem confirm
the theoretical improvements, demonstrating that symmetry-aware RL achieves
significantly better performance than their standard kernel counterparts. These
findings highlight the value of structural priors in designing more
sample-efficient reinforcement learning algorithms.

*Yinsicheng Jiang,Yeqi Huang,Liang Cheng,Cheng Deng,Xuan Sun,Luo Mai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RAGBoost introduces an accuracy-preserving, high cache-reuse retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system. It detects overlapping retrieved items across concurrent sessions and uses efficient indexing, ordering, and de-duplication with lightweight contextual hints to maximize reuse, boosting prefill performance by 1.5–3× while preserving or improving reasoning across RAG workloads.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the trade-off between cache reuse and reasoning accuracy in existing RAG caching techniques, especially for long, complex inputs and multi-turn conversations.

Method: Identify overlapping retrieved items across sessions; build/maintain an efficient context index; perform deduplication and ordering to maximize reuse; insert lightweight contextual hints to preserve reasoning fidelity; integrate with existing LLM inference engines.

Result: Achieves 1.5–3× faster prefill than state-of-the-art methods; maintains or enhances reasoning accuracy across diverse RAG and agentic AI workloads; code released at GitHub.

Conclusion: RAGBoost provides practical, accuracy-preserving cache reuse for RAG, enabling faster, scalable deployments without sacrificing reasoning quality.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enhances large language models (LLMs)
with retrieved context but often suffers from downgraded prefill performance as
modern applications demand longer and more complex inputs. Existing caching
techniques either preserve accuracy with low cache reuse or improve reuse at
the cost of degraded reasoning quality. We present RAGBoost, an efficient RAG
system that achieves high cache reuse without sacrificing accuracy through
accuracy-preserving context reuse. RAGBoost detects overlapping retrieved items
across concurrent sessions and multi-turn interactions, using efficient context
indexing, ordering, and de-duplication to maximize reuse, while lightweight
contextual hints maintain reasoning fidelity. It integrates seamlessly with
existing LLM inference engines and improves their prefill performance by 1.5-3X
over state-of-the-art methods, while preserving or even enhancing reasoning
accuracy across diverse RAG and agentic AI workloads. Our code is released at:

*Alvise Dei Rossi,Julia van der Meer,Markus H. Schmidt,Claudio L. A. Bassetti,Luigi Fiorillo,Francesca Faraci*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: NAP is an attention-based neural aggregator that fuses predictions from frozen single-channel sleep models to handle heterogeneous polysomnography data, using a tri-axial attention over time, space, and predictors, achieving strong zero-shot generalization across datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Polysomnography data vary in modalities, channels, and acquisition protocols; fixed modality models waste multimodal information and generalization is limited.

Method: Introduce NAP (Neural Aggregator of Predictions), which aggregates outputs from frozen pretrained single-channel models using a tri-axial attention mechanism capturing temporal, spatial, and predictor-level dependencies; trains to adapt to varying input dimensions and modalities.

Result: Outperforms individual predictors and simple ensembles, achieving state-of-the-art zero-shot generalization across multiple datasets.

Conclusion: Although demonstrated for automated sleep staging from polysomnography, NAP is applicable to other multimodal physiological tasks and can facilitate robust cross-dataset generalization.

Abstract: Polysomnography signals are highly heterogeneous, varying in modality
composition (e.g., EEG, EOG, ECG), channel availability (e.g., frontal,
occipital EEG), and acquisition protocols across datasets and clinical sites.
Most existing models that process polysomnography data rely on a fixed subset
of modalities or channels and therefore neglect to fully exploit its inherently
multimodal nature. We address this limitation by introducing NAP (Neural
Aggregator of Predictions), an attention-based model which learns to combine
multiple prediction streams using a tri-axial attention mechanism that captures
temporal, spatial, and predictor-level dependencies. NAP is trained to adapt to
different input dimensions. By aggregating outputs from frozen, pretrained
single-channel models, NAP consistently outperforms individual predictors and
simple ensembles, achieving state-of-the-art zero-shot generalization across
multiple datasets. While demonstrated in the context of automated sleep staging
from polysomnography, the proposed approach could be extended to other
multimodal physiological applications.

*Elvis Dohmatob,Mohammad Pezeshki,Reyhane Askari-Hemmat*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A theory of data curation showing when less data beats full data, via exact scaling laws and phase transitions, with ImageNet validation and implications for LLM reasoning strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To resolve the paradox of 'more is better' in ML by analyzing curated, imperfect data selections and their impact on generalization, motivated by emerging evidence that small, carefully chosen datasets can outperform larger ones.

Method: Develop a theoretical framework deriving exact scaling-law curves for test error under label-agnostic and label-aware curation, identify phase-transition curves tied to data size and quality, and validate predictions with experiments on ImageNet; interpret results for LLM reasoning strategies.

Result: Exact scaling-law curves are obtained; conditions are derived under which small curated datasets outperform full datasets; phase-transition boundaries mapped; empirical ImageNet results confirm the theory; curation can mitigate model collapse and explain inconsistent LLM reasoning strategies.

Conclusion: The work provides a principled explanation for when data curation helps, clarifies contradictory strategies in practice, and offers analytical tools to guide data selection in modern ML.

Abstract: This paper introduces a theoretical framework to resolve a central paradox in
modern machine learning: When is it better to use less data? This question has
become critical as classical scaling laws suggesting ``more is more'' (Sun et
al., 2025) are challenged by methods like LIMO (``less is more'') and s1 (Ye et
al., 2025; Muenighoff et al., 2025), which achieve superior performance with
small, aggressively curated datasets. Here, we study data curation strategies
where an imperfect oracle selects the training examples according to their
difficulty and correctness. Our results provide exact scaling law curves for
test error under both label-agnostic and label-aware curation rules, revealing
when and why keeping only a subset of data can improve generalization. In
contrast to classical scaling laws, we show that under certain conditions,
small curated datasets can outperform full datasets, and we provide analytical
conditions for this by deriving precise phase transition curves tied to data
size and quality. We validate these theoretical claims with empirical results
on ImageNet, confirming our predictions about when curation improves accuracy
and can even mitigate model collapse. Furthermore, our framework provides a
principled explanation for the contradictory curation strategies recently
observed in LLM mathematical reasoning.

*Bryan L. M. de Oliveira,Felipe V. Frujeri,Marcos P. C. M. Queiroz,Luana G. B. Martins,Telma W. de L. Soares,Luckeciano C. Melo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GRPO, a critic-free variant of PPO using group-relative trajectory comparisons, is systematically evaluated; critic-free baselines generally fail on long-horizon tasks; high discount helps except in HalfCheetah; smaller group sizes beat larger ones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand whether learned baselines are necessary in policy-gradient methods and when critic-free GRPO can be viable.

Method: Systematic study across classical single-task RL environments (discrete and continuous), with controlled ablations isolating baselines, discounting, and group sampling.

Result: Three findings: (1) critics are essential for long-horizon tasks; all critic-free baselines underperform PPO except in short-horizon CartPole; (2) GRPO benefits from high discount (gamma=0.99) except in HalfCheetah, where lack of early termination favors gamma=0.9; (3) smaller group sizes outperform larger ones, indicating batching/grouping limitations.

Conclusion: Learned critics remain important for classical control; critic-free GRPO is viable only under specific short-horizon or discounting/batching conditions.

Abstract: Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) has emerged as a scalable
alternative to Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) by eliminating the learned
critic and instead estimating advantages through group-relative comparisons of
trajectories. This simplification raises fundamental questions about the
necessity of learned baselines in policy-gradient methods. We present the first
systematic study of GRPO in classical single-task reinforcement learning
environments, spanning discrete and continuous control tasks. Through
controlled ablations isolating baselines, discounting, and group sampling, we
reveal three key findings: (1) learned critics remain essential for
long-horizon tasks: all critic-free baselines underperform PPO except in
short-horizon environments like CartPole where episodic returns can be
effective; (2) GRPO benefits from high discount factors (gamma = 0.99) except
in HalfCheetah, where lack of early termination favors moderate discounting
(gamma = 0.9); (3) smaller group sizes outperform larger ones, suggesting
limitations in batch-based grouping strategies that mix unrelated episodes.
These results reveal both the limitations of critic-free methods in classical
control and the specific conditions where they remain viable alternatives to
learned value functions.

*Javad Parsa,Amir Hossein Daghestani,André M. H. Teixeira,Mikael Johansson*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A Byzantine-robust FL method with learnable aggregation weights optimized jointly with the global model via alternating minimization, offering convergence guarantees and improved resilience under data heterogeneity and attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Byzantine clients and non-IID data in FL threaten robustness; fixed-weight aggregations may fail under adversarial or heterogeneous settings, necessitating adaptive design.

Method: Formulates FL with weights as learnable parameters; alternates between updating the global model and the aggregation weights; proves convergence guarantees; analyzes Byzantine resilience.

Result: Empirical evaluations against state-of-the-art Byzantine-robust FL methods across datasets and attack scenarios; the proposed method consistently outperforms baselines, especially with high data heterogeneity and many malicious clients.

Conclusion: Adaptive weighting in FL can significantly enhance robustness against Byzantine attacks and heterogeneity, with strong theoretical and empirical support.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables clients to collaboratively train a global
model without sharing their private data. However, the presence of malicious
(Byzantine) clients poses significant challenges to the robustness of FL,
particularly when data distributions across clients are heterogeneous. In this
paper, we propose a novel Byzantine-robust FL optimization problem that
incorporates adaptive weighting into the aggregation process. Unlike
conventional approaches, our formulation treats aggregation weights as
learnable parameters, jointly optimizing them alongside the global model
parameters. To solve this optimization problem, we develop an alternating
minimization algorithm with strong convergence guarantees under adversarial
attack. We analyze the Byzantine resilience of the proposed objective. We
evaluate the performance of our algorithm against state-of-the-art
Byzantine-robust FL approaches across various datasets and attack scenarios.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms
existing approaches, particularly in settings with highly heterogeneous data
and a large proportion of malicious clients.

### [144] [Flat Minima and Generalization: Insights from Stochastic Convex Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03548)
*Matan Schliserman,Shira Vansover-Hager,Tomer Koren*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Flat minima do not guarantee good generalization in stochastic convex optimization with a non-negative, β-smooth objective; even sharpness-aware methods SA-GD and SAM can yield Ω(1) population risk, though stability-based bounds exist.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To test the flat-minima generalization hypothesis in a canonical stochastic convex setting and evaluate sharpness-aware optimization methods (SA-GD and SAM) for their ability to improve generalization.

Method: Theoretical analysis of a non-negative, β-smooth objective in stochastic convex optimization; analysis of empirical vs population risk; examination of SA-GD (maximal loss in a neighborhood) and SAM (normalized ascent steps); derivation of results and stability-based population risk bounds.

Result: There exist flat empirical minima with Ω(1) population risk; SA-GD converges to flat minima quickly but can still have Ω(1) population risk; SAM minimizes empirical loss yet can converge to sharp minima with Ω(1) population risk; additional upper bounds on population risk derived via algorithmic stability.

Conclusion: The flat-minima explanation is insufficient for generalization in this setting; sharpness-aware methods do not guarantee improved generalization; stability-based bounds provide some guarantees, but Ω(1) risk can persist.

Abstract: Understanding the generalization behavior of learning algorithms is a central
goal of learning theory. A recently emerging explanation is that learning
algorithms are successful in practice because they converge to flat minima,
which have been consistently associated with improved generalization
performance. In this work, we study the link between flat minima and
generalization in the canonical setting of stochastic convex optimization with
a non-negative, $\beta$-smooth objective. Our first finding is that, even in
this fundamental and well-studied setting, flat empirical minima may incur
trivial $\Omega(1)$ population risk while sharp minima generalizes optimally.
Then, we show that this poor generalization behavior extends to two natural
''sharpness-aware'' algorithms originally proposed by Foret et al. (2021),
designed to bias optimization toward flat solutions: Sharpness-Aware Gradient
Descent (SA-GD) and Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM). For SA-GD, which
performs gradient steps on the maximal loss in a predefined neighborhood, we
prove that while it successfully converges to a flat minimum at a fast rate,
the population risk of the solution can still be as large as $\Omega(1)$,
indicating that even flat minima found algorithmically using a sharpness-aware
gradient method might generalize poorly. For SAM, a computationally efficient
approximation of SA-GD based on normalized ascent steps, we show that although
it minimizes the empirical loss, it may converge to a sharp minimum and also
incur population risk $\Omega(1)$. Finally, we establish population risk upper
bounds for both SA-GD and SAM using algorithmic stability techniques.

*Günther Schindler,Maximilian Schambach,Michael Medek,Sam Thelin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TabGemma: a schema-agnostic in-context learner for tabular data using LLMs; handles numeric tokenization issues, long context via 128k tokens, and shows strong classification performance; regression less favorable with more data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the gap of applying LLMs to tabular prediction with mixed text/numeric/categorical fields, focusing on numeric stability and context efficiency.

Method: Treat rows as sequences; canonicalize numbers with signed scientific notation; continue pretraining a 12B Gemma 3 model with a target imputation objective on large real-world data; use a compact n-gram-based retrieval to select informative exemplars fitting a 128k-token window.

Result: New state-of-the-art for tabular classification across data regimes; monotonic gains with more context rows; competitive for regression at small samples but less so as data grows.

Conclusion: LLMs can be effective tabular in-context learners when paired with numeric handling and context retrieval; highlights need for improved numeric modeling and long-context scaling.

Abstract: We study LLMs for tabular prediction with mixed text, numeric, and
categorical fields. We introduce TabGemma, a schema-agnostic in-context learner
that treats rows as sequences and tackles two practical hurdles when adapting
pretrained LLMs for tabular predictions: unstable numeric tokenization and
limited context size. We propose to canonicalize numbers via signed scientific
notation and continue pretraining of a 12B Gemma 3 model with a target
imputation objective using a large-scale real world dataset. For inference, we
use a compact n-gram-based retrieval to select informative exemplars that fit
within a 128k-token window.
  On semantically rich benchmarks, TabGemma establishes a new state of the art
on classification across low- and high-data regimes and improves monotonically
with more context rows. For regression, it is competitive at small sample sizes
but trails conventional approaches as data grows. Our results show that LLMs
can be effective tabular in-context learners on highly semantic tasks when
paired with dedicated numeric handling and context retrieval, while motivating
further advances in numeric modeling and long-context scaling.

### [146] [Tensor-Efficient High-Dimensional Q-learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03595)
*Junyi Wu,Dan Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TEQL uses low-rank tensor decomposition with improved block coordinate descent for Q-learning on discretized state-action spaces, augmented by a novel exploration strategy (approximation error + visit-count UCB) and a frequency-based penalty to encourage exploration of less-visited regions. It achieves better sample efficiency and total rewards than matrix-based and many deep RL methods on classic control tasks, suitable for resource-constrained domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-dimensional RL suffers from the curse of dimensionality and poor sample efficiency. Tensor-based, parameter-efficient approaches aim to mitigate this, but require better exploration and regularization to perform well in large state-action spaces.

Method: TEQL builds on low-rank tensor decomposition for Q-learning with discretized state-action spaces. It employs an enhanced block coordinate descent optimization, an exploration strategy that combines approximation error with a visit-count-based upper confidence bound, and a frequency-based penalty term in the objective to encourage exploration of less-visited state-action pairs and reduce overfitting to frequently visited regions.

Result: Empirical evaluation on classic control tasks shows TEQL outperforms conventional matrix-based methods and many deep RL approaches in both sample efficiency and total rewards.

Conclusion: TEQL provides a more parameter-efficient alternative with improved exploration and regularization, making it suitable for resource-constrained applications (e.g., space and healthcare) where sampling costs are high.

Abstract: High-dimensional reinforcement learning faces challenges with complex
calculations and low sample efficiency in large state-action spaces. Q-learning
algorithms struggle particularly with the curse of dimensionality, where the
number of state-action pairs grows exponentially with problem size. While
neural network-based approaches like Deep Q-Networks have shown success, recent
tensor-based methods using low-rank decomposition offer more
parameter-efficient alternatives. Building upon existing tensor-based methods,
we propose Tensor-Efficient Q-Learning (TEQL), which enhances low-rank tensor
decomposition via improved block coordinate descent on discretized state-action
spaces, incorporating novel exploration and regularization mechanisms. The key
innovation is an exploration strategy that combines approximation error with
visit count-based upper confidence bound to prioritize actions with high
uncertainty, avoiding wasteful random exploration. Additionally, we incorporate
a frequency-based penalty term in the objective function to encourage
exploration of less-visited state-action pairs and reduce overfitting to
frequently visited regions. Empirical results on classic control tasks
demonstrate that TEQL outperforms conventional matrix-based methods and deep RL
approaches in both sample efficiency and total rewards, making it suitable for
resource-constrained applications, such as space and healthcare where sampling
costs are high.

### [147] [Going Beyond Expert Performance via Deep Implicit Imitation Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03616)
*Iason Chrysomallis,Georgios Chalkiadakis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces DIIQN to learn from observation-only demonstrations by inferring expert actions and balancing expert guidance with self-learning; extends to HA-DIIQN for heterogeneous action sets, achieving strong performance and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Imitation learning requires complete state-action demonstrations and optimal experts; many real-world settings only provide state observations or suboptimal experts. The paper aims to learn from observations and handle action-set mismatches while still leveraging expert data.

Method: Proposes Deep Implicit Imitation Q-Network (DIIQN) with action inference to reconstruct expert actions via online exploration and a dynamic confidence mechanism to blend expert-guided and self-directed learning. Extends to HA-DIIQN with infeasibility detection and bridging to connect agent actions to expert guidance when direct replication is impossible.

Result: DIIQN yields up to 130% higher episodic returns than standard DQN and outperforms existing implicit imitation methods; HA-DIIQN accelerates learning by up to 64% in heterogeneous-action settings; robust across dataset sizes and hyperparameters.

Conclusion: The framework enables effective imitation from observation-only data and can surpass suboptimal experts; the heterogeneous-action extension broadens applicability by bridging action-set gaps, with demonstrated robustness and strong empirical gains.

Abstract: Imitation learning traditionally requires complete state-action
demonstrations from optimal or near-optimal experts. These requirements
severely limit practical applicability, as many real-world scenarios provide
only state observations without corresponding actions and expert performance is
often suboptimal. In this paper we introduce a deep implicit imitation
reinforcement learning framework that addresses both limitations by combining
deep reinforcement learning with implicit imitation learning from
observation-only datasets. Our main algorithm, Deep Implicit Imitation
Q-Network (DIIQN), employs an action inference mechanism that reconstructs
expert actions through online exploration and integrates a dynamic confidence
mechanism that adaptively balances expert-guided and self-directed learning.
This enables the agent to leverage expert guidance for accelerated training
while maintaining capacity to surpass suboptimal expert performance. We further
extend our framework with a Heterogeneous Actions DIIQN (HA-DIIQN) algorithm to
tackle scenarios where expert and agent possess different action sets, a
challenge previously unaddressed in the implicit imitation learning literature.
HA-DIIQN introduces an infeasibility detection mechanism and a bridging
procedure identifying alternative pathways connecting agent capabilities to
expert guidance when direct action replication is impossible. Our experimental
results demonstrate that DIIQN achieves up to 130% higher episodic returns
compared to standard DQN, while consistently outperforming existing implicit
imitation methods that cannot exceed expert performance. In heterogeneous
action settings, HA-DIIQN learns up to 64% faster than baselines, leveraging
expert datasets unusable by conventional approaches. Extensive parameter
sensitivity analysis reveals the framework's robustness across varying dataset
sizes and hyperparameter configurations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the need for rigorous validation of RL convergence proofs and reduces human error by formal verification; aims to unify Q-learning and TD convergence results and enable extensions to rates and other modes of convergence.

Method: Lean 4 / Mathlib formalization leveraging Robbins-Siegmund theorem to establish almost-sure convergence for stochastic approximation algorithms under Markovian sampling; develops a unified framework that can be extended to convergence rates and other modes; includes practical code implementation.

Result: Obtains a formal proof of almost-sure convergence for both Q-learning and linear TD within a single framework in Lean 4; demonstrates the extensibility of the framework to other convergence notions; provides a link to the code repository for reproducibility.

Conclusion: Marks a significant step toward fully formalizing convergent RL results; the unified framework enables future work on rates and broader convergence concepts; facilitates reliable verification through theorem proving.

Abstract: In this paper, we formalize the almost sure convergence of $Q$-learning and
linear temporal difference (TD) learning with Markovian samples using the Lean
4 theorem prover based on the Mathlib library. $Q$-learning and linear TD are
among the earliest and most influential reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms.
The investigation of their convergence properties is not only a major research
topic during the early development of the RL field but also receives increasing
attention nowadays. This paper formally verifies their almost sure convergence
in a unified framework based on the Robbins-Siegmund theorem. The framework
developed in this work can be easily extended to convergence rates and other
modes of convergence. This work thus makes an important step towards fully
formalizing convergent RL results. The code is available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: NanoTabPFN is a simplified, lightweight implementation of TabPFN v2 for tabular foundation models, designed to be accessible and educational. It achieves comparable performance to traditional ML baselines in small-data settings with very rapid pretraining on a single GPU (≈1 minute), vastly faster than TabPFN v2, lowering resource barriers; code is available.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing open-source tabular foundation models are large, complex (thousands of lines of code), poorly documented, and require substantial computational resources. This hinders accessibility, reproducibility, and experimentation, especially for students and researchers.

Method: Introduce nanoTabPFN, a simplified architecture that mirrors TabPFN v2 and a training loop that uses pre-generated training data; focuses on small-data regimes and educational use; emphasizes code simplicity and portability.

Result: In small-data settings, nanoTabPFN achieves performance comparable to traditional ML baselines and can pretrain in about one minute on a single GPU, which is ~160,000x faster than TabPFN v2 pretraining.

Conclusion: NanoTabPFN lowers the barrier to entry for tabular foundation models, making pretraining feasible with limited resources and enabling educational and experimental work; code is publicly available at the linked repo.

Abstract: Tabular foundation models such as TabPFN have revolutionized predictive
machine learning for tabular data. At the same time, the driving factors of
this revolution are hard to understand. Existing open-source tabular foundation
models are implemented in complicated pipelines boasting over 10,000 lines of
code, lack architecture documentation or code quality. In short, the
implementations are hard to understand, not beginner-friendly, and complicated
to adapt for new experiments. We introduce nanoTabPFN, a simplified and
lightweight implementation of the TabPFN v2 architecture and a corresponding
training loop that uses pre-generated training data. nanoTabPFN makes tabular
foundation models more accessible to students and researchers alike. For
example, restricted to a small data setting it achieves a performance
comparable to traditional machine learning baselines within one minute of
pre-training on a single GPU (160,000x faster than TabPFN v2 pretraining). This
eliminated requirement of large computational resources makes pre-training
tabular foundation models accessible for educational purposes. Our code is

TL;DR: Eight-model ML framework for IoT-healthcare security detects cyberattacks and device anomalies; XGBoost and KNN lead; LSTM Autoencoders lag; GAN costly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance security and reliability of IoT-enabled healthcare by timely detection of cyber threats and device faults, using a large dataset (200k records).

Method: Evaluate eight models across supervised (XGBoost, KNN), semi-supervised (GAN, VAE), unsupervised (One-Class SVM, Isolation Forest, Graph Neural Networks, LSTM Autoencoders); compare across metrics (F1, precision, recall, accuracy, ROC-AUC) and latency.

Result: XGBoost achieved 99% anomaly-detection accuracy with 0.04s; KNN achieved near-perfect metrics for attack detection with 0.05s; VAE ~97% accuracy; Isolation Forest balanced precision/recall; GAN had high cost, low accuracy/ROC-AUC; LSTM Autoencoder underperformed.

Conclusion: The framework enhances IoT healthcare security by enabling early threat and fault detection, reducing breaches and downtime, and supporting safe, trustworthy operation of medical devices.

Abstract: The integration of IoT devices in healthcare introduces significant security
and reliability challenges, increasing susceptibility to cyber threats and
operational anomalies. This study proposes a machine learning-driven framework
for (1) detecting malicious cyberattacks and (2) identifying faulty device
anomalies, leveraging a dataset of 200,000 records. Eight machine learning
models are evaluated across three learning approaches: supervised learning
(XGBoost, K-Nearest Neighbors (K- NN)), semi-supervised learning (Generative
Adversarial Networks (GAN), Variational Autoencoders (VAE)), and unsupervised
learning (One-Class Support Vector Machine (SVM), Isolation Forest, Graph
Neural Networks (GNN), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Autoencoders). The
comprehensive evaluation was conducted across multiple metrics like F1-score,
precision, recall, accuracy, ROC-AUC, computational efficiency. XGBoost
achieved 99\% accuracy with minimal computational overhead (0.04s) for anomaly
detection, while Isolation Forest balanced precision and recall effectively.
LSTM Autoencoders underperformed with lower accuracy and higher latency. For
attack detection, KNN achieved near-perfect precision, recall, and F1-score
with the lowest computational cost (0.05s), followed by VAE at 97% accuracy.
GAN showed the highest computational cost with lowest accuracy and ROC-AUC.
These findings enhance IoT-enabled healthcare security through effective
anomaly detection strategies. By improving early detection of cyber threats and
device failures, this framework has the potential to prevent data breaches,
minimize system downtime, and ensure the continuous and safe operation of
medical devices, ultimately safeguarding patient health and trust in IoT-driven
healthcare solutions.

*Lipeng Zu,Hansong Zhou,Xiaonan Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: BAQ introduces Behavior-Adaptive Q-Learning to bridge offline-to-online RL by leveraging an implicit behavior model from offline data. It uses a dual-objective loss to keep the online policy aligned with offline behavior under high uncertainty and gradually relaxes this constraint as online experience grows, stabilizing early updates and speeding adaptation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Offline RL policies often degrade when deployed online due to distributional shift and unreliable value estimates on unseen state-action pairs; there is a need for a reliable, smooth transition from offline training to online adaptation.

Method: BAQ derives an implicit behavioral model from offline data to provide a behavior-consistency signal during online fine-tuning. It optimizes a dual-objective loss: (i) align the online policy with offline behavior when uncertainty is high, and (ii) gradually relax this constraint as more confident online experience accumulates, thereby reducing error propagation from out-of-distribution estimates.

Result: On standard benchmarks, BAQ consistently outperforms prior offline-to-online RL approaches, achieving faster recovery from offline initialization, improved robustness, and higher overall performance during online adaptation.

Conclusion: Implicit behavior adaptation offers a principled, practical solution for reliable real-world policy deployment by enabling a smooth offline-to-online transition and stabilizing early online updates.

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) enables training from fixed data without
online interaction, but policies learned offline often struggle when deployed
in dynamic environments due to distributional shift and unreliable value
estimates on unseen state-action pairs. We introduce Behavior-Adaptive
Q-Learning (BAQ), a framework designed to enable a smooth and reliable
transition from offline to online RL. The key idea is to leverage an implicit
behavioral model derived from offline data to provide a behavior-consistency
signal during online fine-tuning. BAQ incorporates a dual-objective loss that
(i) aligns the online policy toward the offline behavior when uncertainty is
high, and (ii) gradually relaxes this constraint as more confident online
experience is accumulated. This adaptive mechanism reduces error propagation
from out-of-distribution estimates, stabilizes early online updates, and
accelerates adaptation to new scenarios. Across standard benchmarks, BAQ
consistently outperforms prior offline-to-online RL approaches, achieving
faster recovery, improved robustness, and higher overall performance. Our
results demonstrate that implicit behavior adaptation is a principled and
practical solution for reliable real-world policy deployment.

*Guanning Zeng,Zhaoyi Zhou,Daman Arora,Andrea Zanette*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Shrinkage-based baselines for RL reward centering reduce policy-gradient variance and improve training stability in RLVR without extra hyperparameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Policy-gradient training with per-prompt baselines incurs high variance; inspired by Stein's paradox, a shrinkage estimator that blends per-prompt and across-prompt means can improve mean estimation, especially in the low-generation regime.

Method: Develop a shrinkage baseline that combines per-prompt and global means, prove it yields lower-variance policy-gradient estimators, and implement as a drop-in replacement with no extra hyperparameters or computation.

Result: Theoretically guaranteed variance reduction across algorithms; empirically, shrinkage baselines outperform standard empirical-mean baselines, yielding lower gradient variance and more stable training.

Conclusion: Shrinkage-based baselines provide a simple, universal, drop-in improvement for RLVR training with policy-gradients, without added hyperparameters and with broad applicability.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a
powerful paradigm for post-training large reasoning models (LRMs) using
policy-gradient methods such as GRPO. To stabilize training, these methods
typically center trajectory rewards by subtracting the empirical mean for each
prompt. Statistically, this centering acts as a control variate (or baseline),
reducing the variance of the policy-gradient estimator.
  Typically, the mean reward is estimated using per-prompt empirical averages
for each prompt in a batch. Drawing inspiration from Stein's paradox, we
propose using shrinkage estimators that combine per-prompt and across-prompt
means to improve the overall per-prompt mean estimation accuracy --
particularly in the low-generation regime typical of RLVR. Theoretically, we
construct a shrinkage-based baseline that provably yields lower-variance
policy-gradient estimators across algorithms. Our proposed baseline serves as a
drop-in replacement for existing per-prompt mean baselines, requiring no
additional hyper-parameters or computation. Empirically, shrinkage baselines
consistently outperform standard empirical-mean baselines, leading to
lower-variance gradient updates and improved training stability.
