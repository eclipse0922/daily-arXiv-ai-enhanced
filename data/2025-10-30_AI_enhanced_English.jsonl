This allows for relatively simple and efficient generation\nof high-quality images. However, rectified flow still faces several challenges.\n1) The reflow process requires a large number of generative pairs to preserve\nthe target distribution, leading to significant computational costs. 2) Since\nthe model is typically trained using only generated image pairs, its\nperformance heavily depends on the 1-rectified flow model, causing it to become\nbiased towards the generated data.\n  In this work, we experimentally expose the limitations of the original\nrectified flow and propose a novel approach that incorporates real images into\nthe training process. By preserving the ODE paths for real images, our method\neffectively reduces reliance on large amounts of generated data.

However, extending\nthese methods to articulated objects by training native 3D diffusion models\nposes significant challenges. In this work, we present FreeArt3D, a\ntraining-free framework for articulated 3D object generation. Instead of\ntraining a new model on limited articulated data, FreeArt3D repurposes a\npre-trained static 3D diffusion model (e.g., Trellis) as a powerful shape\nprior. It extends Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) into the 3D-to-4D domain by\ntreating articulation as an additional generative dimension. Given a few images\ncaptured in different articulation states, FreeArt3D jointly optimizes the\nobject's geometry, texture, and articulation parameters without requiring\ntask-specific training or access to large-scale articulated datasets. Our\nmethod generates high-fidelity geometry and textures, accurately predicts\nunderlying kinematic structures, and generalizes well across diverse object\ncategories. Despite following a per-instance optimization paradigm, FreeArt3D\ncompletes in minutes and significantly outperforms prior state-of-the-art\napproaches in both quality and versatility.", "AI": {"tldr": "Training-free articulated 3D object generation by repurposing a static 3D diffusion model as a shape prior, extending SDS to 3D-to-4D with articulation as an extra generative dimension, enabling per-instance optimization in minutes.", "motivation": "Articulated 3D objects are central to robotics, AR/VR, and animation but are hard to model.
