Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A model-agnostic framework using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) with random contrastive sampling to improve Radiography Report Generation (RRG) without extra data or reward models, yielding up to 5% gains across three SOTA models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RRG is critical for reducing radiologists' workload but current methods fall short of real-world clinical deployment. Progress in general Visual Language Models via alignment inspires adapting such strategies to RRG. There is a need for data-efficient, model-agnostic improvements.

Method: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) with random contrastive sampling to generate training pairs; avoids reward models and human feedback; applies to any RRG model; constructs pairs by contrasting random samples; training objective aligns outputs with preferences; requires no extra data.

Result: Random DPO improves clinical performance metrics by up to 5% when added to three state-of-the-art RRG models; no additional training data required.

Conclusion: Random DPO is a simple, model-agnostic, data-efficient approach that can boost RRG performance and move closer to real-world clinical deployment; supports broader adoption and potential for further improvements with more data or tasks.

Abstract: Radiography Report Generation (RRG) has gained significant attention in
medical image analysis as a promising tool for alleviating the growing workload
of radiologists. However, despite numerous advancements, existing methods have
yet to achieve the quality required for deployment in real-world clinical
settings. Meanwhile, large Visual Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated
remarkable progress in the general domain by adopting training strategies
originally designed for Large Language Models (LLMs), such as alignment
techniques. In this paper, we introduce a model-agnostic framework to enhance
RRG accuracy using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Our approach leverages
random contrastive sampling to construct training pairs, eliminating the need
for reward models or human preference annotations. Experiments on supplementing
three state-of-the-art models with our Random DPO show that our method improves
clinical performance metrics by up to 5%, without requiring any additional
training data.

*William Saakyan,Matthias Norden,Lola Eversmann,Simon Kirsch,Muyu Lin,Simon Guendelman,Isabel Dziobek,Hanna Drimalla*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Multimodal video-based autism screening using facial expressions, voice, motion, HRV, and gaze; improves gaze descriptors; achieves 74% accuracy on a balanced large dataset; supports scalable screening.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diagnosing Autism Spectrum Condition is resource-intensive; existing computer-aided approaches suffer from weak gaze features and limited generalizability; there is a need for robust, scalable, real-world applicable screening tools.

Method: Conducted a multimodal analysis on 168 ASC and 157 neurotypical participants; introduced novel statistical descriptors for gaze angle variability; performed late fusion across modalities to classify ASC vs non-ASC.

Result: Gaze-based accuracy improved from 64% to 69%; late fusion yields 74% accuracy; dataset is largest and balanced to date; findings align with clinical observations of gaze aversion in ASC.

Conclusion: Supports potential for scalable video-based screening tools for autism assessment; cross-modal integration improves robustness; further work needed for real-world generalization and validation.

Abstract: Due to the complex and resource-intensive nature of diagnosing Autism
Spectrum Condition (ASC), several computer-aided diagnostic support methods
have been proposed to detect autism by analyzing behavioral cues in patient
video data. While these models show promising results on some datasets, they
struggle with poor gaze feature performance and lack of real-world
generalizability. To tackle these challenges, we analyze a standardized video
dataset comprising 168 participants with ASC (46% female) and 157 non-autistic
participants (46% female), making it, to our knowledge, the largest and most
balanced dataset available. We conduct a multimodal analysis of facial
expressions, voice prosody, head motion, heart rate variability (HRV), and gaze
behavior. To address the limitations of prior gaze models, we introduce novel
statistical descriptors that quantify variability in eye gaze angles, improving
gaze-based classification accuracy from 64% to 69% and aligning computational
findings with clinical research on gaze aversion in ASC. Using late fusion, we
achieve a classification accuracy of 74%, demonstrating the effectiveness of
integrating behavioral markers across multiple modalities. Our findings
highlight the potential for scalable, video-based screening tools to support
autism assessment.

### [3] [KV-Efficient VLA: A Method of Speed up Vision Language Model with RNN-Gated Chunked KV Cache](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21354)
*Wanshun Xu,Long Zhuang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: KV-Efficient VLA introduces a memory compression strategy that prunes historical key-value context via a recurrent gating module, achieving up to 1.21x faster inference and 36% KV memory reduction with minimal impact on task performance, while being model-agnostic and training-friendly for real-time VLA systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-Language-Action models face quadratic attention cost and unbounded KV growth during long-horizon inference, which limits real-time deployment; existing scaling-focused methods neglect inference efficiency.

Method: Partition the KV cache into fixed-size chunks; apply a recurrent gating module to summarize and filter history using learned utility scores; preserve recent fine-grained information while aggressively pruning stale memory; maintain causality; integrate with autoregressive and hybrid VLA stacks without changing training or downstream control logic.

Result: The approach yields up to 1.21x inference speedup and 36% KV memory reduction with minimal impact on task success.

Conclusion: KV-Efficient VLA provides a model-agnostic, training-friendly memory compression mechanism enabling scalable, real-time inference in VLA systems without modifying training pipelines.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models promise unified robotic perception and
control, yet their scalability is constrained by the quadratic cost of
attention and the unbounded growth of key-value (KV) memory during long-horizon
inference. While recent methods improve generalization through scaling backbone
architectures, they often neglect the inference inefficiencies critical to
real-time deployment. In this work, we present KV-Efficient VLA, a
model-agnostic memory compression framework that addresses these limitations by
introducing a lightweight, training-friendly mechanism to selectively retain
high-utility context. Our method partitions the KV cache into fixed size chunks
and employs a recurrent gating module to summarize and filter historical
context according to learned utility scores. This design preserves recent
fine-grained detail while aggressively pruning stale, low-relevance memory, all
while maintaining causality. Theoretically, KV-Efficient VLA yields up to 1.21x
inference speedup and 36% KV memory reduction, with minimal impact on task
success. Our method integrates seamlessly into existing autoregressive and
hybrid VLA stacks, enabling scalable inference without modifying training
pipelines or downstream control logic.

### [4] [Phrase-grounded Fact-checking for Automatically Generated Chest X-ray Reports](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21356)
*Razi Mahmood,Diego Machado-Reyes,Joy Wu,Parisa Kaviani,Ken C. L. Wong,Niharika D'Souza,Mannudeep Kalra,Ge Wang,Pingkun Yan,Tanveer Syeda-Mahmood*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a phrase-grounded fact-checking model for chest X-ray reports to detect and localize factual errors in AI-generated reports, trained on synthetic perturbations, achieving near-perfect agreement with ground-truth verification (CCC ≈ 0.997).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hallucinations and factual errors in large vision-language models hinder clinical adoption of AI-generated radiology reports; there is a need for automated verification of reported findings and their locations to support safe inference.

Method: Create a large synthetic dataset by perturbing ground-truth findings and their locations in chest X-ray reports to create real/fake finding-location pairs with images; train a multi-label cross-modal contrastive regression network to predict veracity and localize errors; evaluate on multiple X-ray datasets and with SOTA report generators.

Result: The model shows robustness in finding veracity prediction and localization across datasets; achieves a concordance correlation coefficient of 0.997 with ground-truth verification; effective in detecting errors in SOTA report generators, supporting its utility in clinical workflow.

Conclusion: The proposed FC model provides a reliable tool to detect and localize factual errors in radiology reports, potentially reducing hallucinations in AI-generated reporting and improving safety in clinical inference.

Abstract: With the emergence of large-scale vision language models (VLM), it is now
possible to produce realistic-looking radiology reports for chest X-ray images.
However, their clinical translation has been hampered by the factual errors and
hallucinations in the produced descriptions during inference. In this paper, we
present a novel phrase-grounded fact-checking model (FC model) that detects
errors in findings and their indicated locations in automatically generated
chest radiology reports.
  Specifically, we simulate the errors in reports through a large synthetic
dataset derived by perturbing findings and their locations in ground truth
reports to form real and fake findings-location pairs with images. A new
multi-label cross-modal contrastive regression network is then trained on this
dataset. We present results demonstrating the robustness of our method in terms
of accuracy of finding veracity prediction and localization on multiple X-ray
datasets. We also show its effectiveness for error detection in reports of SOTA
report generators on multiple datasets achieving a concordance correlation
coefficient of 0.997 with ground truth-based verification, thus pointing to its
utility during clinical inference in radiology workflows.

### [5] [MDF-MLLM: Deep Fusion Through Cross-Modal Feature Alignment for Contextually Aware Fundoscopic Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21358)
*Jason Jordan,Mohammadreza Akbari Lor,Peter Koulen,Mei-Ling Shyu,Shu-Ching Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A multimodal framework (MDF-MLLM) fuses fine-grained retinal image features from a U-Net with global textual context via cross-attention in a LLaMA-based model to classify retinal diseases. It greatly improves accuracy on a public dataset from 60% to 94%, with notable gains in recall and F1, and demonstrates ablation-supported gains from multi-depth feature fusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Capture low-level spatial details in fundus images that traditional multimodal LLMs miss, while leveraging rich textual context to improve disease classification.

Method: Integrate skip features from four U-Net encoder layers into cross-attention blocks within a LLaMA 3.2 11B MLLM. Vision features are patch-wise projected and fused using scaled cross-attention and FiLM-based U-Net modulation. Train both U-Net and MLLM components end-to-end on 1,305 image-text pairs from FIVES, HRF, and StoneRounds for dual-type disease classification; perform ablations on multi-depth fusion.

Result: Baseline MLLM accuracy 60%; MDF-MLLM achieves 94% accuracy (56% absolute gain). Recall up to +67% and F1 up to +35% relative to baseline. Ablation confirms multi-depth fusion improves spatial reasoning and performance, especially for inherited diseases with rich text.

Conclusion: MDF-MLLM is a generalizable, interpretable, and modular framework that surpasses traditional MLLMs in fundus image classification, with potential for clinical deployment and future extensions to synchronized training, broader disease sets, and segmentation tasks.

Abstract: This study aimed to enhance disease classification accuracy from retinal
fundus images by integrating fine-grained image features and global textual
context using a novel multimodal deep learning architecture. Existing
multimodal large language models (MLLMs) often struggle to capture low-level
spatial details critical for diagnosing retinal diseases such as glaucoma,
diabetic retinopathy, and retinitis pigmentosa. This model development and
validation study was conducted on 1,305 fundus image-text pairs compiled from
three public datasets (FIVES, HRF, and StoneRounds), covering acquired and
inherited retinal diseases, and evaluated using classification accuracy and
F1-score. The MDF-MLLM integrates skip features from four U-Net encoder layers
into cross-attention blocks within a LLaMA 3.2 11B MLLM. Vision features are
patch-wise projected and fused using scaled cross-attention and FiLM-based
U-Net modulation. Baseline MLLM achieved 60% accuracy on the dual-type disease
classification task. MDF-MLLM, with both U-Net and MLLM components fully
fine-tuned during training, achieved a significantly higher accuracy of 94%,
representing a 56% improvement. Recall and F1-scores improved by as much as 67%
and 35% over baseline, respectively. Ablation studies confirmed that the
multi-depth fusion approach contributed to substantial gains in spatial
reasoning and classification, particularly for inherited diseases with rich
clinical text. MDF-MLLM presents a generalizable, interpretable, and modular
framework for fundus image classification, outperforming traditional MLLM
baselines through multi-scale feature fusion. The architecture holds promise
for real-world deployment in clinical decision support systems. Future work
will explore synchronized training techniques, a larger pool of diseases for
more generalizability, and extending the model for segmentation tasks.

### [6] [Multimodal Prompt Decoupling Attack on the Safety Filters in Text-to-Image Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21360)
*Xingkai Peng,Jun Jiang,Meng Tong,Shuai Li,Weiming Zhang,Nenghai Yu,Kejiang Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MPDA is a multimodal prompt attack that uses an image input to decouple unsafe prompts into pseudo-safe and harmful components, then rewrites harmful prompts into natural adversarial prompts to bypass safety filters, with captions guiding iterative refinement to preserve semantic alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text-based jailbreaks are well-studied, but image-based input vulnerabilities are underexplored. Exploring multimodal prompt manipulation is essential to understand and mitigate NSFW jailbreak risks in T2I systems.

Method: Three-step pipeline: (1) An LLM decouples unsafe prompts into pseudo-safe and harmful sub-prompts; (2) The LLM rewrites the harmful prompts into natural adversarial prompts designed to bypass safety filters and steer the T2I model toward NSFW outputs; (3) A visual language model generates image captions to ensure semantic consistency and guide iterative rewriting by the LLM.

Result: The abstract presents the MPDA framework and its components, arguing for its feasibility and highlighting a novel vulnerability class in multimodal prompt injection. It does not provide empirical results within the abstract.

Conclusion: MPDA introduces a new multimodal attack vector on T2I systems, revealing limitations of current safety mechanisms and underscoring the need for defenses that address multimodal prompt manipulation and cross-modal consistency checks.

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models have been widely applied in generating
high-fidelity images across various domains. However, these models may also be
abused to produce Not-Safe-for-Work (NSFW) content via jailbreak attacks.
Existing jailbreak methods primarily manipulate the textual prompt, leaving
potential vulnerabilities in image-based inputs largely unexplored. Moreover,
text-based methods face challenges in bypassing the model's safety filters. In
response to these limitations, we propose the Multimodal Prompt Decoupling
Attack (MPDA), which utilizes image modality to separate the harmful semantic
components of the original unsafe prompt. MPDA follows three core steps:
firstly, a large language model (LLM) decouples unsafe prompts into pseudo-safe
prompts and harmful prompts. The former are seemingly harmless sub-prompts that
can bypass filters, while the latter are sub-prompts with unsafe semantics that
trigger filters. Subsequently, the LLM rewrites the harmful prompts into
natural adversarial prompts to bypass safety filters, which guide the T2I model
to modify the base image into an NSFW output. Finally, to ensure semantic
consistency between the generated NSFW images and the original unsafe prompts,
the visual language model generates image captions, providing a new pathway to
guide the LLM in iterative rewriting and refining the generated content.

### [7] [A Mutual Learning Method for Salient Object Detection with intertwined Multi-Supervision--Revised](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21363)
*Runmin Wu,Mengyang Feng,Wenlong Guan,Dong Wang,Huchuan Lu,Errui Ding*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A multi-task mutual learning framework for salient object detection leveraging foreground contour and edge detection to produce more complete and well-boundaried saliency maps; introduces a mutual learning module with multi-branch networks; achieves state-of-the-art results on seven datasets for SOD and edge detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome incomplete saliency and boundary inaccuracies caused by feature stride and pooling in CNNs by incorporating auxiliary shape/edge cues and mutual learning.

Method: Jointly train SOD, foreground contour detection, and edge detection with a novel mutual learning module (MLM) consisting of multiple branches that learn from each other; contours and edges guide saliency maps to be uniform, while contours and edges mutually refine each other.

Result: Experiments on seven challenging datasets show state-of-the-art performance in both salient object detection and edge detection, with significant improvements over baselines.

Conclusion: Demonstrates effectiveness of multi-task and mutual learning strategies in refining saliency predictions and boundary localization; MLM is a powerful building block for cross-task supervision.

Abstract: Though deep learning techniques have made great progress in salient object
detection recently, the predicted saliency maps still suffer from incomplete
predictions due to the internal complexity of objects and inaccurate boundaries
caused by strides in convolution and pooling operations. To alleviate these
issues, we propose to train saliency detection networks by exploiting the
supervision from not only salient object detection, but also foreground contour
detection and edge detection. First, we leverage salient object detection and
foreground contour detection tasks in an intertwined manner to generate
saliency maps with uniform highlight. Second, the foreground contour and edge
detection tasks guide each other simultaneously, thereby leading to precise
foreground contour prediction and reducing the local noises for edge
prediction. In addition, we develop a novel mutual learning module (MLM) which
serves as the building block of our method. Each MLM consists of multiple
network branches trained in a mutual learning manner, which improves the
performance by a large margin. Extensive experiments on seven challenging
datasets demonstrate that the proposed method has delivered state-of-the-art
results in both salient object detection and edge detection.

### [8] [MAJORScore: A Novel Metric for Evaluating Multimodal Relevance via Joint Representation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21365)
*Zhicheng Du,Qingyang Shi,Jiasheng Lu,Yingshan Liang,Xinyu Zhang,Yiran Wang,Peiwu Qin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MAJORScore is a new N-modal relevance metric (N≥3) based on a multimodal joint representation, outperforming pairwise metrics by better capturing cross-modal similarity in large-scale datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current metrics derived from bimodal embedding (e.g., CLIP) cannot evaluate multimodal similarity across more than two modalities; there is a need for a reliable, scalable evaluation metric for N modalities.

Method: Introduce MAJORScore that learns a shared latent space to jointly encode multiple modalities and quantify their relevance via the joint representation.

Result: Experiments show MAJORScore increases by 26.03%-64.29% for consistent modality and decreases by 13.28%-20.54% for inconsistency compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: MAJORScore provides a more reliable, scalable metric for evaluating multimodal similarity and model performance on large-scale multimodal data.

Abstract: The multimodal relevance metric is usually borrowed from the embedding
ability of pretrained contrastive learning models for bimodal data, which is
used to evaluate the correlation between cross-modal data (e.g., CLIP).
However, the commonly used evaluation metrics are only suitable for the
associated analysis between two modalities, which greatly limits the evaluation
of multimodal similarity. Herein, we propose MAJORScore, a brand-new evaluation
metric for the relevance of multiple modalities ($N$ modalities, $N\ge3$) via
multimodal joint representation for the first time. The ability of multimodal
joint representation to integrate multiple modalities into the same latent
space can accurately represent different modalities at one scale, providing
support for fair relevance scoring. Extensive experiments have shown that
MAJORScore increases by 26.03%-64.29% for consistent modality and decreases by
13.28%-20.54% for inconsistence compared to existing methods. MAJORScore serves
as a more reliable metric for evaluating similarity on large-scale multimodal
datasets and multimodal model performance evaluation.

### [9] [Safety Assessment of Scaffolding on Construction Site using AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21368)
*Sameer Prabhu,Amit Patwardhan,Ramin Karim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A cloud-based AI platform analyzes scaffolding point cloud data to detect deviations from certified reference data, enabling automated monitoring and potentially safer, more efficient inspections.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Scaffolding safety relies on visual inspections that are time-consuming and prone to human error; automated, data-driven methods are needed to improve accuracy and safety.

Method: Developed a cloud-based AI platform that processes point cloud data of scaffolding and compares current scans to certified reference data to detect structural modifications.

Result: Proposes a system capable of detecting alterations and enabling automated monitoring; emphasizes potential reductions in manual inspection effort and improved safety, though empirical results are not reported in the abstract.

Conclusion: AI-driven digitization can enhance scaffold safety by enabling automated monitoring and reducing the manual inspection burden on construction sites.

Abstract: In the construction industry, safety assessment is vital to ensure both the
reliability of assets and the safety of workers. Scaffolding, a key structural
support asset requires regular inspection to detect and identify alterations
from the design rules that may compromise the integrity and stability. At
present, inspections are primarily visual and are conducted by site manager or
accredited personnel to identify deviations. However, visual inspection is
time-intensive and can be susceptible to human errors, which can lead to unsafe
conditions. This paper explores the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and
digitization to enhance the accuracy of scaffolding inspection and contribute
to the safety improvement. A cloud-based AI platform is developed to process
and analyse the point cloud data of scaffolding structure. The proposed system
detects structural modifications through comparison and evaluation of certified
reference data with the recent point cloud data. This approach may enable
automated monitoring of scaffolding, reducing the time and effort required for
manual inspections while enhancing the safety on a construction site.

*Aleksa Jelaca,Ying Jiao,Chang Tian,Marie-Francine Moens*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A three-component automatic prompt-engineering framework for counterfactual size in text-to-image generation, including an image evaluator, a supervised prompt rewriter, and a DPO-trained ranker; it builds the first counterfactual-size dataset and achieves strong improvements over baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the gap in fine-grained, counterfactual controllability in text-to-image generation, enabling deliberate creation of images that defy common-sense patterns to support creativity and exploration.

Method: 1) Image evaluator guides dataset construction by identifying successful counterfactual-size generations; 2) Supervised prompt rewriter produces revised prompts; 3) DPO-trained ranker selects the optimal revised prompt. The authors construct the first counterfactual-size text–image dataset and enhance an image evaluator (Grounded SAM with refinements).

Result: The method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and ChatGPT-4o, and achieves a 114% improvement over the backbone image evaluator; experiments validate effectiveness and establish a foundation for counterfactual controllability research.

Conclusion: The work provides a foundation for counterfactual controllability in text-to-image generation, introduces the first counterfactual-size dataset, and demonstrates the efficacy of automatic prompt engineering for producing counterfactual imagery.

Abstract: Text-to-image generation has advanced rapidly with large-scale multimodal
training, yet fine-grained controllability remains a critical challenge.
Counterfactual controllability, defined as the capacity to deliberately
generate images that contradict common-sense patterns, remains a major
challenge but plays a crucial role in enabling creativity and exploratory
applications. In this work, we address this gap with a focus on counterfactual
size (e.g., generating a tiny walrus beside a giant button) and propose an
automatic prompt engineering framework that adapts base prompts into revised
prompts for counterfactual images. The framework comprises three components: an
image evaluator that guides dataset construction by identifying successful
image generations, a supervised prompt rewriter that produces revised prompts,
and a DPO-trained ranker that selects the optimal revised prompt. We construct
the first counterfactual size text-image dataset and enhance the image
evaluator by extending Grounded SAM with refinements, achieving a 114 percent
improvement over its backbone. Experiments demonstrate that our method
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and ChatGPT-4o, establishing a
foundation for future research on counterfactual controllability.

### [11] [In silico Deep Learning Protocols for Label-Free Super-Resolution Microscopy: A Comparative Study of Network Architectures and SNR Dependence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21376)
*Shiraz S Kaderuppan,Jonathan Mar,Andrew Irvine,Anurag Sharma,Muhammad Ramadan Saifuddin,Wai Leong Eugene Wong,Wai Lok Woo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Two DNN-based SR models (O-Net, Theta-Net) for non-fluorescent phase-contrast/DIC microscopy show complementary strengths depending on image SNR; high SNR favors O-Net, low SNR favors Theta-Net; architecture and SNR jointly shape SR quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the limitation of lateral resolution in optical microscopy by offering an economical, non-fluorescent SR approach usable by non-specialists, avoiding costly hardware or fluorescent techniques.

Method: In silico evaluation of two pre-existing architectures (O-Net and Theta-Net) trained on the same data to perform super-resolution on PCM/DIC images, using a nanoscale AFM-calibrated test target; assess performance across varying SNRs.

Result: Both models perform well and are complementary rather than competing; SNR dictates which architecture yields better SR; O-Net excels at high SNR, Theta-Net at low SNR; architecture influences SR quality even with identical training data/epochs.

Conclusion: DNN-based non-fluorescent nanoscopy is feasible; select models based on SNR, and consider complementary/ensemble use to optimize SR across SNR regimes.

Abstract: The field of optical microscopy spans across numerous industries and research
domains, ranging from education to healthcare, quality inspection and analysis.
Nonetheless, a key limitation often cited by optical microscopists refers to
the limit of its lateral resolution (typically defined as ~200nm), with
potential circumventions involving either costly external modules (e.g.
confocal scan heads, etc) and/or specialized techniques [e.g. super-resolution
(SR) fluorescent microscopy]. Addressing these challenges in a normal
(non-specialist) context thus remains an aspect outside the scope of most
microscope users & facilities. This study thus seeks to evaluate an alternative
& economical approach to achieving SR optical microscopy, involving
non-fluorescent phase-modulated microscopical modalities such as Zernike phase
contrast (PCM) and differential interference contrast (DIC) microscopy. Two in
silico deep neural network (DNN) architectures which we developed previously
(termed O-Net and Theta-Net) are assessed on their abilities to resolve a
custom-fabricated test target containing nanoscale features calibrated via
atomic force microscopy (AFM). The results of our study demonstrate that
although both O-Net and Theta-Net seemingly performed well when super-resolving
these images, they were complementary (rather than competing) approaches to be
considered for image SR, particularly under different image signal-to-noise
ratios (SNRs). High image SNRs favoured the application of O-Net models, while
low SNRs inclined preferentially towards Theta-Net models. These findings
demonstrate the importance of model architectures (in conjunction with the
source image SNR) on model performance and the SR quality of the generated
images where DNN models are utilized for non-fluorescent optical nanoscopy,
even where the same training dataset & number of epochs are being used.

### [12] [Dynamic Multi-Target Fusion for Efficient Audio-Visual Navigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21377)
*Yinfeng Yu,Hailong Zhang,Meiling Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Dynamic Multi-Target Fusion for Efficient Audio-Visual Navigation (DMTF-AVN) combines a multi-target architecture with a refined Transformer to selectively fuse cross-modal cues for audio-visual navigation, achieving state-of-the-art SR, SPL, and SNA on Replica and Matterport3D; code available.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Locating audio sources with robots requires effective integration of visual and auditory cues. Prior fusion methods are often shallow and fail to exploit deeper perceptual context, hindering generalization across environments. A more context-aware, scalable fusion strategy is needed for robust multimodal navigation.

Method: Proposes DMTF-AVN, a dynamic multi-target navigation framework that uses a multi-target architecture and a refined Transformer to filter and selectively fuse cross-modal information from visual observations and audio signals, enabling flexible, context-aware decision making during navigation.

Result: Experiments on Replica and Matterport3D datasets show state-of-the-art performance, outperforming baselines in success rate (SR), path efficiency (SPL), and scene adaptation (SNA). The model demonstrates strong scalability and generalizability, indicating effective multimodal fusion strategies for robotic navigation.

Conclusion: DMTF-AVN advances multimodal fusion for embodied navigation by leveraging a dynamic multi-target approach and Transformer-based cross-modal filtering, with strong empirical performance and potential for broader adoption; code and videos are available at the provided GitHub link.

Abstract: Audiovisual embodied navigation enables robots to locate audio sources by
dynamically integrating visual observations from onboard sensors with the
auditory signals emitted by the target. The core challenge lies in effectively
leveraging multimodal cues to guide navigation. While prior works have explored
basic fusion of visual and audio data, they often overlook deeper perceptual
context. To address this, we propose the Dynamic Multi-Target Fusion for
Efficient Audio-Visual Navigation (DMTF-AVN). Our approach uses a multi-target
architecture coupled with a refined Transformer mechanism to filter and
selectively fuse cross-modal information. Extensive experiments on the Replica
and Matterport3D datasets demonstrate that DMTF-AVN achieves state-of-the-art
performance, outperforming existing methods in success rate (SR), path
efficiency (SPL), and scene adaptation (SNA). Furthermore, the model exhibits
strong scalability and generalizability, paving the way for advanced multimodal
fusion strategies in robotic navigation. The code and videos are available at

### [13] [SAEmnesia: Erasing Concepts in Diffusion Models with Sparse Autoencoders](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21379)
*Enrico Cassano,Riccardo Renzulli,Marco Nurisso,Mirko Zaffaroni,Alan Perotti,Marco Grangetto*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SAEmnesia uses supervised sparse autoencoder training to achieve one-to-one concept-neuron mappings for concept unlearning in diffusion models, reducing search overhead and achieving state-of-the-art results on UnlearnCanvas and scalable 9-object unlearning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Concept representations in latent space are polysemantic; despite sparse autoencoders, concepts can still be distributed across multiple latent features, requiring extensive search for unlearning.

Method: Systematic concept labeling during supervised sparse autoencoder training to promote one-to-one concept-neuron mappings; learn specialized neurons with strong concept associations; training incurs only cross-entropy overhead; at inference time, interpretable representations dramatically reduce hyperparameter search (reported as 96.67%).

Result: SAEmnesia yields significantly stronger concept associations than unsupervised baselines; 9.22% improvement on the UnlearnCanvas benchmark; 28.4% improvement in unlearning accuracy for 9-object removal in sequential unlearning tasks; training overhead limited to cross-entropy.

Conclusion: SAEmnesia improves localization of concept representations in latent space and enhances unlearning scalability while reducing search overhead, demonstrating a practical approach to concept unlearning in diffusion models.

Abstract: Effective concept unlearning in text-to-image diffusion models requires
precise localization of concept representations within the model's latent
space. While sparse autoencoders successfully reduce neuron polysemanticity
(i.e., multiple concepts per neuron) compared to the original network,
individual concept representations can still be distributed across multiple
latent features, requiring extensive search procedures for concept unlearning.
We introduce SAEmnesia, a supervised sparse autoencoder training method that
promotes one-to-one concept-neuron mappings through systematic concept
labeling, mitigating feature splitting and promoting feature centralization.
Our approach learns specialized neurons with significantly stronger concept
associations compared to unsupervised baselines. The only computational
overhead introduced by SAEmnesia is limited to cross-entropy computation during
training. At inference time, this interpretable representation reduces
hyperparameter search by 96.67% with respect to current approaches. On the
UnlearnCanvas benchmark, SAEmnesia achieves a 9.22% improvement over the
state-of-the-art. In sequential unlearning tasks, we demonstrate superior
scalability with a 28.4% improvement in unlearning accuracy for 9-object
removal.

### [14] [Coreset selection based on Intra-class diversity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21380)
*Imran Ashraf,Mukhtar Ullah,Muhammad Faisal Nadeem,Muhammad Nouman Noor*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A lightweight coreset selection method preserves intra-class diversity by forming per-class clusters and sampling from those clusters, yielding a representative training subset (coreset) for biomedical image classification that outperforms random sampling under uniform conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training DL models on large biomedical image datasets is computationally expensive, and hyperparameter search amplifies this cost. Random sampling of data for coresets can bias toward dominant classes and miss intra-class diversity, reducing representativeness.

Method: Extract intra-class diversity by forming per-class clusters and use these clusters for final sampling to construct the coreset. This clustered sampling is designed to be lightweight and representative.

Result: Experiments on a well-known biomedical imaging dataset show that the proposed coreset sampling scheme outperforms random sampling on several performance metrics under uniform conditions.

Conclusion: Intelligent, cluster-based per-class coreset selection improves representativeness and performance, enabling more efficient training and hyperparameter search for biomedical image classification.

Abstract: Deep Learning models have transformed various domains, including the
healthcare sector, particularly biomedical image classification by learning
intricate features and enabling accurate diagnostics pertaining to complex
diseases. Recent studies have adopted two different approaches to train DL
models: training from scratch and transfer learning. Both approaches demand
substantial computational time and resources due to the involvement of massive
datasets in model training. These computational demands are further increased
due to the design-space exploration required for selecting optimal
hyperparameters, which typically necessitates several training rounds. With the
growing sizes of datasets, exploring solutions to this problem has recently
gained the research community's attention. A plausible solution is to select a
subset of the dataset for training and hyperparameter search. This subset,
referred to as the corset, must be a representative set of the original
dataset. A straightforward approach to selecting the coreset could be employing
random sampling, albeit at the cost of compromising the representativeness of
the original dataset. A critical limitation of random sampling is the bias
towards the dominant classes in an imbalanced dataset. Even if the dataset has
inter-class balance, this random sampling will not capture intra-class
diversity. This study addresses this issue by introducing an intelligent,
lightweight mechanism for coreset selection. Specifically, it proposes a method
to extract intra-class diversity, forming per-class clusters that are utilized
for the final sampling. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed methodology
by conducting extensive classification experiments on a well-known biomedical
imaging dataset. Results demonstrate that the proposed scheme outperforms the
random sampling approach on several performance metrics for uniform conditions.

### [15] [The LongiMam model for improved breast cancer risk prediction using longitudinal mammograms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21383)
*Manel Rakez,Thomas Louis,Julien Guillaumin,Foucauld Chamming's,Pierre Fillard,Brice Amadeo,Virginie Rondeau*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LongiMam leverages current and up to four prior mammograms with a CNN+RNN to improve breast cancer risk prediction; shows robust gains in real-world, imbalanced screening data and across subgroups; open-source.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop robust, longitudinal risk models for population-based breast cancer screening that handle imbalanced outcomes and heterogeneous follow-up, by utilizing repeated mammograms.

Method: End-to-end deep learning model (LongiMam) that fuses current and up to four prior mammograms using a convolutional network plus a recurrent network to capture spatial and temporal patterns; trained and evaluated on a large, population-based screening dataset with a disproportionate case–control ratio; analyzed across scenarios varying the number and composition of priors; included subgroup analyses.

Result: LongiMam consistently improved prediction when prior exams were included; adding prior and current visits outperformed single-visit models; priors alone were less effective; robust across key risk groups, including dense breasts and women aged 55+, with the best performance when mammographic density changed over time.

Conclusion: Longitudinal modeling enhances breast cancer prediction and supports using repeated mammograms to refine risk stratification in screening programs; LongiMam is publicly available as open-source software.

Abstract: Risk-adapted breast cancer screening requires robust models that leverage
longitudinal imaging data. Most current deep learning models use single or
limited prior mammograms and lack adaptation for real-world settings marked by
imbalanced outcome distribution and heterogeneous follow-up. We developed
LongiMam, an end-to-end deep learning model that integrates both current and up
to four prior mammograms. LongiMam combines a convolutional and a recurrent
neural network to capture spatial and temporal patterns predictive of breast
cancer. The model was trained and evaluated using a large, population-based
screening dataset with disproportionate case-to-control ratio typical of
clinical screening. Across several scenarios that varied in the number and
composition of prior exams, LongiMam consistently improved prediction when
prior mammograms were included. The addition of prior and current visits
outperformed single-visit models, while priors alone performed less well,
highlighting the importance of combining historical and recent information.
Subgroup analyses confirmed the model's efficacy across key risk groups,
including women with dense breasts and those aged 55 years or older. Moreover,
the model performed best in women with observed changes in mammographic density
over time. These findings demonstrate that longitudinal modeling enhances
breast cancer prediction and support the use of repeated mammograms to refine
risk stratification in screening programs. LongiMam is publicly available as
open-source software.

### [16] [Assessing the Alignment of Popular CNNs to the Brain for Valence Appraisal](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21384)
*Laurent Mertens,Elahe' Yargholi,Laura Van Hove,Hans Op de Beeck,Jan Van den Stock,Joost Vennekens*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CNNs align with human behavior/brain mainly for basic visual processing; they struggle with higher-order social cognition like image valence appraisal; Object2Brain framework analyzes object-class influences and architecture-specific sensitivities, but overall correlations are similar across architectures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To test whether CNN-brain correspondences observed in general vision extend to social cognition (valence appraisal) and to understand how object content modulates CNN-to-brain alignment.

Method: Correlational analysis between several popular CNN architectures and human behavioral and fMRI data during image valence appraisal; use GradCAM and in-CNN object detection to map activations to object classes; introduce Object2Brain framework to study object-class influences on CNN-brain correlations and compare architecture sensitivities.

Result: CNNs do not reflect higher-order brain processing for valence appraisal; they largely reflect simple visual processing. Object2Brain reveals that different object classes modulate correlations differently, and architectures show distinct object-class sensitivities, though overall correlation trends are similar across architectures.

Conclusion: Caution in using CNNs as models of social-cognitive brain processes. The framework enables dissection of object-level contributions and architectural biases, highlighting limits of CNNs for higher-level social cognition.

Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are a popular type of computer model
that have proven their worth in many computer vision tasks. Moreover, they form
an interesting study object for the field of psychology, with shown
correspondences between the workings of CNNs and the human brain. However,
these correspondences have so far mostly been studied in the context of general
visual perception. In contrast, this paper explores to what extent this
correspondence also holds for a more complex brain process, namely social
cognition. To this end, we assess the alignment between popular CNN
architectures and both human behavioral and fMRI data for image valence
appraisal through a correlation analysis. We show that for this task CNNs
struggle to go beyond simple visual processing, and do not seem to reflect
higher-order brain processing. Furthermore, we present Object2Brain, a novel
framework that combines GradCAM and object detection at the CNN-filter level
with the aforementioned correlation analysis to study the influence of
different object classes on the CNN-to-human correlations. Despite similar
correlation trends, different CNN architectures are shown to display different
object class sensitivities.

### [17] [Debugging Concept Bottleneck Models through Removal and Retraining](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21385)
*Eric Enouen,Sainyam Galhotra*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduces CBDebug, an interpretable debugging framework for Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) using a two-step Removal and Retraining process to mitigate reliance on undesired concepts and spurious correlations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CBMs suffer from misalignment with expert reasoning and can rely on biased shortcuts. There is a need for an interpretable debugging framework to align CBMs with expert knowledge and reduce bias.

Method: Removal: experts use concept explanations to identify and remove undesired concepts. Retraining: CBDebug converts concept-level user feedback into sample-level auxiliary labels, enabling supervised bias mitigation and targeted augmentation to reduce reliance on undesired concepts.

Result: CBDebug significantly outperforms prior retraining methods across multiple CBM architectures (PIP-Net, Post-hoc CBM) and benchmarks with known spurious correlations, using both real and automated expert feedback.

Conclusion: Interpretable debugging via a two-step Removal and CBDebug retraining framework improves CBM robustness to biases and spurious correlations, offering a general approach for bias mitigation in concept bottleneck models.

Abstract: Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) use a set of human-interpretable concepts to
predict the final task label, enabling domain experts to not only validate the
CBM's predictions, but also intervene on incorrect concepts at test time.
However, these interventions fail to address systemic misalignment between the
CBM and the expert's reasoning, such as when the model learns shortcuts from
biased data. To address this, we present a general interpretable debugging
framework for CBMs that follows a two-step process of Removal and Retraining.
In the Removal step, experts use concept explanations to identify and remove
any undesired concepts. In the Retraining step, we introduce CBDebug, a novel
method that leverages the interpretability of CBMs as a bridge for converting
concept-level user feedback into sample-level auxiliary labels. These labels
are then used to apply supervised bias mitigation and targeted augmentation,
reducing the model's reliance on undesired concepts. We evaluate our framework
with both real and automated expert feedback, and find that CBDebug
significantly outperforms prior retraining methods across multiple CBM
architectures (PIP-Net, Post-hoc CBM) and benchmarks with known spurious
correlations.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Open-source QGIS plugin ShipwreckFinder for automatic shipwreck detection from multibeam sonar using preprocessing, deep learning inference, and thresholding; outputs pixel masks or bounding boxes; trained with synthetic data; claims superior segmentation vs ArcGIS toolkit and inverse sinkhole method.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual bathymetric inspection for shipwrecks is time-consuming; automated methods can accelerate discovery and broaden accessibility; open-source plugin encourages community validation and extension.

Method: Preprocess bathymetry data; run deep learning inference with a backbone model trained on shipwreck data; use synthetic data to augment dataset; threshold model outputs to produce segmentation masks or bounding boxes; compare against ArcGIS toolkit and inverse sinkhole method; implemented as a QGIS plugin.

Result: Demonstrates superior segmentation performance compared to the ArcGIS toolkit and the inverse sinkhole method; tool and training pipeline are open-source and available at a GitHub repo.

Conclusion: ShipwreckFinder provides an effective, open-source pipeline for automatic shipwreck detection from multibeam sonar, with potential to standardize and accelerate maritime archaeology workflows; further evaluation on diverse datasets and real-world deployment encouraged.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce ShipwreckFinder, an open-source QGIS plugin that
detects shipwrecks from multibeam sonar data. Shipwrecks are an important
historical marker of maritime history, and can be discovered through manual
inspection of bathymetric data. However, this is a time-consuming process and
often requires expert analysis. Our proposed tool allows users to automatically
preprocess bathymetry data, perform deep learning inference, threshold model
outputs, and produce either pixel-wise segmentation masks or bounding boxes of
predicted shipwrecks. The backbone of this open-source tool is a deep learning
model, which is trained on a variety of shipwreck data from the Great Lakes and
the coasts of Ireland. Additionally, we employ synthetic data generation in
order to increase the size and diversity of our dataset. We demonstrate
superior segmentation performance with our open-source tool and training
pipeline as compared to a deep learning-based ArcGIS toolkit and a more
classical inverse sinkhole detection method. The open-source tool can be found

### [19] [Do Sparse Subnetworks Exhibit Cognitively Aligned Attention? Effects of Pruning on Saliency Map Fidelity, Sparsity, and Concept Coherence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21387)
*Sanish Suwal,Dipkamal Bhusal,Michael Clifford,Nidhi Rastogi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Light-to-moderate magnitude-based pruning can enhance interpretability (more focused, faithful saliency maps and coherent high-level concepts), while aggressive pruning degrades interpretability despite maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pruning improves efficiency but its effect on model interpretability is unclear. This work probes how pruning reshapes low-level saliency explanations and high-level concept representations, addressing a gap where pruning is typically evaluated only on accuracy/performance.

Method: Apply magnitude-based pruning with subsequent fine-tuning to a ResNet-18 trained on ImageNette. Compare post-hoc explanations from Vanilla Gradients (VG) and Integrated Gradients (IG) across pruning levels; assess sparsity and faithfulness. Use CRAFT-based concept extraction to track semantic coherence of learned concepts.

Result: Light-to-moderate pruning improves saliency-map focus and faithfulness and preserves semantically meaningful concepts. Aggressive pruning merges heterogeneous features, reducing saliency sparsity and concept coherence, even though accuracy is maintained.

Conclusion: Pruning can steer internal representations toward human-aligned attention patterns, but excessive pruning undermines interpretability. When optimizing for interpretability, moderate pruning is preferable; aggressive pruning harms qualitative explanations.

Abstract: Prior works have shown that neural networks can be heavily pruned while
preserving performance, but the impact of pruning on model interpretability
remains unclear. In this work, we investigate how magnitude-based pruning
followed by fine-tuning affects both low-level saliency maps and high-level
concept representations. Using a ResNet-18 trained on ImageNette, we compare
post-hoc explanations from Vanilla Gradients (VG) and Integrated Gradients (IG)
across pruning levels, evaluating sparsity and faithfulness. We further apply
CRAFT-based concept extraction to track changes in semantic coherence of
learned concepts. Our results show that light-to-moderate pruning improves
saliency-map focus and faithfulness while retaining distinct, semantically
meaningful concepts. In contrast, aggressive pruning merges heterogeneous
features, reducing saliency map sparsity and concept coherence despite
maintaining accuracy. These findings suggest that while pruning can shape
internal representations toward more human-aligned attention patterns,
excessive pruning undermines interpretability.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TUN3D jointly estimates indoor scene layout and 3D object detections from multi-view RGB images without depth or pose supervision, using a sparse-convolutional backbone and dual heads; it achieves state-of-the-art layout estimation and competitive object detection across GT point clouds, posed, and unposed inputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enable holistic indoor scene understanding using common RGB data without requiring depth sensors or ground-truth camera poses, addressing a gap between layout estimation and 3D object detection.

Method: A lightweight sparse-convolutional backbone processes multi-view images with two task heads: one for 3D object detection and one for layout estimation, employing a novel parametric wall representation; training and inference do not require ground-truth poses or depth supervision.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on layout estimation and competitive performance with specialized 3D detectors across three benchmarks: ground-truth point clouds, posed images, and unposed images.

Conclusion: First method to jointly perform layout estimation and 3D object detection on real scans from multi-view RGB inputs without pose or depth supervision, advancing holistic indoor scene understanding; open-sourced code is available.

Abstract: Layout estimation and 3D object detection are two fundamental tasks in indoor
scene understanding. When combined, they enable the creation of a compact yet
semantically rich spatial representation of a scene. Existing approaches
typically rely on point cloud input, which poses a major limitation since most
consumer cameras lack depth sensors and visual-only data remains far more
common. We address this issue with TUN3D, the first method that tackles joint
layout estimation and 3D object detection in real scans, given multi-view
images as input, and does not require ground-truth camera poses or depth
supervision. Our approach builds on a lightweight sparse-convolutional backbone
and employs two dedicated heads: one for 3D object detection and one for layout
estimation, leveraging a novel and effective parametric wall representation.
Extensive experiments show that TUN3D achieves state-of-the-art performance
across three challenging scene understanding benchmarks: (i) using ground-truth
point clouds, (ii) using posed images, and (iii) using unposed images. While
performing on par with specialized 3D object detection methods, TUN3D
significantly advances layout estimation, setting a new benchmark in holistic
indoor scene understanding. Code is available at

*Qiyu Ma,Wanli Ni,Zhijin Qin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A region-aware generative semantic communication framework for image transmission that prioritizes key regions with a semantic encoder and compresses non-key regions via image-to-text, plus quantization and low-rank adaptation for efficiency; achieves higher semantic fidelity and visual quality than traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods neglect regional importance in images, risking loss of visually critical content and inefficient resource use; a system that preserves essential details while reducing transmission payload is needed.

Method: Segment images into key and non-key regions. Key regions are processed with an image-oriented semantic encoder; non-key regions are compressed using image-to-text modeling. To reduce resource demands, apply lightweight deployment via model quantization and LoRA (low-rank adaptation) fine-tuning to the large AI models.

Result: Simulation results indicate the proposed system achieves higher semantic fidelity and better visual quality than traditional methods in image transmission tasks.

Conclusion: Region-aware generative semantic communication for images is effective, offering improved performance with lower resource requirements and practical viability for image transmission.”

Abstract: The rapid development of generative artificial intelligence (AI) has
introduced significant opportunities for enhancing the efficiency and accuracy
of image transmission within semantic communication systems. Despite these
advancements, existing methodologies often neglect the difference in importance
of different regions of the image, potentially compromising the reconstruction
quality of visually critical content. To address this issue, we introduce an
innovative generative semantic communication system that refines semantic
granularity by segmenting images into key and non-key regions. Key regions,
which contain essential visual information, are processed using an image
oriented semantic encoder, while non-key regions are efficiently compressed
through an image-to-text modeling approach. Additionally, to mitigate the
substantial storage and computational demands posed by large AI models, the
proposed system employs a lightweight deployment strategy incorporating model
quantization and low-rank adaptation fine-tuning techniques, significantly
boosting resource utilization without sacrificing performance. Simulation
results demonstrate that the proposed system outperforms traditional methods in
terms of both semantic fidelity and visual quality, thereby affirming its
effectiveness for image transmission tasks.

*Julia Gierke,Pascal Peter*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduces skeletonisation scale-spaces that sparsify the medial axis to yield a hierarchical, transformation-equivariant skeleton with controllable simplification and densification, enabling coarse-to-fine shape representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The medial axis (Hamilton–Jacobi skeleton) is highly sensitive to boundary noise and traditional pruning is non-scale-aware. A principled, scale-space framework is needed to achieve robust, hierarchically simplified skeletons that respect geometric transformations.

Method: Develop skeletonisation scale-spaces by sparsifying the medial axis to create a hierarchy of skeletons. Provide continuous and discrete formulations, and extend with densification to allow coarse-to-fine progression and overcomplete representations. Demonstrate inverse progression from coarse to fine scales.

Result: The framework achieves hierarchical, controllable skeleton simplification with scale-space properties (hierarchy, transformation equivariance). Proof-of-concept experiments show robustness in skeletonisation, shape compression, and stiffness enhancement for additive manufacturing.

Conclusion: Skeletonisation scale-spaces offer a principled, scalable approach to skeleton simplification that integrates sparsification with medial-axis geometry, enabling robust, controllable representations and practical applications across design and manufacturing.

Abstract: The Hamilton-Jacobi skeleton, also known as the medial axis, is a powerful
shape descriptor that represents binary objects in terms of the centres of
maximal inscribed discs. Despite its broad applicability, the medial axis
suffers from sensitivity to noise: minor boundary variations can lead to
disproportionately large and undesirable expansions of the skeleton. Classical
pruning methods mitigate this shortcoming by systematically removing extraneous
skeletal branches. This sequential simplification of skeletons resembles the
principle of sparsification scale-spaces that embed images into a family of
reconstructions from increasingly sparse pixel representations.
  We combine both worlds by introducing skeletonisation scale-spaces: They
leverage sparsification of the medial axis to achieve hierarchical
simplification of shapes. Unlike conventional pruning, our framework inherently
satisfies key scale-space properties such as hierarchical architecture,
controllable simplification, and equivariance to geometric transformations. We
provide a rigorous theoretical foundation in both continuous and discrete
formulations and extend the concept further with densification. This allows
inverse progression from coarse to fine scales and can even reach beyond the
original skeleton to produce overcomplete shape representations with relevancy
for practical applications.
  Through proof-of-concept experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our
framework for practical tasks including robust skeletonisation, shape
compression, and stiffness enhancement for additive manufacturing.

### [24] [Downscaling climate projections to 1 km with single-image super resolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21399)
*Petr Košťál,Pavel Kordík,Ondřej Podsztavek*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Single-image super-resolution can downscale climate projections from coarse to 1-km using high-res observational data for training, with a climate-indicator-based assessment to validate without ground-truth high-res data; demonstrated on daily mean temperature.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-resolution local climate projections are essential for decision-making, but available projections are low-resolution. Training data at high resolution is unavailable for climate projections, so novel downscaling via SR models trained on observations is proposed to improve spatial detail.

Method: Train single-image super-resolution models on high-resolution observational gridded data and apply them to low-resolution climate projections to obtain 1-km outputs. Use a climate-indicator-based assessment by computing observed climate indices at stations to evaluate downscaled projections in the absence of ground-truth high-resolution projections.

Result: Experiments on daily mean temperature show that SR-based downscaling can downscale climate projections from low to 1-km without increasing the error of climate indicators compared to using low-resolution projections.

Conclusion: Single-image SR-based downscaling is a viable, data-efficient approach to produce high-resolution climate projections for local decision-making, preserving climate-indicator fidelity without requiring ground-truth high-resolution climate data.

Abstract: High-resolution climate projections are essential for local decision-making.
However, available climate projections have low spatial resolution (e.g. 12.5
km), which limits their usability. We address this limitation by leveraging
single-image super-resolution models to statistically downscale climate
projections to 1-km resolution. Since high-resolution climate projections are
unavailable for training, we train models on a high-resolution observational
gridded data set and apply them to low-resolution climate projections. We
propose a climate indicator-based assessment using observed climate indices
computed at weather station locations to evaluate the downscaled climate
projections without ground-truth high-resolution climate projections.
Experiments on daily mean temperature demonstrate that single-image
super-resolution models can downscale climate projections without increasing
the error of climate indicators compared to low-resolution climate projections.

### [25] [JaiLIP: Jailbreaking Vision-Language Models via Loss Guided Image Perturbation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21401)
*Md Jueal Mia,M. Hadi Amini*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A loss-guided image perturbation jailbreaking attack (JaiLIP) for vision-language models that jointly optimizes image similarity (MSE) with a harmful-output loss to produce highly effective, imperceptible adversarial images; validated with toxicity metrics (Perspective API, Detoxify) and extended to transportation domain, highlighting defense needs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Safety and alignment concerns for vision-language models (VLMs) amid jailbreak vectors. Image-space perturbations can cause toxic or harmful outputs; existing jailbreaks often yield unstable or visibly perturbed results, underscoring the need for effective, stealthy attacks to evaluate defenses.

Method: JaiLIP introduces a joint objective that minimizes the MSE distance between clean and adversarial images while maximizing a harmful-output loss. Toxicity is assessed with Perspective API and Detoxify; experiments on VLMs demonstrate improved toxicity induction and imperceptibility over baselines; additional domain test in transportation shows practical applicability beyond toxic text.

Result: The attack produces highly effective and visually imperceptible adversarial images, surpassing existing methods in inducing toxicity. It also proves practicality in a transportation domain, illustrating broader attack surface.

Conclusion: Image-based jailbreaks pose substantial practical challenges for VLM safety; robust defenses are needed to mitigate imperceptible perturbations that exploit model toxicity pathways.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have remarkable abilities in generating
multimodal reasoning tasks. However, potential misuse or safety alignment
concerns of VLMs have increased significantly due to different categories of
attack vectors. Among various attack vectors, recent studies have demonstrated
that image-based perturbations are particularly effective in generating harmful
outputs. In the literature, many existing techniques have been proposed to
jailbreak VLMs, leading to unstable performance and visible perturbations. In
this study, we propose Jailbreaking with Loss-guided Image Perturbation
(JaiLIP), a jailbreaking attack in the image space that minimizes a joint
objective combining the mean squared error (MSE) loss between clean and
adversarial image with the models harmful-output loss. We evaluate our proposed
method on VLMs using standard toxicity metrics from Perspective API and
Detoxify. Experimental results demonstrate that our method generates highly
effective and imperceptible adversarial images, outperforming existing methods
in producing toxicity. Moreover, we have evaluated our method in the
transportation domain to demonstrate the attacks practicality beyond toxic text
generation in specific domain. Our findings emphasize the practical challenges
of image-based jailbreak attacks and the need for efficient defense mechanisms
for VLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantify uncertainty in automated identifications and benchmark AI vs human expertise to gauge how close AI is to human-level capabilities and to understand how experts validate visual/audio observations.

Method: Analysis of the LifeCLEF 2018 ExpertCLEF challenge: 19 deep-learning systems from 4 teams were evaluated against 9 expert botanists (French flora); the paper describes resources, approaches, systems, and provides analysis of outcomes.

Result: State-of-the-art deep learning models perform close to the most advanced human expertise, as demonstrated by the challenge results and accompanying analyses.

Conclusion: AI-assisted plant/animal identification has advanced toward expert-level performance; the challenge provides valuable benchmarks and resources for ongoing assessment and highlights remaining gaps and future work.

Abstract: Automated identification of plants and animals has improved considerably in
the last few years, in particular thanks to the recent advances in deep
learning. The next big question is how far such automated systems are from the
human expertise. Indeed, even the best experts are sometimes confused and/or
disagree between each others when validating visual or audio observations of
living organism. A picture actually contains only a partial information that is
usually not sufficient to determine the right species with certainty.
Quantifying this uncertainty and comparing it to the performance of automated
systems is of high interest for both computer scientists and expert
naturalists. The LifeCLEF 2018 ExpertCLEF challenge presented in this paper was
designed to allow this comparison between human experts and automated systems.
In total, 19 deep-learning systems implemented by 4 different research teams
were evaluated with regard to 9 expert botanists of the French flora. The main
outcome of this work is that the performance of state-of-the-art deep learning
models is now close to the most advanced human expertise. This paper presents
more precisely the resources and assessments of the challenge, summarizes the
approaches and systems employed by the participating research groups, and
provides an analysis of the main outcomes.

TL;DR: QuadGPT is the first autoregressive, end-to-end quad-mesh generator with unified tokenization for mixed topology and RL fine-tuning (tDPO), outperforming triangle-to-quad pipelines in geometry and topology.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing quad meshes are often produced by converting triangles, resulting in poor topology; there is a need for native quad-mesh generation with better topology and quality.

Method: An autoregressive model that directly generates quad meshes; introduces a unified tokenization to handle triangles and quads; fine-tunes with topology-aware reinforcement learning (tDPO).

Result: QuadGPT significantly surpasses triangle-to-quad conversion pipelines in geometric accuracy and topological quality; establishes a new benchmark for native quad-mesh generation.

Conclusion: Validates the viability of native quad-mesh generation via large autoregressive models with topology-aware RL refinement for high-quality structured 3D assets.

Abstract: The generation of quadrilateral-dominant meshes is a cornerstone of
professional 3D content creation. However, existing generative models generate
quad meshes by first generating triangle meshes and then merging triangles into
quadrilaterals with some specific rules, which typically produces quad meshes
with poor topology. In this paper, we introduce QuadGPT, the first
autoregressive framework for generating quadrilateral meshes in an end-to-end
manner. QuadGPT formulates this as a sequence prediction paradigm,
distinguished by two key innovations: a unified tokenization method to handle
mixed topologies of triangles and quadrilaterals, and a specialized
Reinforcement Learning fine-tuning method tDPO for better generation quality.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that QuadGPT significantly surpasses previous
triangle-to-quad conversion pipelines in both geometric accuracy and
topological quality. Our work establishes a new benchmark for native quad-mesh
generation and showcases the power of combining large-scale autoregressive
models with topology-aware RL refinement for creating structured 3D assets.

### [28] [DyME: Dynamic Multi-Concept Erasure in Diffusion Models with Bi-Level Orthogonal LoRA Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21433)
*Jiaqi Liu,Lan Zhang,Xiaoyong Yuan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DyME enables on-demand, modular erasure for text-to-image diffusion models using concept-specific LoRA adapters with bi-level orthogonality constraints, allowing flexible multi-concept erasure with less collateral damage and scalable inference-time composition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current static erasure methods require a single fine-tuned checkpoint to erase many concepts, leading to degraded erasure effectiveness and collateral loss at inference time. Real-world usage demands selectively erasing varying concepts per generation.

Method: Train lightweight, concept-specific LoRA adapters; dynamically compose only the needed adapters at inference. Apply bi-level orthogonality constraints at feature and parameter levels to disentangle representation shifts and enforce orthogonal adapter subspaces. Introduce ErasureBench-H benchmark to evaluate erasure across semantic granularity and erasure set size.

Result: DyME consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving higher multi-concept erasure fidelity with minimal collateral degradation on ErasureBench-H and standard datasets (e.g., CIFAR-100, Imagenette).

Conclusion: On-demand, modular erasure via concept-specific adapters with bi-level orthogonality is effective for scalable, flexible erasure in diffusion models; ErasureBench-H provides a principled evaluation framework and demonstrates practical gains.

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models (DMs) inadvertently reproduce copyrighted
styles and protected visual concepts, raising legal and ethical concerns.
Concept erasure has emerged as a safeguard, aiming to selectively suppress such
concepts through fine-tuning. However, existing methods do not scale to
practical settings where providers must erase multiple and possibly conflicting
concepts. The core bottleneck is their reliance on static erasure: a single
checkpoint is fine-tuned to remove all target concepts, regardless of the
actual erasure needs at inference. This rigid design mismatches real-world
usage, where requests vary per generation, leading to degraded erasure success
and reduced fidelity for non-target content. We propose DyME, an on-demand
erasure framework that trains lightweight, concept-specific LoRA adapters and
dynamically composes only those needed at inference. This modular design
enables flexible multi-concept erasure, but naive composition causes
interference among adapters, especially when many or semantically related
concepts are suppressed. To overcome this, we introduce bi-level orthogonality
constraints at both the feature and parameter levels, disentangling
representation shifts and enforcing orthogonal adapter subspaces. We further
develop ErasureBench-H, a new hierarchical benchmark with
brand-series-character structure, enabling principled evaluation across
semantic granularities and erasure set sizes. Experiments on ErasureBench-H and
standard datasets (e.g., CIFAR-100, Imagenette) demonstrate that DyME
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving higher
multi-concept erasure fidelity with minimal collateral degradation.

### [29] [VideoJudge: Bootstrapping Enables Scalable Supervision of MLLM-as-a-Judge for Video Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21451)
*Abdul Waheed,Zhen Wu,Dareen Alharthi,Seungone Kim,Bhiksha Raj*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VideoJudge is a 3B/7B multimodal LLM judge for video understanding that uses a generator-evaluator training loop; the 7B variant beats larger MLLM judges on several meta-evaluation benchmarks; video inputs are essential, while larger LLMs underperform and chain-of-thought helps little.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Evaluating video understanding is hard with traditional text-based metrics, which miss fine-grained human judgments and are costly to obtain manually. While LLM-based evaluators have been explored, their extension to video understanding is underexplored; there is a need for a dedicated multimodal judge that ingests video stimuli.

Method: Develop VideoJudge in 3B and 7B sizes. Train via a generator-evaluator interplay: the generator produces responses conditioned on a target rating; responses that don\'t match the evaluator\'s rating are discarded, shaping the evaluator\'s guidance. Evaluate on meta-evaluation benchmarks against larger MLLMs (e.g., Qwen2.5-VL 32B/72B) and LLMs (Qwen3).

Result: VideoJudge-7B outperforms larger MLLM judge baselines on three of four meta-evaluation benchmarks (e.g., surpassing Qwen2.5-VL at 32B/72B). LLM judges (Qwen3) perform worse than MLLMs (Qwen2.5-VL), and adding long chain-of-thought does not improve performance, highlighting that integrating video inputs is crucial for evaluating video understanding tasks.

Conclusion: Multimodal judges with video grounding can surpass larger text-only or non-video baselines for video evaluation. The generator-evaluator training setup is effective, and video conditioning is more impactful than sheer model size or chain-of-thought reasoning. Further work could explore broader benchmarks and additional modalities.

Abstract: Precisely evaluating video understanding models remains challenging: commonly
used metrics such as BLEU, ROUGE, and BERTScore fail to capture the fineness of
human judgment, while obtaining such judgments through manual evaluation is
costly. Recent work has explored using large language models (LLMs) or
multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) as evaluators, but their extension to video
understanding remains relatively unexplored. In this work, we introduce
VideoJudge, a 3B and 7B-sized MLLM judge specialized to evaluate outputs from
video understanding models (\textit{i.e.}, text responses conditioned on
videos). To train VideoJudge, our recipe builds on the interplay between a
generator and an evaluator: the generator is prompted to produce responses
conditioned on a target rating, and responses not matching the evaluator's
rating are discarded. Across three out of four meta-evaluation benchmarks,
VideoJudge-7B outperforms larger MLLM judge baselines such as Qwen2.5-VL (32B
and 72B). Notably, we find that LLM judges (Qwen3) models perform worse than
MLLM judges (Qwen2.5-VL) and long chain-of-thought reasoning does not improve
performance, indicating that providing video inputs is crucial for evaluation
of video understanding tasks.

### [30] [Residual Vector Quantization For Communication-Efficient Multi-Agent Perception](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21464)
*Dereje Shenkut,B. V. K Vijaya Kumar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A learned feature codec (ReVQom) compresses intermediate features for multi-agent collaborative perception, preserving spatial identity while greatly reducing bandwidth with minimal accuracy loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bandwidth constraints hinder scalable multi-agent collaborative perception. There is a need to compress feature representations efficiently without destroying spatial information critical for scene understanding.

Method: End-to-end feature encoding using a simple bottleneck network followed by multi-stage residual vector quantization (RVQ). Compresses per-pixel feature indices (code indices) rather than full floating-point features, drastically reducing payload while aiming to retain perceptual utility for CP.

Result: On DAIR-V2X real-world CP data, ReVQom achieves 273x to 1365x compression across 30 bpp to 6 bpp. At 18 bpp (455x), it matches or exceeds raw-feature CP. At 6–12 bpp, it enables ultra-low-bandwidth operation with graceful degradation, enabling practical V2X deployment.

Conclusion: Efficient, accurate multi-agent CP is feasible with a learned feature codec like ReVQom, offering substantial bandwidth savings with controllable accuracy loss and guiding toward real-world V2X deployment.

Abstract: Multi-agent collaborative perception (CP) improves scene understanding by
sharing information across connected agents such as autonomous vehicles,
unmanned aerial vehicles, and robots. Communication bandwidth, however,
constrains scalability. We present ReVQom, a learned feature codec that
preserves spatial identity while compressing intermediate features. ReVQom is
an end-to-end method that compresses feature dimensions via a simple bottleneck
network followed by multi-stage residual vector quantization (RVQ). This allows
only per-pixel code indices to be transmitted, reducing payloads from 8192 bits
per pixel (bpp) of uncompressed 32-bit float features to 6-30 bpp per agent
with minimal accuracy loss. On DAIR-V2X real-world CP dataset, ReVQom achieves
273x compression at 30 bpp to 1365x compression at 6 bpp. At 18 bpp (455x),
ReVQom matches or outperforms raw-feature CP, and at 6-12 bpp it enables
ultra-low-bandwidth operation with graceful degradation. ReVQom allows
efficient and accurate multi-agent collaborative perception with a step toward
practical V2X deployment.

### [31] [Gender Stereotypes in Professional Roles Among Saudis: An Analytical Study of AI-Generated Images Using Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21466)
*Khaloud S. AlKhalifah,Malak Mashaabi,Hend Al-Khalifa*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A study assesses gender stereotypes and cultural inaccuracies in AI-generated depictions of Saudi professionals using 1,006 images from three models; finds strong gender bias (DALL-E V3 most male-skewed) and cultural misrepresentations across clothing, settings, and activities; argues biases reflect training data and calls for diverse data and culturally aware evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine whether contemporary text-to-image AI models propagate gender stereotypes and cultural inaccuracies when depicting professionals in Saudi Arabia, with implications for fair representation and workforce perceptions.

Method: Analyzed 1,006 images produced by ImageFX, DALL-E V3, and Grok for 56 Saudi professions using neutral prompts. Two trained Saudi annotators evaluated each image on five dimensions (perceived gender, clothing/appearance, background/setting, activities/interactions, age). A third senior researcher adjudicated disagreements, yielding 10,100 judgments.

Result: Findings show a strong gender imbalance: ImageFX 85% male, Grok 86.6% male, DALL-E V3 96% male, with the strongest stereotyping in leadership and technical roles. Cultural inaccuracies in clothing, settings, and activities were common across models. Counter-stereotypical images arose mainly from cultural misinterpretations, not progressive portrayals.

Conclusion: Current models mirror societal biases in training data, offering limited reflection of Saudi labor market gender dynamics and cultural nuances. There is a need for more diverse training data, fairer algorithms, and culturally sensitive evaluation frameworks to ensure equitable and authentic outputs.

Abstract: This study investigates the extent to which contemporary Text-to-Image
artificial intelligence (AI) models perpetuate gender stereotypes and cultural
inaccuracies when generating depictions of professionals in Saudi Arabia. We
analyzed 1,006 images produced by ImageFX, DALL-E V3, and Grok for 56 diverse
Saudi professions using neutral prompts. Two trained Saudi annotators evaluated
each image on five dimensions: perceived gender, clothing and appearance,
background and setting, activities and interactions, and age. A third senior
researcher adjudicated whenever the two primary raters disagreed, yielding
10,100 individual judgements. The results reveal a strong gender imbalance,
with ImageFX outputs being 85\% male, Grok 86.6\% male, and DALL-E V3 96\%
male, indicating that DALL-E V3 exhibited the strongest overall gender
stereotyping. This imbalance was most evident in leadership and technical
roles. Moreover, cultural inaccuracies in clothing, settings, and depicted
activities were frequently observed across all three models.
Counter-stereotypical images often arise from cultural misinterpretations
rather than genuinely progressive portrayals. We conclude that current models
mirror societal biases embedded in their training data, generated by humans,
offering only a limited reflection of the Saudi labour market's gender dynamics
and cultural nuances. These findings underscore the urgent need for more
diverse training data, fairer algorithms, and culturally sensitive evaluation
frameworks to ensure equitable and authentic visual outputs.

### [32] [Reasoning-Enhanced Domain-Adaptive Pretraining of Multimodal Large Language Models for Short Video Content Moderation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21486)
*Zixuan Wang,Yu Sun,Hongwei Wang,Baoyu Jing,Xiang Shen,Xin Dong,Zhuolin Hao,Hongyu Xiong,Yang Song*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A unified, reasoning-enhanced multimodal LLM pretraining approach for detecting inappropriate content in short videos, using Caption, VQA, and Chain-of-Thought tasks to improve zero-shot, supervised fine-tuning, and generalization to unseen issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Short video platforms generate diverse, rapidly changing content requiring scalable, cross-issue moderation. Existing methods use separate small models per issue, needing labeled data and lacking cross-issue generalization. A unified, reasoning-enabled MLLM could address distribution shifts and complex, evolving issue definitions.

Method: Propose a reasoning-enhanced multimodal LLM pretraining paradigm with three targeted tasks: (1) Caption to improve video-detail perception, (2) Visual Question Answering (VQA) to align with issue definitions and annotation guidelines, and (3) Chain-of-Thought (CoT) to boost reasoning. The aim is to enable unified inappropriate content detection across multiple issues and generalize to emergent ones.

Result: Experiments show significant improvements in both zero-shot and supervised fine-tuning settings, with strong generalization to emergent, previously unseen issues.

Conclusion: The proposed pretraining strategy yields a unified, more capable MLLM for inappropriate content detection in short videos, enhancing cross-issue generalization and potential for rapid adaptation to new moderation challenges.

Abstract: Short video platforms are evolving rapidly, making the identification of
inappropriate content increasingly critical. Existing approaches typically
train separate and small classification models for each type of issue, which
requires extensive human-labeled data and lacks cross-issue generalization. We
propose a reasoning-enhanced multimodal large language model (MLLM) pretraining
paradigm for unified inappropriate content detection. To address the
distribution gap between short video content and the original pretraining data
of MLLMs, as well as the complex issue definitions, we introduce three targeted
pretraining tasks: (1) \textit{Caption}, to enhance the MLLM's perception of
video details; (2) \textit{Visual Question Answering (VQA)}, to deepen the
MLLM's understanding of issue definitions and annotation guidelines; (3)
\textit{Chain-of-Thought (CoT)}, to enhance the MLLM's reasoning capability.
Experimental results show that our pretraining approach significantly improves
the MLLM's performance in both zero-shot and supervised fine-tuning (SFT)
settings. In addition, our pretrained model demonstrates strong generalization
capabilities to emergent, previously unseen issues.

### [33] [Learning GUI Grounding with Spatial Reasoning from Visual Feedback](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21552)
*Yu Zhao,Wei-Ning Chen,Huseyin Atahan Inan,Samuel Kessler,Lu Wang,Lukas Wutschitz,Fangkai Yang,Chaoyun Zhang,Pasquale Minervini,Saravan Rajmohan,Robert Sim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A new GUI grounding approach that treats grounding as an interactive, cursor-driven search using reinforcement learning, achieving state-of-the-art results on ScreenSpot benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLMs struggle to predict precise numeric GUI coordinates on high-resolution, complex layouts. The paper reframes grounding as an interactive search task to incorporate visual feedback via a moving cursor and improve alignment with UI elements.

Method: An agent iteratively selects target objects, reasons about spatial relations to the cursor, and moves the cursor toward the target. It uses online reinforcement learning with dense, trajectory-based rewards. The system renders the cursor to provide visual feedback and is built on Qwen2.5-VL-7B (GUI-Cursor).

Result: Significant accuracy gains on GUI grounding: ScreenSpot-v2 from 88.8% to 93.9% and ScreenSpot-Pro from 26.8% to 56.5%. The model typically resolves most instances in two steps (95%) and can take more steps on harder cases.

Conclusion: Framing GUI grounding as an interactive search with a cursor and RL yields state-of-the-art performance and efficiency, suggesting broader applicability to complex GUI layouts and heightening robustness to visual noise.

Abstract: Graphical User Interface (GUI) grounding is commonly framed as a coordinate
prediction task -- given a natural language instruction, generate on-screen
coordinates for actions such as clicks and keystrokes. However, recent Vision
Language Models (VLMs) often fail to predict accurate numeric coordinates when
processing high-resolution GUI images with complex layouts. To address this
issue, we reframe GUI grounding as an \emph{interactive search task}, where the
VLM generates actions to move a cursor in the GUI to locate UI elements. At
each step, the model determines the target object, evaluates the spatial
relations between the cursor and the target, and moves the cursor closer to the
target conditioned on the movement history. In this interactive process, the
rendered cursor provides visual feedback to help the model align its
predictions with the corresponding on-screen locations. We train our GUI
grounding model, GUI-Cursor, using multi-step online reinforcement learning
with a dense trajectory-based reward function. Our experimental results show
that GUI-Cursor, based on Qwen2.5-VL-7B, improves the GUI grounding accuracy
and achieves state-of-the-art results on ScreenSpot-v2 ($88.8\% \rightarrow
93.9\%$) and ScreenSpot-Pro ($26.8\% \rightarrow 56.5\%$). Moreover, we observe
that GUI-Cursor learns to solve the problem within two steps for 95\% of
instances and can adaptively conduct more steps on more difficult examples.

### [34] [X-CoT: Explainable Text-to-Video Retrieval via LLM-based Chain-of-Thought Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21559)
*Prasanna Reddy Pulakurthi,Jiamian Wang,Majid Rabbani,Sohail Dianat,Raghuveer Rao,Zhiqiang Tao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: X-CoT introduces an explainable text-to-video retrieval framework that uses LLM-based chain-of-thought reasoning instead of embedding-based cosine similarity. It augments benchmarks with more video annotations and uses pairwise comparison steps to yield detailed, transparent ranking; it improves retrieval performance and enables data-quality analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Embedding-based retrieval with cosine similarity faces two key issues: (1) susceptibility to low-quality text-video pairs that are hard to identify, and (2) lack of interpretability for ranking results. There is a need for interpretable ranking explanations and for diagnosing data quality.

Method: X-CoT replaces embedding-based similarity with an LLM-CoT retrieval process. It includes a retrieval CoT that performs pairwise comparisons to derive a full ranking, expands benchmarks with additional video annotations for semantic understanding and bias reduction, and provides detailed rationales for decisions. Code and data are made available.

Result: Empirically improves retrieval performance and generates detailed rationales, enabling model behavior and data-quality analysis.

Conclusion: X-CoT offers an explainable retrieval framework that enhances ranking interpretability and supports data-quality assessment, with code and data available for reproducibility.

Abstract: Prevalent text-to-video retrieval systems mainly adopt embedding models for
feature extraction and compute cosine similarities for ranking. However, this
design presents two limitations. Low-quality text-video data pairs could
compromise the retrieval, yet are hard to identify and examine. Cosine
similarity alone provides no explanation for the ranking results, limiting the
interpretability. We ask that can we interpret the ranking results, so as to
assess the retrieval models and examine the text-video data? This work proposes
X-CoT, an explainable retrieval framework upon LLM CoT reasoning in place of
the embedding model-based similarity ranking. We first expand the existing
benchmarks with additional video annotations to support semantic understanding
and reduce data bias. We also devise a retrieval CoT consisting of pairwise
comparison steps, yielding detailed reasoning and complete ranking. X-CoT
empirically improves the retrieval performance and produces detailed
rationales. It also facilitates the model behavior and data quality analysis.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A versatile unsupervised defect-detection method tailored for surgical instruments, using background masking, patch-based analysis, and domain adaptation to reliably detect fine-grained defects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual inspection of surgical instruments is error-prone and transferable defect-detection methods trained on non-surgical data underperform due to domain shift, textured backgrounds causing false positives, and poor sensitivity to small defects.

Method: Adapt unsupervised defect-detection methods to the surgical domain by integrating background masking, a patch-based analysis strategy, and efficient domain adaptation to handle instrumentation-specific textures and defects.

Result: The approach overcomes transfer issues and enables reliable detection of fine-grained defects in surgical instrument imagery, addressing false positives and missed small defects.

Conclusion: Domain-adapted, background-aware, patch-based unsupervised defect detection provides a practical and robust solution for surgical instrument quality control.

Abstract: Ensuring the safety of surgical instruments requires reliable detection of
visual defects. However, manual inspection is prone to error, and existing
automated defect detection methods, typically trained on natural/industrial
images, fail to transfer effectively to the surgical domain. We demonstrate
that simply applying or fine-tuning these approaches leads to issues: false
positive detections arising from textured backgrounds, poor sensitivity to
small, subtle defects, and inadequate capture of instrument-specific features
due to domain shift. To address these challenges, we propose a versatile method
that adapts unsupervised defect detection methods specifically for surgical
instruments. By integrating background masking, a patch-based analysis
strategy, and efficient domain adaptation, our method overcomes these
limitations, enabling the reliable detection of fine-grained defects in
surgical instrument imagery.

*Junno Yun,Yaşar Utku Alçalar,Mehmet Akçakaya*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: We propose Linear SEParability (LSEP) regularization for diffusion model training that yields better internal representations without relying on large external encoders, improving training efficiency and generation quality (FID 1.46 on 256x256 ImageNet).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving discriminative feature representations in diffusion models is beneficial, and prior alignment methods rely on large pretrained encoders which are computationally expensive.

Method: Introduce LSEP regularization that enforces linear separability of intermediate layer representations during training, integrating linear probing into learning dynamics without external representation alignment.

Result: Significant gains in training efficiency and image quality on flow-based transformer architectures (e.g., SiTs), achieving an FID of 1.46 on 256x256 ImageNet.

Conclusion: LSEP regularization offers an encoder-free path to improved representation quality and training efficiency, potentially broadening the practicality of high-quality diffusion models.

Abstract: Efficient training strategies for large-scale diffusion models have recently
emphasized the importance of improving discriminative feature representations
in these models. A central line of work in this direction is representation
alignment with features obtained from powerful external encoders, which
improves the representation quality as assessed through linear probing.
Alignment-based approaches show promise but depend on large pretrained
encoders, which are computationally expensive to obtain. In this work, we
propose an alternative regularization for training, based on promoting the
Linear SEParability (LSEP) of intermediate layer representations. LSEP
eliminates the need for an auxiliary encoder and representation alignment,
while incorporating linear probing directly into the network's learning
dynamics rather than treating it as a simple post-hoc evaluation tool. Our
results demonstrate substantial improvements in both training efficiency and
generation quality on flow-based transformer architectures such as SiTs,
achieving an FID of 1.46 on $256 \times 256$ ImageNet dataset.

### [37] [Enhancing Contrastive Learning for Geolocalization by Discovering Hard Negatives on Semivariograms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21573)
*Boyi Chen,Zhangyu Wang,Fabian Deuser,Johann Maximilian Zollner,Martin Werner*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A spatially regularized contrastive learning approach for image geo-localization that uses semivariograms to encode geographic spatial dependencies, improving fine-grained localization by better handling false negatives and hard negatives in GeoCLIP on OSV5M.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Contrastive alignment of street-view images and locations ignores spatial correlation, leading to false negatives (visually similar but geographically close) and weak handling of hard negatives (visually similar yet far apart). Incorporating spatial priors could constrain learning to geographic structure and reduce such errors.

Method: Fit a semivariogram by mapping feature-space distances between image pairs to their geographic distances, capturing how visual content correlates with distance. Use the semantic of the semivariogram to define expected visual dissimilarity at a given spatial distance, identifying hard negatives and false negatives. Integrate this spatial regularization into the GeoCLIP framework.

Result: The proposed spatially regularized contrastive learning improves image-based geo-localization performance, with notable gains at finer-grained localization on the OSV5M dataset.

Conclusion: Modeling spatial priors via a semivariogram enhances geo-localization by better handling negative samples and leveraging geographic dependencies, particularly for fine-grained localization.

Abstract: Accurate and robust image-based geo-localization at a global scale is
challenging due to diverse environments, visually ambiguous scenes, and the
lack of distinctive landmarks in many regions. While contrastive learning
methods show promising performance by aligning features between street-view
images and corresponding locations, they neglect the underlying spatial
dependency in the geographic space. As a result, they fail to address the issue
of false negatives -- image pairs that are both visually and geographically
similar but labeled as negatives, and struggle to effectively distinguish hard
negatives, which are visually similar but geographically distant. To address
this issue, we propose a novel spatially regularized contrastive learning
strategy that integrates a semivariogram, which is a geostatistical tool for
modeling how spatial correlation changes with distance. We fit the
semivariogram by relating the distance of images in feature space to their
geographical distance, capturing the expected visual content in a spatial
correlation. With the fitted semivariogram, we define the expected visual
dissimilarity at a given spatial distance as reference to identify hard
negatives and false negatives. We integrate this strategy into GeoCLIP and
evaluate it on the OSV5M dataset, demonstrating that explicitly modeling
spatial priors improves image-based geo-localization performance, particularly
at finer granularity.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: X-Streamer is a real-time, end-to-end multimodal framework that turns a single portrait into an interactive digital human agent, using a Thinker–Actor dual-transformer architecture to unify text, speech, and video generation in one model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable persistent, open-ended, multimodal interactions with digital humans by unifying perception, reasoning, and generation across text, speech, and vision, and by achieving long-horizon stability for real-time conversations.

Method: Thinker: a pretrained large language–speech model that perceives and reason over streaming inputs. Actor: a chunk-wise autoregressive diffusion model that cross-attends to the Thinker's hidden states to produce time-aligned multimodal outputs (text, audio, and video latent streams). The system uses inter- and intra-chunk attention with time-aligned multimodal positional embeddings, diffusion forcing, and global identity referencing to maintain consistency. It runs in real time on two A100 GPUs, enabling hours-long, portrait-based video chats.

Result: A demonstration-ready pipeline that sustains real-time, hours-long video chat experiences from arbitrary portraits, with synchronized multimodal outputs driven by streaming inputs.

Conclusion: X-Streamer presents a unified world-modeling approach for interactive digital humans, showing promise for scalable, real-time multimodal agents and paving the way toward persistent, identity-consistent audiovisual interactions.

Abstract: We introduce X-Streamer, an end-to-end multimodal human world modeling
framework for building digital human agents capable of infinite interactions
across text, speech, and video within a single unified architecture. Starting
from a single portrait, X-Streamer enables real-time, open-ended video calls
driven by streaming multimodal inputs. At its core is a Thinker-Actor
dual-transformer architecture that unifies multimodal understanding and
generation, turning a static portrait into persistent and intelligent
audiovisual interactions. The Thinker module perceives and reasons over
streaming user inputs, while its hidden states are translated by the Actor into
synchronized multimodal streams in real time. Concretely, the Thinker leverages
a pretrained large language-speech model, while the Actor employs a chunk-wise
autoregressive diffusion model that cross-attends to the Thinker's hidden
states to produce time-aligned multimodal responses with interleaved discrete
text and audio tokens and continuous video latents. To ensure long-horizon
stability, we design inter- and intra-chunk attentions with time-aligned
multimodal positional embeddings for fine-grained cross-modality alignment and
context retention, further reinforced by chunk-wise diffusion forcing and
global identity referencing. X-Streamer runs in real time on two A100 GPUs,
sustaining hours-long consistent video chat experiences from arbitrary
portraits and paving the way toward unified world modeling of interactive
digital humans.

*Gabrijel Boduljak,Laurynas Karazija,Iro Laina,Christian Rupprecht,Andrea Vedaldi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Motion forecasting from a single image by generating dense trajectory grids instead of pixels; outperforms prior methods and highlights limitations of pixel-based video models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enable planning and reasoning about future object motion when only a static frame is available, addressing uncertainty and scene-wide dynamics.

Method: Adapt a modern video-generation architecture to output dense motion trajectories conditional on a single image, producing probabilistic, diverse trajectories; evaluate on simulated data, robotics tasks, and intuitive physics datasets; compare against regressors and pixel-based video models.

Result: More accurate and diverse motion predictions than prior methods; demonstrated usefulness in robotics and real-world datasets; revealed that pixel-focused video generators struggle with motion forecasting due to overhead of generating pixels.

Conclusion: Direct motion-trajectory modeling is preferable for single-image forecasting; reducing pixel generation overhead improves motion forecast accuracy and diversity; underscores the gap between world-model video generators and true motion forecasting.

Abstract: We consider the problem of forecasting motion from a single image, i.e.,
predicting how objects in the world are likely to move, without the ability to
observe other parameters such as the object velocities or the forces applied to
them. We formulate this task as conditional generation of dense trajectory
grids with a model that closely follows the architecture of modern video
generators but outputs motion trajectories instead of pixels. This approach
captures scene-wide dynamics and uncertainty, yielding more accurate and
diverse predictions than prior regressors and generators. We extensively
evaluate our method on simulated data, demonstrate its effectiveness on
downstream applications such as robotics, and show promising accuracy on
real-world intuitive physics datasets. Although recent state-of-the-art video
generators are often regarded as world models, we show that they struggle with
forecasting motion from a single image, even in simple physical scenarios such
as falling blocks or mechanical object interactions, despite fine-tuning on
such data. We show that this limitation arises from the overhead of generating
pixels rather than directly modeling motion.

### [40] [Temporal vs. Spatial: Comparing DINOv3 and V-JEPA2 Feature Representations for Video Action Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21595)
*Sai Varun Kodathala,Rakesh Vunnam*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A comparative study of two self-supervised video feature extractors, DINOv3 (spatial frame-wise) and V-JEPA2 (temporal), on UCF Sports. DINOv3 excels in clustering and pose-focused discrimination; V-JEPA2 offers more consistent performance with lower variance across action types. The work highlights architectural trade-offs and offers guidance on method choice based on task needs and reliability constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To empirically compare two leading self-supervised video representations (DINOv3 and V-JEPA2) to understand how architectural differences—frame-wise spatial processing vs joint temporal modeling—impact feature quality and task reliability, informing method selection for video analysis tasks.

Method: Evaluate DINOv3 and V-JEPA2 on the UCF Sports dataset. Assess feature quality across metrics including classification accuracy, clustering (Silhouette score), intra-class consistency, inter-class discrimination, and action-specific performance to identify strengths and weaknesses of each architecture (DINOv3: frame-wise spatial features; V-JEPA2: joint temporal modeling).

Result: DINOv3 achieves superior clustering performance (Silhouette score 0.31 vs 0.21) and shows strong discrimination for pose-identifiable actions (6.16x separation). V-JEPA2 demonstrates consistent reliability across all action types with lower performance variance (0.094 vs 0.288). Action-specific results indicate DINOv3 excels at static pose recognition, while V-JEPA2 provides balanced representations for motion-dependent actions, yielding lower variance across the action spectrum.

Conclusion: The study clarifies architectural trade-offs between spatial-focused and temporally grounded video representations. It provides empirical guidance for selecting feature extraction methods based on task requirements (pose/static vs motion-rich actions) and reliability constraints, aiding design decisions in video analysis systems.

Abstract: This study presents a comprehensive comparative analysis of two prominent
self-supervised learning architectures for video action recognition: DINOv3,
which processes frames independently through spatial feature extraction, and
V-JEPA2, which employs joint temporal modeling across video sequences. We
evaluate both approaches on the UCF Sports dataset, examining feature quality
through multiple dimensions including classification accuracy, clustering
performance, intra-class consistency, and inter-class discrimination. Our
analysis reveals fundamental architectural trade-offs: DINOv3 achieves superior
clustering performance (Silhouette score: 0.31 vs 0.21) and demonstrates
exceptional discrimination capability (6.16x separation ratio) particularly for
pose-identifiable actions, while V-JEPA2 exhibits consistent reliability across
all action types with significantly lower performance variance (0.094 vs
0.288). Through action-specific evaluation, we identify that DINOv3's spatial
processing architecture excels at static pose recognition but shows degraded
performance on motion-dependent actions, whereas V-JEPA2's temporal modeling
provides balanced representation quality across diverse action categories.
These findings contribute to the understanding of architectural design choices
in video analysis systems and provide empirical guidance for selecting
appropriate feature extraction methods based on task requirements and
reliability constraints.

*Md. Mahfuzur Rahman,Kishor Datta Gupta,Marufa Kamal,Fahad Rahman,Sunzida Siddique,Ahmed Rafi Hasan,Mohd Ariful Haque,Roy George*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A multimodal vision-language system (VLCE) that creates thorough, context-rich explanations of disaster imagery from satellite and UAV data, using dual architectures and external knowledge to outperform baseline vision-language models on description quality while maintaining solid semantic alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Natural catastrophes demand rapid, actionable damage assessment. Traditional hand evaluations are slow and risky; existing CV methods mostly produce labels or masks, not full contextual explanations. VLCE aims to automate generation of informative, situation-aware descriptions to support decision-making.

Method: Two-model architecture: (1) CNN-LSTM with ResNet50 backbone pretrained on EuroSat for the xBD satellite dataset; (2) Vision Transformer (ViT) pretrained on UAV imagery for the RescueNet dataset. External semantic knowledge from ConceptNet and WordNet expands vocabulary and improves description accuracy. Evaluated against leading V+L models (LLaVA, QwenVL) using CLIPScore (semantic alignment) and InfoMetIC (caption informativeness).

Result: VLCE substantially outperforms baselines, achieving up to 95.33% InfoMetIC and maintaining competitive CLIPScore, demonstrating strong, information-dense, context-aware descriptions for disaster imagery.

Conclusion: VLCE demonstrates the promise of a dual-architecture, knowledge-enhanced V+L system for disaster damage assessment, enabling automated generation of actionable, information-rich explanations from satellite and drone imagery; future work could broaden datasets, refine integration, and assess deployment in real-time triage workflows.

Abstract: Immediate damage assessment is essential after natural catastrophes; yet,
conventional hand evaluation techniques are sluggish and perilous. Although
satellite and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) photos offer extensive perspectives
of impacted regions, current computer vision methodologies generally yield just
classification labels or segmentation masks, so constraining their capacity to
deliver a thorough situational comprehension. We introduce the Vision Language
Caption Enhancer (VLCE), a multimodal system designed to produce comprehensive,
contextually-informed explanations of disaster imagery. VLCE employs a
dual-architecture approach: a CNN-LSTM model with a ResNet50 backbone
pretrained on EuroSat satellite imagery for the xBD dataset, and a Vision
Transformer (ViT) model pretrained on UAV pictures for the RescueNet dataset.
Both systems utilize external semantic knowledge from ConceptNet and WordNet to
expand vocabulary coverage and improve description accuracy. We assess VLCE in
comparison to leading vision-language models (LLaVA and QwenVL) utilizing
CLIPScore for semantic alignment and InfoMetIC for caption informativeness.
Experimental findings indicate that VLCE markedly surpasses baseline models,
attaining a maximum of 95.33% on InfoMetIC while preserving competitive
semantic alignment. Our dual-architecture system demonstrates significant
potential for improving disaster damage assessment by automating the production
of actionable, information-dense descriptions from satellite and drone photos.

### [42] [A Data-driven Typology of Vision Models from Integrated Representational Metrics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21628)
*Jialin Wu,Shreya Saha,Yiqing Bo,Meenakshi Khosla*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A multi-metric, fusion-based framework shows architecture and training objectives jointly shape representations; geometry/tuning carry family-specific signatures while linearly decodable information is more shared; Similarity Network Fusion (SNF) yields sharper family separation and robust composite signatures, revealing meaningful clusters across model families.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To identify which aspects of representations are shared across large vision model families and which reflect distinctive computational strategies, given diverse architectures and training paradigms.

Method: Compute a suite of representational similarity metrics capturing geometry, unit tuning, and linear decodability (e.g., RSA, Soft Matching, etc.); apply Similarity Network Fusion (SNF) to integrate metrics into a single fused similarity matrix; cluster the fused matrix to reveal model-family structure; compare patterns across supervised vs. self-supervised models and across architectural categories (ResNets, ViTs, ConvNets, hybrids).

Result: Geometry- and tuning-preserving metrics strongly discriminate model families, while linear decodability metrics show weaker separation. SNF produces substantially sharper family separation than any single metric and yields robust composite signatures. Clustering reveals distinct groups for supervised ResNets and ViTs; all self-supervised models group together across architectures; hybrid architectures cluster with MAEs, indicating convergence between architectural modernization and reconstruction-based training.

Conclusion: A biology-inspired integrative framework provides a principled typology of vision models, showing that emergent computational strategies shaped by architecture and training objective define representational structure beyond surface design. The fused, multi-facet signatures offer robust and interpretable insights into model families and their convergence patterns.

Abstract: Large vision models differ widely in architecture and training paradigm, yet
we lack principled methods to determine which aspects of their representations
are shared across families and which reflect distinctive computational
strategies. We leverage a suite of representational similarity metrics, each
capturing a different facet-geometry, unit tuning, or linear decodability-and
assess family separability using multiple complementary measures. Metrics
preserving geometry or tuning (e.g., RSA, Soft Matching) yield strong family
discrimination, whereas flexible mappings such as Linear Predictivity show
weaker separation. These findings indicate that geometry and tuning carry
family-specific signatures, while linearly decodable information is more
broadly shared. To integrate these complementary facets, we adapt Similarity
Network Fusion (SNF), a method inspired by multi-omics integration. SNF
achieves substantially sharper family separation than any individual metric and
produces robust composite signatures. Clustering of the fused similarity matrix
recovers both expected and surprising patterns: supervised ResNets and ViTs
form distinct clusters, yet all self-supervised models group together across
architectural boundaries. Hybrid architectures (ConvNeXt, Swin) cluster with
masked autoencoders, suggesting convergence between architectural modernization
and reconstruction-based training. This biology-inspired framework provides a
principled typology of vision models, showing that emergent computational
strategies-shaped jointly by architecture and training objective-define
representational structure beyond surface design categories.

*Yixiang Dai,Fan Jiang,Chiyu Wang,Mu Xu,Yonggang Qi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FantasyWorld adds a trainable geometric branch to frozen video foundation models to jointly model video latents and an implicit 3D field, enabling 3D-aware video generation with cross-branch supervision and improved 3D reasoning without per-scene fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D grounding is missing in current video foundation models, limiting spatial consistency and 3D task performance such as view synthesis and navigation; a geometry-aware representation could bridge video imagination and 3D perception.

Method: Introduce FantasyWorld, a geometry-enhanced framework with a trainable geometric branch added to a frozen video foundation model, enabling joint learning of video latents and an implicit 3D field in a single forward pass. Use cross-branch supervision where geometry cues guide video generation and video priors regularize 3D prediction; unified backbone with cross-branch information exchange.

Result: Empirically outperforms recent geometry-consistent baselines in multi-view coherence and style consistency; ablations indicate gains stem from unified backbone and cross-branch exchange; latents from the geometric branch show promise for downstream 3D tasks such as novel view synthesis and navigation without per-scene optimization.

Conclusion: FantasyWorld effectively bridges video imagination and 3D perception, yielding consistent, generalizable 3D-aware video representations suitable for downstream 3D tasks, reducing the need for per-scene optimization.

Abstract: High-quality 3D world models are pivotal for embodied intelligence and
Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), underpinning applications such as AR/VR
content creation and robotic navigation. Despite the established strong
imaginative priors, current video foundation models lack explicit 3D grounding
capabilities, thus being limited in both spatial consistency and their utility
for downstream 3D reasoning tasks. In this work, we present FantasyWorld, a
geometry-enhanced framework that augments frozen video foundation models with a
trainable geometric branch, enabling joint modeling of video latents and an
implicit 3D field in a single forward pass. Our approach introduces
cross-branch supervision, where geometry cues guide video generation and video
priors regularize 3D prediction, thus yielding consistent and generalizable
3D-aware video representations. Notably, the resulting latents from the
geometric branch can potentially serve as versatile representations for
downstream 3D tasks such as novel view synthesis and navigation, without
requiring per-scene optimization or fine-tuning. Extensive experiments show
that FantasyWorld effectively bridges video imagination and 3D perception,
outperforming recent geometry-consistent baselines in multi-view coherence and
style consistency. Ablation studies further confirm that these gains stem from
the unified backbone and cross-branch information exchange.

### [44] [MORPH: Shape-agnostic PDE Foundation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21670)
*Mahindra Singh Rautela,Alexander Most,Siddharth Mansingh,Bradley C. Love,Ayan Biswas,Diane Oyen,Earl Lawrence*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MORPH is a shape-agnostic autoregressive foundation model for PDEs that handles 1D–3D heterogeneous, multi-field data via component-wise conv, inter-field cross-attention, and axial attention; pretrained on diverse PDE data and achieves strong transfer with full fine-tuning and LoRA, rivaling or surpassing state-of-the-art.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need for scalable, data-efficient foundation models that can learn from heterogeneous, multimodal scientific observations and operate across varying spatial/temporal dimensions and resolutions.

Method: A convolutional vision transformer backbone with (i) component-wise convolution to jointly process scalar and vector channels, (ii) inter-field cross-attention to propagate information between physical fields, (iii) axial attentions to factorize spatiotemporal self-attention along each axis. Pretraining on diverse PDE datasets; evaluation on downstream tasks; use of full-model fine-tuning and parameter-efficient LoRA adapters for transfer.

Result: MORPH outperforms models trained from scratch in both zero-shot and full-shot settings; matches or surpasses strong baselines and recent state-of-the-art models across extensive evaluations and downstream tasks.

Conclusion: MORPH provides a flexible, scalable backbone for learning from heterogeneous, multimodal scientific observations, enabling data-efficient scientific machine learning across 1D–3D PDE data with mixed scalar/vector fields.

Abstract: We introduce MORPH, a shape-agnostic, autoregressive foundation model for
partial differential equations (PDEs). MORPH is built on a convolutional vision
transformer backbone that seamlessly handles heterogeneous spatiotemporal
datasets of varying data dimensionality (1D--3D) at different resolutions,
multiple fields with mixed scalar and vector components. The architecture
combines (i) component-wise convolution, which jointly processes scalar and
vector channels to capture local interactions, (ii) inter-field
cross-attention, which models and selectively propagates information between
different physical fields, (iii) axial attentions, which factorizes full
spatiotemporal self-attention along individual spatial and temporal axes to
reduce computational burden while retaining expressivity. We pretrain multiple
model variants on a diverse collection of heterogeneous PDE datasets and
evaluate transfer to a range of downstream prediction tasks. Using both
full-model fine-tuning and parameter-efficient low-rank adapters (LoRA), MORPH
outperforms models trained from scratch in both zero-shot and full-shot
generalization. Across extensive evaluations, MORPH matches or surpasses strong
baselines and recent state-of-the-art models. Collectively, these capabilities
present a flexible and powerful backbone for learning from heterogeneous and
multimodal nature of scientific observations, charting a path toward scalable
and data-efficient scientific machine learning.

*Jiali Zhang,Thomas S. White,Haoliang Zhang,Wenqing Hu,Donald C. Wunsch II,Jian Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MS-YOLO: a lightweight IR detector with a MobileNetV4 backbone and SlideLoss, achieving competitive mAP and higher precision at 6.7 GFLOPs on FLIR ADAS V2—suitable for real-time edge deployment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address practical challenges in infrared urban object detection—class imbalance, thermal noise, and limited compute—by finding an efficient yet accurate detector suitable for low-light/adverse conditions.

Method: Evaluate multiple YOLO variants on FLIR ADAS V2, select YOLOv8 as baseline, replace CSPDarknet with MobileNetV4 to reduce compute by 1.5%, and introduce SlideLoss to emphasize under-represented and occluded samples; train/evaluate MS-YOLO on FLIR ADAS V2.

Result: MS-YOLO achieves competitive mean average precision and superior precision while operating at 6.7 GFLOPs, with a marginal 1.5% reduction in computational overhead compared to the baseline.

Conclusion: MS-YOLO effectively balances detection quality with computational efficiency, enabling real-time edge deployment for urban infrared object detection; SlideLoss contributes to handling data imbalance and occlusion without harming recall.

Abstract: Infrared imaging has emerged as a robust solution for urban object detection
under low-light and adverse weather conditions, offering significant advantages
over traditional visible-light cameras. However, challenges such as class
imbalance, thermal noise, and computational constraints can significantly
hinder model performance in practical settings. To address these issues, we
evaluate multiple YOLO variants on the FLIR ADAS V2 dataset, ultimately
selecting YOLOv8 as our baseline due to its balanced accuracy and efficiency.
Building on this foundation, we present \texttt{MS-YOLO} (\textbf{M}obileNetv4
and \textbf{S}lideLoss based on YOLO), which replaces YOLOv8's CSPDarknet
backbone with the more efficient MobileNetV4, reducing computational overhead
by \textbf{1.5%} while sustaining high accuracy. In addition, we introduce
\emph{SlideLoss}, a novel loss function that dynamically emphasizes
under-represented and occluded samples, boosting precision without sacrificing
recall. Experiments on the FLIR ADAS V2 benchmark show that \texttt{MS-YOLO}
attains competitive mAP and superior precision while operating at only
\textbf{6.7 GFLOPs}. These results demonstrate that \texttt{MS-YOLO}
effectively addresses the dual challenge of maintaining high detection quality
while minimizing computational costs, making it well-suited for real-time edge
deployment in urban environments.

### [46] [Motion-Aware Transformer for Multi-Object Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21715)
*Xu Yang,Gady Agam*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Motion-Aware Transformer (MATR) introduces explicit motion modeling to update track queries ahead of decoding in MOT, reducing query collisions and improving detection and association, achieving state-of-the-art results on DanceTrack, SportsMOT, and BDD100k without external data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MOT in crowded scenes is challenging; DETR-based models rely on shared detection/tracking queries in a single Transformer Decoder, causing conflicts that hurt association accuracy; there is a need to separate or pre-align motion to improve tracking performance.

Method: MATR predicts object movements across frames to update track queries in advance; this motion-aware update reduces query collisions and yields more consistent end-to-end training, benefiting both detection and association performance.

Result: Significant improvements across datasets: on DanceTrack, HOTA increases by over 9 points vs MOTR without extra data and reaches 71.3 with supplementary data; on SportsMOT 72.2 HOTA; on BDD100k 54.7 mTETA and 41.6 mHOTA, without external data. State-of-the-art performance achieved without external datasets.

Conclusion: Explicitly modeling motion within end-to-end Transformers is an effective and simple enhancement for MOT, yielding substantial gains without extra data or complex post-processing.

Abstract: Multi-object tracking (MOT) in videos remains challenging due to complex
object motions and crowded scenes. Recent DETR-based frameworks offer
end-to-end solutions but typically process detection and tracking queries
jointly within a single Transformer Decoder layer, leading to conflicts and
degraded association accuracy. We introduce the Motion-Aware Transformer
(MATR), which explicitly predicts object movements across frames to update
track queries in advance. By reducing query collisions, MATR enables more
consistent training and improves both detection and association. Extensive
experiments on DanceTrack, SportsMOT, and BDD100k show that MATR delivers
significant gains across standard metrics. On DanceTrack, MATR improves HOTA by
more than 9 points over MOTR without additional data and reaches a new
state-of-the-art score of 71.3 with supplementary data. MATR also achieves
state-of-the-art results on SportsMOT (72.2 HOTA) and BDD100k (54.7 mTETA, 41.6
mHOTA) without relying on external datasets. These results demonstrate that
explicitly modeling motion within end-to-end Transformers offers a simple yet
highly effective approach to advancing multi-object tracking.

### [47] [DeLiVR: Differential Spatiotemporal Lie Bias for Efficient Video Deraining](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21719)
*Shuning Sun,Jialang Lu,Xiang Chen,Jichao Wang,Dianjie Lu,Guijuan Zhang,Guangwei Gao,Zhuoran Zheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DeLiVR introduces Lie-group–inspired biases injected into attention to enforce spatiotemporal consistency for video deraining, using a rotation-bounded relative bias and a differential group displacement to model frame geometry and motion, achieving efficient and robust deraining on benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Videos captured in the wild suffer rain streaks, blur, and noise; small camera pose changes amplify cross-frame mismatches and temporal artifacts. Traditional deraining relies on optical flow or heuristic alignment, which are costly and can be fragile. Lie groups offer principled, continuous geometric representations that can enforce spatial and temporal consistency, enabling more robust and efficient video modeling.

Method: The approach injects two Lie-group–biased components into attention: (1) a rotation-bounded Lie relative bias that predicts the in-plane frame angle via a compact module; coordinates are rotated and compared with base coordinates to achieve geometry-consistent alignment before feature aggregation; (2) a differential group displacement that computes angular differences between adjacent frames to estimate a velocity. This bias computation uses temporal decay and attention masks to emphasize inter-frame relationships and align with the direction of rain streaks, all integrated directly into the attention scores for efficient computation.

Result: Extensive experiments on publicly available benchmarks show that DeLiVR improves deraining performance and robustness, outperforming baselines in terms of deraining quality and computational efficiency, particularly under camera motion and varying rain patterns.

Conclusion: Lie-group–based spatiotemporal biases in attention offer an effective and efficient way to enforce geometry and temporal consistency in video deraining, enabling robust deraining in wild conditions.

Abstract: Videos captured in the wild often suffer from rain streaks, blur, and noise.
In addition, even slight changes in camera pose can amplify cross-frame
mismatches and temporal artifacts. Existing methods rely on optical flow or
heuristic alignment, which are computationally expensive and less robust. To
address these challenges, Lie groups provide a principled way to represent
continuous geometric transformations, making them well-suited for enforcing
spatial and temporal consistency in video modeling. Building on this insight,
we propose DeLiVR, an efficient video deraining method that injects
spatiotemporal Lie-group differential biases directly into attention scores of
the network. Specifically, the method introduces two complementary components.
First, a rotation-bounded Lie relative bias predicts the in-plane angle of each
frame using a compact prediction module, where normalized coordinates are
rotated and compared with base coordinates to achieve geometry-consistent
alignment before feature aggregation. Second, a differential group displacement
computes angular differences between adjacent frames to estimate a velocity.
This bias computation combines temporal decay and attention masks to focus on
inter-frame relationships while precisely matching the direction of rain
streaks. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our
method on publicly available benchmarks.

### [48] [On the Status of Foundation Models for SAR Imagery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21722)
*Nathan Inkawhich*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SSL-adapted foundation models significantly improve SAR object recognition, outperforming SAR-specific models; off-the-shelf models underperform; results motivate SSL-focused SAR foundation model development.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Leverage progress in natural-image foundation models trained with self-supervised learning to create data-efficient, robust, and transferable SAR representations, addressing SAR data scarcity and distribution shifts.

Method: Assess off-the-shelf visual foundation models (DINOv2, DINOv3, PE-Core) on SAR tasks; perform self-supervised finetuning of public SSL models with SAR data; train several AFRL-DINOv2 variants; compare with the SARATR-X baseline; analyze backbone choices and downstream adaptation recipes; evaluate robustness under extended operating conditions and limited labeled data.

Result: Off-the-shelf models struggle to extract semantically discriminative SAR features; self-supervised finetuning yields viable SAR foundation models, with AFRL-DINOv2 variants achieving a new state-of-the-art and significantly surpassing SARATR-X; results illuminate trade-offs across backbones and adaptation strategies, showing progress yet acknowledging remaining challenges in SAR foundation modeling.

Conclusion: Demonstrates the feasibility and promise of SSL-based SAR foundation models and provides guidance for future model-building, while recognizing substantial unresolved challenges in achieving robust, generalizable SAR vision.

Abstract: In this work we investigate the viability of foundational AI/ML models for
Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) object recognition tasks. We are inspired by the
tremendous progress being made in the wider community, particularly in the
natural image domain where frontier labs are training huge models on web-scale
datasets with unprecedented computing budgets. It has become clear that these
models, often trained with Self-Supervised Learning (SSL), will transform how
we develop AI/ML solutions for object recognition tasks - they can be adapted
downstream with very limited labeled data, they are more robust to many forms
of distribution shift, and their features are highly transferable
out-of-the-box. For these reasons and more, we are motivated to apply this
technology to the SAR domain. In our experiments we first run tests with
today's most powerful visual foundational models, including DINOv2, DINOv3 and
PE-Core and observe their shortcomings at extracting semantically-interesting
discriminative SAR target features when used off-the-shelf. We then show that
Self-Supervised finetuning of publicly available SSL models with SAR data is a
viable path forward by training several AFRL-DINOv2s and setting a new
state-of-the-art for SAR foundation models, significantly outperforming today's
best SAR-domain model SARATR-X. Our experiments further analyze the performance
trade-off of using different backbones with different downstream
task-adaptation recipes, and we monitor each model's ability to overcome
challenges within the downstream environments (e.g., extended operating
conditions and low amounts of labeled data). We hope this work will inform and
inspire future SAR foundation model builders, because despite our positive
results, we still have a long way to go.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UISim is an image-based mobile UI simulator that predicts the next UI state's abstract layout from the current screen and a user action, then synthesizes a coherent next-screen image, enabling realistic UI transitions for testing and AI agent training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Testing and training UI-based AI agents is hard due to dynamic real-world mobile environments. Existing approaches rely on physical devices or static screenshots, limiting scalability for UI testing, prototyping, and data generation. An image-based, interactive simulator can provide scalable, realistic transitions purely from screen images.

Method: A two-stage process: (1) given an initial screen image and a user action, predict the abstract layout of the next UI state; (2) synthesize a new, visually consistent image based on the predicted layout to render the next screen. The system operates purely from screen images to simulate UI transitions dynamically, enabling interactive exploration and AI agent training.

Result: Experimental results show UISim outperforms end-to-end UI generation baselines in generating realistic and coherent subsequent UI states, indicating higher fidelity and potential to streamline UI development and AI agent training.

Conclusion: UISim offers practical benefits for UI testing, rapid prototyping, and synthetic data generation, and its interactive capabilities support AI agent UI navigation task planning, representing a step toward more scalable and realistic UI simulation.

Abstract: Developing and testing user interfaces (UIs) and training AI agents to
interact with them are challenging due to the dynamic and diverse nature of
real-world mobile environments. Existing methods often rely on cumbersome
physical devices or limited static analysis of screenshots, which hinders
scalable testing and the development of intelligent UI agents. We introduce
UISim, a novel image-based UI simulator that offers a dynamic and interactive
platform for exploring mobile phone environments purely from screen images. Our
system employs a two-stage method: given an initial phone screen image and a
user action, it first predicts the abstract layout of the next UI state, then
synthesizes a new, visually consistent image based on this predicted layout.
This approach enables the realistic simulation of UI transitions. UISim
provides immediate practical benefits for UI testing, rapid prototyping, and
synthetic data generation. Furthermore, its interactive capabilities pave the
way for advanced applications, such as UI navigation task planning for AI
agents. Our experimental results show that UISim outperforms end-to-end UI
generation baselines in generating realistic and coherent subsequent UI states,
highlighting its fidelity and potential to streamline UI development and
enhance AI agent training.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need for accurate retinal vessel segmentation that works well in real-world, resource-constrained clinical environments, addressing small-vessel segmentation and high computational costs.

Result: Achieves Dice scores of 83.28 (DRIVE), 87.44 (STARE), and 84.50 (CHASE_DB); Jaccard indices of 72.85, 79.31, and 74.70 respectively; validated on three datasets; code available at GitHub.

Conclusion: LFA-Net provides a favorable balance of accuracy and efficiency for retinal vessel segmentation in resource-constrained settings, with publicly available code enabling replication and further validation.

Abstract: Lightweight retinal vessel segmentation is important for the early diagnosis
of vision-threatening and systemic diseases, especially in a real-world
clinical environment with limited computational resources. Although
segmentation methods based on deep learning are improving, existing models are
still facing challenges of small vessel segmentation and high computational
costs. To address these challenges, we proposed a new vascular segmentation
network, LFA-Net, which incorporates a newly designed attention module,
LiteFusion-Attention. This attention module incorporates residual learning
connections, Vision Mamba-inspired dynamics, and modulation-based attention,
enabling the model to capture local and global context efficiently and in a
lightweight manner. LFA-Net offers high performance with 0.11 million
parameters, 0.42 MB memory size, and 4.46 GFLOPs, which make it ideal for
resource-constrained environments. We validated our proposed model on DRIVE,
STARE, and CHASE_DB with outstanding performance in terms of dice scores of
83.28, 87.44, and 84.50% and Jaccard indices of 72.85, 79.31, and 74.70%,

Conclusion: Adaptive feature/layer selection with an early-exit strategy, optimized by Bayesian thresholds, can substantially reduce compute while maintaining or enhancing navigation performance, offering improved efficiency and interpretability for resource-limited visual navigation systems.

Abstract: Visual navigation is essential for robotics and embodied AI. However,
existing foundation models, particularly those with transformer decoders,
suffer from high computational overhead and lack interpretability, limiting
their deployment in resource-tight scenarios. To address this, we propose
DynaNav, a Dynamic Visual Navigation framework that adapts feature and layer
selection based on scene complexity. It employs a trainable hard feature
selector for sparse operations, enhancing efficiency and interpretability.
Additionally, we integrate feature selection into an early-exit mechanism, with
Bayesian Optimization determining optimal exit thresholds to reduce
computational cost. Extensive experiments in real-world-based datasets and
simulated environments demonstrate the effectiveness of DynaNav. Compared to
ViNT, DynaNav achieves a 2.26x reduction in FLOPs, 42.3% lower inference time,
and 32.8% lower memory usage, while improving navigation performance across
four public datasets.

### [52] [Incorporating Scene Context and Semantic Labels for Enhanced Group-level Emotion Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21747)
*Qing Zhu,Wangdong Guo,Qirong Mao,Xiaohua Huang,Xiuyan Shao,Wenming Zheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A dual-branch GER framework that fuses multi-scale visual scene context with label-guided semantic information generated by an LLM, refined through a structured emotion tree, using similarity-aware interaction to improve group-level emotion recognition; achieves competitive results on three GER datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current GER methods underutilize visual scene context and neglect semantic information embedded in emotion labels, limiting modeling of inter-person relationships and holistic emotions.

Method: (1) Visual context encoding module with multi-scale scene cues to diversely encode inter-individual relations; (2) Emotion semantic encoding module that uses group-level emotion labels to prompt an LLM to produce nuanced emotion lexicons, which are refined by a structured emotion tree into semantic representations; (3) similarity-aware interaction to align and integrate visual and semantic representations for enhanced GER.

Result: Demonstrates competitive performance against state-of-the-art methods on three widely adopted GER datasets.

Conclusion: The framework effectively leverages both visual context and label-guided semantic information to enhance GER, underscoring the role of semantic prompts and structured representations in group-level emotion understanding.

Abstract: Group-level emotion recognition (GER) aims to identify holistic emotions
within a scene involving multiple individuals. Current existed methods
underestimate the importance of visual scene contextual information in modeling
individual relationships. Furthermore, they overlook the crucial role of
semantic information from emotional labels for complete understanding of
emotions. To address this limitation, we propose a novel framework that
incorporates visual scene context and label-guided semantic information to
improve GER performance. It involves the visual context encoding module that
leverages multi-scale scene information to diversely encode individual
relationships. Complementarily, the emotion semantic encoding module utilizes
group-level emotion labels to prompt a large language model to generate nuanced
emotion lexicons. These lexicons, in conjunction with the emotion labels, are
then subsequently refined into comprehensive semantic representations through
the utilization of a structured emotion tree. Finally, similarity-aware
interaction is proposed to align and integrate visual and semantic information,
thereby generating enhanced group-level emotion representations and
subsequently improving the performance of GER. Experiments on three widely
adopted GER datasets demonstrate that our proposed method achieves competitive
performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

*Yu Li,Da Chang,Xi Xiao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: KG-SAM is a knowledge-guided framework that integrates a medical knowledge graph, energy-based CRF, and uncertainty-aware fusion to improve SAM-based medical image segmentation, achieving strong Dice scores in prostate, abdominal MRI, and abdominal CT datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome SAM’s limitations in medical imaging: ambiguous boundaries, insufficient modeling of anatomical relationships, and lack of uncertainty quantification, aiming for robust, generalizable medical segmentation.

Method: Incorporates (i) a medical knowledge graph encoding fine-grained anatomical relationships; (ii) an energy-based CRF to enforce anatomically consistent predictions; (iii) an uncertainty-aware fusion module to improve reliability in high-stakes clinical settings.

Result: Demonstrates effectiveness on multi-center data: Dice score of 82.69% for prostate segmentation; 78.05% (MRI) and 79.68% (CT) for abdominal segmentation, indicating strong and generalizable performance.

Conclusion: KG-SAM provides a robust and generalizable framework that advances medical image segmentation by integrating anatomical priors, boundary refinement, and uncertainty estimation, with strong cross-center results.

Abstract: While the Segment Anything Model (SAM) has achieved remarkable success in
image segmentation, its direct application to medical imaging remains hindered
by fundamental challenges, including ambiguous boundaries, insufficient
modeling of anatomical relationships, and the absence of uncertainty
quantification. To address these limitations, we introduce KG-SAM, a
knowledge-guided framework that synergistically integrates anatomical priors
with boundary refinement and uncertainty estimation. Specifically, KG-SAM
incorporates (i) a medical knowledge graph to encode fine-grained anatomical
relationships, (ii) an energy-based Conditional Random Field (CRF) to enforce
anatomically consistent predictions, and (iii) an uncertainty-aware fusion
module to enhance reliability in high-stakes clinical scenarios. Extensive
experiments across multi-center medical datasets demonstrate the effectiveness
of our approach: KG-SAM achieves an average Dice score of 82.69% on prostate
segmentation and delivers substantial gains in abdominal segmentation, reaching
78.05% on MRI and 79.68% on CT. These results establish KG-SAM as a robust and
generalizable framework for advancing medical image segmentation.

### [55] [UniVid: Unifying Vision Tasks with Pre-trained Video Generation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21760)
*Lan Chen,Yuchao Gu,Qi Mao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UniVid adapts a pre-trained video diffusion model to perform diverse vision tasks via visual sentences, enabling cross-modal and cross-source generalization without task-specific pretraining and allowing easy switching between understanding and generation by sentence order.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the cost and scalability limits of task-specific cross-modal pretraining (as in LVM-like approaches) by leveraging the temporal modeling capabilities of video generation models to serve as a unified foundation for vision tasks.

Method: Fine-tune a pre-trained video diffusion transformer to handle multiple vision tasks without task-specific modifications. Represent tasks as visual sentences, where the context sequence defines the task and the output modality. Evaluate generalization in cross-modal settings (images and videos) and cross-source data (natural to annotated) without multi-source pretraining.

Result: UniVid generalizes well in both cross-modal and cross-source settings, despite training only on natural video data. The model can switch between understanding and generation by simply reversing the visual sentence order. Code release is planned.

Conclusion: Pre-trained video generation models can serve as scalable, unified foundation models for diverse vision tasks across modalities and data sources, reducing the need for task-specific pretraining.

Abstract: Large language models, trained on extensive corpora, successfully unify
diverse linguistic tasks within a single generative framework. Inspired by
this, recent works like Large Vision Model (LVM) extend this paradigm to vision
by organizing tasks into sequential visual sentences, where visual prompts
serve as the context to guide outputs. However, such modeling requires
task-specific pre-training across modalities and sources, which is costly and
limits scalability to unseen tasks. Given that pre-trained video generation
models inherently capture temporal sequence dependencies, we explore a more
unified and scalable alternative: can a pre-trained video generation model
adapt to diverse image and video tasks? To answer this, we propose UniVid, a
framework that fine-tunes a video diffusion transformer to handle various
vision tasks without task-specific modifications. Tasks are represented as
visual sentences, where the context sequence defines both the task and the
expected output modality. We evaluate the generalization of UniVid from two
perspectives: (1) cross-modal inference with contexts composed of both images
and videos, extending beyond LVM's uni-modal setting; (2) cross-source tasks
from natural to annotated data, without multi-source pre-training. Despite
being trained solely on natural video data, UniVid generalizes well in both
settings. Notably, understanding and generation tasks can easily switch by
simply reversing the visual sentence order in this paradigm. These findings
highlight the potential of pre-trained video generation models to serve as a
scalable and unified foundation for vision modeling. Our code will be released
at https://github.com/CUC-MIPG/UniVid.

### [56] [MesaTask: Towards Task-Driven Tabletop Scene Generation via 3D Spatial Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22281)
*Jinkun Hao,Naifu Liang,Zhen Luo,Xudong Xu,Weipeng Zhong,Ran Yi,Yichen Jin,Zhaoyang Lyu,Feng Zheng,Lizhuang Ma,Jiangmiao Pang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduces MesaTask-10K dataset (~10.7K synthetic tabletop scenes) and MesaTask framework with a Spatial Reasoning Chain and DPO to generate task-aligned, realistic 3D layouts for manipulation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a substantial gap between high-level task instructions and realistic tabletop scenes, and current scene generation methods rely on manual layouts or random placements, limiting plausibility and task alignment.

Method: Propose a Spatial Reasoning Chain that breaks generation into object inference, spatial interrelation reasoning, and scene graph construction to produce final 3D layouts. Build MesaTask, an LLM-based framework enhanced with DPO to generate physically plausible tabletop scenes that align with given task descriptions. Create MesaTask-10K with manually crafted layouts ensuring realism and rich inter-object relations.

Result: Exhaustive experiments show MesaTask outperforming baselines in generating task-conforming tabletop scenes with realistic layouts and physical plausibility.

Conclusion: The dataset and framework advance task-oriented scene generation for robotics, enabling better training data; future work could extend tasks, realism, and real-world validation.

Abstract: The ability of robots to interpret human instructions and execute
manipulation tasks necessitates the availability of task-relevant tabletop
scenes for training. However, traditional methods for creating these scenes
rely on time-consuming manual layout design or purely randomized layouts, which
are limited in terms of plausibility or alignment with the tasks. In this
paper, we formulate a novel task, namely task-oriented tabletop scene
generation, which poses significant challenges due to the substantial gap
between high-level task instructions and the tabletop scenes. To support
research on such a challenging task, we introduce MesaTask-10K, a large-scale
dataset comprising approximately 10,700 synthetic tabletop scenes with manually
crafted layouts that ensure realistic layouts and intricate inter-object
relations. To bridge the gap between tasks and scenes, we propose a Spatial
Reasoning Chain that decomposes the generation process into object inference,
spatial interrelation reasoning, and scene graph construction for the final 3D
layout. We present MesaTask, an LLM-based framework that utilizes this
reasoning chain and is further enhanced with DPO algorithms to generate
physically plausible tabletop scenes that align well with given task
descriptions. Exhaustive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of
MesaTask compared to baselines in generating task-conforming tabletop scenes
with realistic layouts. Project page is at https://mesatask.github.io/

*Wenyi Gong,Mieszko Lis*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A simple token merging method preserves spatial structure for Vision Transformers with spatial architectures, enabling faster inference with minimal accuracy loss across tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing token reduction methods often destroy spatial structure crucial for windowed attention, relative positional embeddings, and RoPE-based designs; there is a need to reduce tokens while maintaining spatial integrity to work well with spatial ViT backbones.

Method: 1) 2D reduction to enforce structured token layouts; 2) a spatial-aware merging algorithm that preserves relative token positions; 3) a max-magnitude-per-dimension token representation to retain salient features.

Result: Demonstrates strong performance off-the-shelf and with fine-tuning, achieving 1.25x speedup on SAM-H with 0.7% mIOU drop on COCO, and 1.15x speedup on DeiT-B with no top-1 accuracy drop on ImageNet after one epoch of fine-tuning; claims state-of-the-art results across spatial and non-spatial architectures for various vision tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed token merging approach enables compatibility with spatial architectures while delivering fast inference and minimal accuracy loss, making it broadly effective for both spatial and non-spatial ViT backbones.

Abstract: Many modern ViT backbones adopt spatial architectural designs, such as window
attention, decomposed relative positional embeddings in SAM, and RoPE in
DINOv3. Such architectures impose new challenges on token reduction, as the
vast majority of existing methods fail to preserve the spatial structure these
architectures depend on. In this paper, we introduce a simple yet effective
token merging method that maintains spatial integrity, enabling seamless
compatibility with spatial architectures. We reconcile two seemingly
conflicting requirements: (i)exploiting the uneven information distribution
across the spatial layout while (ii)preserving the spatial structure
post-merging. Our approach employs (i)a 2D reduction strategy to enforce
structured token layouts, (ii)a spatial-aware merging algorithm that maintains
relative token positions, and (iii)a novel max-magnitude-per-dimension token
representation that preserves salient features. Our method demonstrates strong
performance both off-the-shelf and with fine-tuning, achieving state-of-the-art
results on spatial and non-spatial architectures across various vision tasks.
Specifically, we achieve 1.25x speedup on SAM-H with only 0.7% mIOU drop
evaluated on COCO off-the-shelf, and 1.15x speedup on DeiT-B with no top-1
accuracy drop on ImageNet within just one epoch of fine-tuning.

*Yuxin Liu,Fei Wang,Kun Li,Yiqi Nie,Junjie Chen,Yanyan Wei,Zhangling Duan,Zhaohong Jia*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A training-free multimodal deepfake detection framework (GASP-ICL) that augments LVLMs with adaptive scoring and cross-sample propagation to select task-relevant demonstrations, achieving state-of-the-art results without LVLM fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LVLMs offer strong multimodal reasoning but underperform on subtle deepfake cues, cross-modal inconsistencies, and retrieval for MDD; a training-free, retrieval-augmented, graph-based approach can improve detection reliability.

Method: 1) Use MDD-adapted feature extractor to retrieve aligned image-text pairs and form a candidate set. 2) Graph-Structured Taylor Adaptive Scorer (GSTAS) to model cross-sample relations and propagate signals to create discriminative exemplars. 3) Use these exemplars as demonstrations for LVLMs in a prompt, without fine-tuning.

Result: On four forgery types, GASP-ICL outperforms strong baselines, achieving improved detection without LVLM fine-tuning.

Conclusion: Training-free GASP-ICL with retrieval and graph-based adaptive scoring enhances multimodal deepfake detection by leveraging task-aligned demonstrations; robust across forgery types.

Abstract: Multimodal deepfake detection (MDD) aims to uncover manipulations across
visual, textual, and auditory modalities, thereby reinforcing the reliability
of modern information systems. Although large vision-language models (LVLMs)
exhibit strong multimodal reasoning, their effectiveness in MDD is limited by
challenges in capturing subtle forgery cues, resolving cross-modal
inconsistencies, and performing task-aligned retrieval. To this end, we propose
Guided Adaptive Scorer and Propagation In-Context Learning (GASP-ICL), a
training-free framework for MDD. GASP-ICL employs a pipeline to preserve
semantic relevance while injecting task-aware knowledge into LVLMs. We leverage
an MDD-adapted feature extractor to retrieve aligned image-text pairs and build
a candidate set. We further design the Graph-Structured Taylor Adaptive Scorer
(GSTAS) to capture cross-sample relations and propagate query-aligned signals,
producing discriminative exemplars. This enables precise selection of
semantically aligned, task-relevant demonstrations, enhancing LVLMs for robust
MDD. Experiments on four forgery types show that GASP-ICL surpasses strong
baselines, delivering gains without LVLM fine-tuning.

*Tianci Wu,Guangming Zhu,Jiang Lu,Siyuan Wang,Ning Wang,Nuoye Xiong,Zhang Liang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ProDA is a prompt-guided disentangled representation framework for action recognition in multi-action videos. It uses Spatio-temporal Scene Graphs and a Dynamic Prompt Module to steer a Graph Parsing Neural Network to produce action-specific features, with a video-adapted architecture that uses dynamic weights. It demonstrates competitive or superior performance versus state-of-the-art and releases code.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In multi-action videos, unified features struggle to model interactions among multiple objects for different actions. Disentangling specified actions within complex scenes can better capture action-specific dynamics and relations.

Method: ProDA leverages Spatio-temporal Scene Graphs (SSGs) and introduces a Dynamic Prompt Module (DPM) to guide a Graph Parsing Neural Network (GPNN) in generating action-specific representations. It also includes a video-adapted GPNN that aggregates information using dynamic weights to adapt to temporal context.

Result: Empirical evaluation on video action recognition shows that ProDA is effective compared with state-of-the-art methods. The work reports improvements on benchmarks, validating the disentangled, prompt-guided approach. Code is released at the provided repository.

Conclusion: Prompt-guided disentangled representation through SSGs and a dynamic GPNN enables action-specific modeling in multi-action scenes, offering benefits over unified feature approaches and contributing a reusable framework for action recognition in complex scenes.

Abstract: Action recognition is a fundamental task in video understanding. Existing
methods typically extract unified features to process all actions in one video,
which makes it challenging to model the interactions between different objects
in multi-action scenarios. To alleviate this issue, we explore disentangling
any specified actions from complex scenes as an effective solution. In this
paper, we propose Prompt-guided Disentangled Representation for Action
Recognition (ProDA), a novel framework that disentangles any specified actions
from a multi-action scene. ProDA leverages Spatio-temporal Scene Graphs (SSGs)
and introduces Dynamic Prompt Module (DPM) to guide a Graph Parsing Neural
Network (GPNN) in generating action-specific representations. Furthermore, we
design a video-adapted GPNN that aggregates information using dynamic weights.
Experiments in video action recognition demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach when compared with the state-of-the-art methods. Our code can be found

### [60] [JanusVLN: Decoupling Semantics and Spatiality with Dual Implicit Memory for Vision-Language Navigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22548)
*Shuang Zeng,Dekang Qi,Xinyuan Chang,Feng Xiong,Shichao Xie,Xiaolong Wu,Shiyi Liang,Mu Xu,Xing Wei*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: JanusVLN introduces dual implicit neural memory for VLN to efficiently fuse spatial-geometric and visual-semantic information, extends Multimodal LLMs with 3D priors, and achieves state-of-the-art results with compact memory and incremental updates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLN systems rely on explicit semantic memory (e.g., cognitive maps, historical frames), which causes spatial information loss, computational redundancy, and memory bloat. Inspired by human brain lateralization, the work aims to develop compact, fixed-size implicit memories to better capture spatial and semantic information without large memory footprints.

Method: Propose a dual implicit memory consisting of spatial-geometric and visual-semantic memories. Extend MLLMs with 3D priors from a spatial-geometric encoder, and construct historical KV caches in both encoders. Retain only KVs within the initial and sliding windows to enable efficient incremental updates, avoiding redundant computation.

Result: Empirically, JanusVLN achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming over 20 recent methods. Reported gains include 10.5–35.5 percentage points in Success Rate over methods using multiple data types and 3.6–10.8 points over methods using more RGB training data.

Conclusion: A dual implicit memory framework offers a new, efficient paradigm for VLN, allowing RGB-based models to exploit 3D priors and lazy, fixed-size memories. It shows strong empirical gains and points to promising directions for future VLN research.

Abstract: Vision-and-Language Navigation requires an embodied agent to navigate through
unseen environments, guided by natural language instructions and a continuous
video stream. Recent advances in VLN have been driven by the powerful semantic
understanding of Multimodal Large Language Models. However, these methods
typically rely on explicit semantic memory, such as building textual cognitive
maps or storing historical visual frames. This type of method suffers from
spatial information loss, computational redundancy, and memory bloat, which
impede efficient navigation. Inspired by the implicit scene representation in
human navigation, analogous to the left brain's semantic understanding and the
right brain's spatial cognition, we propose JanusVLN, a novel VLN framework
featuring a dual implicit neural memory that models spatial-geometric and
visual-semantic memory as separate, compact, and fixed-size neural
representations. This framework first extends the MLLM to incorporate 3D prior
knowledge from the spatial-geometric encoder, thereby enhancing the spatial
reasoning capabilities of models based solely on RGB input. Then, the
historical key-value caches from the spatial-geometric and visual-semantic
encoders are constructed into a dual implicit memory. By retaining only the KVs
of tokens in the initial and sliding window, redundant computation is avoided,
enabling efficient incremental updates. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
JanusVLN outperforms over 20 recent methods to achieve SOTA performance. For
example, the success rate improves by 10.5-35.5 compared to methods using
multiple data types as input and by 3.6-10.8 compared to methods using more RGB
training data. This indicates that the proposed dual implicit neural memory, as
a novel paradigm, explores promising new directions for future VLN research.

Abstract: The rise in harmful online content not only distorts public discourse but
also poses significant challenges to maintaining a healthy digital environment.
In response to this, we introduce a multimodal dataset uniquely crafted for
identifying hate in digital content. Central to our methodology is the
innovative application of watermarked, stability-enhanced, stable diffusion
techniques combined with the Digital Attention Analysis Module (DAAM). This
combination is instrumental in pinpointing the hateful elements within images,
thereby generating detailed hate attention maps, which are used to blur these
regions from the image, thereby removing the hateful sections of the image. We
release this data set as a part of the dehate shared task. This paper also
describes the details of the shared task. Furthermore, we present DeHater, a

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MIRG-RL is a two-stage learning framework that enables multi-image reasoning and grounding by combining supervised trajectory-based fine-tuning with image-aware reinforcement learning, including dual rewards for objects and images, achieving state-of-the-art cross-image reasoning performance (64.82%).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LVLMs struggle with cross-image reasoning and cross-image reference reward signals; there is a need to integrate object-level and image-level cues and to resolve cross-image ambiguities for robust multi-image understanding.

Method: A two-stage training paradigm: (1) supervised fine-tuning on annotated trajectories to bootstrap reasoning; (2) image-aware reinforcement learning optimization with a dual-reward policy. A novel trajectory-construction method combines object-level and image-level annotations to create a lightweight reasoning-enhanced dataset. The RL policy uses dual rewards for objects and images to address cross-image ambiguities.

Result: MIRG-RL achieves state-of-the-art performance on multi-image grounding benchmarks, reporting 64.82% on cross-image reasoning tasks, exceeding the previous best by 1%. The authors also release code and dataset.

Conclusion: The framework effectively bridges trajectory-guided supervision with image-aware reinforcement learning to enhance cross-image reasoning and grounding, demonstrating robust improvements and providing resources for reproducibility.

Abstract: Multi-image reasoning and grounding require understanding complex cross-image
relationships at both object levels and image levels. Current Large Visual
Language Models (LVLMs) face two critical challenges: the lack of cross-image
reasoning capabilities and insufficient cross-image reference reward modeling.
To address these issues, we propose a unified framework - Multi-Image Reasoning
and Grounding with Reinforcement Learning (MIRG-RL). Specifically, our
two-stage training paradigm combines supervised fine-tuning with annotated
trajectories and image-aware reinforcement learning optimization, progressively
developing multi-image reasoning capabilities. Furthermore, we innovatively
propose a method for constructing the trajectory data, which integrates
object-level and image-level annotation information, and use this method to
generate a lightweight reasoning-enhanced dataset. To effectively resolve
cross-image ambiguities, we design an image-aware RL policy with dual reward
functions for objects and images. Experiments demonstrate that MIRG-RL achieves
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in multi-image grounding benchmarks,
attaining 64.82% on cross-image reasoning tasks - exceeding the previous best
method by 1%. The code and dataset have been released at

*Yu Shang,Lei Jin,Yiding Ma,Xin Zhang,Chen Gao,Wei Wu,Yong Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LongScape is a hybrid video-generation framework for long-horizon, stable embodied manipulation, combining intra-chunk diffusion denoising with inter-chunk autoregressive generation, guided by action-aware, variable-length chunking and a Context-aware Mixture-of-Experts (CMoE) to ensure high visual fidelity and smooth transitions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video-generation approaches struggle with long sequences: diffusion methods suffer from temporal drift and inconsistency across rollouts, while autoregressive methods degrade visual quality. Stable, long-horizon, action-consistent video data is crucial for learning embodied manipulation policies.

Method: Introduce action-guided, variable-length chunking that partitions video according to semantic robotic actions. Use intra-chunk diffusion denoising for visual quality within each chunk and inter-chunk autoregressive causal generation for temporal continuity across chunks. Deploy a Context-aware Mixture-of-Experts (CMoE) that activates specialized experts per chunk to maintain high visual fidelity and smooth transitions.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate stable and consistent long-horizon video generation over extended rollouts, with improved visual quality and coherence across chunks. The authors provide code at the linked repository.

Conclusion: LongScape offers a flexible framework that leverages action-aware chunking and adaptive expert routing to achieve stable, high-fidelity long-horizon video generation for embodied manipulation tasks, addressing the limitations of existing diffusion and autoregressive methods.

Abstract: Video-based world models hold significant potential for generating
high-quality embodied manipulation data. However, current video generation
methods struggle to achieve stable long-horizon generation: classical
diffusion-based approaches often suffer from temporal inconsistency and visual
drift over multiple rollouts, while autoregressive methods tend to compromise
on visual detail. To solve this, we introduce LongScape, a hybrid framework
that adaptively combines intra-chunk diffusion denoising with inter-chunk
autoregressive causal generation. Our core innovation is an action-guided,
variable-length chunking mechanism that partitions video based on the semantic
context of robotic actions. This ensures each chunk represents a complete,
coherent action, enabling the model to flexibly generate diverse dynamics. We
further introduce a Context-aware Mixture-of-Experts (CMoE) framework that
adaptively activates specialized experts for each chunk during generation,
guaranteeing high visual quality and seamless chunk transitions. Extensive
experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves stable and consistent
long-horizon generation over extended rollouts. Our code is available at:

TL;DR: MoWM fuses latent motion-aware representations with pixel-space features to improve embodied action planning; achieves state-of-the-art results on CALVIN with strong generalization; code released.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pixel-level video models often introduce visual redundancies that hinder action decoding; latent world models lack fine-grained details necessary for precise manipulation; a hybrid approach aims to combine the strengths of both.

Method: Introduce MoWM, a mixture-of-world-models that uses motion-aware representations from a latent model as a high-level prior to guide the extraction of fine-grained visual features from a pixel-space world model, enabling a joint representation for action decoding.

Result: On the CALVIN benchmark, MoWM achieves state-of-the-art task success rates and superior generalization; includes analysis of the strengths of each feature space; code is available.

Conclusion: Hybridizing world-model representations improves embodied action planning by leveraging complementary information from latent and pixel-space models, offering guidance for future research in embodied planning.

Abstract: Embodied action planning is a core challenge in robotics, requiring models to
generate precise actions from visual observations and language instructions.
While video generation world models are promising, their reliance on
pixel-level reconstruction often introduces visual redundancies that hinder
action decoding and generalization. Latent world models offer a compact,
motion-aware representation, but overlook the fine-grained details critical for
precise manipulation. To overcome these limitations, we propose MoWM, a
mixture-of-world-model framework that fuses representations from hybrid world
models for embodied action planning. Our approach uses motion-aware
representations from a latent model as a high-level prior, which guides the
extraction of fine-grained visual features from the pixel space model. This
design allows MoWM to highlight the informative visual details needed for
action decoding. Extensive evaluations on the CALVIN benchmark demonstrate that
our method achieves state-of-the-art task success rates and superior
generalization. We also provide a comprehensive analysis of the strengths of
each feature space, offering valuable insights for future research in embodied
planning. The code is available at: https://github.com/tsinghua-fib-lab/MoWM.

*Cheng Lei,Jiayu Zhang,Yue Ma,Xinyu Wang,Long Chen,Liang Tang,Yiqiang Yan,Fei Su,Zhicheng Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Training-free trajectory control for DiT-based text-to-video using foreground-background prompts and STD-RoPE to align cross-frame attention, improving quality and controllability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need for user-friendly trajectory control in text-to-video generation that leverages DiT's 3D full attention without heavy training or U-Net-centric designs; existing methods are resource-intensive or not aligned with DiT.

Method: Foreground-background separation guidance via LLM-generated prompts; analysis of 3D full attention and position embeddings; Inter-frame Spatial-Temporal Decoupled 3D-RoPE (STD-RoPE) by updating only foreground tokens' position embeddings to reduce cross-frame spatial discrepancies and strengthen cross-frame attention; regulate density of position embeddings to achieve 3D-aware trajectory control; training-free framework tailored for DiT.

Result: Empirical experiments show DiTraj outperforms prior methods in video quality and trajectory controllability; achieves effective, training-free trajectory control for DiT-based video generation.

Conclusion: DiTraj provides a practical, training-free solution for trajectory control in DiT-based text-to-video generation. STD-RoPE and foreground-background prompting improve cross-frame coherence and control without retraining, demonstrating both effectiveness and efficiency.

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiT)-based video generation models with 3D full
attention exhibit strong generative capabilities. Trajectory control represents
a user-friendly task in the field of controllable video generation. However,
existing methods either require substantial training resources or are
specifically designed for U-Net, do not take advantage of the superior
performance of DiT. To address these issues, we propose DiTraj, a simple but
effective training-free framework for trajectory control in text-to-video
generation, tailored for DiT. Specifically, first, to inject the object's
trajectory, we propose foreground-background separation guidance: we use the
Large Language Model (LLM) to convert user-provided prompts into foreground and
background prompts, which respectively guide the generation of foreground and
background regions in the video. Then, we analyze 3D full attention and explore
the tight correlation between inter-token attention scores and position
embedding. Based on this, we propose inter-frame Spatial-Temporal Decoupled
3D-RoPE (STD-RoPE). By modifying only foreground tokens' position embedding,
STD-RoPE eliminates their cross-frame spatial discrepancies, strengthening
cross-frame attention among them and thus enhancing trajectory control.
Additionally, we achieve 3D-aware trajectory control by regulating the density
of position embedding. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method
outperforms previous methods in both video quality and trajectory
controllability.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Hybrid dense+lexical retrieval in a retrieval-augmented generator yields large gains for multi-hop QA on HotpotQA, with about 50% higher exact match and 47% higher F1 than a cosine baseline, while maintaining efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Assess and compare retrieval strategies for multi-hop question answering within a retrieval-augmented generation framework, aiming to enable strong zero-shot performance and better interpretability.

Method: Systematically compare retrieval strategies (cosine similarity, maximal marginal relevance) and a hybrid approach combining dense embeddings with lexical overlap and re-ranking.

Result: On HotpotQA, the hybrid approach substantially outperforms baselines, achieving ~50% relative improvement in exact match and ~47% in F1 over cosine similarity. Error analysis shows improved entity recall and evidence complementarity, but challenges remain with distractors and temporal reasoning.

Conclusion: Hybrid retrieval-augmented generation provides a practical zero-shot solution for multi-hop QA, balancing accuracy, efficiency, and interpretability, though future work should address distractors and temporal reasoning.

Abstract: Transformer-based models have advanced the field of question answering, but
multi-hop reasoning, where answers require combining evidence across multiple
passages, remains difficult. This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of
retrieval strategies for multi-hop question answering within a
retrieval-augmented generation framework. We compare cosine similarity, maximal
marginal relevance, and a hybrid method that integrates dense embeddings with
lexical overlap and re-ranking. To further improve retrieval, we adapt the
EfficientRAG pipeline for query optimization, introducing token labeling and
iterative refinement while maintaining efficiency. Experiments on the HotpotQA
dataset show that the hybrid approach substantially outperforms baseline
methods, achieving a relative improvement of 50 percent in exact match and 47
percent in F1 score compared to cosine similarity. Error analysis reveals that
hybrid retrieval improves entity recall and evidence complementarity, while
remaining limited in handling distractors and temporal reasoning. Overall, the
results suggest that hybrid retrieval-augmented generation provides a practical
zero-shot solution for multi-hop question answering, balancing accuracy,
efficiency, and interpretability.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HDR DNVS introduces HDR-4DGS, a Gaussian Splatting-based method with a dynamic tone-mapping module to jointly model temporal radiance variations and LDR↔HDR translation, enabling photorealistic HDR novel view synthesis in dynamic scenes; claims state-of-the-art performance and code release.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current HDR NVS methods mainly handle static scenes. Real-world imagery contains dynamic elements (moving objects, changing lighting) that require modeling temporal radiance changes and consistent cross-domain translation between LDR and HDR.

Method: Proposes HDR-4DGS, a Gaussian Splatting-based architecture featuring a dynamic tone-mapping module that explicitly links HDR and LDR domains. This module adapts tone-mapping functions over time to keep temporal radiance distributions coherent, enabling joint modeling of temporal radiance variation and 3D translation from LDR to HDR across time.

Result: Extensive experiments show HDR-4DGS surpasses existing state-of-the-art methods in both quantitative metrics and visual fidelity, with photorealistic HDR renderings from arbitrary viewpoints and time instances. Source code will be released.

Conclusion: The paper defines HDR Dynamic Novel View Synthesis (HDR DNVS) as a more realistic problem and offers HDR-4DGS as an effective solution that achieves temporal radiance coherence and spatial color translation in dynamic scenes, outperforming baselines.

Abstract: High Dynamic Range Novel View Synthesis (HDR NVS) seeks to learn an HDR 3D
model from Low Dynamic Range (LDR) training images captured under conventional
imaging conditions. Current methods primarily focus on static scenes,
implicitly assuming all scene elements remain stationary and non-living.
However, real-world scenarios frequently feature dynamic elements, such as
moving objects, varying lighting conditions, and other temporal events, thereby
presenting a significantly more challenging scenario. To address this gap, we
propose a more realistic problem named HDR Dynamic Novel View Synthesis (HDR
DNVS), where the additional dimension ``Dynamic'' emphasizes the necessity of
jointly modeling temporal radiance variations alongside sophisticated 3D
translation between LDR and HDR. To tackle this complex, intertwined challenge,
we introduce HDR-4DGS, a Gaussian Splatting-based architecture featured with an
innovative dynamic tone-mapping module that explicitly connects HDR and LDR
domains, maintaining temporal radiance coherence by dynamically adapting
tone-mapping functions according to the evolving radiance distributions across
the temporal dimension. As a result, HDR-4DGS achieves both temporal radiance
consistency and spatially accurate color translation, enabling photorealistic
HDR renderings from arbitrary viewpoints and time instances. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that HDR-4DGS surpasses existing state-of-the-art
methods in both quantitative performance and visual fidelity. Source code will
be released.

*Minje Kim,Tae-Kyun Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SRHand reconstructs detailed 3D hand geometry and textures from low-resolution images by upsampling with a geometric-aware implicit image function (GIIF) while jointly optimizing with explicit hand meshes, achieving better multi-view consistency and capturing fine details like wrinkles and nails.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-fidelity hand capture typically requires high-resolution multi-view images. Existing low-res or static-scene super-resolution methods struggle to generalize to articulated hands and enforce 3D consistency across views and poses. There is a need for a method that preserves multi-view/pose consistency while upsampling and reconstructing detailed 3D hand geometry.

Method: Introduce GIIF (Geometric-aware Implicit Image Function) to upsample coarse input hand images. Jointly optimize the implicit image function with explicit 3D hand meshes to preserve multi-view and pose consistency and recover fine details. Combines implicit image representation with explicit mesh geometry to produce detailed 3D hand shapes and textures.

Result: On InterHand2.6M and Goliath datasets, SRHand significantly outperforms state-of-the-art image upsampling methods adapted to hand datasets and 3D hand reconstruction methods, both quantitatively and qualitatively.

Conclusion: SRHand enables detailed 3D hand reconstruction from low-resolution inputs, capturing fine details such as wrinkles and nails while maintaining multi-view/pose consistency, validated on two datasets with a dedicated project page.

Abstract: Reconstructing detailed hand avatars plays a crucial role in various
applications. While prior works have focused on capturing high-fidelity hand
geometry, they heavily rely on high-resolution multi-view image inputs and
struggle to generalize on low-resolution images. Multi-view image
super-resolution methods have been proposed to enforce 3D view consistency.
These methods, however, are limited to static objects/scenes with fixed
resolutions and are not applicable to articulated deformable hands. In this
paper, we propose SRHand (Super-Resolution Hand), the method for reconstructing
detailed 3D geometry as well as textured images of hands from low-resolution
images. SRHand leverages the advantages of implicit image representation with
explicit hand meshes. Specifically, we introduce a geometric-aware implicit
image function (GIIF) that learns detailed hand prior by upsampling the coarse
input images. By jointly optimizing the implicit image function and explicit 3D
hand shapes, our method preserves multi-view and pose consistency among
upsampled hand images, and achieves fine-detailed 3D reconstruction (wrinkles,
nails). In experiments using the InterHand2.6M and Goliath datasets, our method
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art image upsampling methods adapted to
hand datasets, and 3D hand reconstruction methods, quantitatively and
qualitatively. Project page: https://yunminjin2.github.io/projects/srhand

*Janis Keuper,Margret Keuper*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A position paper arguing that fake-image detection relies on outdated notions of “real” images and old datasets; calls for a clear technical definition of real images and new benchmark datasets, given modern smartphone-based image formation closely tied to generative-model architectures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address fundamental shortcomings in fake-image detection research: unclear definition of what constitutes a real image, reliance on old, low-resolution datasets, and potential misalignment with modern image acquisition pipelines.

Method: Conceptual analysis and critique presented as a position paper; no empirical experiments; advocates discussion and design of new benchmarks and definitions.

Result: Identifies a critical gap: current detection methods depend on stale real-image datasets (e.g., ImageNet) and lack a robust definition of reality; argues for rethinking what counts as real images and for the creation of new benchmarks.

Conclusion: Calls for a technical, operational definition of real images and for new benchmark datasets to guide fake-image detection research; suggests that the objective of detecting fake images must be revisited in light of evolving image formation technologies.

Abstract: The wide availability and low usability barrier of modern image generation
models has triggered the reasonable fear of criminal misconduct and negative
social implications. The machine learning community has been engaging this
problem with an extensive series of publications proposing algorithmic
solutions for the detection of "fake", e.g. entirely generated or partially
manipulated images. While there is undoubtedly some progress towards technical
solutions of the problem, we argue that current and prior work is focusing too
much on generative algorithms and "fake" data-samples, neglecting a clear
definition and data collection of "real" images. The fundamental question "what
is a real image?" might appear to be quite philosophical, but our analysis
shows that the development and evaluation of basically all current
"fake"-detection methods is relying on only a few, quite old low-resolution
datasets of "real" images like ImageNet. However, the technology for the
acquisition of "real" images, aka taking photos, has drastically evolved over
the last decade: Today, over 90% of all photographs are produced by smartphones
which typically use algorithms to compute an image from multiple inputs (over
time) from multiple sensors. Based on the fact that these image formation
algorithms are typically neural network architectures which are closely related
to "fake"-image generators, we state the position that today, we need to
re-think the concept of "real" images. The purpose of this position paper is to
raise the awareness of the current shortcomings in this active field of
research and to trigger an open discussion whether the detection of "fake"
images is a sound objective at all. At the very least, we need a clear
technical definition of "real" images and new benchmark datasets.

*Boyang Liu,Yifan Hu,Senjie Jin,Shihan Dou,Gonglei Shi,Jie Shao,Tao Gui,Xuanjing Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Aes-R1 introduces an aesthetic reasoning framework for multimodal LLMs that combines a data-generation pipeline (AesCoT) for high-quality chain-of-thought explanations and a reinforcement learning algorithm (RAPO) that optimizes both absolute score accuracy and relative ranking, yielding substantial gains in aesthetic scoring and robust generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Aesthetic judgment is highly subjective and data-scarce in multimodal settings. There is a need for interpretable, reliable scoring and reasoning to improve MLLMs’ image aesthetics assessment across images and contexts.

Method: Aes-R1 uses AesCoT to construct and filter high-quality chain-of-thought aesthetic reasoning data for cold-start. The model is trained to produce structured explanations before scoring. It then employs RAPO, a novel RL algorithm that jointly optimizes absolute score regression and relative ranking order, improving per-image accuracy and cross-image preferences.

Result: The approach improves the backbone’s average PLCC and SRCC by 47.9% and 34.8%, respectively, surpassing state-of-the-art baselines of similar size. Ablations show robust generalization under limited supervision and in out-of-distribution scenarios.

Conclusion: Aes-R1 enables MLLMs to generate grounded explanations alongside faithful scores, enhancing both aesthetic scoring and reasoning within a unified framework.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are well suited to image aesthetic
assessment, as they can capture high-level aesthetic features leveraging their
cross-modal understanding capacity. However, the scarcity of multimodal
aesthetic reasoning data and the inherently subjective nature of aesthetic
judgment make it difficult for MLLMs to generate accurate aesthetic judgments
with interpretable rationales. To this end, we propose Aes-R1, a comprehensive
aesthetic reasoning framework with reinforcement learning (RL). Concretely,
Aes-R1 integrates a pipeline, AesCoT, to construct and filter high-quality
chain-of-thought aesthetic reasoning data used for cold-start. After teaching
the model to generate structured explanations prior to scoring, we then employ
the Relative-Absolute Policy Optimization (RAPO), a novel RL algorithm that
jointly optimizes absolute score regression and relative ranking order,
improving both per-image accuracy and cross-image preference judgments. Aes-R1
enables MLLMs to generate grounded explanations alongside faithful scores,
thereby enhancing aesthetic scoring and reasoning in a unified framework.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that Aes-R1 improves the backbone's average
PLCC/SRCC by 47.9%/34.8%, surpassing state-of-the-art baselines of similar
size. More ablation studies validate Aes-R1's robust generalization under
limited supervision and in out-of-distribution scenarios.

*Liyang Chen,Tianze Zhou,Xu He,Boshi Tang,Zhiyong Wu,Yang Huang,Yang Wu,Zhongqian Sun,Wei Yang,Helen Meng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A diffusion-based visual dubbing method, StableDub, integrates lip-habit-aware control with occlusion-robust inpainting to improve lip-sync accuracy and visual fidelity under occlusions, using a hybrid Mamba-Transformer on Stable Diffusion for efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current audio-driven dubbing struggles to capture speaker-specific lip habits with audio-only inputs, and traditional blind-inpainting often yields artifacts under occlusions (e.g., microphones, hands), hindering real-world deployment.

Method: Build on Stable-Diffusion with a lip-habit-modulated mechanism that jointly models phonemic synchronization and speaker-specific orofacial dynamics. Employ an occlusion-aware training strategy that exposes occluders to the inpainting process. Introduce a hybrid Mamba-Transformer architecture to boost efficiency, enabling effective diffusion-based training, and avoid reliance on costly priors.

Result: StableDub achieves superior lip-habit resemblance and occlusion robustness, and yields improvements in audio-lip synchronization, video quality, and resolution consistency compared to existing methods; demonstrates practical efficiency and broad applicability, with demos available online.

Conclusion: By fusing lip-habit modeling with occlusion-robust synthesis on a diffusion backbone, StableDub expands the applicability of visual dubbing, offering improved realism and robustness, particularly in low-resource settings, without the need for expensive priors.

Abstract: The visual dubbing task aims to generate mouth movements synchronized with
the driving audio, which has seen significant progress in recent years.
However, two critical deficiencies hinder their wide application: (1)
Audio-only driving paradigms inadequately capture speaker-specific lip habits,
which fail to generate lip movements similar to the target avatar; (2)
Conventional blind-inpainting approaches frequently produce visual artifacts
when handling obstructions (e.g., microphones, hands), limiting practical
deployment. In this paper, we propose StableDub, a novel and concise framework
integrating lip-habit-aware modeling with occlusion-robust synthesis.
Specifically, building upon the Stable-Diffusion backbone, we develop a
lip-habit-modulated mechanism that jointly models phonemic audio-visual
synchronization and speaker-specific orofacial dynamics. To achieve plausible
lip geometries and object appearances under occlusion, we introduce the
occlusion-aware training strategy by explicitly exposing the occlusion objects
to the inpainting process. By incorporating the proposed designs, the model
eliminates the necessity for cost-intensive priors in previous methods, thereby
exhibiting superior training efficiency on the computationally intensive
diffusion-based backbone. To further optimize training efficiency from the
perspective of model architecture, we introduce a hybrid Mamba-Transformer
architecture, which demonstrates the enhanced applicability in low-resource
research scenarios. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that StableDub
achieves superior performance in lip habit resemblance and occlusion
robustness. Our method also surpasses other methods in audio-lip sync, video
quality, and resolution consistency. We expand the applicability of visual
dubbing methods from comprehensive aspects, and demo videos can be found at

*Minjun Kang,Inkyu Shin,Taeyeop Lee,In So Kweon,Kuk-Jin Yoon*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Drag4D provides an end-to-end, interactive framework to control 3D object motion inside text-driven 3D scenes, from a single image, using a three-stage pipeline and a motion-conditioned diffusion model for temporal coherence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text-to-3D methods often struggle to integrate user-controlled object motion with high-quality backgrounds and to maintain view-consistent temporal coherence; the approach seeks a unified pipeline that inserts a moving object into a single-image-derived 3D scene.

Method: Stage 1: improve background via 2D Gaussian Splatting with panoramic images and inpainted novel views for dense 3D reconstructions. Stage 2: from a reference image, perform 3D copy-and-paste by reconstructing the target object into a full 3D mesh with an off-the-shelf image-to-3D model and embedding it into the scene, using physics-aware object position learning for spatial alignment. Stage 3: animate the object along a user-defined 3D trajectory, aided by a part-augmented, motion-conditioned video diffusion model that processes multiview image pairs with their projected 2D trajectories to reduce motion hallucination and ensure temporal consistency.

Result: Demonstrates improved harmony between object motion and a high-quality 3D background, with effective background reconstruction, seamless object insertion, precise placement, and temporally coherent motion across evaluated stages and final renderings.

Conclusion:  Drag4D presents a unified, interactive pipeline for motion-controlled 3D scene generation from a single image, combining advanced 3D background reconstruction, physics-aware object placement, and motion-conditioned diffusion to achieve view-consistent, user-guided object motion within 3D scenes.

Abstract: We introduce Drag4D, an interactive framework that integrates object motion
control within text-driven 3D scene generation. This framework enables users to
define 3D trajectories for the 3D objects generated from a single image,
seamlessly integrating them into a high-quality 3D background. Our Drag4D
pipeline consists of three stages. First, we enhance text-to-3D background
generation by applying 2D Gaussian Splatting with panoramic images and
inpainted novel views, resulting in dense and visually complete 3D
reconstructions. In the second stage, given a reference image of the target
object, we introduce a 3D copy-and-paste approach: the target instance is
extracted in a full 3D mesh using an off-the-shelf image-to-3D model and
seamlessly composited into the generated 3D scene. The object mesh is then
positioned within the 3D scene via our physics-aware object position learning,
ensuring precise spatial alignment. Lastly, the spatially aligned object is
temporally animated along a user-defined 3D trajectory. To mitigate motion
hallucination and ensure view-consistent temporal alignment, we develop a
part-augmented, motion-conditioned video diffusion model that processes
multiview image pairs together with their projected 2D trajectories. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of our unified architecture through evaluations
at each stage and in the final results, showcasing the harmonized alignment of
user-controlled object motion within a high-quality 3D background.

*Jibin Song,Mingi Kwon,Jaeseok Jeong,Youngjung Uh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Syncphony is a high-quality audio-to-video generation method that achieves synchronized 380×640 resolution at 24fps using two innovations: a Motion-aware Loss and Audio Sync Guidance, plus a new CycleSync evaluation metric. It outperforms baselines on AVSync15 and The Greatest Hits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current audio-to-video (A2V) models struggle with fine-grained synchronization due to indirect conditioning and limited temporal modeling. Audio provides temporal cues that could tightly synchronize motion, but effectively leveraging them without compromising visual quality remains challenging.

Method: The approach builds on a pre-trained video backbone and adds two components: (1) Motion-aware Loss, which emphasizes learning in high-motion regions to improve temporal alignment; (2) Audio Sync Guidance, which guides the full model using a visually aligned off-sync model without audio layers to better exploit audio cues at inference while preserving visual quality. It also introduces CycleSync, a video-to-audio-based metric that measures how well motion cues in the generated video can reconstruct the original audio. Experiments on AVSync15 and The Greatest Hits datasets demonstrate improved synchronization and visual quality.

Result: Syncphony outperforms existing methods in both synchronization accuracy and visual quality on AVSync15 and The Greatest Hits.

Conclusion: The proposed Motion-aware Loss and Audio Sync Guidance enable temporally precise, high-quality audio-driven video generation, supported by a new CycleSync metric. A project page is provided for further details.

Abstract: Text-to-video and image-to-video generation have made rapid progress in
visual quality, but they remain limited in controlling the precise timing of
motion. In contrast, audio provides temporal cues aligned with video motion,
making it a promising condition for temporally controlled video generation.
However, existing audio-to-video (A2V) models struggle with fine-grained
synchronization due to indirect conditioning mechanisms or limited temporal
modeling capacity. We present Syncphony, which generates 380x640 resolution,
24fps videos synchronized with diverse audio inputs. Our approach builds upon a
pre-trained video backbone and incorporates two key components to improve
synchronization: (1) Motion-aware Loss, which emphasizes learning at
high-motion regions; (2) Audio Sync Guidance, which guides the full model using
a visually aligned off-sync model without audio layers to better exploit audio
cues at inference while maintaining visual quality. To evaluate
synchronization, we propose CycleSync, a video-to-audio-based metric that
measures the amount of motion cues in the generated video to reconstruct the
original audio. Experiments on AVSync15 and The Greatest Hits datasets
demonstrate that Syncphony outperforms existing methods in both synchronization
accuracy and visual quality. Project page is available at:

*Yixiao Liu,Yizhou Yang,Jinwen Li,Jun Tao,Ruoyu Li,Xiangkun Wang,Min Zhu,Junlong Cheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduces LG-CD, a language-guided change detection model for remote sensing that uses text prompts to steer attention and fuse vision with language for more accurate change detection across three benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RSCD methods are largely unimodal and overlook semantic cues from text. Incorporating natural language prompts can guide the model to focus on target change regions, improving accuracy and robustness and enabling better generalization.

Method: LG-CD uses a visual foundation model (SAM2) to extract multi-scale pyramid features from bi-temporal RS images. It adds multi-layer adapters for task-specific fine-tuning, a Text Fusion Attention Module (TFAM) to align and fuse text with visuals, and a Vision-Semantic Fusion Decoder (V-SFD) with cross-attention to produce change masks. Training and evaluation on LEVIR-CD, WHU-CD, and SYSU-CD datasets show improved performance over state-of-the-art methods.

Result: LG-CD consistently outperforms state-of-the-art change detection methods on three standard RSCD datasets, demonstrating improved accuracy, robustness, and potential for generalized, multimodal change detection using text prompts.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the viability and benefits of multimodal (vision-language) guidance for RSCD. It suggests that leveraging textual prompts with a strong visual backbone can enhance generalization and accuracy, and points to future work in expanding prompts and multimodal fusion for broader RS tasks.

Abstract: Remote Sensing Change Detection (RSCD) typically identifies changes in land
cover or surface conditions by analyzing multi-temporal images. Currently, most
deep learning-based methods primarily focus on learning unimodal visual
information, while neglecting the rich semantic information provided by
multimodal data such as text. To address this limitation, we propose a novel
Language-Guided Change Detection model (LG-CD). This model leverages natural
language prompts to direct the network's attention to regions of interest,
significantly improving the accuracy and robustness of change detection.
Specifically, LG-CD utilizes a visual foundational model (SAM2) as a feature
extractor to capture multi-scale pyramid features from high-resolution to
low-resolution across bi-temporal remote sensing images. Subsequently,
multi-layer adapters are employed to fine-tune the model for downstream tasks,
ensuring its effectiveness in remote sensing change detection. Additionally, we
design a Text Fusion Attention Module (TFAM) to align visual and textual
information, enabling the model to focus on target change regions using text
prompts. Finally, a Vision-Semantic Fusion Decoder (V-SFD) is implemented,
which deeply integrates visual and semantic information through a
cross-attention mechanism to produce highly accurate change detection masks.
Our experiments on three datasets (LEVIR-CD, WHU-CD, and SYSU-CD) demonstrate
that LG-CD consistently outperforms state-of-the-art change detection methods.
Furthermore, our approach provides new insights into achieving generalized
change detection by leveraging multimodal information.

TL;DR: A unified diffusion-based framework enabling joint text- and drag-driven image editing, introducing Point-Cloud Deterministic Drag and Drag-Text Guided Denoising for flexible, high-fidelity editing across text-only, drag-only, or combined conditions.


<details>

Motivation: Text-driven editing excels at texture manipulation but lacks precise spatial control, while drag-driven editing offers strong spatial control but limited texture guidance. A unified approach aims to combine strengths and mitigate weaknesses.

Method: Two key innovations: (1) Point-Cloud Deterministic Drag, which uses 3D feature mapping to improve latent-space layout control; (2) Drag-Text Guided Denoising, which dynamically balances the influence of drag and text conditions during denoising. The framework supports text-only, drag-only, and combined editing modes within a diffusion-based pipeline.

Result: Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments show high-fidelity joint editing and competitive performance with specialized text-only or drag-only methods, demonstrating versatility and generalizability. Code will be released for reproducibility.

Conclusion: Proposes a versatile, generalizable solution for controllable image manipulation that effectively merges text and drag cues, enabling flexible editing modes and strong performance across settings.

Abstract: This paper explores image editing under the joint control of text and drag
interactions. While recent advances in text-driven and drag-driven editing have
achieved remarkable progress, they suffer from complementary limitations:
text-driven methods excel in texture manipulation but lack precise spatial
control, whereas drag-driven approaches primarily modify shape and structure
without fine-grained texture guidance. To address these limitations, we propose
a unified diffusion-based framework for joint drag-text image editing,
integrating the strengths of both paradigms. Our framework introduces two key
innovations: (1) Point-Cloud Deterministic Drag, which enhances latent-space
layout control through 3D feature mapping, and (2) Drag-Text Guided Denoising,
dynamically balancing the influence of drag and text conditions during
denoising. Notably, our model supports flexible editing modes - operating with
text-only, drag-only, or combined conditions - while maintaining strong
performance in each setting. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments
demonstrate that our method not only achieves high-fidelity joint editing but
also matches or surpasses the performance of specialized text-only or drag-only
approaches, establishing a versatile and generalizable solution for
controllable image manipulation. Code will be made publicly available to
reproduce all results presented in this work.

*Boying Li,Chang Liu,Petter Kyösti,Mattias Öhman,Devashish Singha Roy,Sofia Plazzi,Hamam Mokayed,Olle Hagner*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes sideload-CL-adaptation: using contrastive pretraining on unlabeled UAV data to improve lightweight vehicle detection by sideloading a representation extractor into a frozen detection backbone, showing 3.8–9.5% mAP50 gains on the NVD dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Remote sensing vehicle detection faces small targets, computation cost, and strong domain shifts due to snow coverage; annotated data is expensive, so leveraging unlabeled data is desirable.

Method: Pretrain a CNN-based representation extractor with contrastive learning on unlabeled UAV data, then sideload it into a frozen YOLO backbone during fine-tuning. Extensive experiments compare fusion methods and granularity to identify robust sideload-CL-adaptation.

Result: Demoed performance gains of 3.8% to 9.5% in mAP50 on the NVD dataset compared to baselines.

Conclusion: Sideload-CL-adaptation effectively leverages unlabeled data to boost lightweight detector performance under snow-domain drift, offering a practical approach for UAV-based vehicle detection.

Abstract: Aside from common challenges in remote sensing like small, sparse targets and
computation cost limitations, detecting vehicles from UAV images in the Nordic
regions faces strong visibility challenges and domain shifts caused by diverse
levels of snow coverage. Although annotated data are expensive, unannotated
data is cheaper to obtain by simply flying the drones. In this work, we
proposed a sideload-CL-adaptation framework that enables the use of unannotated
data to improve vehicle detection using lightweight models. Specifically, we
propose to train a CNN-based representation extractor through contrastive
learning on the unannotated data in the pretraining stage, and then sideload it
to a frozen YOLO11n backbone in the fine-tuning stage. To find a robust
sideload-CL-adaptation, we conducted extensive experiments to compare various
fusion methods and granularity. Our proposed sideload-CL-adaptation model
improves the detection performance by 3.8% to 9.5% in terms of mAP50 on the NVD
dataset.

*Xianghao Kong,Hansheng Chen,Yuwei Guo,Lvmin Zhang,Gordon Wetzstein,Maneesh Agrawala,Anyi Rao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: IF-V2V is an inversion-free method that adapts image-to-video flow-based models for video editing with low overhead, using vector-field rectification, motion-structure-preserving initialization, and deviation caching to ensure quality and temporal consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Video editing with image-conditioned I2V models suffers from the need for inversion or heavy optimization, hindering real-time or lightweight transfer of powerful image editing capabilities to video. A model-agnostic, inversion-free approach is needed to leverage up-to-date I2V models for coherent video edits.

Method: Propose IF-V2V: an inversion-free framework that uses (1) Vector Field Rectification with Sample Deviation to inject source-video information into the denoising vector field, (2) Structure-and-Motion-Preserving Initialization to generate motion-aware, structurally informed noise for temporally coherent edits, and (3) Deviation Caching to reduce extra denoising cost, enabling plug-and-play use with off-the-shelf flow-matching I2V models.

Result: Empirical evaluations show improved editing quality and temporal consistency compared with existing inversion-based or optimization-heavy methods, with low additional computational overhead, enabling a lightweight, plug-and-play path for leveraging modern I2V models in video editing.

Conclusion: IF-V2V offers a practical inversion-free solution that preserves structure and motion while adapting current I2V models for video editing, delivering higher quality, more consistent edits with modest compute and broad applicability.

Abstract: Although image editing techniques have advanced significantly, video editing,
which aims to manipulate videos according to user intent, remains an emerging
challenge. Most existing image-conditioned video editing methods either require
inversion with model-specific design or need extensive optimization, limiting
their capability of leveraging up-to-date image-to-video (I2V) models to
transfer the editing capability of image editing models to the video domain. To
this end, we propose IF-V2V, an Inversion-Free method that can adapt
off-the-shelf flow-matching-based I2V models for video editing without
significant computational overhead. To circumvent inversion, we devise Vector
Field Rectification with Sample Deviation to incorporate information from the
source video into the denoising process by introducing a deviation term into
the denoising vector field. To further ensure consistency with the source video
in a model-agnostic way, we introduce Structure-and-Motion-Preserving
Initialization to generate motion-aware temporally correlated noise with
structural information embedded. We also present a Deviation Caching mechanism
to minimize the additional computational cost for denoising vector
rectification without significantly impacting editing quality. Evaluations
demonstrate that our method achieves superior editing quality and consistency
over existing approaches, offering a lightweight plug-and-play solution to
realize visual creativity.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A self-supervised MVC framework that uses neural volumetric rendering to learn implicit scene geometry and view-dependent appearance, achieving state-of-the-art results and strong data efficiency (competitive with 70% of training data).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reduce dependence on large annotated datasets in multi-view counting by leveraging self-supervised learning and differentiable rendering to capture geometry and appearance, enabling flexible integration with existing MVC pipelines.

Method: Learn an implicit scene representation via neural volumetric rendering; reconstruct continuous geometry and 2D projections through differentiable rendering within a self-supervised objective; designed to be easily integrated into existing MVC architectures.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performances on multiple MVC benchmarks and demonstrates strong data efficiency by performing competitively with only 70% of the training data.

Conclusion: SSLCounter provides a versatile SSL-based solution for MVC that reduces annotation requirements while delivering high accuracy, and can be plugged into existing MVC systems.

Abstract: Multi-view counting (MVC) methods have attracted significant research
attention and stimulated remarkable progress in recent years. Despite their
success, most MVC methods have focused on improving performance by following
the fully supervised learning (FSL) paradigm, which often requires large
amounts of annotated data. In this work, we propose SSLCounter, a novel
self-supervised learning (SSL) framework for MVC that leverages neural
volumetric rendering to alleviate the reliance on large-scale annotated
datasets. SSLCounter learns an implicit representation w.r.t. the scene,
enabling the reconstruction of continuous geometry shape and the complex,
view-dependent appearance of their 2D projections via differential neural
rendering. Owing to its inherent flexibility, the key idea of our method can be
seamlessly integrated into exsiting frameworks. Notably, extensive experiments
demonstrate that SSLCounter not only demonstrates state-of-the-art performances
but also delivers competitive performance with only using 70% proportion of
training data, showcasing its superior data efficiency across multiple MVC
benchmarks.

### [79] [Spatial Reasoning in Foundation Models: Benchmarking Object-Centric Spatial Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21922)
*Vahid Mirjalili,Ramin Giahi,Sriram Kollipara,Akshay Kekuda,Kehui Yao,Kai Zhao,Jianpeng Xu,Kaushiki Nag,Sinduja Subramaniam,Topojoy Biswas,Evren Korpeoglu,Kannan Achan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A synthetic-object-centric spatial-reasoning benchmark for foundation models reveals a trade-off: detectors (e.g., GroundingDINO, OWLv2) excel at localization but lack relational reasoning, while large VLMs (e.g., GPT-4o, SmolVLM) offer fluent captions and layout cues but struggle with fine-grained spatial context, highlighting a gap between localization and true spatial understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Spatial understanding is essential for scene comprehension beyond object recognition. Existing benchmarks focus on localization accuracy, not on how objects relate, arrange, or depth-order within a scene. The work argues that robust vision foundations require evaluating and improving relational and spatial reasoning capabilities.

Method: Introduce a systematic benchmark for object-centric spatial reasoning using a controlled synthetic dataset. Evaluate state-of-the-art detectors (GroundingDINO, Florence-2, OWLv2) and large VLMs (InternVL, LLaVA, GPT-4o) on three tasks: spatial localization, spatial reasoning, and downstream retrieval.

Result: Detectors provide precise object boxes but limited relational reasoning; large VLMs supply coarse layout cues and fluent captions yet struggle with fine-grained spatial context. A stable trade-off emerges: current models do not equally excel at localization and relational/spatial understanding.

Conclusion: There is a persistent gap between localization and true spatial understanding in foundation models. The community needs spatially-aware foundation models and benchmarks that explicitly evaluate relational and depth-related spatial reasoning.

Abstract: Spatial understanding is a critical capability for vision foundation models.
While recent advances in large vision models or vision-language models (VLMs)
have expanded recognition capabilities, most benchmarks emphasize localization
accuracy rather than whether models capture how objects are arranged and
related within a scene. This gap is consequential; effective scene
understanding requires not only identifying objects, but reasoning about their
relative positions, groupings, and depth. In this paper, we present a
systematic benchmark for object-centric spatial reasoning in foundation models.
Using a controlled synthetic dataset, we evaluate state-of-the-art vision
models (e.g., GroundingDINO, Florence-2, OWLv2) and large VLMs (e.g., InternVL,
LLaVA, GPT-4o) across three tasks: spatial localization, spatial reasoning, and
downstream retrieval tasks. We find a stable trade-off: detectors such as
GroundingDINO and OWLv2 deliver precise boxes with limited relational
reasoning, while VLMs like SmolVLM and GPT-4o provide coarse layout cues and
fluent captions but struggle with fine-grained spatial context. Our study
highlights the gap between localization and true spatial understanding, and
pointing toward the need for spatially-aware foundation models in the
community.

*Jiahao Zhang,Bowen Wang,Hong Liu,Yuta Nakashima,Hajime Nagahara*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PANICL is a training-free patch-based k-NN VICL framework that uses multiple in-context image pairs to smooth assignment scores, reducing bias and improving performance and robustness across diverse vision tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In-context learning for vision (VICL) can be overly dependent on a single in-context pair, leading to biased and unstable predictions. A simple, training-free approach that leverages multiple in-context examples to stabilize predictions and generalize across tasks is needed.

Method: PANICL introduces a patch-based k-NN VICL framework that uses multiple in-context pairs. It computes assignment scores for each pair and applies smoothing across pairs to reduce bias. It does not require additional training and can be plugged into existing VICL backbones. It is evaluated on tasks including foreground segmentation, single object detection, colorization, multi-object segmentation, and keypoint detection, showing robustness to domain shifts (e.g., COCO→Pascal) and label-space shifts (e.g., FSS-1000), and generalizes to VICL models like SegGPT, Painter, and LVM.

Result: PANICL yields consistent improvements over strong baselines across a broad set of vision tasks. It demonstrates robustness to domain shifts (dataset-level and label-space shifts) and generalizes to multiple VICL backbones and models, indicating wide applicability.

Conclusion: PANICL provides a simple, training-free method to enhance VICL by leveraging multiple in-context pairs and smoothing their scores. This approach reduces bias, improves stability, and enhances cross-domain generalization across diverse vision tasks and architectures.

Abstract: Visual In-Context Learning (VICL) uses input-output image pairs, referred to
as in-context pairs (or examples), as prompts alongside query images to guide
models in performing diverse vision tasks. However, VICL often suffers from
over-reliance on a single in-context pair, which can lead to biased and
unstable predictions. We introduce PAtch-based $k$-Nearest neighbor visual
In-Context Learning (PANICL), a general training-free framework that mitigates
this issue by leveraging multiple in-context pairs. PANICL smooths assignment
scores across pairs, reducing bias without requiring additional training.
Extensive experiments on a variety of tasks, including foreground segmentation,
single object detection, colorization, multi-object segmentation, and keypoint
detection, demonstrate consistent improvements over strong baselines. Moreover,
PANICL exhibits strong robustness to domain shifts, including dataset-level
shift (e.g., from COCO to Pascal) and label-space shift (e.g., FSS-1000), and
generalizes well to other VICL models such as SegGPT, Painter, and LVM,
highlighting its versatility and broad applicability.

### [81] [SingRef6D: Monocular Novel Object Pose Estimation with a Single RGB Reference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21927)
*Jiahui Wang,Haiyue Zhu,Haoren Guo,Abdullah Al Mamun,Cheng Xiang,Tong Heng Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SingRef6D is a lightweight RGB-only pipeline for 6D pose estimation that uses a single RGB reference image, avoiding depth sensors, multi-view setups, or neural fields. It introduces a token-scaler-based fine-tuning on Depth-Anything v2 to improve depth prediction and a depth-aware matching extension within LoFTR, yielding state-of-the-art pose estimation results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 6D pose methods rely on depth sensors or dense templates, which fail on challenging surfaces (transparent/reflective) or in low-light/texture-less scenes. RGB-only approaches struggle due to limited geometry cues. There is a need for robust, resource-efficient RGB-based pose estimation that does not require depth, multi-view data, or view synthesis.

Method: Proposes a token-scaler-based fine-tuning mechanism with a novel optimization loss on top of Depth-Anything v2 to enhance depth prediction for difficult surfaces. Adds a depth-aware matching process that leverages depth to augment LoFTR's spatial reasoning. Operates with a single RGB image as reference and does not rely on training view synthesis or neural fields.

Result: 14.41% improvement in delta_1.05 depth prediction on REAL275 over Depth-Anything v2 with a fine-tuned head. Also achieves 6.1% improvement in average recall across REAL275, ClearPose, and Toyota-Light datasets.

Conclusion: SingRef6D enables robust and efficient 6D pose estimation in resource-limited settings without depth sensors or dense templates, by combining improved depth prediction with depth-aware matching. It surpasses state-of-the-art methods on multiple datasets, demonstrating strong performance under challenging materials and lighting.

Abstract: Recent 6D pose estimation methods demonstrate notable performance but still
face some practical limitations. For instance, many of them rely heavily on
sensor depth, which may fail with challenging surface conditions, such as
transparent or highly reflective materials. In the meantime, RGB-based
solutions provide less robust matching performance in low-light and
texture-less scenes due to the lack of geometry information. Motivated by
these, we propose SingRef6D, a lightweight pipeline requiring only a single RGB
image as a reference, eliminating the need for costly depth sensors, multi-view
image acquisition, or training view synthesis models and neural fields. This
enables SingRef6D to remain robust and capable even under resource-limited
settings where depth or dense templates are unavailable. Our framework
incorporates two key innovations. First, we propose a token-scaler-based
fine-tuning mechanism with a novel optimization loss on top of Depth-Anything
v2 to enhance its ability to predict accurate depth, even for challenging
surfaces. Our results show a 14.41% improvement (in $\delta_{1.05}$) on REAL275
depth prediction compared to Depth-Anything v2 (with fine-tuned head). Second,
benefiting from depth availability, we introduce a depth-aware matching process
that effectively integrates spatial relationships within LoFTR, enabling our
system to handle matching for challenging materials and lighting conditions.
Evaluations of pose estimation on the REAL275, ClearPose, and Toyota-Light
datasets show that our approach surpasses state-of-the-art methods, achieving a
6.1% improvement in average recall.

### [82] [SemanticControl: A Training-Free Approach for Handling Loosely Aligned Visual Conditions in ControlNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21938)
*Woosung Joung,Daewon Chae,Jinkyu Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SemanticControl is a training-free method that enables ControlNet to leverage misaligned but semantically relevant visual conditions by extracting informative attention masks from a surrogate prompt aligned to the condition and applying these masks during denoising of the actual target prompt, improving text fidelity under loosely aligned conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ControlNet struggles when available visual conditions are not precisely aligned with the user’s prompt, particularly for uncommon or imaginative scenes. There is a need to exploit semantically related cues without retraining or collecting perfectly aligned visual data.

Method: 1) Run an auxiliary denoising pass using a surrogate prompt that aligns with the visual condition (e.g., 'a human playing guitar' for a human-pose input). 2) Extract informative attention masks from this pass. 3) Use these masks to guide the denoising of the actual target prompt, suppressing guidance from the visual condition when it conflicts with the prompt and strengthening text guidance. This approach is training-free and applicable to depth maps, edge maps, and skeletons.

Result: Empirical evaluation shows improved performance with loosely aligned visual conditions across various inputs (depth, edge maps, human skeletons) and outperforms baselines designed for aligned conditions. Code released.

Conclusion: SemanticControl enables effective use of misaligned but semantically related cues for diffusion models without additional training, enhancing text fidelity and reducing artifacts when visual conditions do not perfectly match the target prompt.

Abstract: ControlNet has enabled detailed spatial control in text-to-image diffusion
models by incorporating additional visual conditions such as depth or edge
maps. However, its effectiveness heavily depends on the availability of visual
conditions that are precisely aligned with the generation goal specified by
text prompt-a requirement that often fails in practice, especially for uncommon
or imaginative scenes. For example, generating an image of a cat cooking in a
specific pose may be infeasible due to the lack of suitable visual conditions.
In contrast, structurally similar cues can often be found in more common
settings-for instance, poses of humans cooking are widely available and can
serve as rough visual guides. Unfortunately, existing ControlNet models
struggle to use such loosely aligned visual conditions, often resulting in low
text fidelity or visual artifacts. To address this limitation, we propose
SemanticControl, a training-free method for effectively leveraging misaligned
but semantically relevant visual conditions. Our approach adaptively suppresses
the influence of the visual condition where it conflicts with the prompt, while
strengthening guidance from the text. The key idea is to first run an auxiliary
denoising process using a surrogate prompt aligned with the visual condition
(e.g., "a human playing guitar" for a human pose condition) to extract
informative attention masks, and then utilize these masks during the denoising
of the actual target prompt (e.g., cat playing guitar). Experimental results
demonstrate that our method improves performance under loosely aligned
conditions across various conditions, including depth maps, edge maps, and
human skeletons, outperforming existing baselines. Our code is available at

*Daiqing Wu,Dongbao Yang,Sicheng Zhao,Can Ma,Yu Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduces an Emotion Statement Judgment task and an automated pipeline to evaluate visual emotion understanding in MLLMs, showing context-based emotion interpretation improves, but perception subjectivity remains challenging, with GPT-4o lagging behind humans.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Inconsistent evidence on MLLMs' emotion perception due to evaluation biases: narrow emotional taxonomies, neglect of context, unseen plausible responses, and labor-intensive annotations.

Method: 1) Propose Emotion Statement Judgment task for flexible, context-aware emotion evaluation. 2) Build an automated pipeline to generate emotion-centric statements with minimal human input. 3) Systematically evaluate leading MLLMs across tasks.

Result: MLLMs show stronger performance in emotion interpretation and context-based emotion judgment, but have notable limitations in perceiving emotion subjectivity. Even top models like GPT-4o underperform humans, highlighting gaps for future work.

Conclusion: Provides a foundational evaluation framework and comprehensive MLLM assessment to advance emotional intelligence in multimodal models; includes a project page for replication and extension.

Abstract: Recently, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved exceptional
performance across diverse tasks, continually surpassing previous expectations
regarding their capabilities. Nevertheless, their proficiency in perceiving
emotions from images remains debated, with studies yielding divergent results
in zero-shot scenarios. We argue that this inconsistency stems partly from
constraints in existing evaluation methods, including the oversight of
plausible responses, limited emotional taxonomies, neglect of contextual
factors, and labor-intensive annotations. To facilitate customized visual
emotion evaluation for MLLMs, we propose an Emotion Statement Judgment task
that overcomes these constraints. Complementing this task, we devise an
automated pipeline that efficiently constructs emotion-centric statements with
minimal human effort. Through systematically evaluating prevailing MLLMs, our
study showcases their stronger performance in emotion interpretation and
context-based emotion judgment, while revealing relative limitations in
comprehending perception subjectivity. When compared to humans, even
top-performing MLLMs like GPT4o demonstrate remarkable performance gaps,
underscoring key areas for future improvement. By developing a fundamental
evaluation framework and conducting a comprehensive MLLM assessment, we hope
this work contributes to advancing emotional intelligence in MLLMs. Project

*Tao Wu,Yibo Jiang,Yehao Lu,Zhizhong Wang,Zeyi Huang,Zequn Qin,Xi Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MultiCrafter proposes explicit attention separation, a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture, and online reinforcement learning to improve fidelity and human-preference alignment in multi-subject image generation, addressing attribute leakage and misalignment in prior reconstruction-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multi-subject generation methods rely on simple reconstruction-based objectives, leading to severe attribute leakage (loss of subject fidelity) and misalignment with nuanced human preferences due to entangled attention across subjects.

Method: Introduce explicit positional supervision to separate attention regions per subject, employ a Mixture-of-Experts architecture to handle diverse scenarios, and adopt an online reinforcement learning framework with a scoring mechanism to align with human preferences and stabilize MoE training.

Result: Experiments show significant improvements in subject fidelity and better alignment with human preferences compared to baselines.

Conclusion: MultiCrafter effectively mitigates attribute leakage, enhances subject fidelity, and achieves better preference alignment through explicit attention separation, MoE capacity, and preference-guided RL.

Abstract: Multi-subject image generation aims to synthesize user-provided subjects in a
single image while preserving subject fidelity, ensuring prompt consistency,
and aligning with human aesthetic preferences. However, existing methods,
particularly those built on the In-Context-Learning paradigm, are limited by
their reliance on simple reconstruction-based objectives, leading to both
severe attribute leakage that compromises subject fidelity and failing to align
with nuanced human preferences. To address this, we propose MultiCrafter, a
framework that ensures high-fidelity, preference-aligned generation. First, we
find that the root cause of attribute leakage is a significant entanglement of
attention between different subjects during the generation process. Therefore,
we introduce explicit positional supervision to explicitly separate attention
regions for each subject, effectively mitigating attribute leakage. To enable
the model to accurately plan the attention region of different subjects in
diverse scenarios, we employ a Mixture-of-Experts architecture to enhance the
model's capacity, allowing different experts to focus on different scenarios.
Finally, we design a novel online reinforcement learning framework to align the
model with human preferences, featuring a scoring mechanism to accurately
assess multi-subject fidelity and a more stable training strategy tailored for
the MoE architecture. Experiments validate that our framework significantly
improves subject fidelity while aligning with human preferences better.

*Zhe Zhu,Le Wan,Rui Xu,Yiheng Zhang,Honghua Chen,Zhiyang Dou,Cheng Lin,Yuan Liu,Mingqiang Wei*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PartSAM is a promptable, 3D-native part segmentation model trained on 5M+ 3D shape-part pairs using a triplane dual-branch encoder. It enables open-world, surface-and-internal-structure decomposition with strong empirical gains over prior methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Open-world 3D part segmentation is difficult due to taxonomy constraints and reliance on 2D proxies. Existing approaches struggle to capture intrinsic geometry and generalize to unseen objects, as they lift 2D masks to 3D.

Method: A SAM-like encoder-decoder architecture with a triplane-based dual-branch encoder to produce spatially structured tokens for scalable part-aware representation learning. A model-in-the-loop annotation pipeline curates over 5 million 3D shape-part pairs from online assets to enable large-scale supervision. The system supports single-prompt part identification and a Segment-Every-Part mode that decomposes shapes into surface and internal structures.

Result: PartSAM achieves large-margin improvements over state-of-the-art methods on multiple benchmarks, demonstrating emergent open-world capabilities and effective 3D part understanding.

Conclusion: This work advances foundation-model-style capabilities for 3D part understanding and promises future releases of code and model to spur further research.

Abstract: Segmenting 3D objects into parts is a long-standing challenge in computer
vision. To overcome taxonomy constraints and generalize to unseen 3D objects,
recent works turn to open-world part segmentation. These approaches typically
transfer supervision from 2D foundation models, such as SAM, by lifting
multi-view masks into 3D. However, this indirect paradigm fails to capture
intrinsic geometry, leading to surface-only understanding, uncontrolled
decomposition, and limited generalization. We present PartSAM, the first
promptable part segmentation model trained natively on large-scale 3D data.
Following the design philosophy of SAM, PartSAM employs an encoder-decoder
architecture in which a triplane-based dual-branch encoder produces spatially
structured tokens for scalable part-aware representation learning. To enable
large-scale supervision, we further introduce a model-in-the-loop annotation
pipeline that curates over five million 3D shape-part pairs from online assets,
providing diverse and fine-grained labels. This combination of scalable
architecture and diverse 3D data yields emergent open-world capabilities: with
a single prompt, PartSAM achieves highly accurate part identification, and in a
Segment-Every-Part mode, it automatically decomposes shapes into both surface
and internal structures. Extensive experiments show that PartSAM outperforms
state-of-the-art methods by large margins across multiple benchmarks, marking a
decisive step toward foundation models for 3D part understanding. Our code and
model will be released soon.

*Javad Hassannataj Joloudari,Bita Mesbahzadeh,Omid Zare,Emrah Arslan,Roohallah Alizadehsani,Hossein Moosaei*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A deep learning framework for blind contrast IQA using fine-tuned EfficientNet B0, ResNet18, MobileNetV2 (and a Siamese variant); EfficientNet B0 achieves state-of-the-art on CCID2014 and CID2013 with PLCC/SRCC ~0.93–0.96; Siamese network less effective.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Contrast distortions degrade perceived image quality; NR IQA models struggle under diverse real-world conditions; need lightweight, real-time capable methods that can generalize.

Method: Fine-tune three pre-trained CNNs with a contrast-aware regression head; train end-to-end with targeted data augmentations on CID2013 and CCID2014; evaluate with PLCC and SRCC; also implement a Siamese network variant to assess perceptual contrast distortions.

Result: EfficientNet B0 achieved state-of-the-art performance: CCID2014 PLCC 0.9286 SRCC 0.9178; CID2013 PLCC 0.9581 SRCC 0.9369; outperforms traditional methods and other deep baselines; the other two architectures were less performing; Siamese model showed limited ability.

Conclusion: Contrast-aware adaptation of lightweight pre-trained networks provides a high-performing, scalable NR contrast IQA method suitable for real-time and resource-constrained applications; the approach is robust to distortions and outperforms existing baselines.

Abstract: Image contrast was a fundamental factor in visual perception and played a
vital role in overall image quality. However, most no reference image quality
assessment NR IQA models struggled to accurately evaluate contrast distortions
under diverse real world conditions. In this study, we proposed a deep learning
based framework for blind contrast quality assessment by customizing and
fine-tuning three pre trained architectures, EfficientNet B0, ResNet18, and
MobileNetV2, for perceptual Mean Opinion Score, along with an additional model
built on a Siamese network, which indicated a limited ability to capture
perceptual contrast distortions. Each model is modified with a contrast-aware
regression head and trained end to end using targeted data augmentations on two
benchmark datasets, CID2013 and CCID2014, containing synthetic and authentic
contrast distortions. Performance is evaluated using Pearson Linear Correlation
Coefficient and Spearman Rank Order Correlation Coefficient, which assess the
alignment between predicted and human rated scores. Among these three models,
our customized EfficientNet B0 model achieved state-of-the-art performance with
PLCC = 0.9286 and SRCC = 0.9178 on CCID2014 and PLCC = 0.9581 and SRCC = 0.9369
on CID2013, surpassing traditional methods and outperforming other deep
baselines. These results highlighted the models robustness and effectiveness in
capturing perceptual contrast distortion. Overall, the proposed method
demonstrated that contrast aware adaptation of lightweight pre trained networks
can yield a high performing, scalable solution for no reference contrast

*Zilun Zhang,Zian Guan,Tiancheng Zhao,Haozhan Shen,Tianyu Li,Yuxiang Cai,Zhonggen Su,Zhaojun Liu,Jianwei Yin,Xiang Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Geo-R1 proposes a reasoning-centric reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) paradigm for few-shot geospatial referring, where the model first generates explicit, interpretable reasoning chains to decompose referring expressions, then uses these rationales to localize targets, improving data efficiency, generalization, and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SFT with multimodal LLMs hinges on large labeled datasets; in remote sensing/geospatial domains labeled data are scarce, causing poor generalization. There is a need for data-efficient, interpretable reasoning that can transfer across tasks and datasets.

Method: Introduce Geo-R1, a reasoning-centric RFT framework. The model is trained to produce explicit reasoning chains that decompose referring expressions, followed by leveraging these rationales to perform object localization. The approach follows a 'reason first, then act' pipeline and is evaluated in few-shot geospatial referring benchmarks with cross-dataset generalization tests.

Result: Geo-R1 consistently and substantially outperforms supervised fine-tuning baselines on three carefully designed few-shot geospatial referring benchmarks and shows strong cross-dataset generalization, indicating robustness and improved data efficiency.

Conclusion: A reasoning-first, reinforcement fine-tuning paradigm can enhance generalization and interpretability for few-shot geospatial referring expressions, offering a data-efficient alternative to SFT. The authors plan to release code and data.

Abstract: Referring expression understanding in remote sensing poses unique challenges,
as it requires reasoning over complex object-context relationships. While
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on multimodal large language models achieves
strong performance with massive labeled datasets, they struggle in data-scarce
scenarios, leading to poor generalization. To address this limitation, we
propose Geo-R1, a reasoning-centric reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) paradigm
for few-shot geospatial referring. Geo-R1 enforces the model to first generate
explicit, interpretable reasoning chains that decompose referring expressions,
and then leverage these rationales to localize target objects. This "reason
first, then act" process enables the model to make more effective use of
limited annotations, enhances generalization, and provides interpretability. We
validate Geo-R1 on three carefully designed few-shot geospatial referring
benchmarks, where our model consistently and substantially outperforms SFT
baselines. It also demonstrates strong cross-dataset generalization,
highlighting its robustness. Code and data will be released at
http://geo-r1.github.io.

*Zikun Guo,Xinyue Xu,Pei Xiang,Shu Yang,Xin Han,Di Wang,Lijie Hu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Medical VLMs exhibit sycophancy; authors build a clinically grounded benchmark, reveal vulnerability to adversarial prompts, and propose VIPER mitigation to filter non-evidentiary content and anchor responses to evidence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To ensure medical VLMs reason from evidence rather than social cues; current models risk misleading clinicians with sycophantic or authority-aligned responses.

Method: Create a benchmark by integrating PathVQA, SLAKE, and VQA-RAD; stratify by organ system and modality; design psychologically motivated pressure templates to induce sycophancy; conduct adversarial prompts across multiple VLMs; analyze triggers and correlations with accuracy/size; develop VIPER to filter non-evidentiary content and generate evidence-first constrained answers.

Result: Models show vulnerability; adversarial responses vary significantly and weakly correlate with model accuracy or size; imitation and expert-correct prompts are particularly effective triggers; VIPER reduces sycophancy on average and preserves interpretability.

Conclusion: This work establishes a benchmark and mitigation framework for robust, evidence-based medical VLM deployment, highlighting the need for evidence-anchored defenses in clinician-facing AI.

Abstract: Vision language models(VLMs) are increasingly integrated into clinical
workflows, but they often exhibit sycophantic behavior prioritizing alignment
with user phrasing social cues or perceived authority over evidence based
reasoning. This study evaluate clinical sycophancy in medical visual question
answering through a novel clinically grounded benchmark. We propose a medical
sycophancy dataset construct from PathVQA, SLAKE, and VQA-RAD stratified by
different type organ system and modality. Using psychologically motivated
pressure templates including various sycophancy. In our adversarial experiments
on various VLMs, we found that these models are generally vulnerable,
exhibiting significant variations in the occurrence of adversarial responses,
with weak correlations to the model accuracy or size. Imitation and expert
provided corrections were found to be the most effective triggers, suggesting
that the models possess a bias mechanism independent of visual evidence. To
address this, we propose Visual Information Purification for Evidence based
Response (VIPER) a lightweight mitigation strategy that filters non evidentiary
content for example social pressures and then generates constrained evidence
first answers. This framework reduces sycophancy by an average amount
outperforming baselines while maintaining interpretability. Our benchmark
analysis and mitigation framework lay the groundwork for robust deployment of
medical VLMs in real world clinician interactions emphasizing the need for
evidence anchored defenses.

*Zeyu Wang,Baiyu Chen,Kun Yan,Hongjing Piao,Hao Xue,Flora D. Salim,Yuanchun Shi,Yuntao Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GLARIFY uses spatiotemporal gaze data to improve vision-language models for real-world query tasks with smart glasses, addressing ambiguity and noisy gaze via a GPT-4o–generated GLARIFY-Ambi dataset and a heatmap fusion module, outperforming baselines on hold-out tests.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Gaze-based attention can enhance VLMs but is noisy and ambiguous in real-world querying, especially with pronouns or missing context; existing methods often rely on single-image inputs and fail to capture dynamic gaze patterns during natural interactions with smart glasses.

Method: 1) Analyze hundreds of gaze-attentive queries to characterize gaze noise; 2) use GPT-4o to automatically synthesize GLARIFY-Ambi data with a chain-of-thought process to handle noisy gaze; 3) design a heatmap module to fuse spatiotemporal gaze into state-of-the-art VLMs while preserving pretrained knowledge; 4) evaluate on a hold-out test set.

Result: GLARIFY significantly outperforms baselines, demonstrating robust alignment between VLMs and human attention and enabling more intuitive interaction with a visual assistant.

Conclusion: GLARIFY offers a practical pathway to deploy gaze-informed VLMs in real-world scenarios by explicitly modeling spatiotemporal gaze noise, leveraging automated CoT-based data synthesis, and integrating gaze via a heatmap module without disrupting pretrained capabilities.

Abstract: With the rise in popularity of smart glasses, users' attention has been
integrated into Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to streamline multi-modal
querying in daily scenarios. However, leveraging gaze data to model users'
attention may introduce ambiguity challenges: (1) users' verbal questions
become ambiguous by using pronouns or skipping context, (2) humans' gaze
patterns can be noisy and exhibit complex spatiotemporal relationships with
their spoken questions. Previous works only consider single image as visual
modality input, failing to capture the dynamic nature of the user's attention.
In this work, we introduce GLARIFY, a novel method to leverage spatiotemporal
gaze information to enhance the model's effectiveness in real-world
applications. Initially, we analyzed hundreds of querying samples with the gaze
modality to demonstrate the noisy nature of users' gaze patterns. We then
utilized GPT-4o to design an automatic data synthesis pipeline to generate the
GLARIFY-Ambi dataset, which includes a dedicated chain-of-thought (CoT) process
to handle noisy gaze patterns. Finally, we designed a heatmap module to
incorporate gaze information into cutting-edge VLMs while preserving their
pretrained knowledge. We evaluated GLARIFY using a hold-out test set.
Experiments demonstrate that GLARIFY significantly outperforms baselines. By
robustly aligning VLMs with human attention, GLARIFY paves the way for a usable
and intuitive interaction paradigm with a visual assistant.

### [90] [From Bias to Balance: Exploring and Mitigating Spatial Bias in LVLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21984)
*Yingjie Zhu,Xuefeng Bai,Kehai Chen,Yang Xiang,Weili Guan,Jun Yu,Min Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Balanced Position Assignment (BaPA) fixes spatial bias in LVLMs by assigning identical position embeddings to all image tokens, improving spatial robustness and overall multimodal performance without full retraining (and with lightweight fine-tuning).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LVLMs exhibit outputs that vary with the spatial placement of identical visual information, revealing a spatial-semantic understanding limitation. The problem is traced to imbalanced cross-modal position embeddings rather than the vision encoder.

Method: Design a probing dataset to reveal spatial bias, diagnose its source, and propose BaPA. BaPA assigns identical position embeddings to all image tokens, promoting balanced cross-modal integration. Evaluation includes zero retraining and lightweight fine-tuning, plus analysis of information flow.

Result: BaPA produces balanced attention and enhances spatial robustness of LVLMs. When combined with lightweight fine-tuning, it further boosts performance across diverse multimodal benchmarks without requiring retraining.

Conclusion: Positional embedding imbalance in cross-modal interaction underpins spatial bias in LVLMs. BaPA is a simple, effective fix that improves spatial-semantic understanding and overall multimodal performance, with balanced information flow enabling holistic visual reasoning.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have achieved remarkable success across
a wide range of multimodal tasks, yet their robustness to spatial variations
remains insufficiently understood. In this work, we present a systematic study
of the spatial bias of LVLMs, focusing on how models respond when identical key
visual information is placed at different locations within an image. Through a
carefully designed probing dataset, we demonstrate that current LVLMs often
produce inconsistent outputs under such spatial shifts, revealing a fundamental
limitation in their spatial-semantic understanding. Further analysis shows that
this phenomenon originates not from the vision encoder, which reliably
perceives and interprets visual content across positions, but from the
unbalanced design of position embeddings in the language model component. In
particular, the widely adopted position embedding strategies, such as RoPE,
introduce imbalance during cross-modal interaction, leading image tokens at
different positions to exert unequal influence on semantic understanding. To
mitigate this issue, we introduce Balanced Position Assignment (BaPA), a simple
yet effective mechanism that assigns identical position embeddings to all image
tokens, promoting a more balanced integration of visual information. Extensive
experiments show that BaPA enhances the spatial robustness of LVLMs without
retraining and further boosts their performance across diverse multimodal
benchmarks when combined with lightweight fine-tuning. Further analysis of
information flow reveals that BaPA yields balanced attention, enabling more
holistic visual understanding.

*Abdelrahman Eldesokey,Aleksandar Cvejic,Bernard Ghanem,Peter Wonka*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Disentangle visual and semantic features in diffusion backbones; propose automated data-pipeline and Visual Semantic Matching (VSM) metric to quantify and localize visual inconsistencies in subject-driven generation; outperforms global metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To isolate visual features from semantic information inside diffusion model backbones and enable quantitative, localized detection of visual discrepancies without annotated datasets.

Method: Construct image pairs with semantic/visual annotations using existing subject-driven datasets via automation; train a contrastive network to separate visual vs semantic features; derive VSM metric from disentangled representations to quantify and localize inconsistencies.

Result: VSM outperforms CLIP, DINO, and vision-language models in quantifying visual inconsistencies; provides spatial localization of inconsistent regions; claims first method to enable both quantification and localization in subject-driven generation; includes project page.

Conclusion: Disentangled representations in diffusion backbones enable effective analysis and quality control of subject-driven creation; VSM offers a practical tool for measuring and localizing perceptual mismatches.

Abstract: We propose a novel approach for disentangling visual and semantic features
from the backbones of pre-trained diffusion models, enabling visual
correspondence in a manner analogous to the well-established semantic
correspondence. While diffusion model backbones are known to encode
semantically rich features, they must also contain visual features to support
their image synthesis capabilities. However, isolating these visual features is
challenging due to the absence of annotated datasets. To address this, we
introduce an automated pipeline that constructs image pairs with annotated
semantic and visual correspondences based on existing subject-driven image
generation datasets, and design a contrastive architecture to separate the two
feature types. Leveraging the disentangled representations, we propose a new
metric, Visual Semantic Matching (VSM), that quantifies visual inconsistencies
in subject-driven image generation. Empirical results show that our approach
outperforms global feature-based metrics such as CLIP, DINO, and
vision--language models in quantifying visual inconsistencies while also
enabling spatial localization of inconsistent regions. To our knowledge, this
is the first method that supports both quantification and localization of
inconsistencies in subject-driven generation, offering a valuable tool for
advancing this task. Project

*Changli Tang,Qinfan Xiao,Ke Mei,Tianyi Wang,Fengyun Rao,Chao Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WAVE delivers a unified LLM-based embedding space for text, audio, and video, enabling any-to-any cross-modal retrieval and prompt-aware embeddings, achieving state-of-the-art results and enabling versatile multimodal QA with joint training and hierarchical fusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal LLM embeddings excel for text but dynamic modalities like audio and video lack a unified, scalable representation space. A single embedding space across modalities is desirable to enable flexible cross-modal tasks and instruction-driven representations.

Method: Introduce WAVE with a hierarchical feature fusion strategy and joint multi-modal, multi-task training that aligns text, audio, and video in one shared embedding space. Supports any-to-any cross-modal retrieval and yields prompt-aware embeddings tailored to user instructions; includes a new versatile audio-visual benchmark and ablation studies to validate the joint training.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art on the MMEB-v2 video benchmark; superior performance in audio and video-to-audio retrieval; strong results in multimodal question answering due to prompt-aware embeddings; ablations confirm benefits of the joint training strategy.

Conclusion: WAVE establishes a unified, versatile embedding space for text, audio, and video, enabling broad cross-modal applications and prompting the release of code, checkpoints, and data to foster further research.

Abstract: While embeddings from multimodal large language models (LLMs) excel as
general-purpose representations, their application to dynamic modalities like
audio and video remains underexplored. We introduce WAVE (\textbf{u}nified \&
\textbf{v}ersatile \textbf{a}udio-\textbf{v}isual \textbf{e}mbeddings), the
first LLM-based embedding that creates a unified representation space for text,
audio, and video modalities. WAVE employs a novel hierarchical feature fusion
strategy and a joint multi-modal, multi-task training approach to enable two
key capabilities: any-to-any cross-modal retrieval and the generation of
prompt-aware embeddings tailored to user instructions. Experimentally, WAVE
sets a new state-of-the-art on the MMEB-v2 video benchmark and achieves
superior results in audio and video-to-audio retrieval. Its prompt-aware nature
also yields remarkable performance in multimodal question answering,
significantly outperforming existing embedding models. Ablation studies
validate our joint training strategy, demonstrating improved performance across
all modalities. With a newly introduced benchmark for versatile audio-visual
learning, WAVE opens up broad possibilities for cross-modal, any-to-any
applications. Our code, checkpoints, and data will be released.

*Jewon Lee,Wooksu Shin,Seungmin Yang,Ki-Ung Song,DongUk Lim,Jaeyeon Kim,Tae-Ho Kim,Bo-Kyeong Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Efficient two-stage coarse-to-fine reasoning (ERGO) for high-resolution vision-language tasks: downsample to locate task-relevant regions, then crop and process at full resolution with RL-guided perception and uncertainty handling. Achieves higher accuracy with far fewer vision tokens (23%) and ~3x speedup, outperforming Qwen2.5-VL-7B on V*.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce the computational burden of Large Vision-Language Models on high-resolution images without sacrificing fine-grained reasoning, by focusing processing on task-relevant regions identified through reasoning and multimodal context, and by accounting for perceptual uncertainty.

Method: A two-stage coarse-to-fine pipeline. Stage 1 downsampling to identify task-relevant regions; Stage 2 cropping these regions at full resolution for detailed reasoning. ERGO adds reasoning-driven perception leveraging multimodal context to decide where to focus, and expands the crop to cover visually ambiguous areas. It uses reinforcement learning with simple reward components to train the perception strategy.

Result: Across multiple datasets, ERGO achieves higher accuracy than the original model and competitive methods, including a 4.7-point improvement on the V* benchmark over Qwen2.5-VL-7B, while using only 23% of vision tokens, yielding about 3× faster inference.

Conclusion: ERGO demonstrates that a reasoning-guided, coarse-to-fine perception strategy can dramatically reduce computation in LVLMs while preserving or enhancing performance, with publicly available code and models.

Abstract: Efficient processing of high-resolution images is crucial for real-world
vision-language applications. However, existing Large Vision-Language Models
(LVLMs) incur substantial computational overhead due to the large number of
vision tokens. With the advent of "thinking with images" models, reasoning now
extends beyond text to the visual domain. This capability motivates our
two-stage "coarse-to-fine" reasoning pipeline: first, a downsampled image is
analyzed to identify task-relevant regions; then, only these regions are
cropped at full resolution and processed in a subsequent reasoning stage. This
approach reduces computational cost while preserving fine-grained visual
details where necessary. A major challenge lies in inferring which regions are
truly relevant to a given query. Recent related methods often fail in the first
stage after input-image downsampling, due to perception-driven reasoning, where
clear visual information is required for effective reasoning. To address this
issue, we propose ERGO (Efficient Reasoning & Guided Observation) that performs
reasoning-driven perception-leveraging multimodal context to determine where to
focus. Our model can account for perceptual uncertainty, expanding the cropped
region to cover visually ambiguous areas for answering questions. To this end,
we develop simple yet effective reward components in a reinforcement learning
framework for coarse-to-fine perception. Across multiple datasets, our approach
delivers higher accuracy than the original model and competitive methods, with
greater efficiency. For instance, ERGO surpasses Qwen2.5-VL-7B on the V*
benchmark by 4.7 points while using only 23% of the vision tokens, achieving a
3x inference speedup. The code and models can be found at:

*Sungmin Woo,Sangyoun Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DualFocus is a variational depth-from-focus (DFF) framework that exploits gradient-pattern changes across focus levels and enforces dual constraints (spatial and focal) to improve depth accuracy and perceptual quality, outperforming existing methods on four datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Depth-from-Focus methods often fail in complex textures or abrupt depth transitions due to ambiguous focus cues. Existing learning-based approaches may overfit to texture without robustly leveraging how focus changes across the focal stack. This paper introduces inductive biases that align with physical focus behavior to improve robustness.

Method: A variational formulation with dual constraints: (1) spatial constraints that use gradient pattern changes across focus levels to distinguish true depth edges from texture artifacts, and (2) focal constraints that enforce unimodal, monotonic focus probabilities consistent with physical focus behavior across the stack.

Result: Extensive experiments on four public datasets show DualFocus consistently surpasses state-of-the-art methods in depth accuracy and perceptual quality.

Conclusion: Incorporating dual inductive biases—across spatial-gradients and across the focal dimension—yields improved robustness and accuracy in challenging DFF scenarios, validating the proposed approach.

Abstract: Depth-from-Focus (DFF) enables precise depth estimation by analyzing focus
cues across a stack of images captured at varying focal lengths. While recent
learning-based approaches have advanced this field, they often struggle in
complex scenes with fine textures or abrupt depth changes, where focus cues may
become ambiguous or misleading. We present DualFocus, a novel DFF framework
that leverages the focal stack's unique gradient patterns induced by focus
variation, jointly modeling focus changes over spatial and focal dimensions.
Our approach introduces a variational formulation with dual constraints
tailored to DFF: spatial constraints exploit gradient pattern changes across
focus levels to distinguish true depth edges from texture artifacts, while
focal constraints enforce unimodal, monotonic focus probabilities aligned with
physical focus behavior. These inductive biases improve robustness and accuracy
in challenging regions. Comprehensive experiments on four public datasets
demonstrate that DualFocus consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in
both depth accuracy and perceptual quality.

TL;DR: A rate-distortion theory-informed framework (RDcomm) for multi-agent collaborative perception that achieves high task accuracy with dramatically reduced communication; uses task entropy coding and MI-driven message selection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fills the theoretical gap in understanding performance-communication trade-offs in goal-oriented multi-agent perception; aims to design pragmatic, redundancy-minimized communication strategies.

Method: Propose pragmatic rate-distortion theory; two innovations: task entropy discrete coding; mutual-information-driven message selection with MI estimation; evaluate on 3D object detection and BEV segmentation on DAIR-V2X and OPV2V.

Result: RDcomm attains state-of-the-art accuracy on DAIR-V2X and OPV2V datasets while reducing communication volume by up to 108x.

Conclusion: Theory-guided, communication-efficient framework for multi-agent collaboration with potential broader impact; code will be released.

Abstract: Collaborative perception emphasizes enhancing environmental understanding by
enabling multiple agents to share visual information with limited bandwidth
resources. While prior work has explored the empirical trade-off between task
performance and communication volume, a significant gap remains in the
theoretical foundation. To fill this gap, we draw on information theory and
introduce a pragmatic rate-distortion theory for multi-agent collaboration,
specifically formulated to analyze performance-communication trade-off in
goal-oriented multi-agent systems. This theory concretizes two key conditions
for designing optimal communication strategies: supplying pragmatically
relevant information and transmitting redundancy-less messages. Guided by these
two conditions, we propose RDcomm, a communication-efficient collaborative
perception framework that introduces two key innovations: i) task entropy
discrete coding, which assigns features with task-relevant codeword-lengths to
maximize the efficiency in supplying pragmatic information; ii)
mutual-information-driven message selection, which utilizes mutual information
neural estimation to approach the optimal redundancy-less condition.
Experiments on 3D object detection and BEV segmentation demonstrate that RDcomm
achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on DAIR-V2X and OPV2V, while reducing
communication volume by up to 108 times. The code will be released.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FailureAtlas is a scalable, active auditing framework for text-to-image models that autonomously discovers minimal failure-inducing concepts and maps the broader failure landscape, revealing extensive, data-scarcity–related errors and enabling robust auditing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Static benchmarks provide limited diagnostic power for T2I models; there is a need for an active, scalable method to uncover the full landscape of systematic failures and their root causes.

Method: Formulates error discovery as a structured search for minimal, failure-inducing concepts (failure slices); employs acceleration techniques to tame combinatorial explosion; applied to Stable Diffusion to map failure modes; outputs a large-scale landscape of error slices and investigates links to training data scarcity.

Result: Uncovered hundreds of thousands of previously unknown error slices (over 247,000 in SD1.5); provides first large-scale evidence linking failures to training data scarcity; demonstrates a principled, scalable approach to model auditing; code available at GitHub.

Conclusion: FailureAtlas provides a principled, scalable engine for automated auditing of generative models, enabling diagnosis-driven improvements toward more robust T2I systems and guiding future research in systematic failure analysis.

Abstract: Static benchmarks have provided a valuable foundation for comparing
Text-to-Image (T2I) models. However, their passive design offers limited
diagnostic power, struggling to uncover the full landscape of systematic
failures or isolate their root causes. We argue for a complementary paradigm:
active exploration. We introduce FailureAtlas, the first framework designed to
autonomously explore and map the vast failure landscape of T2I models at scale.
FailureAtlas frames error discovery as a structured search for minimal,
failure-inducing concepts. While it is a computationally explosive problem, we
make it tractable with novel acceleration techniques. When applied to Stable
Diffusion models, our method uncovers hundreds of thousands of previously
unknown error slices (over 247,000 in SD1.5 alone) and provides the first
large-scale evidence linking these failures to data scarcity in the training
set. By providing a principled and scalable engine for deep model auditing,
FailureAtlas establishes a new, diagnostic-first methodology to guide the
development of more robust generative AI. The code is available at

### [97] [Exposing Hallucinations To Suppress Them: VLMs Representation Editing With Generative Anchors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21997)
*Youxu Shi,Suorong Yang,Dong Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A training-free, self-supervised method to mitigate hallucinations in multimodal LLMs by using a hallucination amplification mechanism: a caption is projected into visual space via a text-to-image model to reveal implicit hallucination signals as a negative anchor, while the real image provides a positive anchor; decoder hidden states are edited to pull toward faithful semantics and push away from hallucination directions, with no extra training or priors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal LLMs exhibit persistent hallucinations that are not cured by scaling; existing mitigation methods require finetuning, handcrafted priors, or trade-offs that hurt informativeness or scalability.

Method: Introduce a hallucination amplification step by projecting the caption into visual space using a text-to-image model to create a negative anchor; compare with the actual image as a positive anchor; edit decoder hidden states to align with faithful semantics and repel hallucination directions, in a training-free, self-supervised manner; no human priors or additional training costs; plug-and-play and broadly applicable.

Result: Significant reduction of hallucinations across object, attribute, and relation levels; preserves recall and caption richness; e.g., hallucination reduction >5% on CHAIR with LLaVA-v1.5-7B; generalizes across architectures (LLaVA-NEXT-7B, Cambrian-8B, InstructBLIP-7B); minimal side effects on hallucination-free captions; implementation will be public.

Conclusion: A simple, training-free, self-supervised approach provides robust hallucination mitigation for multimodal LLMs that transfers across architectures and maintains caption quality, enabling practical plug-and-play deployment.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable success
across diverse vision-language tasks, yet they remain highly susceptible to
hallucinations, producing content that is fluent but inconsistent with visual
evidence. Such hallucinations, spanning objects, attributes, and relations,
persist even in larger models, while existing mitigation approaches often
require additional finetuning, handcrafted priors, or trade-offs that
compromise informativeness and scalability. To address this limitation, we
propose a training-free, self-supervised method for hallucination mitigation.
Our approach introduces a novel hallucination amplification mechanism: a
caption is projected into the visual space via a text-to-image model to reveal
implicit hallucination signals, serving as a negative anchor, while the
original image provides a positive anchor. Leveraging these dual anchors, we
edit decoder hidden states by pulling representations toward faithful semantics
and pushing them away from hallucination directions. This correction requires
no human priors or additional training costs, ensuring both effectiveness and
efficiency. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks show that our
method significantly reduces hallucinations at the object, attribute, and
relation levels while largely preserving recall and caption richness, e.g.,
achieving a hallucination reduction by over 5% using LLaVA-v1.5-7B on CHAIR.
Furthermore, results on diverse architectures, including LLaVA-NEXT-7B,
Cambrian-8B, and InstructBLIP-7B, validate strong cross-architecture
generalization. More importantly, when applied to hallucination-free captions,
our method introduces almost no side effects, underscoring its robustness and
practical plug-and-play applicability. The implementation will be publicly
available.

*Xinyu Zhang,Yuxuan Dong,Lingling Zhang,Chengyou Jia,Zhuohang Dang,Basura Fernando,Jun Liu,Mike Zheng Shou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A training-free CoFFT approach improves VLM visual reasoning by iteratively generating diverse reasoning samples, evaluating them with focus and progression, and adjusting visual focus; yields 3.1–5.8% gains across benchmarks with controllable overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLMs struggle with noisy, irrelevant visual input and fail to precisely identify regions needed during reasoning, leading to interference and hallucinations. A human-like cognitive mechanism is needed to discover and process the required regions.

Method: CoFFT consists of three iterative stages per foresight-thought: (1) Diverse Sample Generation to explore multiple reasoning paths; (2) Dual Foresight Decoding to evaluate samples on visual focus and reasoning progression and insert the first step of the optimal sample into the reasoning; (3) Visual Focus Adjustment to steer attention to regions beneficial for future reasoning, then repeat until final answer.

Result: Empirical results show consistent improvements of 3.1–5.8% on benchmarks across Qwen2.5-VL, InternVL-2.5, and Llava-Next, with controllable computational overhead.

Conclusion: A training-free, cognition-inspired approach that tightens the coupling between visual focus and reasoning in VLMs, reducing interference from irrelevant regions and improving accuracy without additional training.

Abstract: Despite significant advances in Vision Language Models (VLMs), they remain
constrained by the complexity and redundancy of visual input. When images
contain large amounts of irrelevant information, VLMs are susceptible to
interference, thus generating excessive task-irrelevant reasoning processes or
even hallucinations. This limitation stems from their inability to discover and
process the required regions during reasoning precisely. To address this
limitation, we present the Chain of Foresight-Focus Thought (CoFFT), a novel
training-free approach that enhances VLMs' visual reasoning by emulating human
visual cognition. Each Foresight-Focus Thought consists of three stages: (1)
Diverse Sample Generation: generates diverse reasoning samples to explore
potential reasoning paths, where each sample contains several reasoning steps;
(2) Dual Foresight Decoding: rigorously evaluates these samples based on both
visual focus and reasoning progression, adding the first step of optimal sample
to the reasoning process; (3) Visual Focus Adjustment: precisely adjust visual
focus toward regions most beneficial for future reasoning, before returning to
stage (1) to generate subsequent reasoning samples until reaching the final
answer. These stages function iteratively, creating an interdependent cycle
where reasoning guides visual focus and visual focus informs subsequent
reasoning. Empirical results across multiple benchmarks using Qwen2.5-VL,
InternVL-2.5, and Llava-Next demonstrate consistent performance improvements of
3.1-5.8\% with controllable increasing computational overhead.

TL;DR: An egocentric instructional video dataset is introduced with ground-truth annotations for procedural step segmentation and conversation-state classification; authors benchmark multimodal LLMs against specialized baselines for analyzing face-to-face instruction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the lack of datasets and analytical methods for face-to-face instructional scenes, aiming to enable holistic understanding of instructional interactions via multimodal data (speech, gaze, motion, and visual context).

Method: Introduce a new egocentric video dataset of face-to-face instruction with ground-truth annotations for two tasks (procedural step segmentation and conversation-state classification); benchmark multimodal large language models that process images, audio, and text against conventional task-specific models, evaluating cross-modal understanding without task-specific fine-tuning.

Result: Multimodal LLMs outperform specialized baselines even without task-specific fine-tuning, indicating their promise for holistic understanding of instructional interactions.

Conclusion: MLLMs show potential for understanding face-to-face instructional scenes; future work could explore deeper multimodal reasoning, fine-tuning, larger and more diverse datasets, and additional instructional-interaction tasks.

Abstract: Analyzing instructional interactions between an instructor and a learner who
are co-present in the same physical space is a critical problem for educational
support and skill transfer. Yet such face-to-face instructional scenes have not
been systematically studied in computer vision. We identify two key reasons: i)
the lack of suitable datasets and ii) limited analytical techniques. To address
this gap, we present a new egocentric video dataset of face-to-face instruction
and provide ground-truth annotations for two fundamental tasks that serve as a
first step toward a comprehensive understanding of instructional interactions:
procedural step segmentation and conversation-state classification. Using this
dataset, we benchmark multimodal large language models (MLLMs) against
conventional task-specific models. Since face-to-face instruction involves
multiple modalities (speech content and prosody, gaze and body motion, and
visual context), effective understanding requires methods that handle verbal
and nonverbal communication in an integrated manner. Accordingly, we evaluate
recently introduced MLLMs that jointly process images, audio, and text. This
evaluation quantifies the extent to which current machine learning models
understand face-to-face instructional scenes. In experiments, MLLMs outperform
specialized baselines even without task-specific fine-tuning, suggesting their
promise for holistic understanding of instructional interactions.

### [100] [High-Quality Sound Separation Across Diverse Categories via Visually-Guided Generative Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22063)
*Chao Huang,Susan Liang,Yapeng Tian,Anurag Kumar,Chenliang Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DAVIS is a diffusion-based audio-visual separation framework using DDPM and Flow Matching within Separation U-Net to generate separated spectrograms from noise, conditioned on mixed audio and visuals; it outperforms prior methods on AVE and MUSIC.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mask-based separation struggles to model complex, multi-category data distributions; generative diffusion models can capture richer distributions to improve separation quality.

Method: Integrates diffusion-based generative modeling (DDPM and Flow Matching) with a Separation U-Net, synthesizing separated spectrograms from noise conditioned on the mixed audio and associated visual info; trained for audio-visual source separation; evaluated on AVE and MUSIC datasets.

Result: Both DDPM and Flow Matching variants surpass existing approaches in separation quality on AVE and MUSIC datasets.

Conclusion: A generative diffusion-based framework is effective for audio-visual source separation, producing high-quality separations across diverse sound categories.

Abstract: We propose DAVIS, a Diffusion-based Audio-VIsual Separation framework that
solves the audio-visual sound source separation task through generative
learning. Existing methods typically frame sound separation as a mask-based
regression problem, achieving significant progress. However, they face
limitations in capturing the complex data distribution required for
high-quality separation of sounds from diverse categories. In contrast, DAVIS
circumvents these issues by leveraging potent generative modeling paradigms,
specifically Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM) and the more
recent Flow Matching (FM), integrated within a specialized Separation U-Net
architecture. Our framework operates by synthesizing the desired separated
sound spectrograms directly from a noise distribution, conditioned concurrently
on the mixed audio input and associated visual information. The inherent nature
of its generative objective makes DAVIS particularly adept at producing
high-quality sound separations for diverse sound categories. We present
comparative evaluations of DAVIS, encompassing both its DDPM and Flow Matching
variants, against leading methods on the standard AVE and MUSIC datasets. The
results affirm that both variants surpass existing approaches in separation
quality, highlighting the efficacy of our generative framework for tackling the
audio-visual source separation task.

### [101] [SpecXNet: A Dual-Domain Convolutional Network for Robust Deepfake Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22070)
*Inzamamul Alam,Md Tanvir Islam,Simon S. Woo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SpecXNet is a dual-domain deepfake detector that fuses local texture and global spectral cues via DDFC and DFA for robust cross-dataset detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing detectors often rely on either spatial or frequency-domain features, limiting generalization as deepfakes become more realistic. A unified spatial-spectral approach is needed for robust detection under unseen manipulations.

Method: SpecXNet introduces a Dual-Domain Feature Coupler (DDFC) that splits features into a local spatial branch for texture anomalies and a global spectral branch using FFT to capture periodic inconsistencies, coupled with a Dual Fourier Attention (DFA) module that content-adaptively fuses spatial and spectral features. The architecture is built atop a modified XceptionNet backbone with DDFC and DFA embedded in a separable convolution block.

Result: Experiments on multiple deepfake benchmarks show state-of-the-art accuracy, particularly under cross-dataset and unseen manipulation scenarios, with real-time feasibility.

Conclusion: Unified spatial-spectral learning via SpecXNet enhances robustness and generalization in deepfake detection; the authors release code on GitHub for reproducibility.

Abstract: The increasing realism of content generated by GANs and diffusion models has
made deepfake detection significantly more challenging. Existing approaches
often focus solely on spatial or frequency-domain features, limiting their
generalization to unseen manipulations. We propose the Spectral
Cross-Attentional Network (SpecXNet), a dual-domain architecture for robust
deepfake detection. The core \textbf{Dual-Domain Feature Coupler (DDFC)}
decomposes features into a local spatial branch for capturing texture-level
anomalies and a global spectral branch that employs Fast Fourier Transform to
model periodic inconsistencies. This dual-domain formulation allows SpecXNet to
jointly exploit localized detail and global structural coherence, which are
critical for distinguishing authentic from manipulated images. We also
introduce the \textbf{Dual Fourier Attention (DFA)} module, which dynamically
fuses spatial and spectral features in a content-aware manner. Built atop a
modified XceptionNet backbone, we embed the DDFC and DFA modules within a
separable convolution block. Extensive experiments on multiple deepfake
benchmarks show that SpecXNet achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, particularly
under cross-dataset and unseen manipulation scenarios, while maintaining
real-time feasibility. Our results highlight the effectiveness of unified
spatial-spectral learning for robust and generalizable deepfake detection. To
ensure reproducibility, we released the full code on

### [102] [Large Material Gaussian Model for Relightable 3D Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22112)
*Jingrui Ye,Lingting Zhu,Runze Zhang,Zeyu Hu,Yingda Yin,Lanjiong Li,Lequan Yu,Qingmin Liao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents the Large Material Gaussian Model (MGM), which integrates 3D Gaussian Splatting with a multiview material diffusion model and a Gaussian material representation to produce PBR materials (albedo, roughness, metallic) for high-quality, relightable 3D assets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current large reconstruction models (LRMs) using 3D Gaussian Splatting efficiently render but fail to capture material properties. Realistic rendering under varying lighting requires embedded PBR attributes, motivating a method to generate and model materials alongside geometry.

Method: 1) Fine-tune a multiview material diffusion model conditioned on input depth and normal maps to generate multiview PBR images. 2) Introduce a Gaussian material representation that models each PBR channel (albedo, roughness, metallic). 3) Reconstruct point clouds from these materials and render to obtain PBR attributes, enabling dynamic relighting with ambient light maps.

Result: Extensive experiments show that the produced materials are more visually appealing than baseline methods and enhance material modeling, supporting practical downstream rendering applications such as relighting and realistic shading.

Conclusion: MGM enables high-quality, relightable 3D content by embedding PBR materials into Gaussian Splatting via a diffusion-based material model and a Gaussian material representation, improving rendering realism and practical utility.

Abstract: The increasing demand for 3D assets across various industries necessitates
efficient and automated methods for 3D content creation. Leveraging 3D Gaussian
Splatting, recent large reconstruction models (LRMs) have demonstrated the
ability to efficiently achieve high-quality 3D rendering by integrating
multiview diffusion for generation and scalable transformers for
reconstruction. However, existing models fail to produce the material
properties of assets, which is crucial for realistic rendering in diverse
lighting environments. In this paper, we introduce the Large Material Gaussian
Model (MGM), a novel framework designed to generate high-quality 3D content
with Physically Based Rendering (PBR) materials, ie, albedo, roughness, and
metallic properties, rather than merely producing RGB textures with
uncontrolled light baking. Specifically, we first fine-tune a new multiview
material diffusion model conditioned on input depth and normal maps. Utilizing
the generated multiview PBR images, we explore a Gaussian material
representation that not only aligns with 2D Gaussian Splatting but also models
each channel of the PBR materials. The reconstructed point clouds can then be
rendered to acquire PBR attributes, enabling dynamic relighting by applying
various ambient light maps. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the
materials produced by our method not only exhibit greater visual appeal
compared to baseline methods but also enhance material modeling, thereby
enabling practical downstream rendering applications.

### [103] [Self-Supervised Point Cloud Completion based on Multi-View Augmentations of Single Partial Point Cloud](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22132)
*Jingjing Lu,Huilong Pi,Yunchuan Qin,Zhuo Tang,Ruihui Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A self-supervised point cloud completion method using multi-view augmentations on a single partial cloud, enhanced by Mamba to boost output quality, achieving state-of-the-art on synthetic and real datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations of supervised methods (reliance on ground truth and domain gap), unsupervised methods requiring complete clouds, weakly-supervised methods needing multi-view data, and the weak efficacy of existing self-supervised signals. The paper proposes stronger self-supervision derived from multi-view augmentations and an additional learning boost with Mamba.

Method: Design novel self-supervised signals based on multi-view augmentations of a single partial point cloud and incorporate Mamba into the self-supervised training to encourage higher-quality point cloud generation.

Result: Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: The approach mitigates data-label constraints and improves generalization across datasets, delivering robust completion results in both synthetic and real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Point cloud completion aims to reconstruct complete shapes from partial
observations. Although current methods have achieved remarkable performance,
they still have some limitations: Supervised methods heavily rely on ground
truth, which limits their generalization to real-world datasets due to the
synthetic-to-real domain gap. Unsupervised methods require complete point
clouds to compose unpaired training data, and weakly-supervised methods need
multi-view observations of the object. Existing self-supervised methods
frequently produce unsatisfactory predictions due to the limited capabilities
of their self-supervised signals. To overcome these challenges, we propose a
novel self-supervised point cloud completion method. We design a set of novel
self-supervised signals based on multi-view augmentations of the single partial
point cloud. Additionally, to enhance the model's learning ability, we first
incorporate Mamba into self-supervised point cloud completion task, encouraging
the model to generate point clouds with better quality. Experiments on
synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our method achieves
state-of-the-art results.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Semi-supervised distillation for edge-friendly, controllable conditional image generation using tri-level knowledge fusion to reduce compute and latency while preserving quality and controllability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enable text-guided image generation on resource-constrained edge devices, addressing high compute demands, data scarcity, privacy concerns, and reliance on third-party data.

Method: Refine-Control framework employing tri-level knowledge fusion loss to transfer different knowledge levels from teacher to student, combined with semi-supervised distillation that leverages both labeled and unlabeled data to improve generalization.

Result: Notable reductions in computational cost and latency with maintained high-fidelity generation and controllability, as evidenced by comparative metrics.

Conclusion: Proposes an effective, privacy-preserving, data-efficient approach for deploying controllable conditional image generation on edge devices through semi-supervised distillation and multi-level knowledge fusion.

Abstract: Conditional image generation models have achieved remarkable results by
leveraging text-based control to generate customized images. However, the high
resource demands of these models and the scarcity of well-annotated data have
hindered their deployment on edge devices, leading to enormous costs and
privacy concerns, especially when user data is sent to a third party. To
overcome these challenges, we propose Refine-Control, a semi-supervised
distillation framework. Specifically, we improve the performance of the student
model by introducing a tri-level knowledge fusion loss to transfer different
levels of knowledge. To enhance generalization and alleviate dataset scarcity,
we introduce a semi-supervised distillation method utilizing both labeled and
unlabeled data. Our experiments reveal that Refine-Control achieves significant
reductions in computational cost and latency, while maintaining high-fidelity
generation capabilities and controllability, as quantified by comparative
metrics.

### [105] [Joint graph entropy knowledge distillation for point cloud classification and robustness against corruptions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22150)
*Zhiqiang Tian,Weigang Li,Junwei Hu,Chunhua Deng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A joint graph entropy-based knowledge distillation (JGEKD) method for 3D point-cloud classification under non-IID conditions, leveraging joint graphs to encode inter-class relations and Siamese-based self and teacher distillation, plus transfer between original and corrupted forms to improve robustness; validated on several datasets with competitive results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: IID assumptions in 3D point-cloud classification hamper capturing inter-class correlations. Preserving and transferring information about class relationships can improve generalization, especially under spatial transformations and corruptions.

Method: Build joint graphs to model hidden relationships among classes and use the entropy of these graphs as a distillation signal. Employ Siamese architectures to enable self- and teacher-based distillation across transformations of the same data, and extend the framework to transfer knowledge between clean and corrupted point clouds to boost robustness.

Result: Extensive experiments on ScanObject, ModelNet40, ScanntV2_cls, and ModelNet-C demonstrate that JGEKD achieves competitive performance and enhanced robustness to corruption.

Conclusion: JGEKD provides a viable approach to non-IID 3D point-cloud classification by encoding and distilling class relationships via joint graph entropy, with transformation-invariant and corruption-robust knowledge transfer through Siamese distillation structures.

### [106] [MultiMat: Multimodal Program Synthesis for Procedural Materials using Large Multimodal Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22151)
*Jonas Belouadi,Tamy Boubekeur,Adrien Kaiser*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MultiMat is a multimodal program synthesis framework for procedural material graphs that combines visual and textual representations with a constrained tree search, achieving higher quality and efficiency than text-only methods on a new production-quality dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Procedural material graphs (DAGs of material properties) are central for high-quality, scalable appearance modeling but are hard to craft; existing neural approaches rely on textual programs and miss the inherently visual-spatial nature of graphs, limiting accessibility and fidelity.

Method: Introduce MultiMat, a framework that leverages large multimodal models to process both visual and textual graph representations. Train on a production-quality procedural material dataset and use a constrained tree search to enforce syntactic validity while efficiently exploring the program space.

Result: Multimodal synthesis outperforms text-only baselines in both unconditional and conditional graph generation, with higher visual quality and fidelity and faster, more efficient search; achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: Integrating visual and textual modalities with constrained search markedly improves procedural material graph generation, making synthesis more accessible and producing higher-quality, resolution-invariant materials.

Abstract: Material node graphs are programs that generate the 2D channels of procedural
materials, including geometry such as roughness and displacement maps, and
reflectance such as albedo and conductivity maps. They are essential in
computer graphics for representing the appearance of virtual 3D objects
parametrically and at arbitrary resolution. In particular, their directed
acyclic graph structures and intermediate states provide an intuitive
understanding and workflow for interactive appearance modeling. Creating such
graphs is a challenging task and typically requires professional training.
While recent neural program synthesis approaches attempt to simplify this
process, they solely represent graphs as textual programs, failing to capture
the inherently visual-spatial nature of node graphs that makes them accessible
to humans. To address this gap, we present MultiMat, a multimodal program
synthesis framework that leverages large multimodal models to process both
visual and textual graph representations for improved generation of procedural
material graphs. We train our models on a new dataset of production-quality
procedural materials and combine them with a constrained tree search inference
algorithm that ensures syntactic validity while efficiently navigating the
program space. Our experimental results show that our multimodal program
synthesis method is more efficient in both unconditional and conditional graph
synthesis with higher visual quality and fidelity than text-only baselines,
establishing new state-of-the-art performance.

*Kirsten Odendaal,Neela Kaushik,Spencer Halverson*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Integrates StyleGAN, DragGAN, and PCA to make latent spaces more efficient and controllable, enabling cross-model alignment between AFHQ-trained models with preserved quality and faster optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the efficiency and interpretability of latent-space manipulation in GANs by combining structured latent spaces (StyleGAN), intuitive editing (DragGAN), and dimensionality reduction (PCA), enabling cross-model alignment.

Method: Combine StyleGAN latent space structure with DragGAN manipulation; apply PCA for dimensionality reduction of latent W+ spaces; apply to AFHQ dataset; test with W+ layers at 3; align models trained on AFHQ-Dog and AFHQ-Cat; evaluate optimization time, SSIM, and visual quality.

Result: PCA-enhanced DragGAN retains performance while reducing optimization time; improved SSIM in optimized images, especially for shallow latent spaces (W+ = 3); demonstrated alignment between AFHQ-Dog and AFHQ-Cat StyleGANs and intuitive latent-space control across aligned models.

Conclusion: Efficient and interpretable latent-space control across multiple GAN models is feasible, enabling faster editing and cross-domain alignment with preserved image quality.

Abstract: This work integrates StyleGAN, DragGAN and Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
to enhance the latent space efficiency and controllability of GAN-generated
images. Style-GAN provides a structured latent space, DragGAN enables intuitive
image manipulation, and PCA reduces dimensionality and facilitates cross-model
alignment for more streamlined and interpretable exploration of latent spaces.
We apply our techniques to the Animal Faces High Quality (AFHQ) dataset, and
find that our approach of integrating PCA-based dimensionality reduction with
the Drag-GAN framework for image manipulation retains performance while
improving optimization efficiency. Notably, introducing PCA into the latent W+
layers of DragGAN can consistently reduce the total optimization time while
maintaining good visual quality and even boosting the Structural Similarity
Index Measure (SSIM) of the optimized image, particularly in shallower latent
spaces (W+ layers = 3). We also demonstrate capability for aligning images
generated by two StyleGAN models trained on similar but distinct data domains
(AFHQ-Dog and AFHQ-Cat), and show that we can control the latent space of these
aligned images to manipulate the images in an intuitive and interpretable
manner. Our findings highlight the possibility for efficient and interpretable
latent space control for a wide range of image synthesis and editing
applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MinerU2.5 is a 1.2B-parameter document parsing vision-language model that uses a coarse-to-fine two-stage parsing to achieve state-of-the-art accuracy with low computational overhead: first perform layout analysis on downsampled images, then recognize content on native-resolution crops guided by the layout; supported by a large-scale data engine for pretraining and fine-tuning, yielding strong benchmarks across tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to achieve high accuracy in document parsing while remaining computationally efficient. Traditional models either overfit to specific domains or incur heavy computation. By decoupling global layout analysis from local content recognition and using a data engine to generate diverse training corpora, the approach aims to improve both accuracy and efficiency.

Method: A two-stage parsing framework: (1) downsampled-image layout analysis to identify structural elements (coarse); (2) content recognition on native-resolution crops guided by the global layout (fine). A 1.2B parameter vision-language model. A comprehensive data engine creates diverse, large-scale training corpora for pretraining and fine-tuning.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple document parsing benchmarks, outperforming both general-purpose and domain-specific models, while maintaining significantly lower computational overhead.

Conclusion: The proposed coarse-to-fine, layout-guided document parsing approach with large-scale data generation delivers strong accuracy and efficiency, validating decoupled layout-content analysis for document understanding and potential for broad applicability.

Abstract: We introduce MinerU2.5, a 1.2B-parameter document parsing vision-language
model that achieves state-of-the-art recognition accuracy while maintaining
exceptional computational efficiency. Our approach employs a coarse-to-fine,
two-stage parsing strategy that decouples global layout analysis from local
content recognition. In the first stage, the model performs efficient layout
analysis on downsampled images to identify structural elements, circumventing
the computational overhead of processing high-resolution inputs. In the second
stage, guided by the global layout, it performs targeted content recognition on
native-resolution crops extracted from the original image, preserving
fine-grained details in dense text, complex formulas, and tables. To support
this strategy, we developed a comprehensive data engine that generates diverse,
large-scale training corpora for both pretraining and fine-tuning. Ultimately,
MinerU2.5 demonstrates strong document parsing ability, achieving
state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks, surpassing both
general-purpose and domain-specific models across various recognition tasks,
while maintaining significantly lower computational overhead.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Geo-CoT introduces a verifiable, multi-step reasoning framework (RSThinker) for remote sensing tasks, using a two-stage alignment (SFT + GRPO) and the Geo-CoT380k dataset; achieves dominant performance and releases dataset/model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in remote sensing struggle with complex analytical tasks due to end-to-end training that bypasses explicit reasoning, yielding unverifiable outputs. There is a need for explicit, verifiable reasoning traces.

Method: Two-stage alignment: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to instill a core cognitive architecture, followed by Group Reward Policy Optimization (GRPO) to refine the reasoning policy toward factual correctness. Introduction of Geo-CoT380k, a large-scale dataset of structured Geo-CoT rationales. The model, RSThinker, outputs both a final answer and a verifiable analytical trace.

Result: Reported dominant performance, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art models across a broad range of remote-sensing tasks.

Conclusion: Public release of Geo-CoT380k and the RSThinker model provides a concrete pathway from opaque perception to structured, verifiable geospatial reasoning in Earth Observation.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in remote sensing often fail at complex
analytical tasks, a limitation stemming from their end-to-end training paradigm
that bypasses crucial reasoning steps and leads to unverifiable outputs. To
address this limitation, we introduce the Perceptually-Grounded Geospatial
Chain-of-Thought (Geo-CoT), a framework that models remote sensing analysis as
a verifiable, multi-step process. We instill this analytical process through a
two-stage alignment strategy, leveraging Geo-CoT380k, the first large-scale
dataset of structured Geo-CoT rationales. This strategy first employs
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to instill the foundational cognitive
architecture, then leverages Group Reward Policy Optimization (GRPO) to refine
the model's reasoning policy towards factual correctness. The resulting model,
RSThinker, outputs both a final answer and its justifying, verifiable
analytical trace. This capability yields dominant performance, significantly
outperforming state-of-the-art models across a comprehensive range of tasks.
The public release of our Geo-CoT380k dataset and RSThinker model upon
publication serves as a concrete pathway from opaque perception towards
structured, verifiable reasoning for Earth Observation.

*Jiayu Ding,Xinpeng Liu,Zhiyi Pan,Shiqiang Long,Ge Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MUSplat is a training-free framework that lifts 2D open-vocabulary understanding into 3D Gaussian Splatting without per-scene training, achieving state-of-the-art open-vocabulary 3D object selection and semantic segmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address three core issues in 3D open-vocabulary methods: expensive per-scene retraining, monosemous representations, and cross-view semantic inconsistencies.

Method: Use a pre-trained 2D segmentation model to produce multi-granularity masks; lift to 3D with per-Gaussian foreground probabilities forming initial object groups; refine boundaries through semantic entropy and geometric opacity; gather appearance across representative viewpoints; distill textual features using a Vision-Language Model; enable open-vocabulary querying via semantic matching; training-free (no feature optimization).

Result: On open-vocabulary 3D object selection and semantic segmentation benchmarks, MUSplat outperforms training-based frameworks and reduces scene adaptation time from hours to minutes.

Conclusion: A training-free pipeline that eliminates per-scene optimization, improves multi-concept 3D semantics, and mitigates cross-view inconsistencies, making 3D open-vocabulary understanding plug-and-play.

Abstract: Lifting 2D open-vocabulary understanding into 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)
scenes is a critical challenge. However, mainstream methods suffer from three
key flaws: (i) their reliance on costly per-scene retraining prevents
plug-and-play application; (ii) their restrictive monosemous design fails to
represent complex, multi-concept semantics; and (iii) their vulnerability to
cross-view semantic inconsistencies corrupts the final semantic representation.
To overcome these limitations, we introduce MUSplat, a training-free framework
that abandons feature optimization entirely. Leveraging a pre-trained 2D
segmentation model, our pipeline generates and lifts multi-granularity 2D masks
into 3D, where we estimate a foreground probability for each Gaussian point to
form initial object groups. We then optimize the ambiguous boundaries of these
initial groups using semantic entropy and geometric opacity. Subsequently, by
interpreting the object's appearance across its most representative viewpoints,
a Vision-Language Model (VLM) distills robust textual features that reconciles
visual inconsistencies, enabling open-vocabulary querying via semantic
matching. By eliminating the costly per-scene training process, MUSplat reduces
scene adaptation time from hours to mere minutes. On benchmark tasks for
open-vocabulary 3D object selection and semantic segmentation, MUSplat
outperforms established training-based frameworks while simultaneously
addressing their monosemous limitations.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UrbanFeel introduces a large, multi-dimension benchmark to evaluate Multimodal LLMs on urban development understanding and subjective perception, using 14.3k QA across static, temporal, and subjective tasks from 11 cities; Gemini-2.5 Pro leads but temporal reasoning remains challenging; subjective judgments show human-level consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a lack of benchmarks that assess MLLMs on urban development dynamics, evolution over time, and subjective environmental perception aligned with human perception, hindering progress toward human-centric, sustainable urban AI.

Method: Collect multi-temporal single-view and panoramic street-view images from 11 cities; generate 14.3k visual QA across Static Scene Perception, Temporal Change Understanding, and Subjective Environmental Perception using a hybrid pipeline (spatial clustering, rule-based generation, model-assisted prompting) with manual annotation; evaluate 20 state-of-the-art MLLMs.

Result: Gemini-2.5 Pro achieves the best overall performance, with accuracy approaching human experts and narrowing the average gap to about 1.5%. Models excel in scene-grounded tasks and some surpass humans in pixel-level change detection; temporal reasoning remains a challenge. In subjective perception tasks, some models reach or exceed human consistency in dimensions like beauty and safety.

Conclusion: UrbanFeel is an effective benchmark revealing the capabilities and limits of current MLLMs in urban understanding and subjective evaluation; highlights the need to strengthen temporal reasoning and human-aligned subjective judgments to advance sustainable, human-centric urban AI.

Abstract: Urban development impacts over half of the global population, making
human-centered understanding of its structural and perceptual changes essential
for sustainable development. While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs)
have shown remarkable capabilities across various domains, existing benchmarks
that explore their performance in urban environments remain limited, lacking
systematic exploration of temporal evolution and subjective perception of urban
environment that aligns with human perception. To address these limitations, we
propose UrbanFeel, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the
performance of MLLMs in urban development understanding and subjective
environmental perception. UrbanFeel comprises 14.3K carefully constructed
visual questions spanning three cognitively progressive dimensions: Static
Scene Perception, Temporal Change Understanding, and Subjective Environmental
Perception. We collect multi-temporal single-view and panoramic street-view
images from 11 representative cities worldwide, and generate high-quality
question-answer pairs through a hybrid pipeline of spatial clustering,
rule-based generation, model-assisted prompting, and manual annotation. Through
extensive evaluation of 20 state-of-the-art MLLMs, we observe that Gemini-2.5
Pro achieves the best overall performance, with its accuracy approaching human
expert levels and narrowing the average gap to just 1.5\%. Most models perform
well on tasks grounded in scene understanding. In particular, some models even
surpass human annotators in pixel-level change detection. However, performance
drops notably in tasks requiring temporal reasoning over urban development.
Additionally, in the subjective perception dimension, several models reach
human-level or even higher consistency in evaluating dimension such as
beautiful and safety.

### [112] [A Tale of Two Experts: Cooperative Learning for Source-Free Unsupervised Domain Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22229)
*Jiaping Yu,Muli Yang,Jiapeng Ji,Jiexi Yan,Cheng Deng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EXCL introduces a dual-experts framework and a Retrieval-Augmentation-Interaction (RAIN) pipeline for source-free unsupervised domain adaptation. It leverages a frozen source-domain model (with Conv-Adapter) and a pretrained vision-language model (with a trainable prompt) to collaboratively learn from unlabeled target data, achieving competitive (state-of-the-art–level) results on four benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Source-free unsupervised domain adaptation (SFUDA) must operate without access to source data due to privacy/cost concerns. Existing methods either rely solely on the source model’s predictions or on fine-tuning large multimodal models, but neglect complementary signals and the latent structure of target data. There is a need to exploit diverse, complementary insights and target data structure to improve adaptation.

Method: Propose Experts Cooperative Learning (EXCL) comprising: 1) Dual Experts framework: a frozen source-domain model augmented with a Conv-Adapter and a pretrained vision-language model with a trainable text prompt, treated equally to mine consensus knowledge from unlabeled target samples. 2) Retrieval-Augmentation-Interaction (RAIN) pipeline: a three-stage unsupervised learning process: (a) retrieve pseudo-source and complex target samples, (b) independently fine-tune each expert on its respective sample set, and (c) enforce object-consistency by sharing a common learning result.

Result: Experimental evaluation on four benchmark datasets shows that EXCL matches state-of-the-art performance for SFUDA, demonstrating competitive results without access to source data.

Conclusion: EXCL demonstrates that combining complementary expertise from a frozen source model and a vision-language model, guided by a retrieval-augmented interaction process, can achieve strong, source-data-free domain adaptation performance, highlighting the value of collaboration between heterogeneous models and targeted sample retrieval.

Abstract: Source-Free Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (SFUDA) addresses the realistic
challenge of adapting a source-trained model to a target domain without access
to the source data, driven by concerns over privacy and cost. Existing SFUDA
methods either exploit only the source model's predictions or fine-tune large
multimodal models, yet both neglect complementary insights and the latent
structure of target data. In this paper, we propose the Experts Cooperative
Learning (EXCL). EXCL contains the Dual Experts framework and
Retrieval-Augmentation-Interaction optimization pipeline. The Dual Experts
framework places a frozen source-domain model (augmented with Conv-Adapter) and
a pretrained vision-language model (with a trainable text prompt) on equal
footing to mine consensus knowledge from unlabeled target samples. To
effectively train these plug-in modules under purely unsupervised conditions,
we introduce Retrieval-Augmented-Interaction(RAIN), a three-stage pipeline that
(1) collaboratively retrieves pseudo-source and complex target samples, (2)
separately fine-tunes each expert on its respective sample set, and (3)
enforces learning object consistency via a shared learning result. Extensive
experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach matches
state-of-the-art performance.

*Junyi Wu,Zhiteng Li,Haotong Qin,Xiaohong Liu,Linghe Kong,Yulun Zhang,Xiaokang Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FlashEdit enables real-time, high-fidelity text-guided image editing with diffusion models via OSIE, BG-Shield, and SSCA, delivering edits in under 0.2s and over 150x faster than previous methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text-guided diffusion-based image editing yields high-quality results but suffers from high latency; there is a need for real-time editing with preserved background and controlled local edits.

Method: One-Step Inversion-and-Editing (OSIE) to avoid iterative inversion; Background Shield (BG-Shield) to modify only the edit region ensuring background preservation; Sparsified Spatial Cross-Attention (SSCA) to suppress semantic leakage to the background, enabling precise localized edits.

Result: Extensive experiments show improved background consistency and structural integrity; edits under 0.2 seconds; >150x speedup over prior multi-step methods; code to be released.

Conclusion: FlashEdit achieves real-time, high-fidelity text-guided image editing while preserving background and structure; practical for real-world applications, with public code release.

Abstract: Text-guided image editing with diffusion models has achieved remarkable
quality but suffers from prohibitive latency, hindering real-world
applications. We introduce FlashEdit, a novel framework designed to enable
high-fidelity, real-time image editing. Its efficiency stems from three key
innovations: (1) a One-Step Inversion-and-Editing (OSIE) pipeline that bypasses
costly iterative processes; (2) a Background Shield (BG-Shield) technique that
guarantees background preservation by selectively modifying features only
within the edit region; and (3) a Sparsified Spatial Cross-Attention (SSCA)
mechanism that ensures precise, localized edits by suppressing semantic leakage
to the background. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FlashEdit maintains
superior background consistency and structural integrity, while performing
edits in under 0.2 seconds, which is an over 150$\times$ speedup compared to
prior multi-step methods. Our code will be made publicly available at
https://github.com/JunyiWuCode/FlashEdit.

### [114] [Beyond Classification Accuracy: Neural-MedBench and the Need for Deeper Reasoning Benchmarks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22258)
*Miao Jing,Mengting Jia,Junling Lin,Zhongxia Shen,Lijun Wang,Yuanyuan Peng,Huan Gao,Mingkun Xu,Shangyang Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Neural-MedBench is a multimodal, reasoning-focused neurology benchmark that reveals current vision-language models struggle with clinical reasoning, not just perception; introduces a two-axis evaluation framework (breadth for generalization, depth for reasoning fidelity) and provides an open-source diagnostic testbed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing medical VLM benchmarks emphasize classification accuracy and may falsely indicate strong diagnostic ability. There is a need for rigorous evaluation of multimodal clinical reasoning, especially in neurology.

Method: Build Neural-MedBench with multi-sequence MRI, structured electronic health records, and clinical notes. Three task families: differential diagnosis, lesion recognition, and rationale generation. Use a hybrid scoring pipeline combining LLM-based graders, clinician validation, and semantic similarity metrics.

Result: State-of-the-art VLMs (e.g., GPT-4o, Claude-4, MedGemma) show a sharp performance drop on Neural-MedBench compared with standard datasets. Error analysis shows reasoning failures dominate over perceptual errors. The benchmark provides a reliable framework and is released openly.

Conclusion: Advocate a Two-Axis Evaluation Framework: breadth-oriented large datasets for statistical generalization and compact, reasoning-focused benchmarks like Neural-MedBench for fidelity. This testbed supports rigorous, cost-effective assessment of clinically trustworthy AI and will guide future benchmark development.

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable
performance on standard medical benchmarks, yet their true clinical reasoning
ability remains unclear. Existing datasets predominantly emphasize
classification accuracy, creating an evaluation illusion in which models appear
proficient while still failing at high-stakes diagnostic reasoning. We
introduce Neural-MedBench, a compact yet reasoning-intensive benchmark
specifically designed to probe the limits of multimodal clinical reasoning in
neurology. Neural-MedBench integrates multi-sequence MRI scans, structured
electronic health records, and clinical notes, and encompasses three core task
families: differential diagnosis, lesion recognition, and rationale generation.
To ensure reliable evaluation, we develop a hybrid scoring pipeline that
combines LLM-based graders, clinician validation, and semantic similarity
metrics. Through systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art VLMs, including
GPT-4o, Claude-4, and MedGemma, we observe a sharp performance drop compared to
conventional datasets. Error analysis shows that reasoning failures, rather
than perceptual errors, dominate model shortcomings. Our findings highlight the
necessity of a Two-Axis Evaluation Framework: breadth-oriented large datasets
for statistical generalization, and depth-oriented, compact benchmarks such as
Neural-MedBench for reasoning fidelity. We release Neural-MedBench at
https://neuromedbench.github.io/ as an open and extensible diagnostic testbed,
which guides the expansion of future benchmarks and enables rigorous yet
cost-effective assessment of clinically trustworthy AI.

### [115] [UniMapGen: A Generative Framework for Large-Scale Map Construction from Multi-modal Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22262)
*Yujian Yuan,Changjie Wu,Xinyuan Chang,Sijin Wang,Hang Zhang,Shiyi Liang,Shuang Zeng,Mu Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A generative framework, UniMapGen, for large-scale map construction using multi-modal inputs (BEV, PV, text prompts) that represents lane lines as discrete sequences and updates a global map iteratively to ensure continuity, achieving SOTA on OpenSatMap and capable of inferring occluded/missing roads; code will be released.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome reliance on costly data collection and annotation for large-scale maps and to address satellite data drawbacks (occlusions, outdatedness) and the rough/discontinuous roads produced by perception-based vectorization by adopting a generative, multi-modal, and globally-consistent approach.

Method: UniMapGen represents lane lines as discrete sequences and uses an iterative generation strategy to produce more complete and smoother map vectors than traditional perception-based methods. It features a flexible architecture that accepts multi-modal inputs (BEV, PV, and text prompts) to mitigate satellite data limitations. It also introduces a state update mechanism to maintain global continuity and consistency across the constructed map.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on the OpenSatMap dataset. It can infer roads that are occluded in the data and predict roads missing from dataset annotations.

Conclusion: UniMapGen advances large-scale map construction by combining discrete-sequence lane representations, multi-modal inputs, and a global state-update for continuity, enabling more complete, smooth, and occlusion-resilient maps and setting a new benchmark on OpenSatMap; code will be released.

Abstract: Large-scale map construction is foundational for critical applications such
as autonomous driving and navigation systems. Traditional large-scale map
construction approaches mainly rely on costly and inefficient special data
collection vehicles and labor-intensive annotation processes. While existing
satellite-based methods have demonstrated promising potential in enhancing the
efficiency and coverage of map construction, they exhibit two major
limitations: (1) inherent drawbacks of satellite data (e.g., occlusions,
outdatedness) and (2) inefficient vectorization from perception-based methods,
resulting in discontinuous and rough roads that require extensive
post-processing. This paper presents a novel generative framework, UniMapGen,
for large-scale map construction, offering three key innovations: (1)
representing lane lines as \textbf{discrete sequence} and establishing an
iterative strategy to generate more complete and smooth map vectors than
traditional perception-based methods. (2) proposing a flexible architecture
that supports \textbf{multi-modal} inputs, enabling dynamic selection among
BEV, PV, and text prompt, to overcome the drawbacks of satellite data. (3)
developing a \textbf{state update} strategy for global continuity and
consistency of the constructed large-scale map. UniMapGen achieves
state-of-the-art performance on the OpenSatMap dataset. Furthermore, UniMapGen
can infer occluded roads and predict roads missing from dataset annotations.
Our code will be released.

### [116] [GS-2M: Gaussian Splatting for Joint Mesh Reconstruction and Material Decomposition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22276)
*Dinh Minh Nguyen,Malte Avenhaus,Thomas Lindemeier*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Unifies mesh reconstruction and material decomposition from multi-view images using 3D Gaussian Splatting (GS-2M), augmented by a roughness supervision strategy to reduce neural components, achieving competitive results and producing meshes with material components.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Separately solving reconstruction and material decomposition is challenging for reflective surfaces; priors and heavy neural architectures hinder scalability. A unified, lightweight approach aims to improve robustness and scalability while maintaining quality.

Method: Joint optimization of depth- and normal-related attributes within a 3D Gaussian Splatting framework; introduction of a roughness supervision strategy based on multi-view photometric variation; carefully designed loss and optimization to operate without heavy neural components.

Result: Reconstruction quality is comparable to state-of-the-art methods; the approach yields triangle meshes with associated material components and is robust to reflective surfaces; validated on standard datasets with qualitative comparisons.

Conclusion: A unified, largely neural-free pipeline based on GS-2M can achieve high-quality mesh reconstruction and material decomposition, offering scalability while maintaining performance on multi-view data.

Abstract: We propose a unified solution for mesh reconstruction and material
decomposition from multi-view images based on 3D Gaussian Splatting, referred
to as GS-2M. Previous works handle these tasks separately and struggle to
reconstruct highly reflective surfaces, often relying on priors from external
models to enhance the decomposition results. Conversely, our method addresses
these two problems by jointly optimizing attributes relevant to the quality of
rendered depth and normals, maintaining geometric details while being resilient
to reflective surfaces. Although contemporary works effectively solve these
tasks together, they often employ sophisticated neural components to learn
scene properties, which hinders their performance at scale. To further
eliminate these neural components, we propose a novel roughness supervision
strategy based on multi-view photometric variation. When combined with a
carefully designed loss and optimization process, our unified framework
produces reconstruction results comparable to state-of-the-art methods,
delivering triangle meshes and their associated material components for
downstream tasks. We validate the effectiveness of our approach with widely
used datasets from previous works and qualitative comparisons with
state-of-the-art surface reconstruction methods.

### [117] [Rule-Based Reinforcement Learning for Document Image Classification with Vision Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22283)
*Michael Jungo,Andreas Fischer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Rule-based reinforcement learning applied to Document Image Classification shows improved generalization to out-of-distribution data across OOD images, unseen classes, and different modalities; code released.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Although RL achieved promise in other domains (e.g., DeepSeek-R1 with simple verifiable rewards), document analysis has lagged; this work investigates whether rule-based RL can enhance reasoning and generalization in document classification.

Method: Study the effects of rule-based reinforcement learning on Document Image Classification, evaluating generalization in three OOD scenarios: out-of-distribution images, unseen classes, and different modalities; code at the provided GitHub.

Result: Reinforcement learning demonstrates better generalisation to out-of-distribution data across the three examined scenarios.

Conclusion: Rule-based RL is a promising approach for document analysis tasks, offering improved generalization and reasoning capabilities; the authors provide public code to facilitate further research.

Abstract: Rule-based reinforcement learning has been gaining popularity ever since
DeepSeek-R1 has demonstrated its success through simple verifiable rewards. In
the domain of document analysis, reinforcement learning is not as prevalent,
even though many downstream tasks may benefit from the emerging properties of
reinforcement learning, particularly the enhanced reason capabilities. We study
the effects of rule-based reinforcement learning with the task of Document
Image Classification which is one of the most commonly studied downstream tasks
in document analysis. We find that reinforcement learning tends to have better
generalisation capabilities to out-of-distritbution data, which we examine in
three different scenarios, namely out-of-distribution images, unseen classes
and different modalities. Our code is available at
https://github.com/jungomi/vision-finetune.

### [118] [Jailbreaking on Text-to-Video Models via Scene Splitting Strategy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22292)
*Wonjun Lee,Haon Park,Doehyeon Lee,Bumsub Ham,Suhyun Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Black-box jailbreak for Text-to-Video models that splits a harmful prompt into benign scenes; sequentially combining scenes narrows the output space into unsafe regions, yielding high attack success and exposing safety gaps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current T2V safety mechanisms are underexplored and appear vulnerable to narrative-structure attacks. There is a need to study how decomposing prompts into scenes can influence generative outputs and identify gaps to improve safety.

Method: Fragment a harmful narrative into multiple scenes, each mapping to a broad, safe output space. The sequential combination of scenes constrains the overall output space, pushing it into an unsafe region. Iterative scene manipulation refined attack effectiveness; a strategy library reuses successful attack patterns. The approach is black-box and evaluated across 11 safety categories on T2V models (Luma Ray2, Hailuo, Veo2).

Result: SceneSplit achieves high average attack success rates: 77.2% on Luma Ray2, 84.1% on Hailuo, and 78.2% on Veo2, outperforming existing baselines. Demonstrated vulnerability of current T2V safety measures to narrative-structure attacks across multiple safety categories.

Conclusion: Safety in Text-to-Video models remains fragile under narrative-structure jailbreaks. The study highlights the need to incorporate scene-level and narrative-consistency safeguards in defenses and provides a framework for evaluating and strengthening T2V safety.

Abstract: Along with the rapid advancement of numerous Text-to-Video (T2V) models,
growing concerns have emerged regarding their safety risks. While recent
studies have explored vulnerabilities in models like LLMs, VLMs, and
Text-to-Image (T2I) models through jailbreak attacks, T2V models remain largely
unexplored, leaving a significant safety gap. To address this gap, we introduce
SceneSplit, a novel black-box jailbreak method that works by fragmenting a
harmful narrative into multiple scenes, each individually benign. This approach
manipulates the generative output space, the abstract set of all potential
video outputs for a given prompt, using the combination of scenes as a powerful
constraint to guide the final outcome. While each scene individually
corresponds to a wide and safe space where most outcomes are benign, their
sequential combination collectively restricts this space, narrowing it to an
unsafe region and significantly increasing the likelihood of generating a
harmful video. This core mechanism is further enhanced through iterative scene
manipulation, which bypasses the safety filter within this constrained unsafe
region. Additionally, a strategy library that reuses successful attack patterns
further improves the attack's overall effectiveness and robustness. To validate
our method, we evaluate SceneSplit across 11 safety categories on T2V models.
Our results show that it achieves a high average Attack Success Rate (ASR) of
77.2% on Luma Ray2, 84.1% on Hailuo, and 78.2% on Veo2, significantly
outperforming the existing baseline. Through this work, we demonstrate that
current T2V safety mechanisms are vulnerable to attacks that exploit narrative
structure, providing new insights for understanding and improving the safety of
T2V models.

### [119] [HiGS: History-Guided Sampling for Plug-and-Play Enhancement of Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22300)
*Seyedmorteza Sadat,Farnood Salehi,Romann M. Weber*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A plug-and-play momentum-based sampling method (HiGS) improves diffusion sampling quality and efficiency with no extra training, achieving state-of-the-art FID on ImageNet with few steps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models often produce unrealistic outputs when using few NFEs or low guidance; there is a need for a budget-friendly method to boost fidelity without retraining.

Method: Introduce history-guided sampling (HiGS), a momentum-based technique that computes a weighted average of past predictions and uses the difference between the current prediction and this average to steer each inference step. No extra compute or training; integrates into existing diffusion pipelines.

Result: HiGS consistently improves image quality across models, architectures, sampling budgets, and guidance scales. On ImageNet (256×256) unguided generation with 30 steps, achieves a new state-of-the-art FID of 1.61 using a pretrained SiT model.

Conclusion: HiGS is a practical, plug-and-play enhancement for diffusion sampling that boosts fidelity and speed without training, applicable across diverse models.

Abstract: While diffusion models have made remarkable progress in image generation,
their outputs can still appear unrealistic and lack fine details, especially
when using fewer number of neural function evaluations (NFEs) or lower guidance
scales. To address this issue, we propose a novel momentum-based sampling
technique, termed history-guided sampling (HiGS), which enhances quality and
efficiency of diffusion sampling by integrating recent model predictions into
each inference step. Specifically, HiGS leverages the difference between the
current prediction and a weighted average of past predictions to steer the
sampling process toward more realistic outputs with better details and
structure. Our approach introduces practically no additional computation and
integrates seamlessly into existing diffusion frameworks, requiring neither
extra training nor fine-tuning. Extensive experiments show that HiGS
consistently improves image quality across diverse models and architectures and
under varying sampling budgets and guidance scales. Moreover, using a
pretrained SiT model, HiGS achieves a new state-of-the-art FID of 1.61 for
unguided ImageNet generation at 256$\times$256 with only 30 sampling steps
(instead of the standard 250). We thus present HiGS as a plug-and-play
enhancement to standard diffusion sampling that enables faster generation with
higher fidelity.

*Jinpeng Lu,Linghan Cai,Yinda Chen,Guo Tang,Songhan Jiang,Haoyuan Shi,Zhiwei Xiong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VeloxSeg presents a lightweight, robust 3D medical image segmentation framework that blends CNN and Transformer via dual streams (PWA and JLC), uses glance-and-focus for multi-scale retrieval, extends to multimodal data with modal interaction, and injects texture priors through SDKT (Gram matrices). It achieves 26% Dice gain and dramatic throughput boosts (GPU 11x, CPU 48x) on multimodal benchmarks; code released.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the fundamental efficiency–robustness conflict in 3D medical image segmentation, especially for high-dimensional images and heterogeneous modalities, and enable robust, deployable lightweight models.

Method: A dual-stream CNN-Transformer architecture with Paired Window Attention (PWA) and Johnson-Lindenstrauss lemma-guided convolution (JLC). A glance-and-focus mechanism rapidly retrieves multi-scale information; JLC provides robust local feature extraction with minimal parameters. The architecture is extended with modal interaction for heterogeneous modalities. Spatially Decoupled Knowledge Transfer (SDKT) via Gram matrices transfers texture priors from a self-supervised network into the segmentation network.

Result: On multimodal benchmarks, VeloxSeg achieves 26% Dice improvement and substantial throughput gains (GPU +11x, CPU +48x) with low computational budget.

Conclusion: VeloxSeg demonstrates that combining lightweight local feature extraction (JLC) with a global, attention-based dual-stream design (PWA) and cross-modal texture priors can overcome the efficiency-robustness trade-off in 3D medical segmentation, enabling strong performance under low-resource settings and scalable multimodal assimilation.

Abstract: Lightweight 3D medical image segmentation remains constrained by a
fundamental "efficiency / robustness conflict", particularly when processing
complex anatomical structures and heterogeneous modalities. In this paper, we
study how to redesign the framework based on the characteristics of
high-dimensional 3D images, and explore data synergy to overcome the fragile
representation of lightweight methods. Our approach, VeloxSeg, begins with a
deployable and extensible dual-stream CNN-Transformer architecture composed of
Paired Window Attention (PWA) and Johnson-Lindenstrauss lemma-guided
convolution (JLC). For each 3D image, we invoke a "glance-and-focus" principle,
where PWA rapidly retrieves multi-scale information, and JLC ensures robust
local feature extraction with minimal parameters, significantly enhancing the
model's ability to operate with low computational budget. Followed by an
extension of the dual-stream architecture that incorporates modal interaction
into the multi-scale image-retrieval process, VeloxSeg efficiently models
heterogeneous modalities. Finally, Spatially Decoupled Knowledge Transfer
(SDKT) via Gram matrices injects the texture prior extracted by a
self-supervised network into the segmentation network, yielding stronger
representations than baselines at no extra inference cost. Experimental results
on multimodal benchmarks show that VeloxSeg achieves a 26% Dice improvement,
alongside increasing GPU throughput by 11x and CPU by 48x. Codes are available
at https://github.com/JinPLu/VeloxSeg.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NIFTY is a non-parametric texture synthesis method that fuses diffusion-model insights with patch-based optimization to avoid training, using non-local patch matching to improve quality and reduce artifacts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Exemplar-based texture synthesis faces challenges: patch-based methods can produce artifacts and depend on initialization; fully training diffusion-style networks is costly and data-hungry. A hybrid, training-free approach could combine strengths while avoiding training costs.

Method: A hybrid, non-parametric flow-matching model built on non-local patch matching. It integrates diffusion-model ideas with classical patch-based texture optimization, enabling texture synthesis without neural network training.

Result: Experiments show the approach is effective and competitive with representative methods in the literature, offering improved quality and robustness on texture synthesis benchmarks; code is released at the provided GitHub link.

Conclusion: NIFTY provides a practical, training-free texture synthesis framework that merges diffusion-informed guidance with patch-based optimization, delivering high-quality results and easier deployment.

Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of exemplar-based texture synthesis. We
introduce NIFTY, a hybrid framework that combines recent insights on diffusion
models trained with convolutional neural networks, and classical patch-based
texture optimization techniques. NIFTY is a non-parametric flow-matching model
built on non-local patch matching, which avoids the need for neural network
training while alleviating common shortcomings of patch-based methods, such as
poor initialization or visual artifacts. Experimental results demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed approach compared to representative methods from
the literature. Code is available at https://github.com/PierrickCh/Nifty.git

*Wangbo Zhao,Yizeng Han,Zhiwei Tang,Jiasheng Tang,Pengfei Zhou,Kai Wang,Bohan Zhuang,Zhangyang Wang,Fan Wang,Yang You*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Zero-update, per-image adaptive acceleration for diffusion transformers (RAPID3) using three policy heads trained online with GRPO; achieves ~3x faster sampling with competitive quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address slow sampling in diffusion transformers by enabling per-image adaptive acceleration without relying on uniform heuristics or expensive fine-tuning.

Method: Three lightweight policy heads (Step-Skip, Cache-Reuse, Sparse-Attention) decide speed-ups at each timestep based on the denoising state. Policies are trained online via Group Relative Policy Optimization with the generator frozen; an adversarial discriminator augments rewards to prevent reward hacking and keep outputs close to the original distribution.

Result: RAPID3 delivers nearly 3x faster sampling across state-of-the-art DiT backbones (e.g., Stable Diffusion 3 and FLUX) with competitive generation quality.

Conclusion: Demonstrates that per-image adaptive acceleration can be achieved without updating the base generator, yielding substantial speedups while maintaining quality.

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) excel at visual generation yet remain hampered
by slow sampling. Existing training-free accelerators - step reduction, feature
caching, and sparse attention - enhance inference speed but typically rely on a
uniform heuristic or a manually designed adaptive strategy for all images,
leaving quality on the table. Alternatively, dynamic neural networks offer
per-image adaptive acceleration, but their high fine-tuning costs limit broader
applicability. To address these limitations, we introduce RAPID3: Tri-Level
Reinforced Acceleration Policies for Diffusion Transformers, a framework that
delivers image-wise acceleration with zero updates to the base generator.
Specifically, three lightweight policy heads - Step-Skip, Cache-Reuse, and
Sparse-Attention - observe the current denoising state and independently decide
their corresponding speed-up at each timestep. All policy parameters are
trained online via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) while the
generator remains frozen. Meanwhile, an adversarially learned discriminator
augments the reward signal, discouraging reward hacking by boosting returns
only when generated samples stay close to the original model's distribution.
Across state-of-the-art DiT backbones, including Stable Diffusion 3 and FLUX,
RAPID3 achieves nearly 3x faster sampling with competitive generation quality.

### [123] [Pedestrian Attribute Recognition via Hierarchical Cross-Modality HyperGraph Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22331)
*Xiao Wang,Shujuan Wu,Xiaoxia Cheng,Changwei Bi,Jin Tang,Bin Luo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A multi-modal knowledge graph-guided cross-modal hypergraph learning approach for pedestrian attribute recognition (PAR) that leverages relations among attributes and between attributes and vision tokens, plus rich visual context, to improve PAR accuracy; experiments on multiple benchmarks validate effectiveness; code at OpenPAR GitHub.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current PAR methods underutilize attribute knowledge and contextual information. While some recent works incorporate attribute text, they do not fully exploit the rich relationships among attributes and between attributes and visual data. There is a need to effectively model cross-modal relationships and context to improve recognition performance.

Method: Construct a multi-modal knowledge graph that captures relationships among attributes and between attributes and vision tokens. Introduce a knowledge graph-guided cross-modal hypergraph learning framework to model these relationships and integrate them into the standard PAR pipeline.

Result: Comprehensive experiments on multiple PAR benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed knowledge graph for PAR, establishing a strong foundation for knowledge-guided pedestrian attribute recognition.

Conclusion: The proposed knowledge-graph framework enhances PAR by effectively modeling cross-modal relationships and context, and the authors plan to release source code to facilitate broader adoption.

Abstract: Current Pedestrian Attribute Recognition (PAR) algorithms typically focus on
mapping visual features to semantic labels or attempt to enhance learning by
fusing visual and attribute information. However, these methods fail to fully
exploit attribute knowledge and contextual information for more accurate
recognition. Although recent works have started to consider using attribute
text as additional input to enhance the association between visual and semantic
information, these methods are still in their infancy. To address the above
challenges, this paper proposes the construction of a multi-modal knowledge
graph, which is utilized to mine the relationships between local visual
features and text, as well as the relationships between attributes and
extensive visual context samples. Specifically, we propose an effective
multi-modal knowledge graph construction method that fully considers the
relationships among attributes and the relationships between attributes and
vision tokens. To effectively model these relationships, this paper introduces
a knowledge graph-guided cross-modal hypergraph learning framework to enhance
the standard pedestrian attribute recognition framework. Comprehensive
experiments on multiple PAR benchmark datasets have thoroughly demonstrated the
effectiveness of our proposed knowledge graph for the PAR task, establishing a
strong foundation for knowledge-guided pedestrian attribute recognition. The

*Arman Akbari,Jian Gao,Yifei Zou,Mei Yang,Jinru Duan,Dmitrii Torbunov,Yanzhi Wang,Yihui Ren,Xuan Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CircuitSense benchmarks MLLMs on circuit diagrams across a full engineering workflow, revealing a large gap between visual parsing and symbolic reasoning. Perception is strong for closed-source models, but symbolic derivation and analytical reasoning lag, making symbolic reasoning the key metric for engineering competence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Engineering design requires converting visual schematic information into symbolic mathematical models. While MLLMs perform well on natural images, their ability to derive equations from technical diagrams is underexplored and likely insufficient for robust circuit synthesis.

Method: Introduce CircuitSense, an 8,006+ problem hierarchy from component-level schematics to block diagrams. Use a grid-based schematic generator and a block diagram generator with auto-derived symbolic labels. Evaluate six state-of-the-art MLLMs (closed and open-source) on perception (component recognition/topology) and symbolic/analytical tasks, examining end-to-end engineering workflow.

Result: Closed-source models achieve >85% on perception tasks but <19% on symbolic derivation and analytical reasoning. Models with stronger symbolic capabilities show higher design-task accuracy, indicating symbolic reasoning as the key determinant of engineering competence.

Conclusion: Symbolic reasoning is essential for circuit design tasks. The gap between visual parsing and symbolic derivation highlights the need to prioritize symbolic reasoning in model development and evaluation, with CircuitSense serving as a critical benchmark for this capability.

Abstract: Engineering design operates through hierarchical abstraction from system
specifications to component implementations, requiring visual understanding
coupled with mathematical reasoning at each level. While Multi-modal Large
Language Models (MLLMs) excel at natural image tasks, their ability to extract
mathematical models from technical diagrams remains unexplored. We present
\textbf{CircuitSense}, a comprehensive benchmark evaluating circuit
understanding across this hierarchy through 8,006+ problems spanning
component-level schematics to system-level block diagrams. Our benchmark
uniquely examines the complete engineering workflow: Perception, Analysis, and
Design, with a particular emphasis on the critical but underexplored capability
of deriving symbolic equations from visual inputs. We introduce a hierarchical
synthetic generation pipeline consisting of a grid-based schematic generator
and a block diagram generator with auto-derived symbolic equation labels.
Comprehensive evaluation of six state-of-the-art MLLMs, including both
closed-source and open-source models, reveals fundamental limitations in
visual-to-mathematical reasoning. Closed-source models achieve over 85\%
accuracy on perception tasks involving component recognition and topology
identification, yet their performance on symbolic derivation and analytical
reasoning falls below 19\%, exposing a critical gap between visual parsing and
symbolic reasoning. Models with stronger symbolic reasoning capabilities
consistently achieve higher design task accuracy, confirming the fundamental
role of mathematical understanding in circuit synthesis and establishing
symbolic reasoning as the key metric for engineering competence.

*Defan Chen,Yaohua Hu,Luchan Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HierLight-YOLO is a lightweight, YOLOv8-based detector with hierarchical feature fusion and new modules (IRDCB, LDown) designed to improve tiny object detection on UAV imagery, achieving state-of-the-art results on VisDrone2019 while keeping real-time efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Detecting tiny objects (<32 px) in drone imagery is hard due to limited resolution and resource constraints. Traditional YOLO detectors excel with large objects but miss small targets, leading to high false negatives. There is a need for an efficient, tiny-object-focused detector.

Method: Proposes Hierarchical Extended Path Aggregation Network (HEPAN) with hierarchical cross-level connections for multi-scale feature fusion. Introduces Inverted Residual Depthwise Convolution Block (IRDCB) and Lightweight Downsample (LDown) to reduce parameters and computation. Adds a small-object detection head to improve high-resolution feature fusion for objects as small as 4 pixels. Based on YOLOv8, evaluated on VisDrone2019 with ablations.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on VisDrone2019 for small-object detection. Ablation studies validate the contributions of HEPAN, IRDCB, and LDown, with enhanced tiny-object detection and only modest increases in model complexity.

Conclusion: HierLight-YOLO provides an effective and efficient solution for real-time small-object detection in UAV imagery. The combination of hierarchical feature fusion and lightweight modules improves accuracy for tiny targets without compromising speed, suggesting applicability to other resource-constrained tiny-object detection tasks.

Abstract: The real-time detection of small objects in complex scenes, such as the
unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) photography captured by drones, has dual
challenges of detecting small targets (<32 pixels) and maintaining real-time
efficiency on resource-constrained platforms. While YOLO-series detectors have
achieved remarkable success in real-time large object detection, they suffer
from significantly higher false negative rates for drone-based detection where
small objects dominate, compared to large object scenarios. This paper proposes
HierLight-YOLO, a hierarchical feature fusion and lightweight model that
enhances the real-time detection of small objects, based on the YOLOv8
architecture. We propose the Hierarchical Extended Path Aggregation Network
(HEPAN), a multi-scale feature fusion method through hierarchical cross-level
connections, enhancing the small object detection accuracy. HierLight-YOLO
includes two innovative lightweight modules: Inverted Residual Depthwise
Convolution Block (IRDCB) and Lightweight Downsample (LDown) module, which
significantly reduce the model's parameters and computational complexity
without sacrificing detection capabilities. Small object detection head is
designed to further enhance spatial resolution and feature fusion to tackle the
tiny object (4 pixels) detection. Comparison experiments and ablation studies
on the VisDrone2019 benchmark demonstrate state-of-the-art performance of
HierLight-YOLO.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Disinformation is increasingly multimodal; there is a need for reliable, reproducible methods that leverage large multimodal models to detect and mitigate false information.

Method: An optimized GPT-4o prompting approach; a multimodal analysis framework with image-text preprocessing to fit token limits; six fine-grained evaluation criteria with a confidence-based self-assessment; repeated testing to assess stability; evaluation across Gossipcop, Politifact, Fakeddit, MMFakeBench, and AMMEBA datasets.

Abstract: The proliferation of disinformation, particularly in multimodal contexts
combining text and images, presents a significant challenge across digital
platforms. This study investigates the potential of large multimodal models
(LMMs) in detecting and mitigating false information. We propose to approach
multimodal disinformation detection by leveraging the advanced capabilities of
the GPT-4o model. Our contributions include: (1) the development of an
optimized prompt incorporating advanced prompt engineering techniques to ensure
precise and consistent evaluations; (2) the implementation of a structured

### [127] [GPT-4 for Occlusion Order Recovery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22383)
*Kaziwa Saleh,Zhyar Rzgar K Rostam,Sándor Szénási,Zoltán Vámossy*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes using GPT-4 with a designed prompt to infer occlusion order from images, constructing an occlusion matrix for downstream tasks; zero-shot, no training data; evaluated on COCOA and InstaOrder; claims improvements via semantic context and commonsense.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Occlusion interpretation in dense real-world scenes is challenging; existing methods struggle with order reasoning; leveraging LLMs can provide semantic, commonsense reasoning in a prompt-driven, zero-shot fashion.

Method: Provide image + tailored prompt to GPT-4; GPT-4 outputs an occlusion order prediction; parse response into an occlusion matrix; use as input for occlusion handling tasks/vision models.

Result: Evaluated on COCOA and InstaOrder datasets; results suggest more accurate occlusion order predictions when using semantic context and commonsense; zero-shot capability without annotated data.

Conclusion: LLMs can perform occlusion reasoning in a zero-shot manner and can be integrated into occlusion handling frameworks; this approach reduces reliance on annotated training data and may generalize to other relations in vision.

Abstract: Occlusion remains a significant challenge for current vision models to
robustly interpret complex and dense real-world images and scenes. To address
this limitation and to enable accurate prediction of the occlusion order
relationship between objects, we propose leveraging the advanced capability of
a pre-trained GPT-4 model to deduce the order. By providing a specifically
designed prompt along with the input image, GPT-4 can analyze the image and
generate order predictions. The response can then be parsed to construct an
occlusion matrix which can be utilized in assisting with other occlusion
handling tasks and image understanding. We report the results of evaluating the
model on COCOA and InstaOrder datasets. The results show that by using semantic
context, visual patterns, and commonsense knowledge, the model can produce more
accurate order predictions. Unlike baseline methods, the model can reason about
occlusion relationships in a zero-shot fashion, which requires no annotated
training data and can easily be integrated into occlusion handling frameworks.

### [128] [Gradient-based multi-focus image fusion with focus-aware saliency enhancement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22392)
*Haoyu Li,XiaoSong Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A gradient-domain multi-focus image fusion method with boundary enhancement and saliency-guided refinement that preserves sharp focus-defocus boundaries and yields high-quality fused images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MFIF methods often blur focus-defocus boundaries, losing sharp boundary details and fine structures. There is a need for boundary-aware fusion that accurately detects focus information and preserves boundary integrity.

Method: 1) A gradient-domain-based model to obtain initial fusion with complete boundaries and preserved boundary details. 2) Tenengrad gradient detection to extract salient features from source images and the initial fused image, producing saliency maps. 3) A boundary refinement step using a gradient-based focus metric that combines saliency with complementary information across images to emphasize focused regions, yielding a high-quality initial decision result.

Result: Extensive experiments on four public datasets show the proposed method consistently outperforms 12 state-of-the-art MFIF methods in both subjective and objective evaluations.

Conclusion: The proposed boundary-enhanced MFIF framework effectively preserves sharp boundaries and focused details, producing high-quality all-in-focus results. Code is available at the authors' GitHub repository.

Abstract: Multi-focus image fusion (MFIF) aims to yield an all-focused image from
multiple partially focused inputs, which is crucial in applications cover
sur-veillance, microscopy, and computational photography. However, existing
methods struggle to preserve sharp focus-defocus boundaries, often resulting in
blurred transitions and focused details loss. To solve this problem, we propose
a MFIF method based on significant boundary enhancement, which generates
high-quality fused boundaries while effectively detecting focus in-formation.
Particularly, we propose a gradient-domain-based model that can obtain initial
fusion results with complete boundaries and effectively pre-serve the boundary
details. Additionally, we introduce Tenengrad gradient detection to extract
salient features from both the source images and the ini-tial fused image,
generating the corresponding saliency maps. For boundary refinement, we develop
a focus metric based on gradient and complementary information, integrating the
salient features with the complementary infor-mation across images to emphasize
focused regions and produce a high-quality initial decision result. Extensive
experiments on four public datasets demonstrate that our method consistently
outperforms 12 state-of-the-art methods in both subjective and objective
evaluations. We have realized codes in https://github.com/Lihyua/GICI

### [129] [Text Adversarial Attacks with Dynamic Outputs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22393)
*Wenqiang Wang,Siyuan Liang,Xiao Yan,Xiaochun Cao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduces Textual Dynamic Outputs Attack (TDOA) that converts dynamic-output NLP tasks into a static single-output framework using a clustering-based surrogate; employs a farthest-label targeted attack to maximize disruption; demonstrates strong, query-efficient attacks on LLMs and extends to generative tasks like translation with BLEU/chrF gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a gap in adversarial NLP research for dynamic or unbounded output spaces, where traditional fixed-label, query-heavy, or surrogate-based attacks are ill-suited. This work seeks a query-efficient method to attack models with evolving output spaces (e.g., translation, open-ended generation).

Method: 1) Train a clustering-based surrogate to map dynamic outputs to a static single-output proxy, converting dynamic-output problems to a static one. 2) Propose farthest-label targeted attacks that select adversarial vectors maximizing deviation from the model's coarse-grained labels. 3) Evaluate on four datasets and eight victim models (including ChatGPT-4o/4.1). 4) Extend the framework to generative tasks by treating translation as a classification problem with unbounded output spaces.

Result: With a single query per text, TDOA achieves a maximum attack success rate of 50.81%. In conventional static-output scenarios, it attains a state-of-the-art ASR of 82.68%. When applied to translation framed as classification, it surpasses prior results by up to 0.64 BLEU (RDBLEU) and 0.62 chrF.

Conclusion: TDOA offers a robust, query-efficient adversarial framework for dynamic-output NLP tasks, revealing vulnerabilities in large language models with limited access. It also strengthens static-output attacks and extends to generative tasks like translation, broadening the scope of NLP adversarial research.

Abstract: Text adversarial attack methods are typically designed for static scenarios
with fixed numbers of output labels and a predefined label space, relying on
extensive querying of the victim model (query-based attacks) or the surrogate
model (transfer-based attacks). To address this gap, we introduce the Textual
Dynamic Outputs Attack (TDOA) method, which employs a clustering-based
surrogate model training approach to convert the dynamic-output scenario into a
static single-output scenario. To improve attack effectiveness, we propose the
farthest-label targeted attack strategy, which selects adversarial vectors that
deviate most from the model's coarse-grained labels, thereby maximizing
disruption. We extensively evaluate TDOA on four datasets and eight victim
models (e.g., ChatGPT-4o, ChatGPT-4.1), showing its effectiveness in crafting
adversarial examples and its strong potential to compromise large language
models with limited access. With a single query per text, TDOA achieves a
maximum attack success rate of 50.81\%. Additionally, we find that TDOA also
achieves state-of-the-art performance in conventional static output scenarios,
reaching a maximum ASR of 82.68\%. Meanwhile, by conceptualizing translation
tasks as classification problems with unbounded output spaces, we extend the
TDOA framework to generative settings, surpassing prior results by up to 0.64
RDBLEU and 0.62 RDchrF.

### [130] [Integrating Background Knowledge in Medical Semantic Segmentation with Logic Tensor Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22399)
*Luca Bergamin,Giovanna Maria Dimitri,Fabio Aiolli*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A neurosymbolic segmentation approach using Logic Tensor Networks to encode medical knowledge as first-order logic rules to regularize a SwinUNETR-based model, improving hippocampus segmentation in brain MRI, especially when labeled data is scarce.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning segmentation benefits from incorporating domain-specific medical knowledge to enforce plausible shapes and inter-region relationships, reducing errors due to noise/artifacts and data scarcity.

Method: Integrate Logic Tensor Networks with an end-to-end SwinUNETR semantic segmentation framework by encoding FOL rules (shape and relational constraints) as LTNs and optimizing jointly with segmentation.

Result: LTNs improve baseline segmentation performance, with larger gains under limited training data, indicating effective leveraging of medical knowledge.

Conclusion: Neurosymbolic methods like LTNs are a general, promising approach for medical semantic segmentation, potentially adaptable to other tasks, though still in a preliminary stage.

Abstract: Semantic segmentation is a fundamental task in medical image analysis, aiding
medical decision-making by helping radiologists distinguish objects in an
image. Research in this field has been driven by deep learning applications,
which have the potential to scale these systems even in the presence of noise
and artifacts. However, these systems are not yet perfected. We argue that
performance can be improved by incorporating common medical knowledge into the
segmentation model's loss function. To this end, we introduce Logic Tensor
Networks (LTNs) to encode medical background knowledge using first-order logic
(FOL) rules. The encoded rules span from constraints on the shape of the
produced segmentation, to relationships between different segmented areas. We
apply LTNs in an end-to-end framework with a SwinUNETR for semantic
segmentation. We evaluate our method on the task of segmenting the hippocampus
in brain MRI scans. Our experiments show that LTNs improve the baseline
segmentation performance, especially when training data is scarce. Despite
being in its preliminary stages, we argue that neurosymbolic methods are
general enough to be adapted and applied to other medical semantic segmentation
tasks.

### [131] [Closing the Safety Gap: Surgical Concept Erasure in Visual Autoregressive Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22400)
*Xinhao Zhong,Yimin Zhou,Zhiqi Zhang,Junhao Li,Yi Sun,Bin Chen,Shu-Tao Xia,Ke Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduces VARE and S-VARE for safe, surgical concept erasure in visual autoregressive (VAR) text-to-image models, using auxiliary tokens and specialized losses to minimize fine-tuning while preserving quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses safety concerns in autoregressive text-to-image generation. Existing concept erasure methods are designed for diffusion models and do not generalize to VARs due to the next-token prediction paradigm, necessitating stable, minimally invasive erasure.

Method: VARE framework uses auxiliary visual tokens to reduce fine-tuning intensity. Building on this, S-VARE applies a filtered cross-entropy loss to precisely identify and minimally adjust unsafe visual tokens, plus a preservation loss to maintain semantic fidelity and mitigate language drift and reduced diversity.

Result: Extensive experiments show surgical concept erasure with preserved generation quality, closing the safety gap in autoregressive text-to-image generation compared to earlier methods.

Conclusion: VARE and S-VARE enable safe deployment of VAR-based text-to-image models by enabling precise, surgical concept erasure with minimal impact on output quality and diversity.

Abstract: The rapid progress of visual autoregressive (VAR) models has brought new
opportunities for text-to-image generation, but also heightened safety
concerns. Existing concept erasure techniques, primarily designed for diffusion
models, fail to generalize to VARs due to their next-scale token prediction
paradigm. In this paper, we first propose a novel VAR Erasure framework VARE
that enables stable concept erasure in VAR models by leveraging auxiliary
visual tokens to reduce fine-tuning intensity. Building upon this, we introduce
S-VARE, a novel and effective concept erasure method designed for VAR, which
incorporates a filtered cross entropy loss to precisely identify and minimally
adjust unsafe visual tokens, along with a preservation loss to maintain
semantic fidelity, addressing the issues such as language drift and reduced
diversity introduce by na\"ive fine-tuning. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our approach achieves surgical concept erasure while preserving generation
quality, thereby closing the safety gap in autoregressive text-to-image
generation by earlier methods.

### [132] [RAU: Reference-based Anatomical Understanding with Vision Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22404)
*Yiwei Li,Yikang Liu,Jiaqi Guo,Lin Zhao,Zheyuan Zhang,Xiao Chen,Boris Mailhe,Ankush Mukherjee,Terrence Chen,Shanhui Sun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RAU is a reference-based framework that uses vision-language models to interpret a labeled reference image to localize and segment anatomical structures in a target image, then fuses VLM spatial cues with SAM2 for pixel-level segmentation, achieving strong generalization and outperformance over a SAM2 baseline on diverse datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical image understanding lags due to limited expert-labeled data. Leveraging annotated reference images could guide interpretation of unlabeled targets, but current VLMs struggle with reference-based reasoning and fine-grained localization in anatomy.

Method: Train a VLM on a moderately sized dataset to perform relative spatial reasoning between a reference and a target image, enabling region identification via VQA and bounding box tasks. Extract spatial cues from the VLM and integrate them with SAM2’s segmentation pipeline to localize and segment small anatomical regions. Evaluate across two in-distribution and two out-of-distribution datasets, comparing to a SAM2 fine-tuning baseline using the same memory setup.

Result: RAU outperforms the SAM2 fine-tuning baseline in both accuracy of segmentations and reliability of localization across both in-distribution and out-of-distribution datasets, demonstrating strong generalization to unseen data and establishing VLMs as viable tools for reference-based anatomical understanding in medical imaging.

Conclusion: VLM-driven reference-based understanding can effectively identify, localize, and segment anatomical structures when combined with powerful segmentation models like SAM2, enabling scalable and robust anatomical understanding for automated clinical workflows.

Abstract: Anatomical understanding through deep learning is critical for automatic
report generation, intra-operative navigation, and organ localization in
medical imaging; however, its progress is constrained by the scarcity of
expert-labeled data. A promising remedy is to leverage an annotated reference
image to guide the interpretation of an unlabeled target. Although recent
vision-language models (VLMs) exhibit non-trivial visual reasoning, their
reference-based understanding and fine-grained localization remain limited. We
introduce RAU, a framework for reference-based anatomical understanding with
VLMs. We first show that a VLM learns to identify anatomical regions through
relative spatial reasoning between reference and target images, trained on a
moderately sized dataset. We validate this capability through visual question
answering (VQA) and bounding box prediction. Next, we demonstrate that the
VLM-derived spatial cues can be seamlessly integrated with the fine-grained
segmentation capability of SAM2, enabling localization and pixel-level
segmentation of small anatomical regions, such as vessel segments. Across two
in-distribution and two out-of-distribution datasets, RAU consistently
outperforms a SAM2 fine-tuning baseline using the same memory setup, yielding
more accurate segmentations and more reliable localization. More importantly,
its strong generalization ability makes it scalable to out-of-distribution
datasets, a property crucial for medical image applications. To the best of our
knowledge, RAU is the first to explore the capability of VLMs for
reference-based identification, localization, and segmentation of anatomical
structures in medical images. Its promising performance highlights the
potential of VLM-driven approaches for anatomical understanding in automated
clinical workflows.

### [133] [FreqDebias: Towards Generalizable Deepfake Detection via Consistency-Driven Frequency Debiasing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22412)
*Hossein Kashiani,Niloufar Alipour Talemi,Fatemeh Afghah*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FreqDebias combats spectral bias in deepfake detectors with Fo-Mixup and dual CR, yielding better cross-domain and in-domain performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Detectors often rely on specific frequency bands learned from limited data, causing poor generalization to unseen forgery types; there is a need to mitigate frequency-domain biases and promote robust representation learning.

Method: Propose Fo-Mixup to diversify frequency characteristics during training; implement dual consistency regularization (local CAM-based consistency and global von Mises–Fisher distribution on hyperspherical embeddings) to enforce stable representations across frequency perturbations and supervision signals.

Result: Extensive experiments show improved cross-domain generalization and state-of-the-art performance in both cross-domain and in-domain evaluations.

Conclusion: Spectral bias is addressable; the combination of frequency-aware augmentation and dual consistency regularization improves robustness and generalization of deepfake detectors across diverse forgery types.

Abstract: Deepfake detectors often struggle to generalize to novel forgery types due to
biases learned from limited training data. In this paper, we identify a new
type of model bias in the frequency domain, termed spectral bias, where
detectors overly rely on specific frequency bands, restricting their ability to
generalize across unseen forgeries. To address this, we propose FreqDebias, a
frequency debiasing framework that mitigates spectral bias through two
complementary strategies. First, we introduce a novel Forgery Mixup (Fo-Mixup)
augmentation, which dynamically diversifies frequency characteristics of
training samples. Second, we incorporate a dual consistency regularization
(CR), which enforces both local consistency using class activation maps (CAMs)
and global consistency through a von Mises-Fisher (vMF) distribution on a
hyperspherical embedding space. This dual CR mitigates over-reliance on certain
frequency components by promoting consistent representation learning under both
local and global supervision. Extensive experiments show that FreqDebias
significantly enhances cross-domain generalization and outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in both cross-domain and in-domain settings.

### [134] [LucidFlux: Caption-Free Universal Image Restoration via a Large-Scale Diffusion Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22414)
*Song Fei,Tian Ye,Lujia Wang,Lei Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LucidFlux is a caption-free universal image restoration framework that adapts a large diffusion transformer with a dual-branch conditioning mechanism and adaptive modulation to leverage degraded inputs and a proxy, achieving state-of-the-art results without captions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: UIR under unknown degradations often oversmooths, hallucinates, or drifts with existing discriminative restorers or UNet-based diffusion priors; there is a need for caption-free, semantic-alignment-capable restoration using scalable supervision.

Method: Introduce a lightweight dual-branch conditioner that injects signals from the degraded input and a lightly restored proxy to anchor geometry and suppress artifacts, plus a timestep- and layer-adaptive modulation schedule across the diffusion backbone. Enforce caption-free semantic alignment via SigLIP features from the proxy. Utilize a scalable data-curation pipeline for structure-rich supervision.

Result: LucidFlux outperforms strong open-source and commercial baselines on synthetic and in-the-wild benchmarks. Ablation studies confirm the necessity of each component. The results suggest that conditioning strategy (when/where/what to condition on) is the key lever for robust, caption-free UIR in the wild.

Conclusion: For large diffusion transformers, intelligent conditioning—rather than increasing parameters or relying on text prompts—is the governing lever for robust, caption-free universal image restoration; LucidFlux demonstrates this approach's effectiveness in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Universal image restoration (UIR) aims to recover images degraded by unknown
mixtures while preserving semantics -- conditions under which discriminative
restorers and UNet-based diffusion priors often oversmooth, hallucinate, or
drift. We present LucidFlux, a caption-free UIR framework that adapts a large
diffusion transformer (Flux.1) without image captions. LucidFlux introduces a
lightweight dual-branch conditioner that injects signals from the degraded
input and a lightly restored proxy to respectively anchor geometry and suppress
artifacts. Then, a timestep- and layer-adaptive modulation schedule is designed
to route these cues across the backbone's hierarchy, in order to yield
coarse-to-fine and context-aware updates that protect the global structure
while recovering texture. After that, to avoid the latency and instability of
text prompts or MLLM captions, we enforce caption-free semantic alignment via
SigLIP features extracted from the proxy. A scalable curation pipeline further
filters large-scale data for structure-rich supervision. Across synthetic and
in-the-wild benchmarks, LucidFlux consistently outperforms strong open-source
and commercial baselines, and ablation studies verify the necessity of each
component. LucidFlux shows that, for large DiTs, when, where, and what to
condition on -- rather than adding parameters or relying on text prompts -- is
the governing lever for robust and caption-free universal image restoration in
the wild.

### [135] [Explaining multimodal LLMs via intra-modal token interactions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22415)
*Jiawei Liang,Ruoyu Chen,Xianghao Jiao,Siyuan Liang,Shiming Liu,Qunli Zhang,Zheng Hu,Xiaochun Cao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes intra-modal explainability methods for multimodal LLMs: MSEA for visual explanations via multi-scale attribution aggregation and ARC for textual explanations via activation ranking correlation; demonstrates improved fidelity and granularity over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current interpretability work for multimodal models largely emphasizes cross-modal attribution and ignores intra-modal dependencies. In visual modalities, explanations based on single patches miss spatial context due to limited receptive fields; in text, relying on preceding tokens can cause spurious activations. This undermines attribution fidelity.

Method: For visuals, Multi-Scale Explanation Aggregation (MSEA) aggregates attributions across multi-scale inputs to dynamically adjust receptive fields, yielding spatially coherent explanations. For text, Activation Ranking Correlation (ARC) measures contextual token relevance to the current token by aligning their top-k prediction rankings and uses this relevance to suppress irrelevant contextual activations while preserving coherent ones.

Result: Extensive experiments on state-of-the-art MLLMs and benchmark datasets show the proposed methods outperform existing interpretability approaches, delivering more faithful and fine-grained explanations of model behavior.

Conclusion: Intra-modal interactions can significantly enhance interpretability for MLLMs. The MSEA and ARC approaches provide more faithful, coherent explanations across visual and textual modalities and are broadly applicable to current MLLMs, with potential for further efficiency and generalization improvements.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable success
across diverse vision-language tasks, yet their internal decision-making
mechanisms remain insufficiently understood. Existing interpretability research
has primarily focused on cross-modal attribution, identifying which image
regions the model attends to during output generation. However, these
approaches often overlook intra-modal dependencies. In the visual modality,
attributing importance to isolated image patches ignores spatial context due to
limited receptive fields, resulting in fragmented and noisy explanations. In
the textual modality, reliance on preceding tokens introduces spurious
activations. Failing to effectively mitigate these interference compromises
attribution fidelity. To address these limitations, we propose enhancing
interpretability by leveraging intra-modal interaction. For the visual branch,
we introduce \textit{Multi-Scale Explanation Aggregation} (MSEA), which
aggregates attributions over multi-scale inputs to dynamically adjust receptive
fields, producing more holistic and spatially coherent visual explanations. For
the textual branch, we propose \textit{Activation Ranking Correlation} (ARC),
which measures the relevance of contextual tokens to the current token via
alignment of their top-$k$ prediction rankings. ARC leverages this relevance to
suppress spurious activations from irrelevant contexts while preserving
semantically coherent ones. Extensive experiments across state-of-the-art MLLMs
and benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms
existing interpretability methods, yielding more faithful and fine-grained
explanations of model behavior.

*Bohan Huang,Qianyun Bao,Haoyuan Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: U-MAN is a U-Net variant that uses attention-based PAGF to fuse encoder-decoder features and a Multi-scale Adaptive KAN (MAN) to process features at multiple scales, addressing semantic gaps and scale variability to improve boundaries and fine details in segmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional U-Nets' skip connections ignore the encoder-decoder semantic gap and lack deep multi-scale feature extraction, leading to blurred boundaries and loss of fine details in complex anatomical/pathological regions.

Method: Introduce U-MAN by augmenting Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) with two modules: Progressive Attention-Guided Feature Fusion (PAGF) which replaces plain skip connections with attention-based fusion of encoder and decoder features, and Multi-scale Adaptive KAN (MAN) enabling adaptive multi-scale feature processing; evaluated on three public datasets (BUSI, GLAS, CVC).

Result: U-MAN outperforms state-of-the-art methods, with notable gains in boundary accuracy and preservation of fine details across the tested datasets.

Conclusion: PAGF and MAN effectively address the encoder-decoder semantic gap and multi-scale feature extraction limitations of standard U-Nets, yielding improved segmentation performance on challenging medical images.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation faces significant challenges in preserving
fine-grained details and precise boundaries due to complex anatomical
structures and pathological regions. These challenges primarily stem from two
key limitations of conventional U-Net architectures: (1) their simple skip
connections ignore the encoder-decoder semantic gap between various features,
and (2) they lack the capability for multi-scale feature extraction in deep
layers. To address these challenges, we propose the U-Net with Multi-scale
Adaptive KAN (U-MAN), a novel architecture that enhances the emerging
Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) with two specialized modules: Progressive
Attention-Guided Feature Fusion (PAGF) and the Multi-scale Adaptive KAN (MAN).
Our PAGF module replaces the simple skip connection, using attention to fuse
features from the encoder and decoder. The MAN module enables the network to
adaptively process features at multiple scales, improving its ability to
segment objects of various sizes. Experiments on three public datasets (BUSI,
GLAS, and CVC) show that U-MAN outperforms state-of-the-art methods,
particularly in defining accurate boundaries and preserving fine details.

### [137] [$γ$-Quant: Towards Learnable Quantization for Low-bit Pattern Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22448)
*Mishal Fatima,Shashank Agnihotri,Marius Bock,Kanchana Vaishnavi Gandikota,Kristof Van Laerhoven,Michael Moeller,Margret Keuper*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Learnable non-linear quantization (gamma-Quant) for pattern recognition on low-bit data; achieves comparable performance to higher-bit raw data in image object detection and HAR, enabling low-bandwidth, energy-efficient sensing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pre-processing pipelines for vision and sensor data may hinder automated analysis and waste energy; low-bit-depth capture can hurt performance. The work investigates task-specific quantization to preserve discriminative information in low-bandwidth settings.

Method: Introduce gamma-Quant, a learnable non-linear quantization tailored to the task. Apply to two domains: raw-image object detection and wearable HAR. Train quantizer jointly with downstream models; demonstrate with as few as 4 bits.

Result: 4-bit gamma-Quant matches performance of 12-bit raw data across the tested tasks; code released.

Conclusion: Task-specific learnable quantization can bridge the gap between low-bit data and high-quality raw data, enabling efficient perception and analytics in resource-constrained environments.

Abstract: Most pattern recognition models are developed on pre-proce\-ssed data. In
computer vision, for instance, RGB images processed through image signal
processing (ISP) pipelines designed to cater to human perception are the most
frequent input to image analysis networks. However, many modern vision tasks
operate without a human in the loop, raising the question of whether such
pre-processing is optimal for automated analysis. Similarly, human activity
recognition (HAR) on body-worn sensor data commonly takes normalized
floating-point data arising from a high-bit analog-to-digital converter (ADC)
as an input, despite such an approach being highly inefficient in terms of data
transmission, significantly affecting the battery life of wearable devices. In
this work, we target low-bandwidth and energy-constrained settings where
sensors are limited to low-bit-depth capture. We propose $\gamma$-Quant,
i.e.~the task-specific learning of a non-linear quantization for pattern
recognition. We exemplify our approach on raw-image object detection as well as
HAR of wearable data, and demonstrate that raw data with a learnable
quantization using as few as 4-bits can perform on par with the use of raw
12-bit data. All code to reproduce our experiments is publicly available via

### [138] [SSVIF: Self-Supervised Segmentation-Oriented Visible and Infrared Image Fusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22450)
*Zixian Zhao,Xingchen Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A self-supervised segmentation-oriented VIF framework (SSVIF) that learns from unlabeled visible–infrared pairs via cross-segmentation consistency, achieving competitive results with supervised methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reduce labeling burden for downstream segmentation tasks in visible–infrared image fusion by moving from supervised to self-supervised learning, leveraging task-consistency to guide fusion.

Method: Propose SSVIF with cross-segmentation consistency between feature-level fusion-based segmentation and pixel-level fusion-based segmentation, plus a two-stage training strategy and dynamic weight adjustment; trained on unlabeled visible–infrared image pairs.

Result: Extensive experiments on public datasets show that SSVIF outperforms traditional VIF methods and rivals supervised segmentation-oriented methods, despite being trained without segmentation labels; code to be released.

Conclusion: SSVIF demonstrates that high-level semantic fusion features can be learned without segmentation labels, enabling competitive segmentation-oriented VIF and reducing data-labeling requirements, with effective joint learning and promising future work.

Abstract: Visible and infrared image fusion (VIF) has gained significant attention in
recent years due to its wide application in tasks such as scene segmentation
and object detection. VIF methods can be broadly classified into traditional
VIF methods and application-oriented VIF methods. Traditional methods focus
solely on improving the quality of fused images, while application-oriented VIF
methods additionally consider the performance of downstream tasks on fused
images by introducing task-specific loss terms during training. However,
compared to traditional methods, application-oriented VIF methods require
datasets labeled for downstream tasks (e.g., semantic segmentation or object
detection), making data acquisition labor-intensive and time-consuming. To
address this issue, we propose a self-supervised training framework for
segmentation-oriented VIF methods (SSVIF). Leveraging the consistency between
feature-level fusion-based segmentation and pixel-level fusion-based
segmentation, we introduce a novel self-supervised task-cross-segmentation
consistency-that enables the fusion model to learn high-level semantic features
without the supervision of segmentation labels. Additionally, we design a
two-stage training strategy and a dynamic weight adjustment method for
effective joint learning within our self-supervised framework. Extensive
experiments on public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed
SSVIF. Remarkably, although trained only on unlabeled visible-infrared image
pairs, our SSVIF outperforms traditional VIF methods and rivals supervised
segmentation-oriented ones. Our code will be released upon acceptance.

### [139] [Bézier Meets Diffusion: Robust Generation Across Domains for Medical Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22476)
*Chen Li,Meilong Xu,Xiaoling Hu,Weimin Lyu,Chao Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Unified Bezier-guided diffusion framework for cross-domain medical image generation to improve unsupervised domain adaptation. Reduces domain gap with Bezier-curve style transfer, uses pseudo-labels from a segmentation model to train a conditional diffusion model (CDM) that synthesizes labeled target-domain images, and introduces uncertainty-guided score matching to handle noisy pseudo-labels. Leads to realistic labeled target-domain data and improved segmentation performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large domain gaps between medical imaging modalities hinder robust UDA. GAN-based style transfer often fails in regions with high variability, and labeled target-domain data is scarce. A framework that can both align domains and generate labeled target-domain images could significantly improve cross-domain segmentation.

Method: 1) Bezier-curve-based style transfer to reduce source-target domain gap. 2) Train segmentation on transferred source images to obtain pseudo-labels for the target domain. 3) Train a conditional diffusion model (CDM) conditioned on target images and pseudo-labels to synthesize labeled target-domain images. 4) Apply uncertainty-guided score matching to mitigate pseudo-label noise during CDM training. 5) Evaluate on public datasets, showing improved segmentation and realistic labeled target-domain data.

Result: The approach yields realistic labeled images and augments the target domain, leading to improved segmentation performance across modalities in public datasets.

Conclusion: Bezier Meets Diffusion provides a unified framework that combines style-transfer-based domain alignment with diffusion-based data synthesis, along with uncertainty-aware training, to enhance cross-domain medical image segmentation.

Abstract: Training robust learning algorithms across different medical imaging
modalities is challenging due to the large domain gap. Unsupervised domain
adaptation (UDA) mitigates this problem by using annotated images from the
source domain and unlabeled images from the target domain to train the deep
models. Existing approaches often rely on GAN-based style transfer, but these
methods struggle to capture cross-domain mappings in regions with high
variability. In this paper, we propose a unified framework, B\'ezier Meets
Diffusion, for cross-domain image generation. First, we introduce a
B\'ezier-curve-based style transfer strategy that effectively reduces the
domain gap between source and target domains. The transferred source images
enable the training of a more robust segmentation model across domains.
Thereafter, using pseudo-labels generated by this segmentation model on the
target domain, we train a conditional diffusion model (CDM) to synthesize
high-quality, labeled target-domain images. To mitigate the impact of noisy
pseudo-labels, we further develop an uncertainty-guided score matching method
that improves the robustness of CDM training. Extensive experiments on public
datasets demonstrate that our approach generates realistic labeled images,
significantly augmenting the target domain and improving segmentation
performance.

### [140] [PSTTS: A Plug-and-Play Token Selector for Efficient Event-based Spatio-temporal Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22481)
*Xiangmo Zhao,Nan Yang,Yang Wang,Zhanwen Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PSTTS is a plug-and-play, parameter-free module that sparsifies event-based tokens in two stages (Spatial Purification and Temporal Selection) to reduce computation (FLOPs -29% to -43.6%, FPS +21.6% to +41.3%) while preserving accuracy across several backbones (UniformerV2, VideoSwin, EVMamba, ExACT) on HARDVS, DailyDVS-200, and SeACT.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Event-based frame sequences suffer from high spatial sparsity and inter-frame motion redundancy, causing heavy computation. Existing RGB video token sparsification fails for event data due to noisy intermediate representations and domain mismatch. A direct, data-driven, parameter-free approach is needed to leverage the raw event stream’s spatio-temporal distribution to discard redundant tokens.

Method: PSTTS comprises two stages: (1) Spatial Token Purification—evaluates spatio-temporal consistency within each event frame to filter out noise and non-event regions before temporal analysis; (2) Temporal Token Selection—assesses motion-pattern similarity between adjacent frames to identify and remove redundant temporal tokens. It is plug-and-play with no extra parameters and is applied to multiple backbones (UniformerV2, VideoSwin, EVMamba, ExACT) on three datasets (HARDVS, DailyDVS-200, SeACT).

Result: Experimental results show substantial efficiency gains: 29-43.6% reduction in FLOPs and 21.6-41.3% increase in FPS on DailyDVS-200, while maintaining task accuracy. The method generalizes across four backbones and three event datasets, indicating robust, dataset- and architecture-agnostic gains.

Conclusion: PSTTS offers an effective, parameter-free approach to sparse token selection for event data, achieving notable speedups without sacrificing accuracy. It highlights the importance of leveraging intrinsic spatio-temporal structure in raw event streams and provides a practical plug-in for existing architectures; future work may explore broader datasets, ablations, and code release.

Abstract: Mainstream event-based spatio-temporal representation learning methods
typically process event streams by converting them into sequences of event
frames, achieving remarkable performance. However, they neglect the high
spatial sparsity and inter-frame motion redundancy inherent in event frame
sequences, leading to significant computational overhead. Existing token
sparsification methods for RGB videos rely on unreliable intermediate token
representations and neglect the influence of event noise, making them
ineffective for direct application to event data. In this paper, we propose
Progressive Spatio-Temporal Token Selection (PSTTS), a Plug-and-Play module for
event data without introducing any additional parameters. PSTTS exploits the
spatio-temporal distribution characteristics embedded in raw event data to
effectively identify and discard spatio-temporal redundant tokens, achieving an
optimal trade-off between accuracy and efficiency. Specifically, PSTTS consists
of two stages, Spatial Token Purification and Temporal Token Selection. Spatial
Token Purification discards noise and non-event regions by assessing the
spatio-temporal consistency of events within each event frame to prevent
interference with subsequent temporal redundancy evaluation. Temporal Token
Selection evaluates the motion pattern similarity between adjacent event
frames, precisely identifying and removing redundant temporal information. We
apply PSTTS to four representative backbones UniformerV2, VideoSwin, EVMamba,
and ExACT on the HARDVS, DailyDVS-200, and SeACT datasets. Experimental results
demonstrate that PSTTS achieves significant efficiency improvements.
Specifically, PSTTS reduces FLOPs by 29-43.6% and increases FPS by 21.6-41.3%
on the DailyDVS-200 dataset, while maintaining task accuracy. Our code will be
available.

### [141] [Group Critical-token Policy Optimization for Autoregressive Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22485)
*Guohui Zhang,Hu Yu,Xiaoxiao Ma,JingHao Zhang,Yaning Pan,Mingde Yao,Jie Xiao,Linjiang Huang,Feng Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GCPO identifies critical tokens in autoregressive RLVR image generation using three criteria (causal dependency, entropy-induced spatial structure, and token diversity). It dynamically weighs token-wise advantages to encourage exploration, and optimizes only 30% of tokens, outperforming full-token GRPO. Validated on multiple text-to-image benchmarks for AR and multimodal models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RLVR with autoregressive image generation currently applies uniform optimization across all tokens, neglecting the varying impact of individual tokens on training and final image quality. There is a need to identify and optimize the most influential tokens to improve data efficiency and performance.

Method: Identify critical tokens via three perspectives: (1) causal dependency (early tokens shape later outputs), (2) entropy-induced spatial structure (high entropy gradients align with image structure and regional bridges), (3) RLVR-focused token diversity (tokens with low cross-sample visual similarity contribute richer diversity). Introduce a dynamic token-wise advantage weight based on confidence divergence between the policy model and a reference model. Optimize only a subset (30%) of tokens rather than all tokens, enabling targeted policy updates.

Result: GCPO with 30% token optimization achieves better performance than GRPO using full tokens across AR and unified multimodal benchmarks, demonstrating effective token-wise policy optimization for RLVR-based AR generation.

Conclusion: Token-wise optimization guided by identified critical tokens improves RLVR-based autoregressive visual generation, offering data-efficient gains and potential applicability to broader AR and multimodal generation tasks.

Abstract: Recent studies have extended Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards
(RLVR) to autoregressive (AR) visual generation and achieved promising
progress. However, existing methods typically apply uniform optimization across
all image tokens, while the varying contributions of different image tokens for
RLVR's training remain unexplored. In fact, the key obstacle lies in how to
identify more critical image tokens during AR generation and implement
effective token-wise optimization for them. To tackle this challenge, we
propose $\textbf{G}$roup $\textbf{C}$ritical-token $\textbf{P}$olicy
$\textbf{O}$ptimization ($\textbf{GCPO}$), which facilitates effective policy
optimization on critical tokens. We identify the critical tokens in RLVR-based
AR generation from three perspectives, specifically: $\textbf{(1)}$ Causal
dependency: early tokens fundamentally determine the later tokens and final
image effect due to unidirectional dependency; $\textbf{(2)}$ Entropy-induced
spatial structure: tokens with high entropy gradients correspond to image
structure and bridges distinct visual regions; $\textbf{(3)}$ RLVR-focused
token diversity: tokens with low visual similarity across a group of sampled
images contribute to richer token-level diversity. For these identified
critical tokens, we further introduce a dynamic token-wise advantage weight to
encourage exploration, based on confidence divergence between the policy model
and reference model. By leveraging 30\% of the image tokens, GCPO achieves
better performance than GRPO with full tokens. Extensive experiments on
multiple text-to-image benchmarks for both AR models and unified multimodal
models demonstrate the effectiveness of GCPO for AR visual generation.

*Ruoyu Chen,Xiaoqing Guo,Kangwei Liu,Siyuan Liang,Shiming Liu,Qunli Zhang,Hua Zhang,Xiaochun Cao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EAGLE is a lightweight black-box framework that explains autoregressive token generation in multimodal LLMs by attributing tokens to compact visual regions and jointly optimizing sufficiency and indispensability, enabling faithful, localization-aware, and modality-aware attribution with lower memory usage; it outperforms prior methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The extent to which generated tokens depend on visual modalities remains poorly understood, limiting interpretability and reliability of multimodal LLMs.

Method: Introduce EAGLE, a black-box attribution framework that attributes selected tokens to compact perceptual regions. It quantifies language priors vs perceptual evidence and unifies sufficiency (insight score) and indispensability (necessity score) in a single objective, optimized via greedy search over sparsified image regions. It also provides modality-aware analysis for fine-grained interpretability.

Result: Across open-source MLLMs, EAGLE consistently outperforms existing methods in faithfulness, localization, and hallucination diagnosis, while requiring substantially less GPU memory.

Conclusion: EAGLE offers an effective, practical, and memory-efficient approach for interpreting token generation in MLLMs, enabling finer-grained, modality-aware explanations; code is available.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in aligning visual inputs with natural language outputs. Yet, the
extent to which generated tokens depend on visual modalities remains poorly
understood, limiting interpretability and reliability. In this work, we present
EAGLE, a lightweight black-box framework for explaining autoregressive token
generation in MLLMs. EAGLE attributes any selected tokens to compact perceptual
regions while quantifying the relative influence of language priors and
perceptual evidence. The framework introduces an objective function that
unifies sufficiency (insight score) and indispensability (necessity score),
optimized via greedy search over sparsified image regions for faithful and
efficient attribution. Beyond spatial attribution, EAGLE performs
modality-aware analysis that disentangles what tokens rely on, providing
fine-grained interpretability of model decisions. Extensive experiments across
open-source MLLMs show that EAGLE consistently outperforms existing methods in
faithfulness, localization, and hallucination diagnosis, while requiring
substantially less GPU memory. These results highlight its effectiveness and
practicality for advancing the interpretability of MLLMs. The code is available

*Alexandra Gomez-Villa,Pablo Hernández-Cámara,Muhammad Atif Butt,Valero Laparra,Jesus Malo,Javier Vazquez-Corral*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Color naming in vision-language models closely mirrors human naming for prototypical colors but falters for non-prototypical colors; model architecture and multilingual training data drive naming patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To quantify whether VLMs name colors similarly to humans, and to reveal biases, linguistic influences, and the role of model architecture in color naming.

Method: Replicated classic color naming experiments using 957 color samples across five representative VLMs. Assessed performance differences between prototypical and expanded color sets. Identified 21 common terms across models. Conducted cross-linguistic analysis across nine languages. Performed ablations to separate effects of language model architecture from visual processing.

Result: VLMs achieve high accuracy on prototypical colors but show significant drops on expanded color sets. 21 common color terms emerge across models. Two naming regimes: constrained models rely on basic terms; expansive models use systematic lightness modifiers. Cross-linguistic results reveal training imbalances favoring English and Chinese. Hue is the primary driver of naming decisions. Language model architecture significantly influences color naming independent of visual input.

Conclusion: Color naming in VLMs is shaped by language model architecture and training data; robust, multilingual color semantics require balanced multilingual training and architecture-aware design. Further work should explore improving non-prototypical color recognition and mitigating linguistic biases.

Abstract: Color serves as a fundamental dimension of human visual perception and a
primary means of communicating about objects and scenes. As vision-language
models (VLMs) become increasingly prevalent, understanding whether they name
colors like humans is crucial for effective human-AI interaction. We present
the first systematic evaluation of color naming capabilities across VLMs,
replicating classic color naming methodologies using 957 color samples across
five representative models. Our results show that while VLMs achieve high
accuracy on prototypical colors from classical studies, performance drops
significantly on expanded, non-prototypical color sets. We identify 21 common
color terms that consistently emerge across all models, revealing two distinct
approaches: constrained models using predominantly basic terms versus expansive
models employing systematic lightness modifiers. Cross-linguistic analysis
across nine languages demonstrates severe training imbalances favoring English
and Chinese, with hue serving as the primary driver of color naming decisions.
Finally, ablation studies reveal that language model architecture significantly
influences color naming independent of visual processing capabilities.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EfficientDepth introduces a transformer-based MDE with a lightweight convolutional decoder and a bimodal density head, trained on mixed synthetic/real data and pseudo-labeled real images, optimized in multiple stages with an LPIPS-based loss, achieving SOTA-like accuracy with reduced compute.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Monocular depth estimation still struggles with geometric consistency, fine detail, robustness to reflections, and efficiency on edge devices, limiting 3D reconstruction and view synthesis.

Method: Proposes EfficientDepth architecture: (i) transformer backbone for global context, (ii) lightweight convolutional decoder for efficiency, (iii) bimodal density head for detailed depth estimation, (iv) training on labeled synthetic/real data plus pseudo-labels from a strong MDE, (v) multi-stage optimization to improve training efficiency and stability, (vi) LPIPS-based loss to encourage perceptual depth detail.

Result: Experimental results show that EfficientDepth achieves comparable or better performance than state-of-the-art models while significantly reducing computational resources.

Conclusion: EfficientDepth provides an efficient, robust MDE solution that emphasizes geometric consistency and fine detail, leveraging mixed data, multi-stage training, and perceptual detail losses to bridge 3D reconstruction and view synthesis requirements on edge devices.

Abstract: Monocular depth estimation (MDE) plays a pivotal role in various computer
vision applications, such as robotics, augmented reality, and autonomous
driving. Despite recent advancements, existing methods often fail to meet key
requirements for 3D reconstruction and view synthesis, including geometric
consistency, fine details, robustness to real-world challenges like reflective
surfaces, and efficiency for edge devices. To address these challenges, we
introduce a novel MDE system, called EfficientDepth, which combines a
transformer architecture with a lightweight convolutional decoder, as well as a
bimodal density head that allows the network to estimate detailed depth maps.
We train our model on a combination of labeled synthetic and real images, as
well as pseudo-labeled real images, generated using a high-performing MDE
method. Furthermore, we employ a multi-stage optimization strategy to improve
training efficiency and produce models that emphasize geometric consistency and
fine detail. Finally, in addition to commonly used objectives, we introduce a
loss function based on LPIPS to encourage the network to produce detailed depth
maps. Experimental results demonstrate that EfficientDepth achieves performance
comparable to or better than existing state-of-the-art models, with
significantly reduced computational resources.

It analyzes methods along three core components—representation learning, label assignment, and estimation of class numbers—benchmarks approaches, and distills key insights: large pretrained backbones, hierarchical and auxiliary cues, and curriculum-style training are beneficial, while label assignment, class-number estimation, and scalability to multi-object scenarios remain challenging; it also provides a living repository for ongoing updates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CD is an open-world learning task where unlabeled data from unseen classes must be organized using labeled data from seen classes. A systematic taxonomy, rigorous analysis, and curated benchmarks are needed to guide future research and synthesize rapidly growing literature.

Method: Propose a taxonomy with two base settings (novel category discovery, generalized category discovery) and several derived settings (continual CD, skewed data distribution, federated CD). For each setting, analyze methods along three fundamental components: representation learning, label assignment, and estimation of class numbers. Benchmark methods and distill practical insights and directions.

Result: Key findings include that large-scale pretrained backbones, hierarchical/auxiliary cues, and curriculum-style training consistently benefit category discovery. Challenges persist in designing effective label assignments, accurately estimating the number of classes, and scaling methods to complex multi-object scenarios. The survey consolidates current knowledge and outlines actionable future directions, and it provides a living survey at the referenced GitHub repository.

Conclusion: The work offers a concise synthesis of the CD literature, highlights actionable insights and remaining gaps, and points to future research avenues. It also invites ongoing contributions through a living survey hosted on GitHub.

Abstract: Category discovery (CD) is an emerging open-world learning task, which aims
at automatically categorizing unlabelled data containing instances from unseen

significant attention over the years and leads to a rich body of literature

fundamental components, representation learning, label assignment, and
estimation of class number. Thirdly, we benchmark all the methods and distill
key insights showing that large-scale pretrained backbones, hierarchical and
auxiliary cues, and curriculum-style training are all beneficial for category
discovery, while challenges remain in the design of label assignment, the
estimation of class numbers, and scaling to complex multi-object

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A hybrid SSL-LLM framework (HyCoVAD) for complex video anomaly detection that combines an SSL temporal analyzer with a semantic LLM validator, achieving strong frame-level detection while reducing LLM cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Complex anomalies depend on relational and temporal interactions among entities, which are hard to capture with SSL alone and expensive for frame-by-frame LLM analysis; a hybrid approach aims to leverage SSL for low-level patterns and LLMs for semantic validation to improve detection and efficiency.

Method: Multi-task SSL temporal analyzer using an nnFormer backbone (transformer-based segmentation) trained on proxy tasks to flag frames suspected of anomaly. Suspected frames are then evaluated by an LLM that applies structured, rule-based reasoning to validate anomalies. The system also introduces an interaction anomaly taxonomy and an adaptive thresholding protocol.

Result: On ComplexVAD, HyCoVAD achieves 72.5% frame-level AUC, outperforming baselines by 12.5%. The approach reduces LLM computation compared to full-frame LLM processing and includes released resources (taxonomy, protocol, code).

Conclusion: HyCoVAD demonstrates that a targeted combination of SSL-based temporal analysis and semantic LLM validation can effectively detect complex video anomalies while maintaining efficiency, and supports future research with released resources.

Abstract: Video anomaly detection (VAD) is crucial for intelligent surveillance, but a
significant challenge lies in identifying complex anomalies, which are events
defined by intricate relationships and temporal dependencies among multiple
entities rather than by isolated actions. While self-supervised learning (SSL)
methods effectively model low-level spatiotemporal patterns, they often
struggle to grasp the semantic meaning of these interactions. Conversely, large
language models (LLMs) offer powerful contextual reasoning but are
computationally expensive for frame-by-frame analysis and lack fine-grained
spatial localization. We introduce HyCoVAD, Hybrid Complex Video Anomaly
Detection, a hybrid SSL-LLM model that combines a multi-task SSL temporal
analyzer with LLM validator. The SSL module is built upon an nnFormer backbone
which is a transformer-based model for image segmentation. It is trained with
multiple proxy tasks, learns from video frames to identify those suspected of
anomaly. The selected frames are then forwarded to the LLM, which enriches the
analysis with semantic context by applying structured, rule-based reasoning to
validate the presence of anomalies. Experiments on the challenging ComplexVAD
dataset show that HyCoVAD achieves a 72.5% frame-level AUC, outperforming
existing baselines by 12.5% while reducing LLM computation. We release our
interaction anomaly taxonomy, adaptive thresholding protocol, and code to
facilitate future research in complex VAD scenarios.

*Jini Yang,Beomseok Oh,Seungryong Kim,Sunok Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SpikeMatch is the first SSL framework for spiking neural networks that uses SNN temporal dynamics (leakage) to generate diverse pseudo-labels via a co-training style, using agreement among predictions from a single SNN to label weakly augmented unlabeled data and train on strongly augmented versions; it outperforms SSL methods adapted to SNN backbones on standard benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SSL for SNNs is underexplored compared to ANNs; leveraging SNN temporal dynamics can provide robust pseudo-labels under limited labeled data and reduce confirmation bias.

Method: Leverage leakage-based temporal dynamics for diverse pseudo-labeling; use agreement among multiple predictions from the same SNN; train with weakly augmented unlabeled samples to generate pseudo-labels and train on strongly augmented versions in a co-training-like framework.

Result: Empirical results show SpikeMatch outperforms existing SSL methods adapted to SNN backbones across standard benchmarks.

Conclusion: Shows viability and benefits of SSL for SNNs by exploiting temporal dynamics for pseudo-labeling; suggests this direction for combining SSL with biologically inspired models.

Abstract: Spiking neural networks (SNNs) have recently been attracting significant
attention for their biological plausibility and energy efficiency, but
semi-supervised learning (SSL) methods for SNN-based models remain
underexplored compared to those for artificial neural networks (ANNs). In this
paper, we introduce SpikeMatch, the first SSL framework for SNNs that leverages
the temporal dynamics through the leakage factor of SNNs for diverse
pseudo-labeling within a co-training framework. By utilizing agreement among
multiple predictions from a single SNN, SpikeMatch generates reliable
pseudo-labels from weakly-augmented unlabeled samples to train on
strongly-augmented ones, effectively mitigating confirmation bias by capturing
discriminative features with limited labels. Experiments show that SpikeMatch
outperforms existing SSL methods adapted to SNN backbones across various

### [148] [Vision-Language Alignment from Compressed Image Representations using 2D Gaussian Splatting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22615)
*Yasmine Omri,Connor Ding,Tsachy Weissman,Thierry Tambe*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) is proposed as a compact, adaptive image representation for CLIP-style multimodal models, delivering large speedups and input compression with competitive zero-shot results, while accuracy lags RGB.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper identifies two inefficiencies in pixel-domain vision-language pipelines: energy-intensive transmission of dense RGB frames from edge devices to the cloud and the explosion of sequence length from patch-based tokenization. It seeks a representation that reduces data transmission and sequence length without sacrificing semantic power.

Method: Introduce 2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS): images are parameterized by colored anisotropic Gaussians with structured initialization, luminance-aware pruning, and batched CUDA kernels to achieve fast fitting. Adapt CLIP by reusing a frozen RGB transformer backbone with a splat-aware input stem and a perceiver resampler, training only about 7% of parameters.

Result: Achieves over 90x faster fitting and ~97% GPU utilization compared to prior implementations. On DataComp subsets, 2DGS encoders provide meaningful zero-shot ImageNet-1K performance while compressing inputs by 3–20x relative to pixels.

Conclusion: 2DGS is a viable multimodal substrate that can reduce transmission and computation bottlenecks in edge-cloud learning, while establishing architectural bottlenecks and guiding future work toward semantically powerful, transmission-efficient representations.

Abstract: Modern vision language pipelines are driven by RGB vision encoders trained on
massive image text corpora. While these pipelines have enabled impressive zero
shot capabilities and strong transfer across tasks, they still inherit two
structural inefficiencies from the pixel domain: (i) transmitting dense RGB
images from edge devices to the cloud is energy intensive and costly, and (ii)
patch based tokenization explodes sequence length, stressing attention budgets
and context limits. We explore 2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) as an alternative
visual substrate for alignment: a compact, spatially adaptive representation
that parameterizes images by a set of colored anisotropic Gaussians. We develop
a scalable 2DGS pipeline with structured initialization, luminance aware
pruning, and batched CUDA kernels, achieving over 90x faster fitting and about
97% GPU utilization compared to prior implementations. We further adapt
contrastive language image pretraining (CLIP) to 2DGS by reusing a frozen
RGB-based transformer backbone with a lightweight splat aware input stem and a
perceiver resampler, training only about 7% of the total parameters. On large
DataComp subsets, GS encoders yield meaningful zero shot ImageNet-1K
performance while compressing inputs 3 to 20x relative to pixels. While
accuracy currently trails RGB encoders, our results establish 2DGS as a viable
multimodal substrate, pinpoint architectural bottlenecks, and open a path
toward representations that are both semantically powerful and transmission
efficient for edge cloud learning.

### [149] [LongLive: Real-time Interactive Long Video Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22622)
*Shuai Yang,Wei Huang,Ruihang Chu,Yicheng Xiao,Yuyang Zhao,Xianbang Wang,Muyang Li,Enze Xie,Yingcong Chen,Yao Lu,Song Han,Yukang Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LongLive introduces a frame-level autoregressive video generator with KV recache, streaming long training, and short-window attention to enable real-time, long-duration video generation with interactive prompts, achieving up to 240s videos on a single H100 with 20.7 FPS and INT8 inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the efficiency and quality challenges in long video generation. Diffusion-based methods achieve high quality but are slow due to bidirectional attention. Causal AR with KV caching is faster but struggles with long videos due to training memory constraints. Interactive streaming prompts require coherent prompt transitions and dynamic content creation, increasing complexity.

Method: A causal, frame-level autoregressive design with (1) KV-recache to refresh cached states for new prompts, (2) streaming long tuning to align long video training with inference (train-long-test-long), and (3) short window attention plus a frame-level attention sink (frame sink) to preserve long-range coherence while enabling faster generation. The model is a 1.3B-parameter short-clip model fine-tuned for minute-long generation (32 GPU-days). Inference achieves 20.7 FPS on an NVIDIA H100, supports up to 240-second videos, and allows INT8-quantized inference with marginal quality loss.

Result: The approach achieves real-time performance and long-duration generation: 20.7 FPS on a single H100, minute-scale (up to 240 seconds) videos, strong performance on VBench for both short and long videos, and efficient INT8 inference with small quality loss.

Conclusion: LongLive demonstrates that frame-level autoregressive video generation with targeted caching and attention strategies can deliver real-time, long-duration, interactive video generation, enabling streaming prompts and dynamic content creation on standard GPUs with manageable training costs.

Abstract: We present LongLive, a frame-level autoregressive (AR) framework for
real-time and interactive long video generation. Long video generation presents
challenges in both efficiency and quality. Diffusion and Diffusion-Forcing
models can produce high-quality videos but suffer from low efficiency due to
bidirectional attention. Causal attention AR models support KV caching for
faster inference, but often degrade in quality on long videos due to memory
challenges during long-video training. In addition, beyond static prompt-based
generation, interactive capabilities, such as streaming prompt inputs, are
critical for dynamic content creation, enabling users to guide narratives in
real time. This interactive requirement significantly increases complexity,
especially in ensuring visual consistency and semantic coherence during prompt
transitions. To address these challenges, LongLive adopts a causal, frame-level
AR design that integrates a KV-recache mechanism that refreshes cached states
with new prompts for smooth, adherent switches; streaming long tuning to enable
long video training and to align training and inference (train-long-test-long);
and short window attention paired with a frame-level attention sink, shorten as
frame sink, preserving long-range consistency while enabling faster generation.
With these key designs, LongLive fine-tunes a 1.3B-parameter short-clip model
to minute-long generation in just 32 GPU-days. At inference, LongLive sustains
20.7 FPS on a single NVIDIA H100, achieves strong performance on VBench in both
short and long videos. LongLive supports up to 240-second videos on a single
H100 GPU. LongLive further supports INT8-quantized inference with only marginal
quality loss.

### [150] [SPARK: Synergistic Policy And Reward Co-Evolving Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22624)
*Ziyu Liu,Yuhang Zang,Shengyuan Ding,Yuhang Cao,Xiaoyi Dong,Haodong Duan,Dahua Lin,Jiaqi Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SPARK introduces a synergistic, on-policy framework that reuses rollouts and correctness signals to train the model as a generative reward model, eliminating separate reward models and human preference data. It forms a positive co-evolving loop between policy and reward, enabling test-time self-reflection and broad gains across LLM/VLM benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RLHF is costly and prone to reward-policy misalignment, while RLVR discards supervision after each update. A method that reuses data to train a reward model on the fly can reduce costs and improve alignment.

Method: An on-policy framework that recycles rollouts and correctness signals to train the model itself as a generative reward model. It uses a mixed objective suite (pointwise reward scores, pairwise comparisons, and evaluation conditioned on reflection responses) and avoids a separate reward model or human preference data. The framework creates a positive co-evolving loop where better reward estimates improve policy gradients, yielding higher-quality data that further refines the reward model. Test-time scalability is achieved via self-reflection.

Result: SPARK achieves notable gains across models and benchmarks: SPARK-VL-7B shows average gains of 9.7% on seven reasoning benchmarks, 12.1% on two reward benchmarks, and 1.5% on eight general benchmarks relative to baselines, indicating robustness and broad generalization across tasks.

Conclusion: SPARK demonstrates a robust, efficient, on-policy approach that trims supervision costs by learning a generative reward model from the model’s own data, with a positive co-evolving policy-reward loop and strong performance gains across diverse benchmarks.

Abstract: Recent Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs)
increasingly use Reinforcement Learning (RL) for post-pretraining, such as RL
with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) for objective tasks and RL from Human Feedback
(RLHF) for subjective tasks. However, RLHF incurs high costs and potential
reward-policy mismatch due to reliance on human preferences, while RLVR still
wastes supervision by discarding rollouts and correctness signals after each
update. To address these challenges, we introduce the Synergistic Policy And
Reward Co-Evolving Framework (SPARK), an efficient, on-policy, and stable
method that builds on RLVR. Instead of discarding rollouts and correctness
data, SPARK recycles this valuable information to simultaneously train the
model itself as a generative reward model. This auxiliary training uses a mix
of objectives, such as pointwise reward score, pairwise comparison, and
evaluation conditioned on further-reflection responses, to teach the model to
evaluate and improve its own responses. Our process eliminates the need for a
separate reward model and costly human preference data. SPARK creates a
positive co-evolving feedback loop: improved reward accuracy yields better
policy gradients, which in turn produce higher-quality rollouts that further
refine the reward model. Our unified framework supports test-time scaling via
self-reflection without external reward models and their associated costs. We
show that SPARK achieves significant performance gains on multiple LLM and LVLM
models and multiple reasoning, reward models, and general benchmarks. For
example, SPARK-VL-7B achieves an average 9.7% gain on 7 reasoning benchmarks,
12.1% on 2 reward benchmarks, and 1.5% on 8 general benchmarks over the
baselines, demonstrating robustness and broad generalization.

### [151] [CCNeXt: An Effective Self-Supervised Stereo Depth Estimation Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22627)
*Alexandre Lopes,Roberto Souza,Helio Pedrini*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Self-supervised CCNeXt for stereo depth estimation achieves state-of-the-art results with substantial speedups: a CNN/ViT hybrid featuring windowed epipolar cross-attention, competitive on KITTI Eigen Split and SOTA on improved GT and Driving Stereo datasets, with open-source code.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Depth estimation in robotics/AR/AV under tight compute constraints and scarce ground-truth data; need efficient, self-supervised methods that leverage unlabeled stereo data.

Method: CCNeXt uses a modern CNN feature extractor with a windowed epipolar cross-attention module in the encoder and a redesigned depth estimation decoder, trained in a self-supervised manner on stereo pairs to estimate disparity (and thus depth) without ground-truth depth.

Result: Competitive metrics on KITTI Eigen Split test; 10.18× faster than the current best model; state-of-the-art results on KITTI Eigen Split Improved Ground Truth and Driving Stereo datasets compared to recently proposed techniques.

Conclusion: The approach delivers strong accuracy with significantly lower computational cost and reproducibility (code available), indicating an effective accuracy-speed trade-off for self-supervised stereo depth estimation.

Abstract: Depth Estimation plays a crucial role in recent applications in robotics,
autonomous vehicles, and augmented reality. These scenarios commonly operate
under constraints imposed by computational power. Stereo image pairs offer an
effective solution for depth estimation since it only needs to estimate the
disparity of pixels in image pairs to determine the depth in a known rectified
system. Due to the difficulty in acquiring reliable ground-truth depth data
across diverse scenarios, self-supervised techniques emerge as a solution,
particularly when large unlabeled datasets are available. We propose a novel
self-supervised convolutional approach that outperforms existing
state-of-the-art Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers
(ViTs) while balancing computational cost. The proposed CCNeXt architecture
employs a modern CNN feature extractor with a novel windowed epipolar
cross-attention module in the encoder, complemented by a comprehensive redesign
of the depth estimation decoder. Our experiments demonstrate that CCNeXt
achieves competitive metrics on the KITTI Eigen Split test data while being
10.18$\times$ faster than the current best model and achieves state-of-the-art
results in all metrics in the KITTI Eigen Split Improved Ground Truth and
Driving Stereo datasets when compared to recently proposed techniques. To

### [152] [UML-CoT: Structured Reasoning and Planning with Unified Modeling Language for Robotic Room Cleaning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22628)
*Hongyu Chen,Guangrun Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UML-CoT uses UML diagrams to generate symbolic CoTs and executable action plans, improving interpretability, planning coherence, and execution in embodied tasks, outperforming unstructured CoTs on a new MRoom-30k benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Unstructured CoTs hinder interpretability and executability in embodied AI; existing structured CoTs are limited to low-order relations and lack rich semantics like inheritance and behavioral abstraction, with no standardized planning semantics.

Method: A three-stage training pipeline combining supervised fine-tuning with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) and reward learning from answer-only data. UML class diagrams encode compositional object semantics and activity diagrams model procedural control flow to produce symbolic CoTs and executable plans.

Result: UML-CoT outperforms unstructured CoTs in interpretability, planning coherence, and execution success on MRoom-30k cluttered room-cleaning scenarios.

Conclusion: UML provides a more expressive and actionable structured reasoning formalism for embodied AI; its combination of object-centric and process-centric UML artifacts enables symbolic reasoning with executable plans, suggesting a promising direction beyond current unstructured CoTs.

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting improves reasoning in large language models
(LLMs), but its reliance on unstructured text limits interpretability and
executability in embodied tasks. Prior work has explored structured CoTs using
scene or logic graphs, yet these remain fundamentally limited: they model only
low-order relations, lack constructs like inheritance or behavioral
abstraction, and provide no standardized semantics for sequential or
conditional planning. We propose UML-CoT, a structured reasoning and planning
framework that leverages Unified Modeling Language (UML) to generate symbolic
CoTs and executable action plans. UML class diagrams capture compositional
object semantics, while activity diagrams model procedural control flow. Our
three-stage training pipeline combines supervised fine-tuning with Group
Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), including reward learning from answer-only
data. We evaluate UML-CoT on MRoom-30k, a new benchmark of cluttered
room-cleaning scenarios. UML-CoT outperforms unstructured CoTs in
interpretability, planning coherence, and execution success, highlighting UML
as a more expressive and actionable structured reasoning formalism.

*Debargha Ganguly,Sumit Kumar,Ishwar Balappanawar,Weicong Chen,Shashank Kambhatla,Srinivasan Iyengar,Shivkumar Kalyanaraman,Ponnurangam Kumaraguru,Vipin Chaudhary*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Labeling Copilot introduces a data curation agent for vision that orchestrates calibrated discovery, controllable synthesis, and consensus annotation to scale high-quality labeled datasets; demonstrations show strong object discovery and efficient sampling at scale.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Curating high-quality, domain-specific datasets is a major bottleneck for deploying robust vision systems, due to trade-offs among data quality, diversity, and cost across large unlabeled data lakes.

Method: A central orchestrator agent powered by a large multimodal model executes three specialized tools: (1) Calibrated Discovery to locate relevant in-distribution data from large repositories; (2) Controllable Synthesis to generate novel data for rare/underrepresented scenarios with robust filtering; (3) Consensus Annotation to produce labels by coordinating multiple foundation models via a consensus mechanism (including non-maximum suppression and voting).

Result: Empirical validation shows: Consensus Annotation yields strong object discovery (on COCO: ~14.2 candidate proposals per image vs 7.4 ground-truth objects, final mAP 37.1%). On Open Images, it discovers 903 new bounding box categories, expanding to over 1500 total. Calibrated Discovery scales to 10 million samples and is up to 40x more computationally efficient than alternatives with equivalent sample efficiency.

Conclusion: An agentic workflow with optimized, scalable tools provides a robust foundation for curating industrial-scale vision datasets.

Abstract: Curating high-quality, domain-specific datasets is a major bottleneck for
deploying robust vision systems, requiring complex trade-offs between data
quality, diversity, and cost when researching vast, unlabeled data lakes. We
introduce Labeling Copilot, the first data curation deep research agent for
computer vision. A central orchestrator agent, powered by a large multimodal
language model, uses multi-step reasoning to execute specialized tools across
three core capabilities: (1) Calibrated Discovery sources relevant,
in-distribution data from large repositories; (2) Controllable Synthesis
generates novel data for rare scenarios with robust filtering; and (3)
Consensus Annotation produces accurate labels by orchestrating multiple
foundation models via a novel consensus mechanism incorporating non-maximum
suppression and voting. Our large-scale validation proves the effectiveness of
Labeling Copilot's components. The Consensus Annotation module excels at object
discovery: on the dense COCO dataset, it averages 14.2 candidate proposals per
image-nearly double the 7.4 ground-truth objects-achieving a final annotation
mAP of 37.1%. On the web-scale Open Images dataset, it navigated extreme class
imbalance to discover 903 new bounding box categories, expanding its capability
to over 1500 total. Concurrently, our Calibrated Discovery tool, tested at a
10-million sample scale, features an active learning strategy that is up to 40x
more computationally efficient than alternatives with equivalent sample
efficiency. These experiments validate that an agentic workflow with optimized,
scalable tools provides a robust foundation for curating industrial-scale
datasets.

*Luc Boudier,Loris Manganelli,Eleftherios Tsonis,Nicolas Dufour,Vicky Kalogeiton*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A training-free method (DIPSY) for few-shot image classification generates highly discriminative synthetic images from few-shot examples using IP-Adapter, achieving competitive or state-of-the-art results without model fine-tuning or external captioning/filtering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of few-shot image classification due to scarce labeled data and limits of existing synthetic data approaches that require fine-tuning or external sources.

Method: DIPSY employs IP-Adapter for image-to-image translation and introduces: (1) an extended classifier-free guidance enabling independent positive/negative conditioning; (2) a class similarity-based sampling strategy to select effective contrastive examples; (3) a simple pipeline that avoids model fine-tuning and external captioning/filtering.

Result: Evaluations on ten benchmark datasets show state-of-the-art or comparable performance, with no need for generative-model adaptation or external captioning/image-filtering tools.

Conclusion: Dual image prompting with positive-negative guidance is effective for generating class-discriminative features in few-shot or fine-grained classification, enabling strong performance without costly model adaptation.

Abstract: Few-shot image classification remains challenging due to the limited
availability of labeled examples. Recent approaches have explored generating
synthetic training data using text-to-image diffusion models, but often require
extensive model fine-tuning or external information sources. We present a novel
training-free approach, called DIPSY, that leverages IP-Adapter for
image-to-image translation to generate highly discriminative synthetic images
using only the available few-shot examples. DIPSY introduces three key
innovations: (1) an extended classifier-free guidance scheme that enables
independent control over positive and negative image conditioning; (2) a class
similarity-based sampling strategy that identifies effective contrastive
examples; and (3) a simple yet effective pipeline that requires no model
fine-tuning or external captioning and filtering. Experiments across ten
benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art or
comparable performance, while eliminating the need for generative model
adaptation or reliance on external tools for caption generation and image
filtering. Our results highlight the effectiveness of leveraging dual image
prompting with positive-negative guidance for generating class-discriminative
features, particularly for fine-grained classification tasks.

*Amandeep Kumar,Nithin Gopalakrishnan Nair,Vishal M. Patel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VAR for visual generation can be reinterpreted as a discrete diffusion when using a Markovian attention mask; the SRDD framework bridges AR transformers and diffusion models, enabling diffusion-like iterative refinement within VAR to improve efficiency and zero-shot reconstruction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To combine the scalability and unified architecture of autoregressive transformers with the iterative refinement and denoising strengths of diffusion models by establishing a principled connection between VAR and diffusion.

Method: Provide a theoretical analysis showing that VAR with a Markovian attention mask is mathematically equivalent to a discrete diffusion process; introduce Scalable Visual Refinement with Discrete Diffusion (SRDD); demonstrate how diffusion advantages (iterative refinement, reduced architectural inefficiencies) can be imported into VAR to improve convergence speed, inference cost, and zero-shot reconstruction across datasets.

Result: Empirical and theoretical results indicate that viewing VAR through a diffusion lens yields consistent gains in efficiency and generation quality; faster convergence, lower inference cost, and improved zero-shot reconstruction across multiple datasets.

Conclusion: SRDD offers a principled bridge between autoregressive transformers and diffusion models, enabling diffusion-like refinements within VAR and unlocking practical benefits for scalable visual generation.

Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) transformers have emerged as a powerful paradigm for
visual generation, largely due to their scalability, computational efficiency
and unified architecture with language and vision. Among them, next scale
prediction Visual Autoregressive Generation (VAR) has recently demonstrated
remarkable performance, even surpassing diffusion-based models. In this work,
we revisit VAR and uncover a theoretical insight: when equipped with a
Markovian attention mask, VAR is mathematically equivalent to a discrete
diffusion. We term this reinterpretation as Scalable Visual Refinement with
Discrete Diffusion (SRDD), establishing a principled bridge between AR
transformers and diffusion models. Leveraging this new perspective, we show how
one can directly import the advantages of diffusion such as iterative
refinement and reduce architectural inefficiencies into VAR, yielding faster
convergence, lower inference cost, and improved zero-shot reconstruction.
Across multiple datasets, we show that the diffusion based perspective of VAR
leads to consistent gains in efficiency and generation.

### [156] [Hierarchical Representation Matching for CLIP-based Class-Incremental Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22645)
*Zhen-Hao Wen,Yan Wang,Ji Feng,Han-Jia Ye,De-Chuan Zhan,Da-Wei Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A CLIP-based class-incremental learning method, HERMAN, uses LLM-generated hierarchical textual descriptors to augment semantic space and route features across semantic levels, achieving state-of-the-art results while reducing forgetting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the hierarchical nature of visual concepts and the underutilization of intermediate representations in CLIP for incremental learning, and to mitigate catastrophic forgetting in CIL by enriching text features with multi-level semantics via LLMs.

Method: Generate discriminative textual descriptors recursively across semantic hierarchy using LLMs; match descriptors to various hierarchy levels; adaptively route information depending on the task; integrate with CLIP's features (beyond the last layer) to leverage hierarchical cues; evaluate on multiple CIL benchmarks.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on multiple CIL benchmarks, validating that hierarchical, LLM-generated textual descriptors improve discrimination and reduce forgetting.

Conclusion: Hierarchical textual descriptors augmented by LLMs, aligned to semantic hierarchy and adaptively routed, enable more precise discrimination and better forgetting mitigation in CLIP-based CIL.

Abstract: Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) aims to endow models with the ability to
continuously adapt to evolving data streams. Recent advances in pre-trained
vision-language models (e.g., CLIP) provide a powerful foundation for this
task. However, existing approaches often rely on simplistic templates, such as
"a photo of a [CLASS]", which overlook the hierarchical nature of visual
concepts. For example, recognizing "cat" versus "car" depends on coarse-grained
cues, while distinguishing "cat" from "lion" requires fine-grained details.
Similarly, the current feature mapping in CLIP relies solely on the
representation from the last layer, neglecting the hierarchical information
contained in earlier layers. In this work, we introduce HiErarchical
Representation MAtchiNg (HERMAN) for CLIP-based CIL. Our approach leverages
LLMs to recursively generate discriminative textual descriptors, thereby
augmenting the semantic space with explicit hierarchical cues. These
descriptors are matched to different levels of the semantic hierarchy and
adaptively routed based on task-specific requirements, enabling precise
discrimination while alleviating catastrophic forgetting in incremental tasks.
Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our method
consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduces DeeptraceReward, a fine-grained spatiotemporal benchmark for human-detected deepfake traces in video, with 4.3K annotations across 3.3K videos; trains a 7B multimodal reward model that outperforms GPT-5 by 34.7%; reveals that trace-level detection is more challenging than binary fake/real; provides a testbed for trustworthy video generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Humans' ability to identify AI-generated videos via grounded traces has been largely overlooked; there is a need for interpretable cues with localization (spatial and temporal) to evaluate and guide safe video synthesis.

Method: Construct DeeptraceReward dataset with 4.3K detailed annotations over 3.3K high-quality generated videos; each annotation includes a natural-language explanation, a bounding-box region, and onset/offset timestamps; consolidate annotations into 9 deepfake trace categories; train multimodal language-model reward models to mimic human judgments and localizations; evaluate against baselines.

Result: A 7B reward model outperforms GPT-5 by 34.7% on average across fake clue identification, grounding, and explanation; reveals a consistent difficulty gradient: binary fake vs real is easier than fine-grained trace detection; within trace detection, NL explanations are easiest, followed by spatial grounding, then temporal labeling (hardest).

Conclusion: Foregrounding human-perceived deepfake traces yields a rigorous testbed and training signal for socially aware and trustworthy video generation.

Abstract: Can humans identify AI-generated (fake) videos and provide grounded reasons?
While video generation models have advanced rapidly, a critical dimension --
whether humans can detect deepfake traces within a generated video, i.e.,
spatiotemporal grounded visual artifacts that reveal a video as machine
generated -- has been largely overlooked. We introduce DeeptraceReward, the
first fine-grained, spatially- and temporally- aware benchmark that annotates
human-perceived fake traces for video generation reward. The dataset comprises
4.3K detailed annotations across 3.3K high-quality generated videos. Each
annotation provides a natural-language explanation, pinpoints a bounding-box
region containing the perceived trace, and marks precise onset and offset
timestamps. We consolidate these annotations into 9 major categories of
deepfake traces that lead humans to identify a video as AI-generated, and train
multimodal language models (LMs) as reward models to mimic human judgments and
localizations. On DeeptraceReward, our 7B reward model outperforms GPT-5 by
34.7% on average across fake clue identification, grounding, and explanation.
Interestingly, we observe a consistent difficulty gradient: binary fake v.s.
real classification is substantially easier than fine-grained deepfake trace
detection; within the latter, performance degrades from natural language
explanations (easiest), to spatial grounding, to temporal labeling (hardest).
By foregrounding human-perceived deepfake traces, DeeptraceReward provides a
rigorous testbed and training signal for socially aware and trustworthy video
generation.

### [158] [CapRL: Stimulating Dense Image Caption Capabilities via Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22647)
*Long Xing,Xiaoyi Dong,Yuhang Zang,Yuhang Cao,Jianze Liang,Qidong Huang,Jiaqi Wang,Feng Wu,Dahua Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CapRL introduces Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards for image captioning, using a vision-free LLM to verify caption quality via QA; shows strong gains across benchmarks and scales with CapRL-5M data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current SFT-based captioning tends to memorize ground-truth answers and lacks diversity; there's a need for an objective, scalable reward that reflects true caption utility in downstream reasoning tasks. CapRL defines such a reward via verifiable QA on captions.

Method: A two-stage pipeline where an LVLM generates a caption for an image; a separate vision-free LLM answers multiple-choice questions based solely on that caption to compute an objective reward. Training uses Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (CapRL). Pretraining on CapRL-5M captions annotated by CapRL-3B.

Result: CapRL achieves substantial gains across 12 benchmarks. Pretraining on CapRL-5M yields strong performance; within the Prism framework, CapRL matches Qwen2.5-VL-72B and exceeds the baseline by an average of 8.4%. Code is available.

Conclusion: This is the first study applying RLVR to the subjective task of image captioning, demonstrating that verifiable rewards can improve caption quality and generalization; CapRL shows promise for scalable improvement in LVLM-based captioning.

Abstract: Image captioning is a fundamental task that bridges the visual and linguistic
domains, playing a critical role in pre-training Large Vision-Language Models
(LVLMs). Current state-of-the-art captioning models are typically trained with
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), a paradigm that relies on expensive, non-scalable
data annotated by humans or proprietary models. This approach often leads to
models that memorize specific ground-truth answers, limiting their generality
and ability to generate diverse, creative descriptions. To overcome the
limitation of SFT, we propose applying the Reinforcement Learning with
Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) paradigm to the open-ended task of image captioning.
A primary challenge, however, is designing an objective reward function for the
inherently subjective nature of what constitutes a "good" caption. We introduce
Captioning Reinforcement Learning (CapRL), a novel training framework that
redefines caption quality through its utility: a high-quality caption should
enable a non-visual language model to accurately answer questions about the
corresponding image. CapRL employs a decoupled two-stage pipeline where an LVLM
generates a caption, and the objective reward is derived from the accuracy of a
separate, vision-free LLM answering Multiple-Choice Questions based solely on
that caption. As the first study to apply RLVR to the subjective image
captioning task, we demonstrate that CapRL significantly enhances multiple
settings. Pretraining on the CapRL-5M caption dataset annotated by CapRL-3B
results in substantial gains across 12 benchmarks. Moreover, within the Prism
Framework for caption quality evaluation, CapRL achieves performance comparable
to Qwen2.5-VL-72B, while exceeding the baseline by an average margin of 8.4%.

TL;DR: RefAM: a training-free grounding framework that uses diffusion-transformer features and attention, with techniques like stop-word attention filtering, GAS suppression/redirect, and attention redistribution to achieve state-of-the-art zero-shot referring image and video segmentation without fine-tuning.

Motivation: To tackle referring segmentation without heavy fine-tuning or multi-model ensembles by leveraging the rich semantic information encoded in large diffusion-based transformers as general-purpose feature extractors.

Method: Analyze cross-attention and feature maps from diffusion transformers; identify stop words as attention magnets and GAS (global attention sinks) in deeper layers; suppress or redirect GAS onto auxiliary tokens; apply attention redistribution by appending stop words to partition background activations; combine cross-attention maps into a training-free grounding pipeline (RefAM) that does not modify architecture or require training.

Result: Empirically achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot referring image and video segmentation on standard benchmarks, outperforming prior methods without fine-tuning or additional components; yields sharper, more localized grounding maps.

Conclusion: Demonstrates that diffusion-model features and attention cues suffice for effective zero-shot grounding; simple, training-free RefAM leverages attention dynamics (stop words, GAS, redistribution) to surpass previous methods, suggesting potential for broader zero-shot grounding tasks.

Abstract: Most existing approaches to referring segmentation achieve strong performance
only through fine-tuning or by composing multiple pre-trained models, often at
the cost of additional training and architectural modifications. Meanwhile,
large-scale generative diffusion models encode rich semantic information,
making them attractive as general-purpose feature extractors. In this work, we
introduce a new method that directly exploits features, attention scores, from
diffusion transformers for downstream tasks, requiring neither architectural
modifications nor additional training. To systematically evaluate these
features, we extend benchmarks with vision-language grounding tasks spanning
both images and videos. Our key insight is that stop words act as attention
magnets: they accumulate surplus attention and can be filtered to reduce noise.
Moreover, we identify global attention sinks (GAS) emerging in deeper layers
and show that they can be safely suppressed or redirected onto auxiliary
tokens, leading to sharper and more accurate grounding maps. We further propose
an attention redistribution strategy, where appended stop words partition
background activations into smaller clusters, yielding sharper and more
localized heatmaps. Building on these findings, we develop RefAM, a simple
training-free grounding framework that combines cross-attention maps, GAS
handling, and redistribution. Across zero-shot referring image and video
segmentation benchmarks, our approach consistently outperforms prior methods,
establishing a new state of the art without fine-tuning or additional
components.

### [160] [The Flood Complex: Large-Scale Persistent Homology on Millions of Points](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22432)
*Florian Graf,Paolo Pellizzoni,Martin Uray,Stefan Huber,Roland Kwitt*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces the Flood complex for scalable persistent homology on large-scale Euclidean point clouds; it floods balls from the full data over a Delaunay triangulation of a small subset, yielding a sparse, GPU-friendly complex. Demonstrates PH up to dimension 2 on millions of points and improved object classification over other PH methods and some neural nets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Persistent homology is powerful for ML on point clouds but the Vietoris–Rips complex grows exponentially; evenAlpha/Witness/sparse Rips can still produce prohibitively many simplices. A scalable, topology-preserving approach suitable for large data and ML tasks is needed.

Method: At a filtration value r, construct the Flood complex from the Delaunay triangulation of a small subset of X by including simplices fully covered by balls of radius r centered at X (the flooding process). This yields a sparse, coverage-based complex that can be computed efficiently and is amenable to GPU parallelization, blending ideas from Alpha and Witness constructions.

Result: Empirical results on 3D data show PH up to dimension 2 can be computed for several millions of points. In object classification tasks on real and synthetic data, Flood-based PH provides superior performance versus other PH-based methods and some neural networks when objects are geometrically or topologically complex.

Conclusion: The Flood complex offers a scalable, GPU-friendly framework for persistent homology on large-scale point clouds with favorable theoretical properties and practical ML utility; demonstrated up to dimension 2, with potential for extension to higher dimensions and broader datasets.

Abstract: We consider the problem of computing persistent homology (PH) for large-scale
Euclidean point cloud data, aimed at downstream machine learning tasks, where
the exponential growth of the most widely-used Vietoris-Rips complex imposes
serious computational limitations. Although more scalable alternatives such as
the Alpha complex or sparse Rips approximations exist, they often still result
in a prohibitively large number of simplices. This poses challenges in the
complex construction and in the subsequent PH computation, prohibiting their
use on large-scale point clouds. To mitigate these issues, we introduce the
Flood complex, inspired by the advantages of the Alpha and Witness complex
constructions. Informally, at a given filtration value $r\geq 0$, the Flood
complex contains all simplices from a Delaunay triangulation of a small subset
of the point cloud $X$ that are fully covered by balls of radius $r$ emanating
from $X$, a process we call flooding. Our construction allows for efficient PH
computation, possesses several desirable theoretical properties, and is
amenable to GPU parallelization. Scaling experiments on 3D point cloud data
show that we can compute PH of up to dimension 2 on several millions of points.
Importantly, when evaluating object classification performance on real-world
and synthetic data, we provide evidence that this scaling capability is needed,
especially if objects are geometrically or topologically complex, yielding
performance superior to other PH-based methods and neural networks for point
cloud data.

*Anna Kalenkova,Lu Xia,Dirk Neumann*

Main category: cs.LG

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Food waste reduction in retail; aligning customer purchasing behavior with supply to minimize waste and avoid shortages.

Method: Apply object-centric process mining to discover a CTMC from sales data; extend with supply activities; perform what-if analyses to simulate inventory evolution and policy impacts.

Result: Outlines a framework and potential insights to balance demand and supply; enables waste reduction and stockout avoidance; demonstrates feasibility of integrating OCPM with stochastic modeling in retail.

Conclusion: Integrated approach provides decision-support for waste reduction and inventory optimization in food retail; potential for broader application and further validation.

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel method for analyzing food retail processes with a
focus on reducing food waste. The approach integrates object-centric process
mining (OCPM) with stochastic process discovery and analysis. First, a
stochastic process in the form of a continuous-time Markov chain is discovered
from grocery store sales data. This model is then extended with supply
activities. Finally, a what-if analysis is conducted to evaluate how the
quantity of products in the store evolves over time. This enables the
identification of an optimal balance between customer purchasing behavior and
supply strategies, helping to prevent both food waste due to oversupply and
product shortages.

### [162] [Impact of Loss Weight and Model Complexity on Physics-Informed Neural Networks for Computational Fluid Dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21393)
*Yi En Chou,Te Hsin Liu,Chao An Lin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Two-dimensional, analysis-based loss weighting for PINNs; a second scheme that includes both quantifiable and unquantifiable terms yields superior stability and accuracy over equal weighting, enabling robust CFD performance even at high Peclet numbers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PINNs are mesh-free but highly sensitive to how the different loss terms (physics, boundary, initial, etc.) are weighted. The abstract seeks to balance training dynamics to improve stability and accuracy, particularly for challenging CFD problems.

Method: Develop two 2D weighting schemes: (i) based on quantifiable terms; (ii) augmenting with unquantifiable terms for a more balanced training signal. Benchmark on heat conduction, convection–diffusion, and lid-driven cavity flows.

Result: The second scheme consistently outperforms equal weighting, yielding improved stability and accuracy. In high Peclet number convection–diffusion, where traditional solvers fail, PINNs with the scheme produce stable, accurate predictions, highlighting robustness and generalizability in CFD.

Conclusion: A two-dimensional weighting strategy—especially the second scheme incorporating unquantifiable terms—significantly enhances PINN performance for CFD, including difficult regimes like high Peclet flows.

Abstract: Physics Informed Neural Networks offer a mesh free framework for solving PDEs
but are highly sensitive to loss weight selection. We propose two dimensional
analysis based weighting schemes, one based on quantifiable terms, and another
also incorporating unquantifiable terms for more balanced training. Benchmarks
on heat conduction, convection diffusion, and lid driven cavity flows show that
the second scheme consistently improves stability and accuracy over equal
weighting. Notably, in high Peclet number convection diffusion, where
traditional solvers fail, PINNs with our scheme achieve stable, accurate
predictions, highlighting their robustness and generalizability in CFD
problems.

*Rushil Gupta,Jason Hartford,Bang Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LLMs fail to perform in-context experimental design; classical methods outperform them; a simple LLM-guided Nearest Neighbor sampling method can be competitive without heavy in-context adaptation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To test whether instruction-tuned LLMs can act as general-purpose agents for in-context experimental design in genetics and molecular discovery, and to compare their performance against traditional optimization methods.

Method: Evaluate open- and closed-source instruction-tuned LLMs on genetic perturbation and molecular property discovery tasks. Test sensitivity to experimental feedback by permuting outcomes. Compare against linear bandits and Gaussian process optimization. Propose LLM-guided Nearest Neighbor (LLMNN) sampling as a hybrid approach.

Result: LLM-based agents show no sensitivity to experimental feedback (randomly permuted outcomes do not affect performance). Across benchmarks, classical methods outperform LLM agents. LLMNN achieves competitive or superior performance without heavy in-context adaptation.

Conclusion: Current open- and closed-source LLMs do not perform in-context experimental design in practice. Hybrid frameworks that decouple prior-based reasoning from posterior updating (e.g., LLM-guided sampling) are needed for effective experimental design.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently been proposed as general-purpose
agents for experimental design, with claims that they can perform in-context
experimental design. We evaluate this hypothesis using both open- and
closed-source instruction-tuned LLMs applied to genetic perturbation and
molecular property discovery tasks. We find that LLM-based agents show no
sensitivity to experimental feedback: replacing true outcomes with randomly
permuted labels has no impact on performance. Across benchmarks, classical
methods such as linear bandits and Gaussian process optimization consistently
outperform LLM agents. We further propose a simple hybrid method, LLM-guided
Nearest Neighbour (LLMNN) sampling, that combines LLM prior knowledge with
nearest-neighbor sampling to guide the design of experiments. LLMNN achieves
competitive or superior performance across domains without requiring
significant in-context adaptation. These results suggest that current open- and
closed-source LLMs do not perform in-context experimental design in practice
and highlight the need for hybrid frameworks that decouple prior-based
reasoning from batch acquisition with updated posteriors.

### [165] [Null-Space Filtering for Data-Free Continual Model Merging: Preserving Transparency, Promoting Fidelity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21413)
*Zihuan Qiu,Lei Wang,Yang Cao,Runtong Zhang,Bing Su,Yi Xu,Fanman Meng,Linfeng Xu,Qingbo Wu,Hongliang Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: NUFILT: a data-free framework for continual model merging that preserves prior knowledge via null-space filtering and enables new-task adaptation with a lightweight LoRA adapter, achieving strong accuracy with minimal forgetting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address data-free continual model merging by aligning data-level desiderata (transparency, fidelity) with parameter-space optimization, bridging the gap without accessing task data.

Method: Use a null-space projector to filter overlapping components of new task vectors to preserve prior responses (transparency) and a lightweight LoRA adapter to inject task-specific signals (fidelity). Train the adapter with a projection-based surrogate loss to retain consistency with prior knowledge. Fuse updates back in a layer-wise linear fashion with no extra parameters or inference cost.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on vision and NLP benchmarks, boosting average accuracy by 4-7% over OPCM and WUDI-Merging, narrows the gap to full fine-tuning, and reduces computation overhead while limiting forgetting.

Conclusion: Joint filtering and adaptation enable the backbone to absorb new tasks while preserving existing behaviors in a data-free setting, with theoretical subspace-alignment guarantees supporting the null-space filtering approach.

Abstract: Data-free continual model merging (DFCMM) aims to fuse independently
fine-tuned models into a single backbone that evolves with incoming tasks
without accessing task data. This paper formulate two fundamental desiderata
for DFCMM: transparency, avoiding interference with earlier tasks, and
fidelity, adapting faithfully to each new task. This poses a challenge that
existing approaches fail to address: how to bridge data-level desiderata with
parameter-space optimization to ensure transparency and fidelity in the absence
of task data. To this end, we propose NUFILT (NUll-space FILTering), a
data-free framework that directly links these desiderata to optimization. Our
key observation is that task vectors approximately align with representation
subspaces, providing structural surrogates for enforcing transparency and
fidelity. Accordingly, we design a null-space projector that preserves prior
responses by filtering out overlapping components of new task vectors, thereby
ensuring transparency, and a lightweight LoRA adapter that injects
complementary task-specific signals, enabling fidelity in adapting to new
tasks. The adapter is trained with a projection-based surrogate loss to retain
consistency with previous knowledge while introducing novel directions. This
joint filtering-adaptation process allows the backbone to absorb new knowledge
while retaining existing behaviors, and the updates are finally fused back in a
layer-wise linear fashion without extra parameters or inference cost.
Theoretically, we establish approximate subspace alignment guarantees that
justify null-space filtering. Empirically, NUFILT achieves state-of-the-art
performance with minimal forgetting on both vision and NLP benchmarks,
improving average accuracy by 4-7% over OPCM and WUDI-Merging, while narrowing
the gap to fine-tuning and reducing computation overhead.

*Waleed Esmail,Alexander Kappes,Stuart Russell,Christine Thomas*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SeismoGPT: a transformer-based autoregressive model for forecasting 3-component seismic waveforms, usable on single-station and array inputs, delivering strong short-term accuracy with gradual degradation over longer horizons, enabling Newtonian-noise mitigation for future detectors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mitigate Newtonian (gravity-gradient) noise in next-generation gravitational-wave detectors and enable data-driven, real-time seismic forecasting for observatory control.

Method: Developed SeismoGPT, a transformer-based autoregressive model that learns temporal and spatial dependencies directly from waveform data, handling single-station and array inputs; evaluated on short-term prediction windows.

Result: Demonstrates accurate short-term forecasts within the immediate window; performance declines progressively with lead time, consistent with autoregressive models; supports feasibility of data-driven seismic forecasting for detector operations.

Conclusion: Paves the way for data-driven seismic forecasting to aid Newtonian-noise mitigation and real-time observatory control, with potential integration into detector networks.

Abstract: We introduce \textit{SeismoGPT}, a transformer-based model for forecasting
three-component seismic waveforms in the context of future gravitational wave
detectors like the Einstein Telescope. The model is trained in an
autoregressive setting and can operate on both single-station and array-based
inputs. By learning temporal and spatial dependencies directly from waveform
data, SeismoGPT captures realistic ground motion patterns and provides accurate
short-term forecasts. Our results show that the model performs well within the
immediate prediction window and gradually degrades further ahead, as expected
in autoregressive systems. This approach lays the groundwork for data-driven
seismic forecasting that could support Newtonian noise mitigation and real-time
observatory control.

### [167] [Talking Trees: Reasoning-Assisted Induction of Decision Trees for Tabular Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21465)
*George Yakushev,Alina Shutova,Ivan Rubachev,Renat Sergazinov,Artem Babenko*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LLM-enabled reasoning is used to induce lightweight, human-readable decision trees for small tabular datasets, balancing interpretability with competitive performance on low-resource problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tabular foundation models rely on large synthetic pretraining and are often opaque. For small/tabular datasets, an interpretable alternative is desirable. The work leverages reasoning-capable LLMs to construct decision trees, combining prior knowledge with data.

Method: Design a minimal toolset to construct, analyze, and manipulate decision trees. In an agentic setup, LLMs use their prior knowledge plus learning from data to create a lightweight decision tree that outperforms traditional CART on low-resource tabular problems. The process yields a human-readable reasoning trace and enables human input to correct biases or inject domain intuition.

Result: The induced decision tree by the LLMs outperforms CART on low-resource tabular problems. It remains competitive but does not surpass state-of-the-art black-box models. It provides a transparent reasoning trace for bias/data-leak checks and supports human-in-the-loop corrections and domain insights.

Conclusion: The approach trades slight predictive performance for interpretability and auditability: LLM-assisted tree induction yields interpretable models with potential for bias correction and domain integration, though it may lag behind top black-box models in accuracy.

Abstract: Tabular foundation models are becoming increasingly popular for low-resource
tabular problems. These models make up for small training datasets by
pretraining on large volumes of synthetic data. The prior knowledge obtained
via pretraining provides the exceptional performance, but the resulting model
becomes a black box that is difficult to interpret and costly to inference. In
this work, we explore an alternative strategy: using reasoning-capable LLMs to
induce decision trees for small tabular datasets in agentic setup. We design a
minimal set of tools for constructing, analyzing and manipulating decision
trees. By using these tools, LLMs combine their prior knowledge with learning
from data to create a lightweight decision tree that outperforms traditional
CART on low-resource tabular problems. While a single decision tree does not
outperform state-of-the-art black box models, it comes with a human-readable
reasoning trace that can be checked for biases and data leaks. Furthermore, the
reasoning-based LLM's creation process allows for additional human input:
correcting biases or incorporating domain-specific intuition that is not
captured in the data.

### [168] [Score-based Idempotent Distillation of Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21470)
*Shehtab Zaman,Chengyan Liu,Kenneth Chiu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes SIGN: distilling idempotent generative networks from diffusion model scores to achieve fast, stable sampling without adversarial training, with multi-step sampling and zero-shot editing; reports state-of-the-art results for idempotent models on CIFAR and CelebA.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mitigate training instability and mode collapse in adversarial IGNs and reduce the high computational cost of diffusion models by unifying the two paradigms into a stable, efficient, editable generative framework.

Method: Distill idempotent models from diffusion scores to create SIGN. Provides score-based training theory, trains from a pre-trained diffusion model, enables multi-step sampling, operates on the source domain with projection back to the target manifold for zero-shot editing, and validates on CIFAR and CelebA.

Result: SIGN achieves stable, non-adversarial training; faster inference than iterative score-based methods; supports multi-step sampling to trade quality for speed; enables zero-shot input editing; attains state-of-the-art results for idempotent models on CIFAR and CelebA.

Conclusion: Distilling diffusion scores into idempotent networks yields a stable, efficient generative framework that preserves high fidelity, enables editing, and reduces computation, representing a promising direction for scalable diffusion-like generative modeling.

Abstract: Idempotent generative networks (IGNs) are a new line of generative models
based on idempotent mapping to a target manifold. IGNs support both single-and
multi-step generation, allowing for a flexible trade-off between computational
cost and sample quality. But similar to Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs),
conventional IGNs require adversarial training and are prone to training
instabilities and mode collapse. Diffusion and score-based models are popular
approaches to generative modeling that iteratively transport samples from one
distribution, usually a Gaussian, to a target data distribution. These models
have gained popularity due to their stable training dynamics and high-fidelity
generation quality. However, this stability and quality come at the cost of
high computational cost, as the data must be transported incrementally along
the entire trajectory. New sampling methods, model distillation, and
consistency models have been developed to reduce the sampling cost and even
perform one-shot sampling from diffusion models. In this work, we unite
diffusion and IGNs by distilling idempotent models from diffusion model scores,
called SIGN. Our proposed method is highly stable and does not require
adversarial losses. We provide a theoretical analysis of our proposed
score-based training methods and empirically show that IGNs can be effectively
distilled from a pre-trained diffusion model, enabling faster inference than
iterative score-based models. SIGNs can perform multi-step sampling, allowing
users to trade off quality for efficiency. These models operate directly on the
source domain; they can project corrupted or alternate distributions back onto
the target manifold, enabling zero-shot editing of inputs. We validate our
models on multiple image datasets, achieving state-of-the-art results for
idempotent models on the CIFAR and CelebA datasets.

### [169] [Are Hallucinations Bad Estimations?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21473)
*Hude Liu,Jerry Yao-Chieh Hu,Jennifer Yuntong Zhang,Zhao Song,Han Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Even optimal estimators can hallucinate because hallucinations arise from a misalignment between loss minimization and human-acceptable outputs; the paper provides a high-probability lower bound on hallucination rate for generic data, and supports theory with experiments across coin aggregation, open-ended QA, and text-to-image.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Formalize hallucinations as a structural misalignment between what loss minimization optimizes and what humans deem acceptable, and quantify this inevitability with a lower bound across generic distributions.

Method: Build a theoretical framework where hallucinations are failures to link estimates to plausible causes; derive a high-probability lower bound on the hallucination rate for generic data distributions; validate the theory with experiments in coin aggregation, open-ended QA, and text-to-image tasks.

Result: Proves that a nonzero minimum hallucination rate exists for any loss-minimizing estimator under broad data distributions; empirical results across three domains corroborate the theory, demonstrating hallucinations persist despite optimization.

Conclusion: Hallucinations stem from structural misalignment between loss-based estimation and human-acceptable outputs rather than mere model deficiency; calibration and objective redesign are needed to mitigate them, and this framework unifies theoretical guarantees with empirical observations across modalities.

Abstract: We formalize hallucinations in generative models as failures to link an
estimate to any plausible cause. Under this interpretation, we show that even
loss-minimizing optimal estimators still hallucinate. We confirm this with a
general high probability lower bound on hallucinate rate for generic data
distributions. This reframes hallucination as structural misalignment between
loss minimization and human-acceptable outputs, and hence estimation errors
induced by miscalibration. Experiments on coin aggregation, open-ended QA, and
text-to-image support our theory.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A diffusion language model framework 'd2' for masked DLMs uses a new policy-gradient RL estimator based on masking to improve reasoning, achieving state-of-the-art diffusion-based reasoning on logical and math benchmarks without supervised fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhance reasoning in diffusion language models, especially masked DLMs, by leveraging masking properties to accurately estimate trajectory likelihoods and enable any-order likelihood estimation; reduce dependence on supervised fine-tuning and improve efficiency for diffusion-based reasoning.

Method: Introduce the d2 framework and a novel policy gradient algorithm that exploits masking to estimate sampling trajectory likelihoods. The estimators trade computation for approximation accuracy in an analytically tractable way and are effective for DLMs supporting any-order likelihood estimation. The paper also analyzes this property in popular DLMs and demonstrates efficiency gains for diffusion-based reasoning.

Result: Empirically, d2 significantly outperforms prior diffusion reasoning frameworks that rely solely on RL and sets new state-of-the-art results on logical reasoning tasks (Countdown and Sudoku) and math reasoning benchmarks (GSM8K and MATH500).

Conclusion: d2 provides a practical RL-based reasoning framework for masked DLMs, enabling improved reasoning without supervised fine-tuning, with efficient estimators and broad applicability; the approach has potential for extending diffusion-based reasoning to other tasks and benchmarks.

Abstract: While diffusion language models (DLMs) have achieved competitive performance
in text generation, improving their reasoning ability with reinforcement
learning remains an active research area. Here, we introduce d2, a reasoning
framework tailored for masked DLMs. Central to our framework is a new policy
gradient algorithm that relies on properties of masking to accurately estimate
the likelihoods of sampling trajectories. Our estimators trade off computation
for approximation accuracy in an analytically tractable manner, and are
particularly effective for DLMs that support any-order likelihood estimation.
We characterize and study this property in popular DLMs and show that it is key
for efficient diffusion-based reasoning. Empirically, d2 significantly improves
over previous diffusion reasoning frameworks using only RL (without relying on
supervised fine-tuning), and sets a new state-of-the-art performance for DLMs
on logical reasoning tasks (Countdown and Sudoku) and math reasoning benchmarks
(GSM8K and MATH500).

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: KD48 benchmark and VISION dynamic prompting for reconstructing subsurface ocean velocity fields from incomplete surface data, achieving strong performance and generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the lack of standardized, analysis-ready benchmarks and robust methods for subsurface ocean dynamics reconstruction under data gaps, enabling systematic evaluation and development.

Method: KD48 is a high-resolution ocean dynamics benchmark derived from petascale simulations with expert-driven denoising. VISION uses Dynamic Prompting to generate an on-the-fly visual prompt from any available observation subset, encoding data availability and physical state. A State-conditioned Prompting module injects this prompt into a universal backbone with geometry- and scale-aware operators to adapt computational strategies to varying input configurations.

Result: VISION substantially outperforms state-of-the-art models on the KD48 benchmark and generalizes well under extreme data-missing scenarios.

Conclusion: Provides a high-quality benchmark and a robust reconstruction framework, enabling ocean science research under data uncertainty; code available at https://github.com/YuanGao-YG/VISION.

Abstract: Reconstructing subsurface ocean dynamics, such as vertical velocity fields,
from incomplete surface observations poses a critical challenge in Earth
science, a field long hampered by the lack of standardized, analysis-ready
benchmarks. To systematically address this issue and catalyze research, we
first build and release KD48, a high-resolution ocean dynamics benchmark
derived from petascale simulations and curated with expert-driven denoising.
Building on this benchmark, we introduce VISION, a novel reconstruction
paradigm based on Dynamic Prompting designed to tackle the core problem of
missing data in real-world observations. The essence of VISION lies in its
ability to generate a visual prompt on-the-fly from any available subset of
observations, which encodes both data availability and the ocean's physical
state. More importantly, we design a State-conditioned Prompting module that
efficiently injects this prompt into a universal backbone, endowed with
geometry- and scale-aware operators, to guide its adaptive adjustment of
computational strategies. This mechanism enables VISION to precisely handle the
challenges posed by varying input combinations. Extensive experiments on the
KD48 benchmark demonstrate that VISION not only substantially outperforms
state-of-the-art models but also exhibits strong generalization under extreme
data missing scenarios. By providing a high-quality benchmark and a robust
model, our work establishes a solid infrastructure for ocean science research
under data uncertainty. Our codes are available at:

### [172] [Filtering with Confidence: When Data Augmentation Meets Conformal Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21479)
*Zixuan Wu,So Won Jeong,Yating Liu,Yeo Jin Jung,Claire Donnat*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A conformal data augmentation framework that filters synthetic data with conformal prediction to control bias and risk, yielding diverse, high-quality samples without model logits or retraining, improving performance across tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Data augmentation expands training data but risks bias and distribution shift; there is a need for diverse samples drawn from the same underlying distribution with provable risk control.

Method: Generate synthetic samples and apply conformal filtering to accept/reject them, producing an augmented dataset with controlled risk. The approach requires no access to internal model logits and does not rely on large-scale retraining; it is simple to implement.

Result: Shows consistent performance gains across tasks (topic prediction, sentiment analysis, image classification, fraud detection), with up to 40% improvement in F1 over unaugmented baselines and about 4% improvement over other filtered augmentation baselines.

Conclusion: Conformal data augmentation provides a principled, scalable framework for augmenting data with provable risk control, delivering robust improvements across diverse domains while minimizing model access and retraining requirements.

Abstract: With promising empirical performance across a wide range of applications,
synthetic data augmentation appears a viable solution to data scarcity and the
demands of increasingly data-intensive models. Its effectiveness lies in
expanding the training set in a way that reduces estimator variance while
introducing only minimal bias. Controlling this bias is therefore critical:
effective data augmentation should generate diverse samples from the same
underlying distribution as the training set, with minimal shifts. In this
paper, we propose conformal data augmentation, a principled data filtering
framework that leverages the power of conformal prediction to produce diverse
synthetic data while filtering out poor-quality generations with provable risk
control. Our method is simple to implement, requires no access to internal
model logits, nor large-scale model retraining. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach across multiple tasks, including topic
prediction, sentiment analysis, image classification, and fraud detection,
showing consistent performance improvements of up to 40% in F1 score over
unaugmented baselines, and 4% over other filtered augmentation baselines.

TL;DR: FedZero is a federated zero-order optimization method that uses randomization on the L1-sphere to achieve high-probability, near-optimal convex optimization guarantees in a federated setting, and the first high-probability convergence guarantees for convex zero-order optimization in the single-worker regime. The analysis hinges on new concentration inequalities for Lipschitz functions under the uniform measure on the L1-sphere.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need for strong, high-probability guarantees for gradient-free optimization in federated learning and for convex zero-order methods in the single-worker setting. This work aims to close the gap between expectation-based results and high-probability bounds, and to provide practical gradient estimators that respect privacy and communication constraints.

Method: Introduce a gradient estimator based on randomization over the L1-sphere. Propose the FedZero federated zero-order algorithm and develop new concentration inequalities for Lipschitz functions under the uniform measure on the L1-sphere with explicit constants to enable high-probability analysis.

Result: FedZero achieves near-optimal optimization error bounds with high probability in the federated convex setting. In the single-worker regime, it provides the first high-probability convergence guarantees for convex zero-order optimization, strengthening classical expectation-based results.

Conclusion: The developed concentration tools on the L1-sphere are central to the high-probability guarantees and may be of independent interest. The gradient estimator based on L1-sphere randomization offers a promising direction for gradient-free federated learning and zero-order optimization.

Abstract: We study distributed learning in the setting of gradient-free zero-order
optimization and introduce FedZero, a federated zero-order algorithm that
delivers sharp theoretical guarantees. Specifically, FedZero: (1) achieves
near-optimal optimization error bounds with high probability in the federated
convex setting; and (2) in the single-worker regime-where the problem reduces
to the standard zero-order framework, establishes the first high-probability
convergence guarantees for convex zero-order optimization, thereby
strengthening the classical expectation-based results. At its core, FedZero
employs a gradient estimator based on randomization over the $\ell_1$-sphere.
To analyze it, we develop new concentration inequalities for Lipschitz
functions under the uniform measure on the $\ell_1$-sphere, with explicit
constants. These concentration tools are not only central to our
high-probability guarantees but may also be of independent interest.

### [174] [Neural Operators for Mathematical Modeling of Transient Fluid Flow in Subsurface Reservoir Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21485)
*Daniil D. Sirota,Sergey A. Khan,Sergey L. Kostikov,Kirill A. Butov*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TFNO-opt is a Fourier neural operator-based model for transient subsurface fluid flow that achieves large speedups and discretization invariance, with modifications including adjustable time resolution in the operator, spectral tensor decomposition, Sobolev-norm loss, and separation of approximation errors and initial-condition reconstruction. Demonstrated on underground gas storage hydrodynamics with ~10^6× speedup over traditional solvers, enabling real-time control of reservoir systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable real-time control and decision support for subsurface reservoir management by replacing slow PDE solvers with fast, discretization-invariant neural operators that can generalize across grid discretizations and equation implementations.

Method: Develop TFNO-opt, an enhanced Fourier neural operator for transient PDEs. Key modifications include (1) adjustable internal time resolution of the integral Fourier operator, (2) tensor decomposition of spectral-domain parameters, (3) use of Sobolev norm in the loss function, and (4) separation of approximation errors from initial-condition reconstruction, aimed at improving accuracy and stability for control. Evaluation uses hydrodynamic modeling of underground gas storage (UGS) to demonstrate speed and accuracy gains over traditional methods.

Result: The approach achieves approximately six orders of magnitude faster computation compared to conventional solvers, with improved accuracy and stability in reproducing the physical processes. Computational experiments confirm the effectiveness of the proposed improvements, including practical significance for control of complex reservoir systems.

Conclusion: TFNO-opt with the described modifications provides a fast, discretization-invariant surrogate for transient reservoir PDEs that is suitable for real-time control and decision support, highlighting the potential of neural-operator approaches for complex subsurface systems.

Abstract: This paper presents a method for modeling transient fluid flow in subsurface
reservoir systems based on the developed neural operator architecture
(TFNO-opt). Reservoir systems are complex dynamic objects with distributed
parameters described by systems of partial differential equations (PDEs).
Traditional numerical methods for modeling such systems, despite their high
accuracy, are characterized by significant time costs for performing
calculations, which limits their applicability in control and decision support
problems. The proposed architecture (TFNO-opt) is based on Fourier neural
operators, which allow approximating PDE solutions in infinite-dimensional
functional spaces, providing invariance to discretization and the possibility
of generalization to various implementations of equations. The developed
modifications are aimed at increasing the accuracy and stability of the trained
neural operator, which is especially important for control problems. These
include adjustable internal time resolution of the integral Fourier operator,
tensor decomposition of parameters in the spectral domain, use of the Sobolev
norm in the error function, and separation of approximation errors and
reconstruction of initial conditions for more accurate reproduction of physical
processes. The effectiveness of the proposed improvements is confirmed by
computational experiments. The practical significance is confirmed by
computational experiments using the example of the problem of hydrodynamic
modeling of an underground gas storage (UGS), where the acceleration of
calculations by six orders of magnitude was achieved, compared to traditional
methods. This opens up new opportunities for the effective control of complex
reservoir systems.

### [175] [GraphPFN: A Prior-Data Fitted Graph Foundation Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21489)
*Dmitry Eremeev,Oleg Platonov,Gleb Bazhenov,Artem Babenko,Liudmila Prokhorenkova*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GraphPFN introduces a graph foundation model pretrained on synthetic graphs from a principled prior, augmenting a tabular foundation model with graph-aware layers. It achieves strong in-context learning and SOTA performance after finetuning on real graphs, outperforming G2T-FM and many GNNs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Graph foundation models exist but rely on hand-crafted features and struggle to learn complex graph-specific patterns. There is a need to leverage large-scale pretraining by using synthetic graph priors to capture structural dependencies.

Method: Design a prior distribution over synthetic attributed graphs by combining multiple stochastic block models and preferential attachment for structure; use graph-aware structured causal models to generate node attributes and targets; augment the tabular foundation model with attention-based graph neighborhood aggregation layers (on top of LimiX) and train on synthetic graphs sampled from the prior.

Result: On diverse real-world graphs up to 50,000 nodes, GraphPFN exhibits strong in-context learning and achieves state-of-the-art results after fine-tuning, outperforming G2T-FM and many task-specific GNNs on most datasets.

Conclusion: Pretraining on synthetic graphs generated from a well-designed prior is an effective strategy for building graph foundation models; GraphPFN demonstrates that prior-data fitting can enable learning of graph structural dependencies beyond what tabular data alone offers.

Abstract: Foundation models pretrained on large-scale datasets have transformed such
fields as natural language processing and computer vision, but their
application to graph data remains limited. Recently emerged graph foundation
models, such as G2T-FM, utilize tabular foundation models for graph tasks and
were shown to significantly outperform prior attempts to create GFMs. However,
these models primarily rely on hand-crafted graph features, limiting their
ability to learn complex graph-specific patterns. In this work, we propose
GraphPFN: a prior-data fitted network for node-level prediction. First, we
design a prior distribution of synthetic attributed graphs. For graph structure
generation, we use a novel combination of multiple stochastic block models and
a preferential attachment process. We then apply graph-aware structured causal
models to generate node attributes and targets. This procedure allows us to
efficiently generate a wide range of realistic graph datasets. Then, we augment
the tabular foundation model LimiX with attention-based graph neighborhood
aggregation layers and train it on synthetic graphs sampled from our prior,
allowing the model to capture graph structural dependencies not present in
tabular data. On diverse real-world graph datasets with up to 50,000 nodes,
GraphPFN shows strong in-context learning performance and achieves
state-of-the-art results after finetuning, outperforming both G2T-FM and
task-specific GNNs trained from scratch on most datasets. More broadly, our
work demonstrates that pretraining on synthetic graphs from a well-designed
prior distribution is an effective strategy for building graph foundation
models.

### [176] [SlimDiff: Training-Free, Activation-Guided Hands-free Slimming of Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21498)
*Arani Roy,Shristi Das Biswas,Kaushik Roy*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SlimDiff is a training-free, activation-guided structural compression method for diffusion models that reduces both attention and feedforward dimensionalities by activation-covariance-based low-rank subspaces, enabling gradient-free dynamic pruning under a fixed compression budget; achieves up to 35% speedup and ~100M parameter reduction with generation quality on par with uncompressed models, using ~500 calibration samples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models provide strong generative performance but are computationally intensive. Existing efficiency techniques often require fine-tuning or retraining to recover lost performance, limiting practicality. A gradient-free, activation-aware compression could significantly reduce compute without retraining.

Method: Activation-informed spectral approximation using activation covariances across denoising timesteps to identify low-rank subspaces. Perform module-wise decompositions over query–key interactions, value–output couplings, and feedforward projections under a fixed compression budget. Dynamic pruning allocates sparsity adaptively across modules. Requires only calibration samples (~500).

Result: Achieves up to 35% acceleration and ~100M parameter reduction versus baselines. Maintains generation quality on par with uncompressed models without backprop. Training-free; empirically robust to diffusion trajectories. Requires ~500 calibration samples, ~70x fewer than prior methods.

Conclusion: First closed-form, activation-guided structural compression of diffusion models that is entirely training-free, offering both theoretical clarity and practical efficiency for DM deployment.

Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs), lauded for their generative performance, are
computationally prohibitive due to their billion-scale parameters and iterative
denoising dynamics. Existing efficiency techniques, such as quantization,
timestep reduction, or pruning, offer savings in compute, memory, or runtime
but are strictly bottlenecked by reliance on fine-tuning or retraining to
recover performance. In this work, we introduce SlimDiff, an automated
activation-informed structural compression framework that reduces both
attention and feedforward dimensionalities in DMs, while being entirely
gradient-free. SlimDiff reframes DM compression as a spectral approximation
task, where activation covariances across denoising timesteps define low-rank
subspaces that guide dynamic pruning under a fixed compression budget. This
activation-aware formulation mitigates error accumulation across timesteps by
applying module-wise decompositions over functional weight groups: query--key
interactions, value--output couplings, and feedforward projections, rather than
isolated matrix factorizations, while adaptively allocating sparsity across
modules to respect the non-uniform geometry of diffusion trajectories. SlimDiff
achieves up to 35\% acceleration and $\sim$100M parameter reduction over
baselines, with generation quality on par with uncompressed models without any
backpropagation. Crucially, our approach requires only about 500 calibration
samples, over 70$\times$ fewer than prior methods. To our knowledge, this is
the first closed-form, activation-guided structural compression of DMs that is
entirely training-free, providing both theoretical clarity and practical
efficiency.

### [177] [Chasing the Tail: Effective Rubric-based Reward Modeling for Large Language Model Post-Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21500)
*Junkai Zhang,Zihao Wang,Lin Gui,Swarnashree Mysore Sathyendra,Jaehwan Jeong,Victor Veitch,Wei Wang,Yunzhong He,Bing Liu,Lifeng Jin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Rubric-based rewards reduce reward over-optimization in reinforcement fine-tuning by targeting the high-reward tail and carefully distinguishing among top responses using a rubric-driven workflow.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reward misspecification at the high-reward tail causes models to hack signals; high-quality outputs are rare in base LLMs and off-policy exemplars alone can misalign rewards. A rubric-based approach aims to robustly reward truly excellent behavior by focusing on the high-reward region while being artifact-insensitive.

Method: Introduce rubric-based rewards and a workflow to elicit rubrics that differentiate among great and diverse responses. Use rubrics to harness off-policy examples without introducing reward artifacts and to emphasize the high-reward tail during training.

Result: Empirically, rubric-based rewards substantially mitigate reward over-optimization and yield better post-training improvements for LLMs; code is provided at the project repository.

Conclusion: Rubric-based rewards effectively align RLHF/RFT objectives by reducing tail misspecification, enabling finer discrimination in the high-reward region, and offering a practical workflow for implementation.

Abstract: Reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) often suffers from \emph{reward
over-optimization}, where a policy model hacks the reward signals to achieve
high scores while producing low-quality outputs. Our theoretical analysis shows
that the key lies in reward misspecification at the high-reward tail: the
inability to reliably distinguish Excellent responses from merely Great ones.
This motivate us to focus on the high-reward region. However, such tail
examples are scarce under the base LLM. While off-policy exemplars (e.g. from
stronger models or rewrites) are easier to obtain, naively training on them
yields a misspecified reward for the policy we aim to align. To address this,
we study rubric-based rewards. By design, rubrics can leverage off-policy
examples while remaining insensitive to their artifacts. To elicit rubrics that
capture the high-reward tail, we highlight the importance of distinguishing
among great and diverse responses, and introduce a workflow to implement this
idea. We empirically demonstrate that rubric-based rewards substantially
mitigate reward over-optimization and deliver effective LLM post-training
improvements. Our code can be accessed at

*Micha Livne*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: cMIM: a contrastive extension of MIM that yields strong discriminative and generative representations, aided by informative embeddings; outperforms MIM and InfoNCE on vision/molecular tasks with good reconstruction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need representations that transfer across diverse downstream tasks; existing paradigms (contrastive learning, self-supervised masking, denoising) balance discriminative and generative trade-offs; aim for a unified framework combining discriminative power with generative fidelity while reducing data augmentation and batch-size sensitivity.

Method: Introduce a contrastive objective into the Mutual Information Machine (MIM) to form cMIM, removing the need for positive data augmentation and reducing batch-size sensitivity relative to InfoNCE. Propose informative embeddings to extract enriched features from encoder–decoder models. Validate across vision and molecular benchmarks.

Result: Empirical results show cMIM outperforms MIM and InfoNCE on classification and regression tasks while preserving competitive reconstruction quality, demonstrated across vision and molecular domains.

Conclusion: cMIM provides a unified representation-learning framework balancing discriminative and generative capabilities, with practical training advantages and broad applicability via informative embeddings.

Abstract: Learning representations that transfer well to diverse downstream tasks
remains a central challenge in representation learning. Existing paradigms --
contrastive learning, self-supervised masking, and denoising auto-encoders --
balance this challenge with different trade-offs. We introduce the {contrastive
Mutual Information Machine} (cMIM), a probabilistic framework that extends the
Mutual Information Machine (MIM) with a contrastive objective. While MIM
maximizes mutual information between inputs and latents and promotes clustering
of codes, it falls short on discriminative tasks. cMIM addresses this gap by
imposing global discriminative structure while retaining MIM's generative
fidelity. Our contributions are threefold. First, we propose cMIM, a
contrastive extension of MIM that removes the need for positive data
augmentation and is substantially less sensitive to batch size than InfoNCE.
Second, we introduce {informative embeddings}, a general technique for
extracting enriched features from encoder-decoder models that boosts
discriminative performance without additional training and applies broadly
beyond MIM. Third, we provide empirical evidence across vision and molecular
benchmarks showing that cMIM outperforms MIM and InfoNCE on classification and
regression tasks while preserving competitive reconstruction quality. These
results position cMIM as a unified framework for representation learning,
advancing the goal of models that serve both discriminative and generative
applications effectively.

*Weiqiao Han,Chenlin Meng,Christopher D. Manning,Stefano Ermon*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DistillKac uses damped wave and stochastic Kac dynamics to move probability mass at finite speed, enabling stable, efficient image generation with velocity-space guidance and endpoint distillation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models risk stiff reverse-time dynamics and potentially unbounded propagation speeds. Finite-speed transport and bounded kinetic energy promise improved numerical stability and efficiency. The work also aims to enable effective guidance and distillation strategies compatible with finite-speed flows.

Method: Adopts the damped wave equation and stochastic Kac representation to achieve finite-speed probability transport. Introduces classifier-free guidance in velocity space that preserves square integrability. Proposes endpoint-only distillation, training a student to match a frozen teacher over long intervals, supported by a stability result that endpoints supervision induces closeness along the entire trajectory.

Result: Empirically, DistillKac delivers high-quality samples with very few function evaluations while retaining the numerical stability benefits of finite-speed probability flows.

Conclusion: DistillKac offers a stable, efficient alternative to diffusion-based generators by enforcing finite-speed probability transport, enabling high-quality image generation with reduced computational cost and robust theoretical guarantees.

Abstract: We present DistillKac, a fast image generator that uses the damped wave
equation and its stochastic Kac representation to move probability mass at
finite speed. In contrast to diffusion models whose reverse time velocities can
become stiff and implicitly allow unbounded propagation speed, Kac dynamics
enforce finite speed transport and yield globally bounded kinetic energy.
Building on this structure, we introduce classifier-free guidance in velocity
space that preserves square integrability under mild conditions. We then
propose endpoint only distillation that trains a student to match a frozen
teacher over long intervals. We prove a stability result that promotes
supervision at the endpoints to closeness along the entire path. Experiments
demonstrate DistillKac delivers high quality samples with very few function
evaluations while retaining the numerical stability benefits of finite speed
probability flows.

*Joshua Mitton,Prarthana Bhattacharyya,Ralph Abboud,Simon Woodhead*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: In KT, modeling predictive uncertainty can reveal when students are likely to err on distractors, offering a signal to guide instruction, especially in low-resource settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: KT models often optimize accuracy but miss student errors like distractor choices. capturing predictive uncertainty could reveal model weaknesses and provide actionable insights for targeted pedagogy.

Method: Augment KT with predictive uncertainty measures and analyze whether higher uncertainty correlates with incorrect predictions, validating its informativeness for pedagogy in resource-constrained educational platforms.

Result: The study reports that larger predictive uncertainty aligns with model incorrect predictions, and that uncertainty is informative for guiding pedagogy in limited-resource settings.

Conclusion: Predictive uncertainty in KT is a valuable signal that can support error detection and targeted interventions in educational platforms when resources are constrained.

Abstract: The main focus of research on Knowledge Tracing (KT) models is on model
developments with the aim of improving predictive accuracy. Most of these
models make the most incorrect predictions when students choose a distractor,
leading to student errors going undetected. We present an approach to add new
capabilities to KT models by capturing predictive uncertainty and demonstrate
that a larger predictive uncertainty aligns with model incorrect predictions.
We show that uncertainty in KT models is informative and that this signal would
be pedagogically useful for application in an educational learning platform
that can be used in a limited resource setting where understanding student
ability is necessary.

### [181] [$\mathbf{Li_2}$: A Framework on Dynamics of Feature Emergence and Delayed Generalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21519)
*Yuandong Tian*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Li2 offers a three-stage gradient-dynamics framework for grokking in 2-layer nets: lazy learning, independent feature learning, and interactive feature learning, linked to an energy-function landscape; it yields provable scaling laws, clarifies hyperparameter roles, and rationalizes optimizer effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is currently no principled mathematical framework describing what features emerge and under what conditions delayed generalization (grokking) occurs for complex structured inputs; this work seeks to formalize and predict feature emergence in grokking.

Method: Propose Li2 framework and analyze backpropagated gradient G_F across layers to characterize three stages: (I) lazy learning with random G_F and overfitting to random hidden representations; (II) independent feature learning where each hidden node learns its representation independently and weight decay injects information about targets into G_F, following gradient ascent on an energy function E; (III) interactive learning where hidden nodes interact and G_F shifts to missing features; derive scaling laws and study memorization vs generalization under varying sample sizes; discuss hyperparameters (weight decay, learning rate) and optimizer Muon; extendable to multi-layer architectures.

Result: The framework yields provable characterizations of the three grokking stages, shows that independently learned features correspond to local maxima of an energy function, demonstrates how G_F evolves to reveal missing features, and establishes scaling laws linking memorization and generalization to data size and hyperparameters; it also provides rationale for optimiser effectiveness and suggests applicability to deeper networks.

Conclusion: Li2 provides a principled, extensible lens for understanding feature emergence and delayed generalization in grokking, clarifying the roles of hyperparameters and optimization dynamics, with potential guidance for network design and training in deeper architectures.

Abstract: While the phenomenon of grokking, i.e., delayed generalization, has been
studied extensively, it remains an open question whether there is a
mathematical framework to characterize what kind of features emerge, how and in
which conditions it happens from training, for complex structured inputs. We
propose a novel framework, named $\mathbf{Li_2}$, that captures three key
stages for the grokking behavior of 2-layer nonlinear networks: (I) Lazy
learning, (II) independent feature learning and (III) interactive feature
learning, characterized by the structure of backpropagated gradient $G_F$
across layers. In (I), $G_F$ is random, and top layer overfits to random hidden
representation. In (II), the gradient of each node (column of $G_F$) only
depends on its own activation, and thus each hidden node learns their
representation independently from $G_F$, which now carries information about
target labels, thanks to weight decay. Interestingly, the independent dynamics
follows exactly the gradient ascent of an energy function $E$, and its local
maxima are precisely the emerging features. We study whether these local-optima
induced features are generalizable, their representation power, and how they
change on sample size, in group arithmetic tasks. Finally, in (III), we
provably show how hidden nodes interact, and how $G_F$ changes to focus on
missing features that need to be learned. Our study sheds lights on roles
played by key hyperparameters such as weight decay, learning rate and sample
sizes in grokking, leads to provable scaling laws of memorization and
generalization, and reveals the underlying cause why recent optimizers such as
Muon can be effective, from the first principles of gradient dynamics. Our
analysis can be extended to multi-layer architectures.

*Hongyang He,Xinyuan Song,Yangfan He,Zeyu Zhang,Yanshu Li,Haochen You,Lifan Sun,Wenqiao Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TRiCo introduces a triadic, game-theoretic co-training framework for SSL with two students on complementary frozen representations, a meta-learned teacher that adaptively regulates pseudo-labels and losses via validation feedback, and a non-parametric generator that perturbs embeddings to expose boundary weaknesses, all formulated as a Stackelberg game.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address core SSL limitations: reliance on static representation views, unreliable pseudo-labels, and lack of hard-sample modeling. TRiCo aims to unify teacher-student, co-training, and adversarial perturbation into a principled framework that better handles epistemic uncertainty and decision-boundary weaknesses.

Method: Three-party interaction: two students trained on frozen, complementary representations; a meta-learned teacher uses validation feedback to regulate pseudo-label selection and loss balancing; a non-parametric generator perturbs embeddings to reveal boundary weaknesses. Pseudo-labels are chosen by mutual information rather than confidence. The setup is formalized as a Stackelberg game with the teacher as leader and students adapting under adversarial perturbations.

Result: Empirical results on CIFAR-10, SVHN, STL-10, and ImageNet show TRiCo achieves state-of-the-art performance in low-label regimes. The method is architecture-agnostic and compatible with frozen vision backbones.

Conclusion: TRiCo provides a principled, generalizable SSL solution that better models epistemic uncertainty and hard samples through triadic interaction and adaptive pseudo-label regulation, achieving strong results across multiple datasets and settings.

Abstract: We introduce TRiCo, a novel triadic game-theoretic co-training framework that
rethinks the structure of semi-supervised learning by incorporating a teacher,
two students, and an adversarial generator into a unified training paradigm.
Unlike existing co-training or teacher-student approaches, TRiCo formulates SSL
as a structured interaction among three roles: (i) two student classifiers
trained on frozen, complementary representations, (ii) a meta-learned teacher
that adaptively regulates pseudo-label selection and loss balancing via
validation-based feedback, and (iii) a non-parametric generator that perturbs
embeddings to uncover decision boundary weaknesses. Pseudo-labels are selected
based on mutual information rather than confidence, providing a more robust
measure of epistemic uncertainty. This triadic interaction is formalized as a
Stackelberg game, where the teacher leads strategy optimization and students
follow under adversarial perturbations. By addressing key limitations in
existing SSL frameworks, such as static view interactions, unreliable
pseudo-labels, and lack of hard sample modeling, TRiCo provides a principled
and generalizable solution. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, SVHN, STL-10,
and ImageNet demonstrate that TRiCo consistently achieves state-of-the-art
performance in low-label regimes, while remaining architecture-agnostic and
compatible with frozen vision backbones.

*Sathwik Karnik,Somil Bansal*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: BRT-Align uses backward reachability to estimate worst-case forward trajectories in latent space for LLMs, enabling a runtime monitor and a minimally invasive steering filter to prevent unsafe generations, improving safety at inference time while preserving coherence and diversity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Inference-time safety gaps in RLHF-aligned LLMs; need principled runtime guarantees beyond training-time alignment.

Method: Model autoregressive generation as a latent-space dynamical system; learn a safety value function via backward reachability to bound worst-case trajectories; implement a runtime monitor for early detection and a least-restrictive steering filter to redirect generation away from unsafe regions.

Result: Earlier and more accurate detection of unsafe continuations than baselines; substantial reduction in unsafe generations while maintaining sentence diversity and coherence; qualitative results show less violence, profanity, offensiveness, and political bias.

Conclusion: Reachability-based safety provides a principled, practical foundation for inference-time safety in LLMs, enabling real-time monitoring and minimal interventions without sacrificing linguistic quality.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are now ubiquitous in everyday tools, raising
urgent safety concerns about their tendency to generate harmful content. The
dominant safety approach -- reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF)
-- effectively shapes model behavior during training but offers no safeguards
at inference time, where unsafe continuations may still arise. We propose
BRT-Align, a reachability-based framework that brings control-theoretic safety
tools to LLM inference. BRT-Align models autoregressive generation as a
dynamical system in latent space and learn a safety value function via backward
reachability, estimating the worst-case evolution of a trajectory. This enables
two complementary mechanisms: (1) a runtime monitor that forecasts unsafe
completions several tokens in advance, and (2) a least-restrictive steering
filter that minimally perturbs latent states to redirect generation away from
unsafe regions. Experiments across multiple LLMs and toxicity benchmarks
demonstrate that BRT-Align provides more accurate and earlier detection of
unsafe continuations than baselines. Moreover, for LLM safety alignment,
BRT-Align substantially reduces unsafe generations while preserving sentence
diversity and coherence. Qualitative results further highlight emergent
alignment properties: BRT-Align consistently produces responses that are less
violent, less profane, less offensive, and less politically biased. Together,
these findings demonstrate that reachability analysis provides a principled and
practical foundation for inference-time LLM safety.

TL;DR: A query-based model collaboration framework augments data using LLMs in healthcare by incorporating expert domain knowledge to preserve critical medical information, reducing factual errors and boosting clinical prediction performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs offer strong generative capabilities for data augmentation, but in high-stakes domains like healthcare, there is a risk of generating clinically incorrect or misleading information; a safe, domain-aligned augmentation approach is needed.

Method: Introduce a lightweight, expert-guided collaboration framework where domain knowledge guides the LLM-driven augmentation process to preserve essential medical facts during data generation.

Result: The proposed approach consistently outperforms existing LLM augmentation methods on clinical prediction tasks and reduces factual errors, indicating better performance and safety.

Conclusion: Integrating expert-level domain knowledge into LLM-based augmentation helps realize the potential of LLMs for data augmentation while meeting safety requirements in specialized domains.

Abstract: Data augmentation is a widely used strategy to improve model robustness and
generalization by enriching training datasets with synthetic examples. While
large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong generative capabilities
for this purpose, their applications in high-stakes domains like healthcare
present unique challenges due to the risk of generating clinically incorrect or
misleading information. In this work, we propose a novel query-based model
collaboration framework that integrates expert-level domain knowledge to guide
the augmentation process to preserve critical medical information. Experiments
on clinical prediction tasks demonstrate that our lightweight
collaboration-based approach consistently outperforms existing LLM augmentation
methods while improving safety through reduced factual errors. This framework
addresses the gap between LLM augmentation potential and the safety
requirements of specialized domains.

*Tankred Saanum,Can Demircan,Samuel J. Gershman,Eric Schulz*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Induction heads in LLMs adaptively learn to attend to context-relevant successors, enabling in-context learning of hierarchical, higher-order patterns and revealing a mechanism by which LLMs discover latent contexts to predict perturbations in text.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understand whether induction heads support in-context learning beyond simple token copying, particularly for hierarchical, context-dependent patterns found in natural language; address limitations of naive, context-independent attention to all successors.

Method: Design a synthetic in-context learning task with hierarchical token dependencies; evaluate multiple LLMs on these sequences and related natural-language analogues; analyze induction-head attention to identify what information is used for prediction and how learning manifests; examine whether attention heads reveal latent contexts structuring token transitions.

Result: Adaptive induction heads learn to selectively attend to context-relevant successors, improving prediction of future tokens in hierarchical patterns; evidence suggests learning is mediated by attention heads that uncover latent contexts, which determine token transition relationships; findings generalize to natural-language analogues.

Conclusion: LLMs possess induction heads that learn to handle higher-order in-context patterns; the study provides a mechanistic account of how induction heads learn what to attend to and how latent-context representations underlie the prediction of complex repetitive structures.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at in-context learning, the ability to use
information provided as context to improve prediction of future tokens.
Induction heads have been argued to play a crucial role for in-context learning
in Transformer Language Models. These attention heads make a token attend to
successors of past occurrences of the same token in the input. This basic
mechanism supports LLMs' ability to copy and predict repeating patterns.
However, it is unclear if this same mechanism can support in-context learning
of more complex repetitive patterns with hierarchical structure. Natural
language is teeming with such cases: The article "the" in English usually
prefaces multiple nouns in a text. When predicting which token succeeds a
particular instance of "the", we need to integrate further contextual cues from
the text to predict the correct noun. If induction heads naively attend to all
past instances of successor tokens of "the" in a context-independent manner,
they cannot support this level of contextual information integration. In this
study, we design a synthetic in-context learning task, where tokens are
repeated with hierarchical dependencies. Here, attending uniformly to all
successor tokens is not sufficient to accurately predict future tokens.
Evaluating a range of LLMs on these token sequences and natural language
analogues, we find adaptive induction heads that support prediction by learning
what to attend to in-context. Next, we investigate how induction heads
themselves learn in-context. We find evidence that learning is supported by
attention heads that uncover a set of latent contexts, determining the
different token transition relationships. Overall, we not only show that LLMs
have induction heads that learn, but offer a complete mechanistic account of
how LLMs learn to predict higher-order repetitive patterns in-context.

### [186] [Evidence for Limited Metacognition in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21545)
*Christopher Ackerman*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces a quantitative, non-self-report method for evaluating metacognition in LLMs, finding frontier models show emerging metacognitive abilities with limitations and possible upstream signals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Safety and policy implications of LLM self-awareness; measurement of metacognition is nascent; avoid relying on model self-reports; adapt animal metacognition methods to LLMs.

Method: Two experimental paradigms inspired by nonhuman animal metacognition; test whether models can strategically deploy knowledge of internal states, including confidence calibration and prospective judgment about anticipated answers; analyze token probabilities for potential internal signals.

Result: Frontier LLMs (since early 2024) show increasing evidence of metacognitive abilities: ability to assess/use confidence in correctness and to anticipate and use information about their own answers. Token-probability analysis suggests an upstream internal signal. Abilities are limited in resolution, context-dependent, and qualitatively different from human metacognition; notable differences across models of similar capabilities; post-training may influence development.

Conclusion: Metacognition appears in LLMs to some extent but is not equivalent to human metacognition; the measurement approach is promising for safety/policy assessment and model design, but more work is needed to understand mechanisms, robustness, and cross-model variability.

Abstract: The possibility of LLM self-awareness and even sentience is gaining
increasing public attention and has major safety and policy implications, but
the science of measuring them is still in a nascent state. Here we introduce a
novel methodology for quantitatively evaluating metacognitive abilities in
LLMs. Taking inspiration from research on metacognition in nonhuman animals,
our approach eschews model self-reports and instead tests to what degree models
can strategically deploy knowledge of internal states. Using two experimental
paradigms, we demonstrate that frontier LLMs introduced since early 2024 show
increasingly strong evidence of certain metacognitive abilities, specifically
the ability to assess and utilize their own confidence in their ability to
answer factual and reasoning questions correctly and the ability to anticipate
what answers they would give and utilize that information appropriately. We
buttress these behavioral findings with an analysis of the token probabilities
returned by the models, which suggests the presence of an upstream internal
signal that could provide the basis for metacognition. We further find that
these abilities 1) are limited in resolution, 2) emerge in context-dependent
manners, and 3) seem to be qualitatively different from those of humans. We
also report intriguing differences across models of similar capabilities,
suggesting that LLM post-training may have a role in developing metacognitive
abilities.

### [187] [Machine Learning. The Science of Selection under Uncertainty](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21547)
*Yevgeny Seldin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Survey of statistical tools for learning under uncertainty, covering concentration inequalities, generalization bounds, and online regret in offline and online learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide theoretical guarantees for selection under uncertainty in prediction tasks.

Method: Compiles and explains concentration inequalities (Markov, Chebyshev, Hoeffding, Bernstein, empirical Bernstein, Unexpected Bernstein, kl, split-kl), classical offline generalization analyses (Occam, VC, PAC-Bayesian), PAC-Bayes for weighted majority votes, and online learning frameworks with environmental feedback/resistance/complexity; derives regret bounds for stochastic and adversarial environments under full information and bandit feedback.

Result: A cohesive framework of tools and bounds for learning under uncertainty, offering theoretical guarantees and guidance for deriving bounds across offline and online settings.

Conclusion: Equips researchers with rigorous theoretical foundations for learning under uncertainty in both offline and online contexts, enabling principled selection and evaluation of prediction rules.

Abstract: Learning, whether natural or artificial, is a process of selection. It starts
with a set of candidate options and selects the more successful ones. In the
case of machine learning the selection is done based on empirical estimates of
prediction accuracy of candidate prediction rules on some data. Due to
randomness of data sampling the empirical estimates are inherently noisy,
leading to selection under uncertainty. The book provides statistical tools to
obtain theoretical guarantees on the outcome of selection under uncertainty. We
start with concentration of measure inequalities, which are the main
statistical instrument for controlling how much an empirical estimate of
expectation of a function deviates from the true expectation. The book covers a
broad range of inequalities, including Markov's, Chebyshev's, Hoeffding's,
Bernstein's, Empirical Bernstein's, Unexpected Bernstein's, kl, and split-kl.
We then study the classical (offline) supervised learning and provide a range
of tools for deriving generalization bounds, including Occam's razor,
Vapnik-Chervonenkis analysis, and PAC-Bayesian analysis. The latter is further
applied to derive generalization guarantees for weighted majority votes. After
covering the offline setting, we turn our attention to online learning. We
present the space of online learning problems characterized by environmental
feedback, environmental resistance, and structural complexity. A common
performance measure in online learning is regret, which compares performance of
an algorithm to performance of the best prediction rule in hindsight, out of a
restricted set of prediction rules. We present tools for deriving regret bounds
in stochastic and adversarial environments, and under full information and
bandit feedback.

### [188] [Interpretable time series analysis with Gumbel dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21578)
*Yiliu Wang,Timothy Doyeon Kim,Eric Shea-Brown,Uygar Sümbül*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces the Gumbel Dynamical Model (GDM), a differentiable, relaxed-state switching dynamical system using Gumbel noise to model smoother transitions and overlapping dynamics in stochastic time series, enabling scalable gradient-based training and interpretable states.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Discrete switching models struggle to capture smooth, variable-speed transitions, stochastic mixtures of overlapping states, and often exhibit spurious rapid switching; a differentiable, flexible framework is needed to better reflect non-stationary ground-truth dynamics.

Method: Replace discrete state dynamics with a continuous relaxation on a relaxed-discrete state space using a Gumbel-based noise model (Gumbel-Softmax), expanding the available dynamics; this makes the model fully differentiable and trainable with standard gradient descent; evaluate on standard simulation datasets and two real-world datasets.

Result: The model more faithfully captures soft, sticky states and non-stationary transitions in stochastic settings; it learns interpretable states for time series with multiple dynamics and performs well on both synthetic and real data compared to traditional methods.

Conclusion: GDM offers a scalable, differentiable approach to switching dynamical systems that handles smooth transitions and stochastic mixtures, improving interpretability and applicability to real-world stochastic time series.

Abstract: Switching dynamical systems can model complicated time series data while
maintaining interpretability by inferring a finite set of dynamics primitives
and explaining different portions of the observed time series with one of these
primitives. However, due to the discrete nature of this set, such models
struggle to capture smooth, variable-speed transitions, as well as stochastic
mixtures of overlapping states, and the inferred dynamics often display
spurious rapid switching on real-world datasets. Here, we propose the Gumbel
Dynamical Model (GDM). First, by introducing a continuous relaxation of
discrete states and a different noise model defined on the relaxed-discrete
state space via the Gumbel distribution, GDM expands the set of available state
dynamics, allowing the model to approximate smoother and non-stationary
ground-truth dynamics more faithfully. Second, the relaxation makes the model
fully differentiable, enabling fast and scalable training with standard
gradient descent methods. We validate our approach on standard simulation
datasets and highlight its ability to model soft, sticky states and transitions
in a stochastic setting. Furthermore, we apply our model to two real-world
datasets, demonstrating its ability to infer interpretable states in stochastic
time series with multiple dynamics, a setting where traditional methods often
fail.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fraudulent reviews undermine consumer trust and seller reputation; scalable, data-driven detection is needed for large review corpora.

Method: Uses a scalable big data framework to process vast review data, extract features indicative of spam, and evaluate multiple ML classifiers (notably Logistic Regression).

Result: LR classifier attains 90.35% accuracy in spam detection on the dataset; demonstrates effectiveness of ML in improving review authenticity.

Conclusion: Shows potential for enhancing trust in e-commerce; highlights the value of scalable ML pipelines for spam review detection; future work could address generalization, other models, and deployment considerations.

Abstract: In this digital era, online shopping is common practice in our daily lives.
Product reviews significantly influence consumer buying behavior and help
establish buyer trust. However, the prevalence of fraudulent reviews undermines
this trust by potentially misleading consumers and damaging the reputations of
the sellers. This research addresses this pressing issue by employing advanced
big data analytics and machine learning approaches on a substantial dataset of
Amazon product reviews. The primary objective is to detect and classify spam
reviews accurately so that it enhances the authenticity of the review. Using a
scalable big data framework, we efficiently process and analyze a large scale
of review data, extracting key features indicative of fraudulent behavior. Our
study illustrates the utility of various machine learning classifiers in
detecting spam reviews, with Logistic Regression achieving an accuracy of
90.35%, thus contributing to a more trustworthy and transparent online shopping
environment.

*Tian Yu Yen,Reese E. Jones,Ravi G. Patel*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GenUQ introduces a likelihood-free uncertainty quantification framework for operator learning using a generative hyper-network, achieving better uncertainty quantification on three problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Uncertainty quantification for stochastic operators is hard when likelihoods are intractable or unavailable; operator learning aims to map function states, requiring robust UQ.

Method: A measure-theoretic UQ approach (GenUQ) that uses a generative hyper-network to produce parameter distributions consistent with observed data, avoiding likelihood construction.

Result: GenUQ outperforms existing UQ methods on three tasks: recovering a manufactured operator, learning the solution operator for a stochastic elliptic PDE, and predicting failure location of porous steel under tension.

Conclusion: GenUQ provides a robust, likelihood-free UQ framework for operator learning, enabling reliable uncertainty quantification where likelihood-based methods struggle.

Abstract: Operator learning is a recently developed generalization of regression to
mappings between functions. It promises to drastically reduce expensive
numerical integration of PDEs to fast evaluations of mappings between
functional states of a system, i.e., surrogate and reduced-order modeling.
Operator learning has already found applications in several areas such as
modeling sea ice, combustion, and atmospheric physics. Recent approaches
towards integrating uncertainty quantification into the operator models have
relied on likelihood based methods to infer parameter distributions from noisy
data. However, stochastic operators may yield actions from which a likelihood
is difficult or impossible to construct. In this paper, we introduce, GenUQ, a
measure-theoretic approach to UQ that avoids constructing a likelihood by
introducing a generative hyper-network model that produces parameter
distributions consistent with observed data. We demonstrate that GenUQ
outperforms other UQ methods in three example problems, recovering a
manufactured operator, learning the solution operator to a stochastic elliptic
PDE, and modeling the failure location of porous steel under tension.

### [191] [Task-Agnostic Federated Continual Learning via Replay-Free Gradient Projection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21606)
*Seohyeon Cha,Huancheng Chen,Haris Vikalo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FedProTIP combines gradient projection to prevent forgetting with a lightweight task-identity predictor for federated continual learning, achieving strong average accuracy, especially when task identities are unknown.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In federated continual learning, non-iid data, limited communication, and privacy constraints lead to catastrophic forgetting. There is a need to reduce interference with previously learned tasks and handle unknown task identities during inference.

Method: On each client, project gradient updates onto the orthogonal complement of the subspace spanned by previously learned global-model representations to minimize interference with earlier tasks. Additionally, a lightweight mechanism leverages core bases from prior tasks to predict task identity and adjust the global outputs accordingly for task-agnostic inference.

Result: Empirical evaluation on standard FCL benchmarks shows FedProTIP significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in average accuracy, with notable gains when task identities are unknown.

Conclusion: The combination of gradient projection and task-identity-informed output adjustment effectively mitigates forgetting in federated continual learning under heterogeneous data and unknown task identities.

Abstract: Federated continual learning (FCL) enables distributed client devices to
learn from streaming data across diverse and evolving tasks. A major challenge
to continual learning, catastrophic forgetting, is exacerbated in decentralized
settings by the data heterogeneity, constrained communication and privacy
concerns. We propose Federated gradient Projection-based Continual Learning
with Task Identity Prediction (FedProTIP), a novel FCL framework that mitigates
forgetting by projecting client updates onto the orthogonal complement of the
subspace spanned by previously learned representations of the global model.
This projection reduces interference with earlier tasks and preserves
performance across the task sequence. To further address the challenge of
task-agnostic inference, we incorporate a lightweight mechanism that leverages
core bases from prior tasks to predict task identity and dynamically adjust the
global model's outputs. Extensive experiments across standard FCL benchmarks
demonstrate that FedProTIP significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods
in average accuracy, particularly in settings where task identities are a
priori unknown.

### [192] [Causal Abstraction Inference under Lossy Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21607)
*Kevin Xia,Elias Bareinboim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces projected abstractions to handle lossy representations in causal abstraction frameworks; provides construction, query translation, identifiability criteria, and empirical validation in high-dimensional images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing causal abstractions assume invariant abstractions; lossy mappings cause information loss making high-level causal reasoning unreliable. Projected abstractions address this gap.

Method: Define projected abstractions; construct from a given low-level causal model; establish translation of observational, interventional, and counterfactual queries to high-level; present graphical criteria for identifiability/estimation with limited data; validate on high-dimensional image datasets.

Result: Theoretical graphical criteria enabling identification and estimation of high-level causal queries from limited low-level data; empirical evidence showing effectiveness in high-dimensional image settings.

Conclusion: Projected abstractions extend causal abstraction theory to lossy mappings, enabling reliable cross-level reasoning from limited data and broad applicability to complex domains like images.

Abstract: The study of causal abstractions bridges two integral components of human
intelligence: the ability to determine cause and effect, and the ability to
interpret complex patterns into abstract concepts. Formally, causal abstraction
frameworks define connections between complicated low-level causal models and
simple high-level ones. One major limitation of most existing definitions is
that they are not well-defined when considering lossy abstraction functions in
which multiple low-level interventions can have different effects while mapping
to the same high-level intervention (an assumption called the abstract
invariance condition). In this paper, we introduce a new type of abstractions
called projected abstractions that generalize existing definitions to
accommodate lossy representations. We show how to construct a projected
abstraction from the low-level model and how it translates equivalent
observational, interventional, and counterfactual causal queries from low to
high-level. Given that the true model is rarely available in practice we prove
a new graphical criteria for identifying and estimating high-level causal
queries from limited low-level data. Finally, we experimentally show the
effectiveness of projected abstraction models in high-dimensional image
settings.

### [193] [LANCE: Low Rank Activation Compression for Efficient On-Device Continual Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21617)
*Marco Paul E. Apolinario,Kaushik Roy*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LANCE uses a one-shot higher-order SVD to learn a reusable, low-rank activation subspace for on-device learning, yielding large memory savings with competitive accuracy and enabling continual learning with orthogonal subspaces.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: On-device personalization and continual learning require memory- and compute-efficient updates. Storing activations during backprop is costly, and repeated low-rank decompositions add overhead. Prior work has not effectively combined activation compression with continual learning.

Method: Compute a one-shot higher-order SVD to obtain a fixed low-rank subspace for activation projections. Use this subspace to project activations during backprop, avoiding repeated decompositions. For continual learning, allocate tasks to orthogonal subspaces to prevent forgetting without storing large task-specific matrices.

Result: Activation storage is reduced up to 250x, with accuracy comparable to full backprop on CIFAR-10/100, Oxford-IIIT Pets, Flowers102, and CUB-200. In continual learning benchmarks (Split CIFAR-100, Split MiniImageNet, 5-Datasets), performance is competitive with orthogonal gradient projection methods at a fraction of the memory cost.

Conclusion: LANCE offers a practical, scalable approach for efficient fine-tuning and continual learning on edge devices by dramatically reducing activation storage and computation while maintaining competitive accuracy.

Abstract: On-device learning is essential for personalization, privacy, and long-term
adaptation in resource-constrained environments. Achieving this requires
efficient learning, both fine-tuning existing models and continually acquiring
new tasks without catastrophic forgetting. Yet both settings are constrained by
high memory cost of storing activations during backpropagation. Existing
activation compression methods reduce this cost but relying on repeated
low-rank decompositions, introducing computational overhead. Also, such methods
have not been explored for continual learning. We propose LANCE (Low-rank
Activation Compression), a framework that performs one-shot higher-order
Singular Value Decompsoition (SVD) to obtain a reusable low-rank subspace for
activation projection. This eliminates repeated decompositions, reducing both
memory and computation. Moreover, fixed low-rank subspaces further enable
on-device continual learning by allocating tasks to orthogonal subspaces
without storing large task-specific matrices. Experiments show that LANCE
reduces activation storage up to 250$\times$ while maintaining accuracy
comparable to full backpropagation on CIFAR-10/100, Oxford-IIIT Pets,
Flowers102, and CUB-200 datasets. On continual learning benchmarks (Split
CIFAR-100, Split MiniImageNet, 5-Datasets), it achieves performance competitive
with orthogonal gradient projection methods at a fraction of the memory cost.
These results position LANCE as a practical and scalable solution for efficient
fine-tuning and continual learning on edge devices.

*Krishu K Thapa,Reet Barik,Krishna Teja Chitty-Venkata,Murali Emani,Venkatram Vishwanath*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Dynamic switching from full parameter training to Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) for ViT-Large based on convergence state; reduces trainable parameters to 10% of original, triples throughput, cuts average epoch time by 1.5x, and lowers GPU memory by 20% while preserving accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training very large models is resource-intensive; most learning occurs early and weights tend to converge to a low intrinsic rank, suggesting late-stage fine-tuning can be achieved with low-rank adapters to save compute and memory.

Method: Monitor convergence of each module during training and use user-defined hyperparameters to determine a switching point. Allocate per-layer ranks based on convergence level and switch from full parameter training to LoRA adapters for ViT-Large, providing a flexible, per-layer adaptation strategy.

Result: Maintains model accuracy while drastically reducing trainable parameters (to 10% of original), achieving ~3x throughput, ~1.5x faster per-epoch training time, and ~20% reduction in GPU memory consumption.

Conclusion: A convergence-aware, dynamic switch to LoRA is an effective and practical approach for efficient training of very large transformers, enabling substantial resource savings with negligible accuracy loss.

Abstract: Training large models ranging from millions to billions of parameters is
highly resource-intensive, requiring significant time, compute, and memory. It
is observed that most of the learning (higher change in weights) takes place in
the earlier stage of the training loop. These changes stabilize as training
continues, enabling them to be captured by matrices of a low intrinsic rank.
Therefore, we propose an approach to identify such states of partial
convergence and dynamically switch from full parameter training to Low-Rank
Adaptation (LoRA) on the ViT-Large model. We introduce a flexible approach that
leverages user-defined hyperparameters to determine the switching point and
assign a rank specific to each module layer based on its level of convergence.
Experimental results show that this approach preserves model accuracy while
reducing the number of trainable parameters to 10% of its original size,
resulting in a 3x improvement in throughput, and a 1.5x reduction in average
training time per epoch while also reducing GPU memory consumption by 20%

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Directly predict Hessians with SE(3)-equivariant GNNs (HIP Hessians) using irreducible representation features up to l=2, enabling fast, accurate, memory-efficient Hessians for downstream tasks and scalable to larger systems; code open-sourced.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hessians are expensive to compute (O(N^3) or worse) and scale poorly with system size, hindering tasks like transition state search and vibrational analysis. A direct Hessian predictor could dramatically accelerate computational chemistry workflows.

Method: Use SE(3)-equivariant, symmetric Hessians constructed from irrep features up to degree l=2 learned during message passing in a graph neural network. Train to output full Hessian matrices (3N x 3N) without automatic differentiation or finite differences, ensuring symmetry and proper tensor transformation properties.

Result: HIP Hessians are 1–2 orders of magnitude faster, more accurate, and more memory-efficient than conventional Hessian computation. They scale better with system size and improve performance across downstream tasks (transition state search, accelerated geometry optimization, zero-point energy corrections, vibrational analysis). The method is validated across diverse benchmarks and the code and weights are open-sourced.

Conclusion: Direct, equivariant Hessian prediction is a viable, superior alternative to traditional Hessian computation, enabling faster workflows and broader scalability in computational chemistry; the open-source HIP package will foster further development in direct Hessian prediction.

Abstract: Fundamental tasks in computational chemistry, from transition state search to
vibrational analysis, rely on molecular Hessians, which are the second
derivatives of the potential energy. Yet, Hessians are computationally
expensive to calculate and scale poorly with system size, with both quantum
mechanical methods and neural networks. In this work, we demonstrate that
Hessians can be predicted directly from a deep learning model, without relying
on automatic differentiation or finite differences. We observe that one can
construct SE(3)-equivariant, symmetric Hessians from irreducible
representations (irrep) features up to degree $l$=2 computed during message
passing in graph neural networks. This makes HIP Hessians one to two orders of
magnitude faster, more accurate, more memory efficient, easier to train, and
enables more favorable scaling with system size. We validate our predictions
across a wide range of downstream tasks, demonstrating consistently superior
performance for transition state search, accelerated geometry optimization,
zero-point energy corrections, and vibrational analysis benchmarks. We
open-source the HIP codebase and model weights to enable further development of
the direct prediction of Hessians at https://github.com/BurgerAndreas/hip

*Feng Yu,Jia Hu,Geyong Min*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Block Hadamard high-Rank Adaptation (BHRA) enables localized, blockwise, high-rank modulation for PEFT, improving performance under fixed parameter budgets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LoRA's fixed, nominal rank constrains expressive capacity; HiRA's global modulation couples updates to the frozen weights and can cause spectral collapse; ABBA uses dense intermediates; there is a need for resource-efficient, localized rank amplification that handles heterogeneous reasoning transformations.

Method: Partition each weight matrix into blocks and apply HiRA-style multiplicative modulation independently within every block, preserving the PEFT parameter footprint while enabling localized rank growth.

Result: BHRA preserves rich spectra across rank budgets, mitigates spectral collapse from global modulation, and outperforms strong PEFT baselines on eight commonsense reasoning tasks and two arithmetic benchmarks across Llama-3.2 (1B/3B), Mistral-7B, and Gemma-2 (9B).

Conclusion: Blockwise Hadamard modulation offers a practical, parameter-efficient path to higher effective rank in PEFT, enabling localized adaptation and improved reasoning performance without increasing parameter counts.

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods must be resource-efficient yet
handle heterogeneous reasoning transformations, and classical low-rank
adaptation (LoRA) is constrained by the nominal rank $r$. Hadamard-style
extensions like HiRA raise the nominal rank but couple every update to the
global energy pattern of the frozen weight matrix, while ABBA trades this
inductive bias for fully learned dense intermediates. To address the limitation
of global modulation, we propose Block Hadamard high-Rank Adaptation (BHRA),
which partitions each weight matrix and applies HiRA-style multiplicative
modulation independently within every block, preserving the PEFT parameter
footprint while unlocking localized rank amplification. Our empirical analyses
reveal that this blockwise design maintains rich spectra across rank budgets,
mitigating the collapse induced by global modulation. Across eight commonsense
reasoning tasks and two arithmetic benchmarks with Llama-3.2 1B/3B, Mistral-7B,
and Gemma-2 9B, BHRA consistently surpasses strong PEFT baselines under matched
parameter budgets.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper links mask-based pretraining to test risk in high-dimensional minimum-norm regression and introduces R^2MAE, a simple random masking scheme that improves representations across modalities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mask-based pretraining has shown empirical success but its mechanisms and limits are unclear. A regression-theoretic view in a ridge-less, high-dimensional regime can reveal fundamental dynamics guiding representation learning across architectures and tasks.

Method: Develop a theoretical framework that maps mask-based pretraining behavior to test risk in high-dimensional minimum-norm linear models. Validate the theory across MLPs, CNNs, and Transformers on vision and language tasks. Propose R^2MAE, a pretraining scheme that randomly randomizes masks to encourage multi-scale feature capture, and evaluate its performance across vision, language, DNA sequences, and single-cell data.

Result: The theory accounts for observed behavior; R^2MAE outperforms fixed-mask ratios in linear models and beats standard and more complex masking schemes across diverse domains, contributing improvements to state-of-the-art models.

Conclusion: A regression-based lens clarifies mask-based pretraining limits and shows that simple random masking can effectively encourage multi-scale feature learning, with broad applicability.

Abstract: Mask-based pretraining has become a cornerstone of modern large-scale models
across language, vision, and recently biology. Despite its empirical success,
its role and limits in learning data representations have been unclear. In this
work, we show that the behavior of mask-based pretraining can be directly
characterized by test risk in high-dimensional minimum-norm ("ridge-less")
linear regression, without relying on further model specifications. Further
analysis of linear models uncovers several novel aspects of mask-based
pretraining. The theoretical framework and its implications have been validated
across diverse neural architectures (including MLPs, CNNs, and Transformers)
applied to both vision and language tasks. Guided by our theory, we propose an
embarrassingly simple yet overlooked pretraining scheme named Randomly Random
Mask AutoEncoding (R$^2$MAE), which enforces capturing multi-scale features
from data and is able to outperform optimal fixed mask ratio settings in our
linear model framework. We implement R$^2$MAE in vision, language, DNA
sequence, and single-cell models, where it consistently outperforms standard
and more complicated masking schemes, leading to improvements for
state-of-the-art models. Our code is available at:

### [198] [Limitations on Safe, Trusted, Artificial General Intelligence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21654)
*Rina Panigrahy,Vatsal Sharan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Formal definitions of safety, trust, and AGI yield an impossibility: a safe, trusted AI cannot be AGI under these strict criteria. The paper proves that tasks easily solvable by humans may be impossible for such an AI, with demonstrations in verification, planning, and graph reachability, and connects the results to Gödel/Turing limits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To formalize the three notions and assess their compatibility, clarifying theoretical limits for AI safety/trust and AGI, and to ground debates with rigorous definitions.

Method: Define strict mathematical notions of safety, trust, and AGI; prove an impossibility theorem showing that a safe, trusted AI cannot be AGI under these definitions; illustrate with concrete domains (program verification, planning, graph reachability); relate proofs to Gödel’s incompleteness and the halting problem.

Result: There exist task instances that are easily solvable by humans but not by the safe, trusted AI; therefore such a system cannot be AGI under the defined criteria; the authors note that real-world interpretations may differ.

Conclusion: Under strict formal definitions, safety and trust are fundamentally incompatible with AGI; the work highlights foundational limits and suggests caution when mapping these concepts to practice, while acknowledging that practical deployments may adopt alternative interpretations.

Abstract: Safety, trust and Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) are aspirational
goals in artificial intelligence (AI) systems, and there are several informal
interpretations of these notions. In this paper, we propose strict,
mathematical definitions of safety, trust, and AGI, and demonstrate a
fundamental incompatibility between them. We define safety of a system as the
property that it never makes any false claims, trust as the assumption that the
system is safe, and AGI as the property of an AI system always matching or
exceeding human capability. Our core finding is that -- for our formal
definitions of these notions -- a safe and trusted AI system cannot be an AGI
system: for such a safe, trusted system there are task instances which are
easily and provably solvable by a human but not by the system. We note that we
consider strict mathematical definitions of safety and trust, and it is
possible for real-world deployments to instead rely on alternate, practical
interpretations of these notions. We show our results for program verification,
planning, and graph reachability. Our proofs draw parallels to G\"odel's
incompleteness theorems and Turing's proof of the undecidability of the halting
problem, and can be regarded as interpretations of G\"odel's and Turing's
results.

It leverages a new drift–potential freedom in the Fokker-Planck equation and offers Variance- and Energy-Controlling Guidance (VCG/ECG) to keep inference stable with lower variance and better sample quality than baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable scalable, retraining-free adaptation of pre-trained diffusion models to new target distributions at inference time, addressing bias from guidance-based methods and high cost/degeneracy from traditional particle-based corrections.

Method: Introduce DriftLite, a lightweight, training-free particle-based approach that steers inference dynamics by exploiting a degree of freedom in the Fokker-Planck equation between drift and particle potential. Propose two practical instantiations, Variance-Controlling Guidance (VCG) and Energy-Controlling Guidance (ECG), to approximate the optimal drift with minimal overhead.

Result: Across Gaussian mixture models, particle systems, and large-scale protein-ligand co-folding tasks, DriftLite consistently reduces variance and improves sample quality relative to pure guidance and sequential Monte Carlo baselines.

Conclusion: DriftLite provides a principled, efficient route for scalable inference-time adaptation of diffusion models, enabling better sample quality without retraining or heavy computation.

Abstract: We study inference-time scaling for diffusion models, where the goal is to
adapt a pre-trained model to new target distributions without retraining.
Existing guidance-based methods are simple but introduce bias, while
particle-based corrections suffer from weight degeneracy and high computational
cost. We introduce DriftLite, a lightweight, training-free particle-based
approach that steers the inference dynamics on the fly with provably optimal
stability control. DriftLite exploits a previously unexplored degree of freedom
in the Fokker-Planck equation between the drift and particle potential, and
yields two practical instantiations: Variance- and Energy-Controlling Guidance
(VCG/ECG) for approximating the optimal drift with minimal overhead. Across
Gaussian mixture models, particle systems, and large-scale protein-ligand
co-folding problems, DriftLite consistently reduces variance and improves
sample quality over pure guidance and sequential Monte Carlo baselines. These
results highlight a principled, efficient route toward scalable inference-time
adaptation of diffusion models.

### [200] [Differentiable Structure Learning for General Binary Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21658)
*Chang Deng,Bryon Aragam*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A differentiable framework for learning structures among discrete variables that captures arbitrary dependencies, with identifiability up to Markov equivalence, formulated as a single differentiable optimization, and validated empirically.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for differentiable structure learning in discrete data rely on specific structural equation models and often assume linear dependencies, which may not reflect true data-generating processes; this limits applicability and ignores complex dependencies.

Method: Propose a general differentiable framework capable of capturing arbitrary dependencies among discrete variables. Show that, despite unidentifiability of general discrete models from observational data, one can characterize the full set of compatible parameters and structures and establish identifiability up to Markov equivalence under mild assumptions. Formulate learning as a single differentiable optimization task in the most general form, avoiding prior simplifications.

Result: Empirical results demonstrate that the proposed approach effectively captures complex relationships in discrete data.

Conclusion: The framework generalizes differentiable structure learning to arbitrary discrete dependencies, with identifiability up to Markov equivalence under mild conditions, unified into a single optimization objective, and validated empirically.

Abstract: Existing methods for differentiable structure learning in discrete data
typically assume that the data are generated from specific structural equation
models. However, these assumptions may not align with the true data-generating
process, which limits the general applicability of such methods. Furthermore,
current approaches often ignore the complex dependence structure inherent in
discrete data and consider only linear effects. We propose a differentiable
structure learning framework that is capable of capturing arbitrary
dependencies among discrete variables. We show that although general discrete
models are unidentifiable from purely observational data, it is possible to
characterize the complete set of compatible parameters and structures.
Additionally, we establish identifiability up to Markov equivalence under mild
assumptions. We formulate the learning problem as a single differentiable
optimization task in the most general form, thereby avoiding the unrealistic
simplifications adopted by previous methods. Empirical results demonstrate that
our approach effectively captures complex relationships in discrete data.

*Siming Shan,Min Zhu,Youzuo Lin,Lu Lu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PDE inverse problems are hard due to nonlinearity and noise; RED-DiffEq combines physics-informed inversion with pretrained diffusion models to regularize such problems, here applied to seismic full waveform inversion (FWI) to reconstruct subsurface velocity models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address ill-posed, nonlinear PDE-governed inverse problems, especially in geophysics, by leveraging learned priors (diffusion models) to regularize and enhance robustness and generalization beyond traditional physics-only methods.

Method: Integrate pretrained diffusion models as a regularizer within a PDE-governed inversion framework (RED-DiffEq). Apply to full waveform inversion by coupling the diffusion prior with the PDE forward model and an optimization loop to estimate high-resolution subsurface velocity from seismic data; demonstrated robustness and generalization to unseen velocity models.

Result: RED-DiffEq yields higher accuracy and robustness than conventional FWI methods and generalizes well to more complex velocity models not seen during diffusion model training.

Conclusion: A physics-driven, data-driven hybrid framework that uses diffusion priors to regularize PDE inversions, with strong potential for broad applicability to diverse PDE-governed inverse problems, notably seismic imaging.

Abstract: Partial differential equation (PDE)-governed inverse problems are fundamental
across various scientific and engineering applications; yet they face
significant challenges due to nonlinearity, ill-posedness, and sensitivity to
noise. Here, we introduce a new computational framework, RED-DiffEq, by
integrating physics-driven inversion and data-driven learning. RED-DiffEq
leverages pretrained diffusion models as a regularization mechanism for
PDE-governed inverse problems. We apply RED-DiffEq to solve the full waveform
inversion problem in geophysics, a challenging seismic imaging technique that
seeks to reconstruct high-resolution subsurface velocity models from seismic
measurement data. Our method shows enhanced accuracy and robustness compared to
conventional methods. Additionally, it exhibits strong generalization ability
to more complex velocity models that the diffusion model is not trained on. Our
framework can also be directly applied to diverse PDE-governed inverse
problems.

TL;DR: Systematic review of conformal prediction methods for treatment effect estimation; analyzes 11 key papers; maps current state-of-the-art and outlines future research directions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Uncertainty quantification for heterogeneous treatment effect estimates is crucial in high-stakes domains (e.g., healthcare, policy). Conformal prediction offers finite-sample coverage guarantees with minimal assumptions and robustness to distribution shifts, enabling reliable decision-making.

Method: Systematic filtering and analysis of the literature to identify 11 key papers; synthesize theoretical background; characterize current state-of-the-art methods; discuss gaps and propose directions for future work.

Result: Identifies 11 key papers and synthesizes current conformal prediction approaches for treatment effect estimation; provides an organized overview of methods and their applicability, highlighting practical guidance.

Conclusion: Conformal prediction holds strong potential to improve decision-making involving treatment effects in high-stakes settings; the review clarifies the theoretical foundations, catalogues existing methods, and outlines concrete directions for future research.

Abstract: Treatment effect estimation is essential for informed decision-making in many
fields such as healthcare, economics, and public policy. While flexible machine
learning models have been widely applied for estimating heterogeneous treatment
effects, quantifying the inherent uncertainty of their point predictions
remains an issue. Recent advancements in conformal prediction address this
limitation by allowing for inexpensive computation, as well as distribution
shifts, while still providing frequentist, finite-sample coverage guarantees
under minimal assumptions for any point-predictor model. This advancement holds
significant potential for improving decision-making in especially high-stakes
environments. In this work, we perform a systematic review regarding conformal
prediction methods for treatment effect estimation and provide for both the
necessary theoretical background. Through a systematic filtering process, we
select and analyze eleven key papers, identifying and describing current
state-of-the-art methods in this area. Based on our findings, we propose
directions for future research.

*Afrina Tabassum,Bin Guo,Xiyao Ma,Hoda Eldardiry,Ismini Lourentzou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MMPlanner is a zero-shot multimodal procedural planning framework that uses Object State Reasoning Chain-of-Thought (OSR-CoT) prompting to enforce object-state consistency across text and images, paired with LLM-based evaluation and a visual step-reordering task; it achieves state-of-the-art results on RECIPEPLAN and WIKIPLAN, with notable gains in textual planning, cross-modal alignment, and visual ordering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The central challenge in multimodal procedural planning is maintaining consistent object states across textual and visual steps, which existing approaches often neglect. There is a need for explicit state-aware reasoning and robust evaluation of cross-modal alignment.

Method: Introduce MMPlanner with OSR-CoT prompting to model object-state transitions and generate accurate multimodal plans in a zero-shot setting. Propose LLM-as-judge protocols for planning accuracy and cross-modal alignment, plus a visual step-reordering task to measure temporal coherence. Evaluate on RECIPEPLAN and WIKIPLAN.

Result: MMPlanner achieves state-of-the-art performance: textual planning improved by 6.8%, cross-modal alignment by 11.9%, and visual step ordering by 26.7% compared to baselines.

Conclusion: Explicit object-state reasoning and evaluation protocols enable more reliable multimodal procedural planning, with MMPlanner delivering significant gains and establishing a strong benchmark for cross-modal planning tasks.

Abstract: Multimodal Procedural Planning (MPP) aims to generate step-by-step
instructions that combine text and images, with the central challenge of
preserving object-state consistency across modalities while producing
informative plans. Existing approaches often leverage large language models
(LLMs) to refine textual steps; however, visual object-state alignment and
systematic evaluation are largely underexplored. We present MMPlanner, a
zero-shot MPP framework that introduces Object State Reasoning Chain-of-Thought
(OSR-CoT) prompting to explicitly model object-state transitions and generate
accurate multimodal plans. To assess plan quality, we design LLM-as-a-judge
protocols for planning accuracy and cross-modal alignment, and further propose
a visual step-reordering task to measure temporal coherence. Experiments on
RECIPEPLAN and WIKIPLAN show that MMPlanner achieves state-of-the-art
performance, improving textual planning by +6.8%, cross-modal alignment by
+11.9%, and visual step ordering by +26.7%

*Davide Bizzaro,Alessandro Daniele*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A unifying neurosymbolic language (LoH) with a learnable choice operator enables differentiable learning of data-driven rules and symbolic priors, discretizable to Boolean decisions without performance loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge hand-crafted rules and learned symbolic rules in NeSy, enabling flexible, hybrid knowledge integration.

Method: Define Logic of Hypotheses (LoH) that extends propositional logic with a learnable choice operator selecting a subformula from a pool; use Goedel fuzzy logic to compile formulas into differentiable graphs; apply the Goedel trick to discretize to hard Boolean functions without loss; demonstrate subsumption of existing NeSy models and support for arbitrary knowledge specification.

Result: Experiments on tabular data and Visual Tic-Tac-Toe NeSy task show strong performance and interpretable decision rules.

Conclusion: LoH provides a unified framework for NeSy, blending data-driven rule learning with symbolic priors, with tunable knowledge specification and exact discretization.

Abstract: Neurosymbolic integration (NeSy) blends neural-network learning with symbolic
reasoning. The field can be split between methods injecting hand-crafted rules
into neural models, and methods inducing symbolic rules from data. We introduce
Logic of Hypotheses (LoH), a novel language that unifies these strands,
enabling the flexible integration of data-driven rule learning with symbolic
priors and expert knowledge. LoH extends propositional logic syntax with a
choice operator, which has learnable parameters and selects a subformula from a
pool of options. Using fuzzy logic, formulas in LoH can be directly compiled
into a differentiable computational graph, so the optimal choices can be
learned via backpropagation. This framework subsumes some existing NeSy models,
while adding the possibility of arbitrary degrees of knowledge specification.
Moreover, the use of Goedel fuzzy logic and the recently developed Goedel trick
yields models that can be discretized to hard Boolean-valued functions without
any loss in performance. We provide experimental analysis on such models,
showing strong results on tabular data and on the Visual Tic-Tac-Toe NeSy task,
while producing interpretable decision rules.

### [205] [DIM: Enforcing Domain-Informed Monotonicity in Deep Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21666)
*Joshua Salim,Jordan Yu,Xilei Zhao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DIM is a regularization method that enforces domain-informed monotonicity in deep nets to improve generalization, tested on real-world and synthetic data, showing performance gains across architectures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep models often overfit by memorizing training data; incorporating domain-specific monotonic relations can guide learning toward generalizable patterns.

Method: Impose monotonicity by penalizing violations relative to a linear baseline; define a linear reference, measure deviation from monotonic behavior, and integrate this as a regularization term in the training objective within a formal mathematical framework.

Result: Empirical results on a Chicago ridesourcing dataset and synthetic data show that modest monotonicity constraints consistently enhance predictive performance across various neural architectures.

Conclusion: DIM provides a principled way to regularize deep networks by leveraging domain-informed monotonicity, improving generalization without sacrificing predictive power.

Abstract: While deep learning models excel at predictive tasks, they often overfit due
to their complex structure and large number of parameters, causing them to
memorize training data, including noise, rather than learn patterns that
generalize to new data. To tackle this challenge, this paper proposes a new
regularization method, i.e., Enforcing Domain-Informed Monotonicity in Deep
Neural Networks (DIM), which maintains domain-informed monotonic relationships
in complex deep learning models to further improve predictions. Specifically,
our method enforces monotonicity by penalizing violations relative to a linear
baseline, effectively encouraging the model to follow expected trends while
preserving its predictive power. We formalize this approach through a
comprehensive mathematical framework that establishes a linear reference,
measures deviations from monotonic behavior, and integrates these measurements
into the training objective. We test and validate the proposed methodology
using a real-world ridesourcing dataset from Chicago and a synthetically
created dataset. Experiments across various neural network architectures show
that even modest monotonicity constraints consistently enhance model
performance. DIM enhances the predictive performance of deep neural networks by
applying domain-informed monotonicity constraints to regularize model behavior
and mitigate overfitting

*Andrii Zahorodnii,Christopher Wang,Bennett Stankovits,Charikleia Moraitaki,Geeling Chau,Andrei Barbu,Boris Katz,Ila R Fiete*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Neuroprobe is an open benchmark suite for iEEG-based language decoding, enabling neuroscientific insights and model comparison; surprisingly, a simple linear model often outperforms modern foundation models on these tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is no standardized framework for evaluating intracranial EEG-based language models, hindering fair comparisons and progress in iEEG foundation models; high-resolution data (iEEG) offers rich spatiotemporal information for tracking language processing in the brain.

Method: They introduce Neuroprobe, built on BrainTreebank: 40 hours of iEEG from 10 subjects during naturalistic movie viewing; a suite of decoding tasks across modalities to probe language processing; analysis across time and electrode locations to map information flow; open-source code and public leaderboard.

Result: Linear baselines are surprisingly strong and beat frontier foundation models on many tasks; the framework enables efficient learning and robust comparisons.

Conclusion: Neuroprobe provides a rigorous, efficient benchmark and analysis platform for iEEG foundation models, accelerating progress in understanding neural language processing and in developing architecture/training protocols.

Abstract: High-resolution neural datasets enable foundation models for the next
generation of brain-computer interfaces and neurological treatments. The
community requires rigorous benchmarks to discriminate between competing
modeling approaches, yet no standardized evaluation frameworks exist for
intracranial EEG (iEEG) recordings. To address this gap, we present Neuroprobe:
a suite of decoding tasks for studying multi-modal language processing in the
brain. Unlike scalp EEG, intracranial EEG requires invasive surgery to implant
electrodes that record neural activity directly from the brain with minimal
signal distortion. Neuroprobe is built on the BrainTreebank dataset, which
consists of 40 hours of iEEG recordings from 10 human subjects performing a
naturalistic movie viewing task. Neuroprobe serves two critical functions.
First, it is a mine from which neuroscience insights can be drawn. Its high
temporal and spatial resolution allows researchers to systematically determine
when and where computations for each aspect of language processing occur in the
brain by measuring the decodability of each feature across time and all
electrode locations. Using Neuroprobe, we visualize how information flows from
the superior temporal gyrus to the prefrontal cortex, and the progression from
simple auditory features to more complex language features in a purely
data-driven manner. Second, as the field moves toward neural foundation models,
Neuroprobe provides a rigorous framework for comparing competing architectures
and training protocols. We found that the linear baseline is surprisingly
strong, beating frontier foundation models on many tasks. Neuroprobe is
designed with computational efficiency and ease of use in mind. We make the
code for Neuroprobe openly available and maintain a public leaderboard, aiming
to enable rapid progress in the field of iEEG foundation models, at

*Junyong Park,Oron Levy,Rebecca Adaimi,Asaf Liberman,Gierad Laput,Abdelkareem Bedri*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SlotFM is an accelerometer foundation model that generalizes to diverse downstream tasks by using Time-Frequency Slot Attention and two loss regularizers; it shows broad improvement across 16 tasks, outperforming self-supervised baselines on 13 tasks and averaging +4.5% gain.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current foundation models for accelerometer data are mostly tuned to common daily activities, limiting transfer to tasks with different signal characteristics; a generalizable model is needed for broader sensing tasks.

Method: Extend Slot Attention to time-frequency representations of raw accelerometer signals (Time-Frequency Slot Attention). The model uses multiple small embeddings (slots) to capture distinct signal components; task-specific heads attend to relevant slots. Two loss regularizers enforce local structure and frequency pattern preservation to improve reconstruction and maintain task-relevant information.

Result: Evaluated on 16 downstream tasks (classification/regression) beyond standard HAR; outperforms existing SSL approaches on 13 tasks and matches best on the rest; average performance gain of 4.5%.

Conclusion: SlotFM demonstrates strong generalization for sensing foundation models across diverse tasks and suggests time-frequency slot-based representations are effective for accelerometer data.

Abstract: Wearable accelerometers are used for a wide range of applications, such as
gesture recognition, gait analysis, and sports monitoring. Yet most existing
foundation models focus primarily on classifying common daily activities such
as locomotion and exercise, limiting their applicability to the broader range
of tasks that rely on other signal characteristics. We present SlotFM, an
accelerometer foundation model that generalizes across diverse downstream
tasks. SlotFM uses Time-Frequency Slot Attention, an extension of Slot
Attention that processes both time and frequency representations of the raw
signals. It generates multiple small embeddings (slots), each capturing
different signal components, enabling task-specific heads to focus on the most
relevant parts of the data. We also introduce two loss regularizers that
capture local structure and frequency patterns, which improve reconstruction of
fine-grained details and helps the embeddings preserve task-relevant
information. We evaluate SlotFM on 16 classification and regression downstream
tasks that extend beyond standard human activity recognition. It outperforms
existing self-supervised approaches on 13 of these tasks and achieves
comparable results to the best performing approaches on the remaining tasks. On
average, our method yields a 4.5% performance gain, demonstrating strong
generalization for sensing foundation models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A smooth unconstrained reformulation of K-means on a submanifold solved by a second-order cubic-regularized Riemannian Newton method, with product-manifold factorization enabling linear-time subproblems, yielding faster convergence while preserving statistical accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the difficulty of K-means optimization due to combinatorial structure and the limitations of relaxation methods in balancing feasibility and optimality; aim to obtain rigorous second-order guarantees and scalable computation.

Method: Reformulate K-means as a smooth unconstrained optimization on a submanifold and characterize its Riemannian geometry. Solve using a second-order cubic-regularized Riemannian Newton algorithm. Factor the K-means manifold into a product manifold to render each Newton subproblem solvable in linear time.

Result: Numerical experiments show the proposed method converges significantly faster than the state-of-the-art first-order nonnegative low-rank factorization method, while achieving similarly optimal statistical accuracy.

Conclusion: The approach provides a scalable second-order optimization framework for K-means on a geometric manifold, delivering fast convergence without sacrificing statistical performance.

Abstract: Clustering is a hard discrete optimization problem. Nonconvex approaches such
as low-rank semidefinite programming (SDP) have recently demonstrated promising
statistical and local algorithmic guarantees for cluster recovery. Due to the
combinatorial structure of the $K$-means clustering problem, current relaxation
algorithms struggle to balance their constraint feasibility and objective
optimality, presenting tremendous challenges in computing the second-order
critical points with rigorous guarantees. In this paper, we provide a new
formulation of the $K$-means problem as a smooth unconstrained optimization
over a submanifold and characterize its Riemannian structures to allow it to be
solved using a second-order cubic-regularized Riemannian Newton algorithm. By
factorizing the $K$-means manifold into a product manifold, we show how each
Newton subproblem can be solved in linear time. Our numerical experiments show
that the proposed method converges significantly faster than the
state-of-the-art first-order nonnegative low-rank factorization method, while
achieving similarly optimal statistical accuracy.

TL;DR: Prophecy automatically infers formal properties of feed-forward neural networks by mining neuron activation patterns to derive rules that imply desired outputs, enabling explanations, verification, monitoring, and repair, including potential uses with large vision-language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: A large portion of network logic is encoded in inner-layer activations; there is a need for automatic, formalizable explanations and verifiable properties that connect activations to outputs.

Method: Extract rules based on neuron activations (values or on/off) as preconditions that imply a target output property; present architecture and demonstrate on varied models and outputs; apply to formal explanations, compositional verification, runtime monitoring, repair, etc.

Result: Illustrates usage across model types and output properties; provides an overview of applications; presents novel results highlighting potential in the era of large vision-language models.

Conclusion: Prophecy demonstrates that activation-based rule extraction can yield formal properties of neural networks, enabling explanations, verification, and practical deployment, with promising applicability to large models.

Abstract: We present Prophecy, a tool for automatically inferring formal properties of
feed-forward neural networks. Prophecy is based on the observation that a
significant part of the logic of feed-forward networks is captured in the
activation status of the neurons at inner layers. Prophecy works by extracting
rules based on neuron activations (values or on/off statuses) as preconditions
that imply certain desirable output property, e.g., the prediction being a
certain class. These rules represent network properties captured in the hidden
layers that imply the desired output behavior. We present the architecture of
the tool, highlight its features and demonstrate its usage on different types
of models and output properties. We present an overview of its applications,
such as inferring and proving formal explanations of neural networks,
compositional verification, run-time monitoring, repair, and others. We also
show novel results highlighting its potential in the era of large
vision-language models.

*Thomas Walton,Darin Tsui,Aryan Musharaf,Amirali Aghazadeh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SpecMER introduces k-mer guided speculative decoding for protein sequence generation, delivering speedups and improved biological plausibility by leveraging MSAs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autoregressive protein sequence generation has high latency, hindering high-throughput screening. Draft models often ignore structural/functional constraints, producing biologically implausible outputs and shifting sequence distributions away from natural patterns.

Method: SpecMER incorporates biological, structural, and functional priors via k-mer motifs extracted from multiple sequence alignments. It scores candidate sequences in parallel and selects those aligned with known biological patterns, integrating this guidance into speculative decoding.

Result: Achieves 24-32% speedup over standard autoregressive decoding, with higher acceptance rates and improved sequence likelihoods, leading to more plausible protein sequences.

Conclusion: Incorporating biologically informed priors through k-mer guidance enhances both the efficiency and quality of protein sequence generation, making speculative decoding more viable for high-throughput protein design workflows.

Abstract: Autoregressive models have transformed protein engineering by enabling the
generation of novel protein sequences beyond those found in nature. However,
their sequential inference introduces significant latency, limiting their
utility in high-throughput protein screening. Speculative decoding accelerates
generation by employing a lightweight draft model to sample tokens, which a
larger target model then verifies and refines. Yet, in protein sequence
generation, draft models are typically agnostic to the structural and
functional constraints of the target protein, leading to biologically
implausible outputs and a shift in the likelihood distribution of generated
sequences. We introduce SpecMER (Speculative Decoding via k-mer Guidance), a
novel framework that incorporates biological, structural, and functional priors
using k-mer motifs extracted from multiple sequence alignments. By scoring
candidate sequences in parallel and selecting those most consistent with known
biological patterns, SpecMER significantly improves sequence plausibility while
retaining the efficiency of speculative decoding. SpecMER achieves 24-32%
speedup over standard autoregressive decoding, along with higher acceptance
rates and improved sequence likelihoods.

### [211] [Wav2Arrest 2.0: Long-Horizon Cardiac Arrest Prediction with Time-to-Event Modeling, Identity-Invariance, and Pseudo-Lab Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21695)
*Saurabh Kataria,Davood Fattahi,Minxiao Wang,Ran Xiao,Matthew Clark,Timothy Ruchti,Mark Mai,Xiao Hu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PPG-based cardiac arrest (CA) prediction can be improved by time-to-event modeling, identity-deconfounding via an adversarial p-vector, and pseudo-lab value regression; yields 24h AUC 0.78-0.80, outperforming baseline 0.74, especially at longer horizons; PCGrad enables stable multi-task optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The work aims to enhance PPG-only CA systems when downstream labels are scarce, leveraging auxiliary supervision signals and representation deconfounding to prevent memorization of identities.

Method: Three orthogonal improvements: (1) time-to-event modeling (regress onset time or discrete survival); (2) learn CA-focused features by making them patient-identity invariant via adversarial use of a large-scale de-identified biometric p-vector; (3) regression on pseudo-lab values generated by pre-trained estimators to enrich labels in a zero-shot fashion. Additionally, a multi-task formulation with PCGrad is used to address high gradient conflict among losses.

Result: The approach improves 24-hour time-averaged AUC from 0.74 to 0.78-0.80, with stronger gains at longer time horizons and minimal degradation near the event; PCGrad helps mitigate gradient conflicts.

Conclusion: Combining time-to-event supervision, identity deconfounding, and pseudo-lab regression enhances PPG-only CA systems under label scarcity; multi-task optimization with PCGrad stabilizes training and boosts early-warning performance.

Abstract: High-frequency physiological waveform modality offers deep, real-time
insights into patient status. Recently, physiological foundation models based
on Photoplethysmography (PPG), such as PPG-GPT, have been shown to predict
critical events, including Cardiac Arrest (CA). However, their powerful
representation still needs to be leveraged suitably, especially when the
downstream data/label is scarce. We offer three orthogonal improvements to
improve PPG-only CA systems by using minimal auxiliary information. First, we
propose to use time-to-event modeling, either through simple regression to the
event onset time or by pursuing fine-grained discrete survival modeling.
Second, we encourage the model to learn CA-focused features by making them
patient-identity invariant. This is achieved by first training the
largest-scale de-identified biometric identification model, referred to as the
p-vector, and subsequently using it adversarially to deconfound cues, such as
person identity, that may cause overfitting through memorization. Third, we
propose regression on the pseudo-lab values generated by pre-trained auxiliary
estimator networks. This is crucial since true blood lab measurements, such as
lactate, sodium, troponin, and potassium, are collected sparingly. Via
zero-shot prediction, the auxiliary networks can enrich cardiac arrest waveform
labels and generate pseudo-continuous estimates as targets. Our proposals can
independently improve the 24-hour time-averaged AUC from the 0.74 to the
0.78-0.80 range. We primarily improve over longer time horizons with minimal
degradation near the event, thus pushing the Early Warning System research.
Finally, we pursue multi-task formulation and diagnose it with a high gradient
conflict rate among competing losses, which we alleviate via the PCGrad
optimization technique.

*Taiga Kojima,Masayuki Karasuyama*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Exact subgraph enumeration plus neural network learning and sparse regularization yield strong graph-level prediction with interpretability; pruning reduces enumeration cost and highlights important subgraphs, achieving competitive performance with standard GNNs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Graph-level prediction benefits from subgraph structure, but existing methods struggle with leveraging exact subgraph information while maintaining interpretability; EIN aims to integrate exact enumeration with learning and sparsity to balance accuracy and explainability.

Method: Enumerate subgraphs exactly, input their features into a neural network, and apply sparse regularization to select and prune subgraphs, providing interpretability by identifying influential subgraphs while reducing computation.

Result: EIN achieves competitive prediction performance compared with standard graph neural networks and enables post-hoc analysis using the selected subgraphs; the sparse regularization yields an effective pruning strategy that preserves accuracy while mitigating enumeration cost.

Conclusion: EIN demonstrates that integrating exact subgraph enumeration with neural models and sparsity can deliver high discriminative power and interpretability in graph-level prediction, with practical pruning to manage computation.

Abstract: In the graph-level prediction task (predict a label for a given graph), the
information contained in subgraphs of the input graph plays a key role. In this
paper, we propose Exact subgraph Isomorphism Network (EIN), which combines the
exact subgraph enumeration, neural network, and a sparse regularization. In
general, building a graph-level prediction model achieving high discriminative
ability along with interpretability is still a challenging problem. Our
combination of the subgraph enumeration and neural network contributes to high
discriminative ability about the subgraph structure of the input graph.
Further, the sparse regularization in EIN enables us 1) to derive an effective
pruning strategy that mitigates computational difficulty of the enumeration
while maintaining the prediction performance, and 2) to identify important
subgraphs that contributes to high interpretability. We empirically show that
EIN has sufficiently high prediction performance compared with standard graph
neural network models, and also, we show examples of post-hoc analysis based on

*Yuqin Jiang,Andrey A. Popov,Tianle Duan,Qingchun Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A machine learning framework to downscale NYC taxi OD flows across spatial scales, comparing LR, RF, SVM, and NN. NN yields best fit on data; SVM offers the best generalization for downscaling; LR underfits due to nonlinear interactions; perturbation-based sensitivity analysis clarifies variable importance. Practical implications for transportation planning and urban development.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Urban mobility patterns across different spatial scales are crucial for planning. Downscaling OD taxi flows from broad to fine spatial units enables more localized transportation services and urban development insights.

Method: Correlate OD trips with demographic, socioeconomic, and commuting features using four models: Linear Regression (LR), Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Neural Networks (NN). Apply perturbation-based sensitivity analysis to interpret variable importance for nonlinear models.

Result: LR fails to capture complex variable interactions. NN delivers the best performance on training/testing data, while SVM shows the strongest generalization in downscaling tasks.

Conclusion: The framework advances analytical capability and offers practical tools for improving transportation services and urban development through more accurate, scale-aware OD flow downscaling.

Abstract: Understanding urban human mobility patterns at various spatial levels is
essential for social science. This study presents a machine learning framework
to downscale origin-destination (OD) taxi trips flows in New York City from a
larger spatial unit to a smaller spatial unit. First, correlations between OD
trips and demographic, socioeconomic, and commuting characteristics are
developed using four models: Linear Regression (LR), Random Forest (RF),
Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Neural Networks (NN). Second, a
perturbation-based sensitivity analysis is applied to interpret variable
importance for nonlinear models. The results show that the linear regression
model failed to capture the complex variable interactions. While NN performs
best with the training and testing datasets, SVM shows the best generalization
ability in downscaling performance. The methodology presented in this study
provides both analytical advancement and practical applications to improve
transportation services and urban development.

### [214] [PQFed: A Privacy-Preserving Quality-Controlled Federated Learning Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21704)
*Weiqi Yue,Wenbiao Li,Yuzhou Jiang,Anisa Halimi,Roger French,Erman Ayday*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PQFed proposes a privacy-preserving personalized federated learning framework that performs client-specific customization before federation by extracting features, clustering to estimate inter-client similarity, and selecting compatible collaborators. It improves target-client performance, especially with few participants, and outperforms IFCA in low-participation scenarios across CIFAR-10 and MNIST.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Data heterogeneity in federated learning degrades global model performance. The work targets early-stage quality control by tailoring training strategies per client before federated training, aiming to boost personalization while preserving privacy.

Method: Extract representative features from each client's data, apply clustering to estimate inter-client dataset similarity, and use these similarity estimates to select clients with compatible data distributions for collaboration. The approach is evaluated by integrating PQFed with three existing FL algorithms on CIFAR-10 and MNIST.

Result: PQFed consistently improves the target client's model performance, even with a limited number of participants. In low-participation scenarios, PQFed also outperforms a baseline cluster-based algorithm, IFCA, demonstrating scalability and effectiveness of personalized collaboration strategies.

Conclusion:  PQFed offers a scalable, privacy-preserving route to personalized federated learning by front-loading client-specific customization and data-distribution-aware collaboration, improving performance in heterogeneous, low-participation FL settings.

Abstract: Federated learning enables collaborative model training without sharing raw
data, but data heterogeneity consistently challenges the performance of the
global model. Traditional optimization methods often rely on collaborative
global model training involving all clients, followed by local adaptation to
improve individual performance. In this work, we focus on early-stage quality
control and propose PQFed, a novel privacy-preserving personalized federated
learning framework that designs customized training strategies for each client
prior to the federated training process. PQFed extracts representative features
from each client's raw data and applies clustering techniques to estimate
inter-client dataset similarity. Based on these similarity estimates, the
framework implements a client selection strategy that enables each client to
collaborate with others who have compatible data distributions. We evaluate
PQFed on two benchmark datasets, CIFAR-10 and MNIST, integrated with three
existing federated learning algorithms. Experimental results show that PQFed
consistently improves the target client's model performance, even with a
limited number of participants. We further benchmark PQFed against a baseline
cluster-based algorithm, IFCA, and observe that PQFed also achieves better
performance in low-participation scenarios. These findings highlight PQFed's
scalability and effectiveness in personalized federated learning settings.

### [215] [ReLAM: Learning Anticipation Model for Rewarding Visual Robotic Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22402)
*Nan Tang,Jing-Cheng Pang,Guanlin Li,Chao Qian,Yang Yu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ReLAM automatically extracts dense rewards from video demonstrations by learning an anticipation model that proposes keypoint-based subgoals, enabling a structured curriculum and HRL with a provable sub-optimality bound to accelerate visual robotic manipulation learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reward design in visual RL for robotics is hard because precise pose information is often unavailable in real-world settings; dense, task-aligned rewards typically rely on inaccessible geometric cues, hindering sample efficiency and long-horizon performance.

Method: Train an anticipation model as a planner that outputs intermediate keypoint-based subgoals along an optimal path to the final goal. Use these subgoals to generate continuous, dense rewards for a low-level, goal-conditioned policy within a hierarchical RL framework, yielding a structured curriculum and a provable sub-optimality bound.

Result: Empirical results on complex, long-horizon manipulation tasks show accelerated learning and superior performance over state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating the efficacy of ReLAM in deriving geometry-aligned rewards from action-free video demonstrations.

Conclusion: ReLAM provides a practical, theoretically grounded approach to reward design for visual RL in robotics by automatic reward shaping from video, enabling efficient, long-horizon control through HRL with provable guarantees.

Abstract: Reward design remains a critical bottleneck in visual reinforcement learning
(RL) for robotic manipulation. In simulated environments, rewards are
conventionally designed based on the distance to a target position. However,
such precise positional information is often unavailable in real-world visual
settings due to sensory and perceptual limitations. In this study, we propose a
method that implicitly infers spatial distances through keypoints extracted
from images. Building on this, we introduce Reward Learning with Anticipation
Model (ReLAM), a novel framework that automatically generates dense, structured
rewards from action-free video demonstrations. ReLAM first learns an
anticipation model that serves as a planner and proposes intermediate
keypoint-based subgoals on the optimal path to the final goal, creating a
structured learning curriculum directly aligned with the task's geometric
objectives. Based on the anticipated subgoals, a continuous reward signal is
provided to train a low-level, goal-conditioned policy under the hierarchical
reinforcement learning (HRL) framework with provable sub-optimality bound.
Extensive experiments on complex, long-horizon manipulation tasks show that
ReLAM significantly accelerates learning and achieves superior performance
compared to state-of-the-art methods.

*Xavier Gonzalez,E. Kelly Buchanan,Hyun Dong Lee,Jerry Weihong Liu,Ke Alexander Wang,David M. Zoltowski,Christopher Ré,Scott W. Linderman*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A unified linear-dynamical-systems (LDS) perspective explains fixed-point parallelization methods (Newton, Picard, Jacobi) as approximate linearizations of nonlinear recursions, offering a common framework to understand, compare, and guide parallelization of sequential models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of parallelizing seemingly sequential processes in ML and to understand when fixed-point iterations are effective across different schemes, by providing a unifying theory.

Method: Proposes a common framework based on linear dynamical systems (LDSs) in which Newton, Picard, Jacobi and related iterations arise as approximate linearizations of a nonlinear recursion; analyzes how these schemes fit within the same LDS-based interpretation.

Result: Reveals shared principles behind these methods; clarifies the regimes where particular fixed-point methods perform best; demonstrates that diverse algorithms can be bridged under LDS language, strengthening the theoretical foundation for parallelizing sequential models and highlighting opportunities for scalable computation.

Conclusion: The LDS-based framework advances a coherent theoretical foundation for parallelizing sequential models and points toward new opportunities for efficient and scalable computation in machine learning.

Abstract: Harnessing parallelism in seemingly sequential models is a central challenge
for modern machine learning. Several approaches have been proposed for
evaluating sequential processes in parallel using fixed-point methods, like
Newton, Picard, and Jacobi iterations. In this work, we show that these methods
can be understood within a common framework based on linear dynamical systems
(LDSs), where different iteration schemes arise naturally as approximate
linearizations of a nonlinear recursion. This unifying view highlights shared
principles behind these techniques and clarifies when particular fixed-point
methods are most likely to be effective. By bridging diverse algorithms through
the language of LDSs, our framework provides a clearer theoretical foundation
for parallelizing sequential models and points toward new opportunities for
efficient and scalable computation.

### [217] [Information-Theoretic Bayesian Optimization for Bilevel Optimization Problems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21725)
*Takuya Kanayama,Yuki Ito,Tomoyuki Tamura,Masayuki Karasuyama*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a unified information-theoretic Bayesian optimization (BO) framework for bilevel optimization, accounting for information gain from both upper- and lower-level expensive black-box objectives; introduces a tractable lower-bound evaluation and shows empirical gains on benchmark datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bilevel optimization with nested, expensive black-box functions is difficult and under-studied in BO; existing BO extensions (e.g., multi-objective or constrained BO) do not adequately capture the coupled information gain between upper and lower problems. A unified information-theoretic criterion can guide queries to improve both levels.

Method: Develops an information-theoretic acquisition criterion that quantifies information gain about both the upper- and lower-level optima and unifies them into a single criterion. Provides a practical lower-bound-based approach to approximate the information gain, likely using surrogate models (e.g., Gaussian processes) for the expensive functions, enabling tractable computation.

Result: Empirically demonstrates that the proposed criterion improves performance on several benchmark datasets for bilevel BO compared to baselines.

Conclusion: The paper presents a principled, tractable information-theoretic framework for bilevel Bayesian optimization that balances information gathering across both levels and is supported by empirical validation on benchmarks.

Abstract: A bilevel optimization problem consists of two optimization problems nested
as an upper- and a lower-level problem, in which the optimality of the
lower-level problem defines a constraint for the upper-level problem. This
paper considers Bayesian optimization (BO) for the case that both the upper-
and lower-levels involve expensive black-box functions. Because of its nested
structure, bilevel optimization has a complex problem definition and, compared
with other standard extensions of BO such as multi-objective or constraint
settings, it has not been widely studied. We propose an information-theoretic
approach that considers the information gain of both the upper- and
lower-optimal solutions and values. This enables us to define a unified
criterion that measures the benefit for both level problems, simultaneously.
Further, we also show a practical lower bound based approach to evaluating the
information gain. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed
method through several benchmark datasets.

*Houliang Zhou,Rong Zhou,Yangying Liu,Kanhao Zhao,Li Shen,Brian Y. Chen,Yu Zhang,Lifang He,Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: An interpretable spatio-temporal GNN using dual SDEs predicts Alzheimer’s disease (AD) progression from irregularly-sampled longitudinal fMRI, identifying key brain regions and networks and sex-specific biomarkers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Forecasting AD progression is difficult due to complex, dynamic dysfunction across spatio-temporal brain networks; existing methods often overlook these irregularities and interpretability.

Method: Develop a spatio-temporal graph neural network framework that uses dual stochastic differential equations to model irregularly-sampled longitudinal fMRI data, yielding sparse, interpretable regional/connective importance probabilities.

Result: Validated on two independent cohorts (OASIS-3 and ADNI); consistently identified salient regions (parahippocampal cortex, prefrontal cortex, parietal lobule) and disruptions in ventral/dorsal attention and default mode networks; biomarkers correlate with longitudinal clinical symptoms; reveals both established and novel sex-specific neural systems-level biomarkers.

Conclusion: Demonstrates the potential of spatio-temporal GNNs with SDE modeling to enable early, individualized prediction of AD progression from irregularly-sampled imaging data and to provide mechanistic neurobiological insights.

Abstract: Identifying objective neuroimaging biomarkers to forecast Alzheimer's disease
(AD) progression is crucial for timely intervention. However, this task remains
challenging due to the complex dysfunctions in the spatio-temporal
characteristics of underlying brain networks, which are often overlooked by
existing methods. To address these limitations, we develop an interpretable
spatio-temporal graph neural network framework to predict future AD
progression, leveraging dual Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs) to model
the irregularly-sampled longitudinal functional magnetic resonance imaging
(fMRI) data. We validate our approach on two independent cohorts, including the
Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS-3) and the Alzheimer's Disease
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Our framework effectively learns sparse
regional and connective importance probabilities, enabling the identification
of key brain circuit abnormalities associated with disease progression.
Notably, we detect the parahippocampal cortex, prefrontal cortex, and parietal
lobule as salient regions, with significant disruptions in the ventral
attention, dorsal attention, and default mode networks. These abnormalities
correlate strongly with longitudinal AD-related clinical symptoms. Moreover,
our interpretability strategy reveals both established and novel neural
systems-level and sex-specific biomarkers, offering new insights into the
neurobiological mechanisms underlying AD progression. Our findings highlight
the potential of spatio-temporal graph-based learning for early, individualized
prediction of AD progression, even in the context of irregularly-sampled
longitudinal imaging data.

### [219] [POLO: Preference-Guided Multi-Turn Reinforcement Learning for Lead Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21737)
*Ziqing Wang,Yibo Wen,William Pattie,Xiao Luo,Weimin Wu,Jerry Yao-Chieh Hu,Abhishek Pandey,Han Liu,Kaize Ding*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: POLO introduces Preference-Guided Policy Optimization (PGPO) to enable LLMs to learn from full optimization trajectories in lead optimization. It uses trajectory-level optimization and turn-level preference learning to improve sample efficiency, outperforming baselines with limited oracle calls.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Lead optimization faces enormous chemical space and limited oracle evaluations; existing methods underutilize LLMs' in-context learning by treating steps independently. POLO aims to leverage full optimization trajectories to improve sample efficiency.

Method: POLO integrates an LLM-guided multi-turn optimization framework with PGPO, a reinforcement learning algorithm that extracts learning signals at two levels: (1) trajectory-level optimization to reinforce successful strategies across an entire trajectory, and (2) turn-level preference learning to rank intermediate molecules within each trajectory. This enables dense feedback from intermediate evaluations.

Result: On 500 oracle evaluations, POLO achieves 84% average success rate on single-property tasks (about 2.3x better than baselines) and 50% on multi-property tasks, significantly advancing sample-efficient molecular optimization.

Conclusion: POLO substantially improves sample efficiency in molecular optimization by exploiting complete optimization trajectories and dual-level learning signals, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines on both single- and multi-property tasks.

Abstract: Lead optimization in drug discovery requires efficiently navigating vast
chemical space through iterative cycles to enhance molecular properties while
preserving structural similarity to the original lead compound. Despite recent
advances, traditional optimization methods struggle with sample
efficiency-achieving good optimization performance with limited oracle
evaluations. Large Language Models (LLMs) provide a promising approach through
their in-context learning and instruction following capabilities, which align
naturally with these iterative processes. However, existing LLM-based methods
fail to leverage this strength, treating each optimization step independently.
To address this, we present POLO (Preference-guided multi-turn Optimization for
Lead Optimization), which enables LLMs to learn from complete optimization
trajectories rather than isolated steps. At its core, POLO introduces
Preference-Guided Policy Optimization (PGPO), a novel reinforcement learning
algorithm that extracts learning signals at two complementary levels:
trajectory-level optimization reinforces successful strategies, while
turn-level preference learning provides dense comparative feedback by ranking
intermediate molecules within each trajectory. Through this dual-level learning
from intermediate evaluation, POLO achieves superior sample efficiency by fully
exploiting each costly oracle call. Extensive experiments demonstrate that POLO
achieves 84% average success rate on single-property tasks (2.3x better than
baselines) and 50% on multi-property tasks using only 500 oracle evaluations,
significantly advancing the state-of-the-art in sample-efficient molecular
optimization.

*Ciyuan Peng,Nguyen Linh Dan Le,Shan Jin,Dexuan Ding,Shuo Yu,Feng Xia*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: BrainPoG introduces a lightweight brain graph learning model that prunes disease-relevant subgraphs and distills disease-related features to improve efficiency and accuracy in brain disease detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current brain graph learning methods are parameter- and compute-heavy, hindering clinical practicality; there is a need to selectively learn disease-relevant information.

Method: Propose BrainPoG with a two-stage approach: PathoGraph construction via a filter that identifies highly disease-relevant subgraphs to prune the brain graph; a pathological feature distillation module to suppress disease-irrelevant noise and strengthen pathological signals per node in PathoGraph.

Result: Experiments on four benchmark datasets show BrainPoG achieves superior performance and computational efficiency across brain disease detection tasks.

Conclusion: BrainPoG demonstrates that focusing on pathological patterns and distilling relevant features enables efficient, informative brain graph learning with potential real-world clinical applicability.

Abstract: Brain graph learning has demonstrated significant achievements in the fields
of neuroscience and artificial intelligence. However, existing methods struggle
to selectively learn disease-related knowledge, leading to heavy parameters and
computational costs. This challenge diminishes their efficiency, as well as
limits their practicality for real-world clinical applications. To this end, we
propose a lightweight Brain PathoGraph Learning (BrainPoG) model that enables
efficient brain graph learning by pathological pattern filtering and
pathological feature distillation. Specifically, BrainPoG first contains a
filter to extract the pathological pattern formulated by highly
disease-relevant subgraphs, achieving graph pruning and lesion localization. A
PathoGraph is therefore constructed by dropping less disease-relevant subgraphs
from the whole brain graph. Afterwards, a pathological feature distillation
module is designed to reduce disease-irrelevant noise features and enhance
pathological features of each node in the PathoGraph. BrainPoG can exclusively
learn informative disease-related knowledge while avoiding less relevant
information, achieving efficient brain graph learning. Extensive experiments on
four benchmark datasets demonstrate that BrainPoG exhibits superiority in both
model performance and computational efficiency across various brain disease
detection tasks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HyperCore is a robust, adaptive coreset selection method for noisy data that uses per-class hyperspheres and Youden's J statistic to automatically prune mislabeled/ambiguous points, outperforming baselines in noisy or low-data scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In real-world settings, coreset selection faces annotation errors and fixed pruning ratios; there is a need for noise-aware, adaptive pruning that does not require manual hyperparameter tuning.

Method: Train lightweight per-class hypersphere models that embed in-class samples near a center and separate out-of-class samples by distance. Use Youden's J statistic to determine adaptive pruning thresholds for data pruning without hyperparameter search.

Result: HyperCore consistently outperforms state-of-the-art coreset methods, especially under noisy and low-data regimes. It discards mislabeled and ambiguous points, yielding compact yet highly informative subsets suitable for scalable, noise-free learning.

Conclusion: HyperCore offers robust, automatic data pruning in noisy environments, enabling efficient training with high-quality coresets and reducing annotation noise impact.

Abstract: The goal of coreset selection methods is to identify representative subsets
of datasets for efficient model training. Yet, existing methods often ignore
the possibility of annotation errors and require fixed pruning ratios, making
them impractical in real-world settings. We present HyperCore, a robust and
adaptive coreset selection framework designed explicitly for noisy
environments. HyperCore leverages lightweight hypersphere models learned per
class, embedding in-class samples close to a hypersphere center while naturally
segregating out-of-class samples based on their distance. By using Youden's J
statistic, HyperCore can adaptively select pruning thresholds, enabling
automatic, noise-aware data pruning without hyperparameter tuning. Our
experiments reveal that HyperCore consistently surpasses state-of-the-art
coreset selection methods, especially under noisy and low-data regimes.
HyperCore effectively discards mislabeled and ambiguous points, yielding
compact yet highly informative subsets suitable for scalable and noise-free
learning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A training-free coreset method SubZeroCore unifies submodular coverage and density, using a closed-form sampler with one hyperparameter, to match or surpass training-based baselines—especially at high pruning rates—while reducing computation and resisting label noise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current coreset methods rely on expensive training-derived signals (e.g., gradients, forgetting counts) computed over the full dataset, which defeats the purpose of pruning and hampers scalability. A training-free, efficient, and robust alternative is needed.

Method: Introduce SubZeroCore, a single unified objective combining submodular coverage and density. Develop a closed-form sampling strategy that optimally balances these objectives, guided by a single hyperparameter controlling local density coverage. The approach is training-free.

Result: Empirical evaluations show SubZeroCore matches training-based baselines and significantly outperforms them at high pruning rates, while dramatically reducing computational overhead. It also exhibits superior robustness to label noise.

Conclusion: SubZeroCore demonstrates practical effectiveness and scalability for real-world scenarios by delivering competitive performance with much lower overhead and robustness to label noise, enabling efficient, training-free coreset selection.

Abstract: The goal of coreset selection is to identify representative subsets of
datasets for efficient model training. Yet, existing approaches paradoxically
require expensive training-based signals, e.g., gradients, decision boundary
estimates or forgetting counts, computed over the entire dataset prior to
pruning, which undermines their very purpose by requiring training on samples
they aim to avoid. We introduce SubZeroCore, a novel, training-free coreset
selection method that integrates submodular coverage and density into a single,
unified objective. To achieve this, we introduce a sampling strategy based on a
closed-form solution to optimally balance these objectives, guided by a single
hyperparameter that explicitly controls the desired coverage for local density
measures. Despite no training, extensive evaluations show that SubZeroCore
matches training-based baselines and significantly outperforms them at high
pruning rates, while dramatically reducing computational overhead. SubZeroCore
also demonstrates superior robustness to label noise, highlighting its
practical effectiveness and scalability for real-world scenarios.

### [223] [Reparameterizing 4DVAR with neural fields](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21751)
*Jaemin Oh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A neural field reformulation of 4DVAR represents the spatiotemporal state with a neural network, enabling parallel-in-time optimization and reducing reliance on ground-truth data by using physics-informed loss. It improves stability of initial-condition estimates for a 2D Navier–Stokes test case and lowers computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classical 4DVAR is accurate but computationally expensive due to its time-sequential optimization. A continuous, neural-field representation could enable parallel-in-time optimization and better integration of physical constraints, potentially reducing data requirements.

Method: Represent the full spatiotemporal state as a neural network (neural field). Optimize network parameters by a loss that includes data misfit and physics constraints (PDE residuals), thus removing time-sequential dependency and enabling parallel-in-time optimization. Evaluate on 2D incompressible Navier–Stokes with Kolmogorov forcing; compare to baseline 4DVAR.

Result: Compared to baseline 4DVAR, neural reparameterized variants yield more stable initial-condition estimates with fewer spurious oscillations. The framework does not require ground-truth states or reanalysis data, broadening applicability and reducing reliance on reference data. Computational cost is reduced due to parallelization and simpler loss formulation.

Conclusion: Neural field reparameterization of 4DVAR provides a viable, data-efficient alternative that enables parallel-in-time optimization, simplifies implementation via physics-informed loss, and improves stability of recovered initial conditions in a PDE-informed data assimilation setting.

Abstract: Four-dimensional variational data assimilation (4DVAR) is a cornerstone of
numerical weather prediction, but its cost function is difficult to optimize
and computationally intensive. We propose a neural field-based reformulation in
which the full spatiotemporal state is represented as a continuous function
parameterized by a neural network. This reparameterization removes the
time-sequential dependency of classical 4DVAR, enabling parallel-in-time
optimization in parameter space. Physical constraints are incorporated directly
through a physics-informed loss, simplifying implementation and reducing
computational cost. We evaluate the method on the two-dimensional
incompressible Navier--Stokes equations with Kolmogorov forcing. Compared to a
baseline 4DVAR implementation, the neural reparameterized variants produce more
stable initial condition estimates without spurious oscillations. Notably,
unlike most machine learning-based approaches, our framework does not require
access to ground-truth states or reanalysis data, broadening its applicability
to settings with limited reference information.

*Sadman Saumik Islam,Bruna Dalcin Baldasso,Davide Cattaneo,Xianta Jiang,Michelle Ploughman*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: fNIRS-based ML reveals MS-related brain activation during dexterous tasks; deoxygenated Hb patterns, especially in ipsilateral supramarginal/angular gyri and precentral gyrus, differentiate MS from controls and suggest stimulation targets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MS-related hand dexterity issues and cognitive fatigue are often subtle; there is a need for objective biomarkers that link brain activity to fatigue and motor performance to guide therapies.

Method: 15 MS patients (without hand/mobility/cognitive impairment) and 12 matched controls performed single and dual hand dexterity tasks (NHPT with/without ball). fNIRS measured HbO and HbR; a machine learning pipeline (KNN) classified MS vs controls based on brain activation in bilateral prefrontal and sensorimotor cortices; XAI identified influential regions.

Result: KNN accuracy: 75% for single-task and 66.7% for dual-task. HbR levels were stronger predictors than HbO. XAI highlighted ipsilateral supramarginal/angular gyri and precentral gyrus as key regions, with MS showing suppressed activity and slower neurovascular responses.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates nonconventional fNIRS analyses can uncover brain activity biomarkers linked to fatigue and dexterity deficits in MS, offering potential personalized brain stimulation targets for treatment.

Abstract: People with Multiple Sclerosis (MS) complain of problems with hand dexterity
and cognitive fatigue. However, in many cases, impairments are subtle and
difficult to detect. Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) is a
non-invasive neuroimaging technique that measures brain hemodynamic responses
during cognitive or motor tasks. We aimed to detect brain activity biomarkers
that could explain subjective reports of cognitive fatigue while completing
dexterous tasks and provide targets for future brain stimulation treatments. We
recruited 15 people with MS who did not have a hand (Nine Hole Peg Test
[NHPT]), mobility, or cognitive impairment, and 12 age- and sex-matched
controls. Participants completed two types of hand dexterity tasks with their
dominant hand, single task and dual task (NHPT while holding a ball between the
fifth finger and hypothenar eminence of the same hand). We analyzed fNIRS data
(oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin levels) using a machine learning
framework to classify MS patients from controls based on their brain activation
patterns in bilateral prefrontal and sensorimotor cortices. The K-Nearest
Neighbor classifier achieved an accuracy of 75.0% for single manual dexterity
tasks and 66.7% for the more complex dual manual dexterity tasks. Using XAI, we
found that the most important brain regions contributing to the machine
learning model were the supramarginal/angular gyri and the precentral gyrus
(sensory integration and motor regions) of the ipsilateral hemisphere, with
suppressed activity and slower neurovascular response in the MS group. During
both tasks, deoxygenated hemoglobin levels were better predictors than the
conventional measure of oxygenated hemoglobin. This nonconventional method of
fNIRS data analysis revealed novel brain activity biomarkers that can help
develop personalized brain stimulation targets.

### [225] [Beyond Formula Complexity: Effective Information Criterion Improves Performance and Interpretability for Symbolic Regression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21780)
*Zihan Yu,Guanren Wang,Jingtao Ding,Huandong Wang,Yong Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces Effective Information Criterion (EIC) to quantify interpretability of symbolic regression formulas by analyzing internal numerical stability; improves both search-based and generative SR algorithms, with strong agreement to human expert preferences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing symbolic regression optimizes formula size (complexity) as a proxy for interoperability, but ignores internal mathematical structure and numerical stability. Physical formulas tend to be numerically stable under limited precision, suggesting a need for a criterion that captures internal structure rationality.

Method: Define EIC as a measure of a formula's information-processing structure. EIC detects unreasonable structure via loss of significant digits or amplification of rounding noise as data flows through the formula. Apply EIC to (i) search-based SR algorithms to improve Pareto-front performance and reduce irrational structure, and (ii) generative SR algorithms to reduce sample requirements (2–4×). Evaluate agreement with human interpretability judgments.

Result: EIC reveals gaps between the structural rationality of SR-discovered formulas and real-world physical formulas. When combined with SR methods, it improves Pareto-front performance and reduces irrational structures. For generative methods, EIC reduces the needed pre-training samples by 2–4×. Among formulas with similar accuracy and complexity, EIC yields 70.2% agreement with 108 human experts’ interpretability preferences.

Conclusion: EIC provides a practical, human-aligned metric for interpretability in symbolic regression. By assessing internal structure, it guides SR methods toward more physically plausible and interpretable formulas, improving both search-based and generative approaches and aligning with expert judgments.

Abstract: Symbolic regression discovers accurate and interpretable formulas to describe
given data, thereby providing scientific insights for domain experts and
promoting scientific discovery. However, existing symbolic regression methods
often use complexity metrics as a proxy for interoperability, which only
considers the size of the formula but ignores its internal mathematical
structure. Therefore, while they can discover formulas with compact forms, the
discovered formulas often have structures that are difficult to analyze or
interpret mathematically. In this work, inspired by the observation that
physical formulas are typically numerically stable under limited calculation
precision, we propose the Effective Information Criterion (EIC). It treats
formulas as information processing systems with specific internal structures
and identifies the unreasonable structure in them by the loss of significant
digits or the amplification of rounding noise as data flows through the system.
We find that this criterion reveals the gap between the structural rationality
of models discovered by existing symbolic regression algorithms and real-world
physical formulas. Combining EIC with various search-based symbolic regression
algorithms improves their performance on the Pareto frontier and reduces the
irrational structure in the results. Combining EIC with generative-based
algorithms reduces the number of samples required for pre-training, improving
sample efficiency by 2~4 times. Finally, for different formulas with similar
accuracy and complexity, EIC shows a 70.2% agreement with 108 human experts'
preferences for formula interpretability, demonstrating that EIC, by measuring
the unreasonable structures in formulas, actually reflects the formula's

### [226] [FastGRPO: Accelerating Policy Optimization via Concurrency-aware Speculative Decoding and Online Draft Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21792)
*Yizhou Zhang,Ning Lv,Teng Wang,Jisheng Dang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a concurrency-aware speculative decoding framework with online draft learning to accelerate Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) training, achieving end-to-end speedups of 2.35x–2.72x under high-concurrency conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GRPO-based reinforcement learning for LLMs is bottlenecked by the slow autoregressive generation of multiple responses per query, especially under high concurrency. Speculative decoding helps but yields limited speedups in this setting.

Method: Introduce a concurrency-aware speculative decoding framework that adapts drafting and verification strategies in real time based on current concurrency, and an online draft learning module that updates the draft model using feedback from the evolving target model to mitigate distributional drift.

Result: End-to-end speedups of 2.35x to 2.72x across multiple mathematical reasoning datasets and models, outperforming baseline approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively accelerates GRPO training in high-concurrency environments by combining adaptive speculative decoding with online draft adaptation, making GRPO more practical for large-scale LLM optimization.

Abstract: Group relative policy optimization (GRPO) has demonstrated significant
potential in improving the reasoning capabilities of large language models
(LLMs) via reinforcement learning. However, its practical deployment is impeded
by an excessively slow training process, primarily attributed to the
computationally intensive autoregressive generation of multiple responses per
query, which makes the generation phase the primary performance bottleneck.
Although speculative decoding presents a promising direction for acceleration,
its direct application in GRPO achieves limited speedup under high-concurrency
training conditions. To overcome this limitation, we propose a
concurrency-aware speculative decoding framework that dynamically adjusts the
drafting and verification strategy according to real-time concurrency levels,
thereby maximizing the acceleration of the generation process. Furthermore, to
address performance degradation arising from distributional drift between the
evolving target model and the fixed draft model during training, we introduce
an online draft learning mechanism that enables the draft model to continuously
adapt using feedback signals from the target model. Experimental results across
multiple mathematical reasoning datasets and models demonstrate that the
proposed method achieves end-to-end speedups of 2.35x to 2.72x, significantly
surpassing baseline approaches in efficiency. The code is available at

*Kourosh Kakhi,Abbas Khosravi,Roohallah Alizadehsani,U. Rajendra Acharyab*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Multi-signal feature-level fusion using ECG, EMG, EOG, and EEG improves fatigue detection; XGBoost with EMG+EEG yields best results; SHAP highlights ECG-EOG importance; multi-signal models outperform single-signal ones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome single-modality limitations in fatigue detection by leveraging statistical relationships between physiological signals and evaluating fusion strategies to improve robustness, interpretability, and practicality.

Method: Using the DROZY dataset, extract features from ECG, EMG, EOG, EEG across 15 signal combinations. Train and compare Decision Tree, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and XGBoost. Use SHAP for feature importance analysis.

Result: XGBoost with EMG+EEG achieved top performance; SHAP identified ECG-EOG correlation as a key feature; all multi-signal models outperform single-signal baselines.

Conclusion: Feature-level fusion of physiological signals enhances accuracy, interpretability, and practicality of fatigue monitoring systems.

Abstract: Fatigue detection using physiological signals is critical in domains such as
transportation, healthcare, and performance monitoring. While most studies
focus on single modalities, this work examines statistical relationships
between signal pairs to improve classification robustness. Using the DROZY
dataset, we extracted features from ECG, EMG, EOG, and EEG across 15 signal
combinations and evaluated them with Decision Tree, Random Forest, Logistic
Regression, and XGBoost. Results show that XGBoost with the EMG EEG combination
achieved the best performance. SHAP analysis highlighted ECG EOG correlation as
a key feature, and multi signal models consistently outperformed single signal
ones. These findings demonstrate that feature level fusion of physiological
signals enhances accuracy, interpretability, and practical applicability of
fatigue monitoring systems.

### [228] [ChaosNexus: A Foundation Model for Universal Chaotic System Forecasting with Multi-scale Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21802)
*Chang Liu,Bohao Zhao,Jingtao Ding,Yong Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ChaosNexus is a foundation model for chaotic dynamics that achieves strong zero-shot/few-shot generalization across diverse systems via a multi-scale ScaleFormer with Mixture-of-Experts, outperforming baselines on synthetic attractor statistics and competitive weather forecasts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Forecasting chaotic systems is hindered by sensitivity to initial conditions, data scarcity, and poor generalization of system-specific models. A diverse, cross-system pretraining regime could enable zero-shot and few-shot forecasting on unseen chaotic dynamics.

Method: Pretrain ChaosNexus, a multi-scale architecture (ScaleFormer) augmented with Mixture-of-Experts layers, on a diverse corpus of chaotic dynamics. The model captures universal patterns and system-specific behaviors to enable cross-system generalization. Evaluation includes a large synthetic benchmark (9k+ systems) and real-world data (5-day weather), with zero-shot and few-shot assessments.

Result: In synthetic benchmarks, ChaosNexus improves long-term attractor statistics fidelity by >40% over leading baselines. In 5-day weather forecasting, zero-shot mean error is competitive (below 1 degree) and improves with few-shot fine-tuning. Across experiments, cross-system generalization correlates with training-system diversity rather than dataset size, and the model demonstrates strong zero-shot generalization across synthetic and real-world chaotic dynamics.

Conclusion: Diversity of training systems is key to cross-system generalization in scientific foundation models for chaotic dynamics; ScaleFormer with Mixture-of-Experts is an effective architecture for capturing universal dynamics while retaining system-specific nuances.

Abstract: Accurately forecasting chaotic systems, prevalent in domains such as weather
prediction and fluid dynamics, remains a significant scientific challenge. The
inherent sensitivity of these systems to initial conditions, coupled with a
scarcity of observational data, severely constrains traditional modeling
approaches. Since these models are typically trained for a specific system,
they lack the generalization capacity necessary for real-world applications,
which demand robust zero-shot or few-shot forecasting on novel or data-limited
scenarios. To overcome this generalization barrier, we propose ChaosNexus, a
foundation model pre-trained on a diverse corpus of chaotic dynamics.
ChaosNexus employs a novel multi-scale architecture named ScaleFormer augmented
with Mixture-of-Experts layers, to capture both universal patterns and
system-specific behaviors. The model demonstrates state-of-the-art zero-shot
generalization across both synthetic and real-world benchmarks. On a
large-scale testbed comprising over 9,000 synthetic chaotic systems, it
improves the fidelity of long-term attractor statistics by more than 40%
compared to the leading baseline. This robust performance extends to real-world
applications with exceptional data efficiency. For instance, in 5-day global
weather forecasting, ChaosNexus achieves a competitive zero-shot mean error
below 1 degree, a result that further improves with few-shot fine-tuning.
Moreover, experiments on the scaling behavior of ChaosNexus provide a guiding
principle for scientific foundation models: cross-system generalization stems
from the diversity of training systems, rather than sheer data volume.

### [229] [Scaling Laws for Neural Material Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21811)
*Akshay Trikha,Kyle Chu,Advait Gosai,Parker Szachta,Eric Weiner*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper empirically analyzes scaling laws for predicting material properties using transformer and EquiformerV2 models. It shows that predictive loss follows a power-law with respect to key hyperparameters—training data, model size, and compute—described by L = α · N^(-β). It also notes practical training settings and suggests extending the analysis to additional architectures for comparison.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Material property prediction is central to designing batteries, semiconductors, and medical devices. Understanding how data, model capacity, and compute scale performance can guide efficient resource allocation and model design, leveraging parallels with scaling laws in other DL domains.

Method: Train transformer and EquiformerV2 models on material-property tasks (energies, forces, stresses). Systematically vary training data quantity, model size, and compute; fit the observed loss to a power-law L = α · N^(-β). Include command-line controls for epochs, learning rate, and mixed-precision; compare architectures and discuss training settings.

Result: Established empirical scaling laws for the models: predictive loss scales as a power law with respect to each hyperparameter (data, size, compute) via L = α · N^(-β), with α and β as constants. The study provides a framework to forecast performance gains from increasing data, capacity, or compute and notes the potential for extending the analysis to other architectures such as GemNet and fully connected networks.

Conclusion: Scaling laws offer a practical guide for resource planning and model choice in material-property prediction. Future work should explore scaling behavior across additional architectures (e.g., GemNet, FCNs) and possibly different material-property tasks to benchmark how scaling exponents compare across models and domains.

Abstract: Predicting material properties is crucial for designing better batteries,
semiconductors, and medical devices. Deep learning helps scientists quickly
find promising materials by predicting their energy, forces, and stresses.
Companies scale capacities of deep learning models in multiple domains, such as
language modeling, and invest many millions of dollars into such models. Our
team analyzes how scaling training data (giving models more information to
learn from), model sizes (giving models more capacity to learn patterns), and
compute (giving models more computational resources) for neural networks
affects their performance for material property prediction. In particular, we
trained both transformer and EquiformerV2 neural networks to predict material
properties. We find empirical scaling laws for these models: we can predict how
increasing each of the three hyperparameters (training data, model size, and
compute) affects predictive performance. In particular, the loss $L$ can be
measured with a power law relationship $L = \alpha \cdot N^{-\beta}$, where
$\alpha$ and $\beta$ are constants while $N$ is the relevant hyperparameter. We
also incorporate command-line arguments for changing training settings such as
the amount of epochs, maximum learning rate, and whether mixed precision is
enabled. Future work could entail further investigating scaling laws for other
neural network models in this domain, such as GemNet and fully connected
networks, to assess how they compare to the models we trained.

### [230] [Sharpness-Aware Minimization Can Hallucinate Minimizers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21818)
*Chanwoong Park,Uijeong Jang,Ernest K. Ryu,Insoon Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SAM can converge to hallucinated minimizers—points that are not minimizers of the original objective. The paper proves their existence and local convergence under certain conditions, provides empirical evidence of such behavior, and proposes a remedy to avoid these hallucinated minimizers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Although SAM aims to find flatter minimizers for better generalization, it may destabilize the optimization landscape by driving iterates toward points that are not true minima of the original loss. Understanding and mitigating this phenomenon is important for reliable training.

Method: The authors provide theoretical results showing the existence of hallucinated minimizers and establish conditions under which SAM dynamics locally converge to them. They support the theory with empirical experiments demonstrating convergence to hallucinated points, and they propose a simple remedy to prevent or mitigate hallucinations.

Result: Existence of hallucinated minimizers is established; local convergence to such points is characterized under specific conditions; empirical evidence confirms practice of converging to hallucinated points; a remedy is proposed and shown to be effective.

Conclusion: SAM has potential pitfalls despite its empirical success; training can end at non-original minimizers. The proposed remedy offers a practical way to avoid hallucinations, contributing to more robust use of SAM in practice.

Abstract: Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) is a widely used method that steers
training toward flatter minimizers, which typically generalize better. In this
work, however, we show that SAM can converge to hallucinated minimizers --
points that are not minimizers of the original objective. We theoretically
prove the existence of such hallucinated minimizers and establish conditions
for local convergence to them. We further provide empirical evidence
demonstrating that SAM can indeed converge to these points in practice.
Finally, we propose a simple yet effective remedy for avoiding hallucinated
minimizers.

### [231] [Preference-Guided Learning for Sparse-Reward Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21828)
*The Viet Bui,Tien Mai,Hong Thanh Nguyen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A framework for online multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) with sparse rewards that learns implicit reward signals through online inverse preference learning, using a preference-based value-decomposition network to produce global and local rewards, dual advantage streams, and LLM-assisted preference labels; achieves state-of-the-art results on MAMuJoCo and SMACv2.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sparse reward feedback in online MARL severely limits learning efficiency. There is a need for learned reward signals that can guide policy optimization when intermediate rewards are unavailable. The paper combines inverse preference learning with on-policy MARL and leverages language-model-generated preferences to enhance reward estimation.

Method: An implicit multi-agent reward learning module based on a preference-based value-decomposition network that outputs global and local reward signals. These rewards feed dual advantage streams to train a centralized critic and decentralized actors. The framework integrates online inverse preference learning with multi-agent on-policy optimization. Large language models are used to generate preference labels to improve the reward model.

Result: Empirical evaluation on MAMuJoCo and SMACv2 benchmarks shows superior performance over baselines, demonstrating effectiveness in addressing sparse rewards in online MARL.

Conclusion: The proposed integration of online inverse preference learning with MARL and LLM-assisted preference labeling provides a viable solution to sparse-reward online MARL, achieving improved performance and pointing to further exploration in preference quality, scalability, and real-world applicability.

Abstract: We study the problem of online multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) in
environments with sparse rewards, where reward feedback is not provided at each
interaction but only revealed at the end of a trajectory. This setting, though
realistic, presents a fundamental challenge: the lack of intermediate rewards
hinders standard MARL algorithms from effectively guiding policy learning. To
address this issue, we propose a novel framework that integrates online inverse
preference learning with multi-agent on-policy optimization into a unified
architecture. At its core, our approach introduces an implicit multi-agent
reward learning model, built upon a preference-based value-decomposition
network, which produces both global and local reward signals. These signals are
further used to construct dual advantage streams, enabling differentiated
learning targets for the centralized critic and decentralized actors. In
addition, we demonstrate how large language models (LLMs) can be leveraged to
provide preference labels that enhance the quality of the learned reward model.
Empirical evaluations on state-of-the-art benchmarks, including MAMuJoCo and
SMACv2, show that our method achieves superior performance compared to existing
baselines, highlighting its effectiveness in addressing sparse-reward
challenges in online MARL.

### [232] [On the Complexity Theory of Masked Discrete Diffusion: From $\mathrm{poly}(1/ε)$ to Nearly $ε$-Free](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21835)
*Xunpeng Huang,Yingyu Lin,Nishant Jain,Kaibo Wang,Difan Zou,Yian Ma,Tong Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Masked discrete diffusion can be analyzed rigorously: Euler samplers reach ε-TV in O(d^2 ε^−3/2) score evaluations, and the MATU approach achieves nearly ε-free complexity O(d log d (1−ε^2)), outperforming uniform diffusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a gap in theoretical understanding of masked discrete diffusion for text generation, especially in high dimensions. Prior work largely analyzes uniform diffusion or uses restrictive assumptions (e.g., bounded scores) or ignores practical samplers like Euler methods, leaving unclear the practical advantages of masking.

Method: First, analyze Euler samplers in masked diffusion to establish ε-accuracy in total variation with O(d^2 ε^−3/2) discrete score evaluations. Then, propose Mask-Aware Truncated Uniformization (MATU) to avoid bounded-score assumptions while preserving unbiased score estimates, exploiting that each token can be unmasked at most once to achieve a complexity of O(d log d (1−ε^2)).

Result: Euler samplers yield ε-accurate TV with ∼O(d^2 ε^−3/2) score evaluations. MATU removes bounded-score requirements and maintains unbiased score approximation, achieving a nearly ε-free complexity of ∼O(d log d (1−ε^2)), surpassing uniformization methods under uniform diffusion.

Conclusion: The work provides a rigorous theoretical foundation for masked discrete diffusion, demonstrating practical advantages over uniform diffusion for text generation and laying groundwork for analyzing diffusion-based language models under masking.

Abstract: We study masked discrete diffusion -- a flexible paradigm for text generation
in which tokens are progressively corrupted by special mask symbols before
being denoised. Although this approach has demonstrated strong empirical
performance, its theoretical complexity in high-dimensional settings remains
insufficiently understood. Existing analyses largely focus on uniform discrete
diffusion, and more recent attempts addressing masked diffusion either (1)
overlook widely used Euler samplers, (2) impose restrictive bounded-score
assumptions, or (3) fail to showcase the advantages of masked discrete
diffusion over its uniform counterpart. To address this gap, we show that Euler
samplers can achieve $\epsilon$-accuracy in total variation (TV) with
$\tilde{O}(d^{2}\epsilon^{-3/2})$ discrete score evaluations, thereby providing
the first rigorous analysis of typical Euler sampler in masked discrete
diffusion. We then propose a Mask-Aware Truncated Uniformization (MATU)
approach that both removes bounded-score assumptions and preserves unbiased
discrete score approximation. By exploiting the property that each token can be
unmasked at most once, MATU attains a nearly $\epsilon$-free complexity of
$O(d\,\ln d\cdot (1-\epsilon^2))$. This result surpasses existing
uniformization methods under uniform discrete diffusion, eliminating the
$\ln(1/\epsilon)$ factor and substantially speeding up convergence. Our
findings not only provide a rigorous theoretical foundation for masked discrete
diffusion, showcasing its practical advantages over uniform diffusion for text
generation, but also pave the way for future efforts to analyze diffusion-based
language models developed under masking paradigm.

### [233] [Beyond Johnson-Lindenstrauss: Uniform Bounds for Sketched Bilinear Forms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21847)
*Rohan Deb,Qiaobo Li,Mayank Shrivastava,Arindam Banerjee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Presents a unified framework for analyzing sketched bilinear forms using generic chaining, yielding uniform bounds governed by geometric complexity, handling sums of independent sketches with sqrt(T) scaling, and unifying/J-L and RIP-type guarantees. Applications include improved convergence in sketched Federated Learning and sharper regret for sketched bandit algorithms, all with geometry-driven error rather than ambient dimension.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need for sharp, uniform control of sketched bilinear forms in ML and randomized algorithms. Existing results (like J-L, RIP, and sketching error bounds) cover specific cases or rely on ambient dimension. The paper seeks a general framework that yields tight bounds for general sets and cross-terms, enabling stronger guarantees in areas such as federated learning and bandits.

Method: Develop a general analytic framework based on generic chaining to bound suprema over pairs of sets involved in sketched bilinear forms. Introduce new techniques for handling cross terms and extend to sums of T independent sketching matrices, showing deviation scales as sqrt(T). Demonstrate how the framework recovers known results (J-L, RIP) as special cases and apply it to practical algorithms.

Result: Derives uniform bounds on sketched bilinear forms in terms of geometric complexities of the involved sets. Proves that the deviation for a sum of T independent sketching matrices scales as sqrt(T). Recovers Johnson-Lindenstrauss and RIP-type guarantees as special cases. Provides improved convergence bounds for sketched Federated Learning and enables sketched variants of bandit algorithms with regret bounds that depend on geometry rather than ambient dimension.

Conclusion: The work offers a unified, geometry-driven framework for sketched bilinear analyses, extending classical results and enabling sharper guarantees for modern sketching-based methods in ML and optimization. It highlights the central role of geometric complexity and generic chaining in understanding sketch-induced deviations.

Abstract: Uniform bounds on sketched inner products of vectors or matrices underpin
several important computational and statistical results in machine learning and
randomized algorithms, including the Johnson-Lindenstrauss (J-L) lemma, the
Restricted Isometry Property (RIP), randomized sketching, and approximate
linear algebra. However, many modern analyses involve *sketched bilinear
forms*, for which existing uniform bounds either do not apply or are not sharp
on general sets. In this work, we develop a general framework to analyze such
sketched bilinear forms and derive uniform bounds in terms of geometric
complexities of the associated sets. Our approach relies on generic chaining
and introduces new techniques for handling suprema over pairs of sets. We
further extend these results to the setting where the bilinear form involves a
sum of $T$ independent sketching matrices and show that the deviation scales as
$\sqrt{T}$. This unified analysis recovers known results such as the J-L lemma
as special cases, while extending RIP-type guarantees. Additionally, we obtain
improved convergence bounds for sketched Federated Learning algorithms where
such cross terms arise naturally due to sketched gradient compression, and
design sketched variants of bandit algorithms with sharper regret bounds that
depend on the geometric complexity of the action and parameter sets, rather
than the ambient dimension.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A principled, compression-based framework for model-agnostic long-context modeling, using a dynamic Graph of Agents to optimize input-dependent collaboration, yielding substantial performance gains on long-context document QA.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current model-agnostic long-context approaches rely on hand-crafted collaboration strategies and prompt engineering, limiting generalization. A principled, generalizable framework is needed to maximize information efficiency in long-context tasks.

Method: Formalize long-context modeling as an information-theoretic compression objective and introduce Graph of Agents (GoA), which dynamically builds an input-dependent collaboration graph to maximize the objective; evaluated on Llama 3.1 8B and Qwen3 8B across six document QA benchmarks.

Result: GoA improves average F1 by 5.7% over a baseline and by 16.35% over a strong multi-agent baseline with fixed collaboration; with only a 2K context window, GoA outperforms a 128K-context Llama 3.1 8B on LongBench.

Conclusion: GoA provides a principled, scalable, model-agnostic approach for long-context tasks, achieving notable gains and enabling larger effective context; source code is available at the provided GitHub link.

Abstract: As a model-agnostic approach to long context modeling, multi-agent systems
can process inputs longer than a large language model's context window without
retraining or architectural modifications. However, their performance often
heavily relies on hand-crafted multi-agent collaboration strategies and prompt
engineering, which limit generalizability. In this work, we introduce a
principled framework that formalizes the model-agnostic long context modeling
problem as a compression problem, yielding an information-theoretic compression
objective. Building on this framework, we propose Graph of Agents (GoA), which
dynamically constructs an input-dependent collaboration structure that
maximizes this objective. For Llama 3.1 8B and Qwen3 8B across six document
question answering benchmarks, GoA improves the average $F_1$ score of
retrieval-augmented generation by 5.7\% and a strong multi-agent baseline using
a fixed collaboration structure by 16.35\%, respectively. Even with only a 2K
context window, GoA surpasses the 128K context window Llama 3.1 8B on
LongBench, showing a dramatic increase in effective context length. Our source

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MolSpectLLM is a molecular foundation model that unifies experimental spectroscopy with 3D molecular structure, achieving state-of-the-art results on spectrum-related tasks and enabling 3D structure generation from SMILES or spectra.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current SMILES-centric models miss critical information from experimental spectra and 3D geometry, limiting performance on tasks involving stereochemistry, conformation, and experimental validation. Integrating spectroscopy and 3D structure should enhance molecular understanding and design.

Method: Pretrain MolSpectLLM on the Qwen2.5-7B foundation model. The model explicitly models molecular spectra (NMR, IR, MS) and 3D structures, enabling spectrum prediction, spectra-to-SMILES translation, and direct 3D structure generation from SMILES or spectra, bridging spectral analysis, elucidation, and design.

Result: State-of-the-art performance on spectrum-related tasks with an average accuracy of 0.53 across NMR, IR, and MS benchmarks. In spectra-to-SMILES, 15.5% sequence accuracy and 41.7% token accuracy. Additionally, it can generate accurate 3D molecular structures directly from SMILES or spectral inputs.

Conclusion: MolSpectLLM bridges spectral analysis, molecular elucidation, and molecular design, improving handling of stereochemistry and experimental validation, with potential impact on drug discovery, reaction prediction, and molecular design workflows.

Abstract: Recent advances in molecular foundation models have shown impressive
performance in molecular property prediction and de novo molecular design, with
promising applications in areas such as drug discovery and reaction prediction.
Nevertheless, most existing approaches rely exclusively on SMILES
representations and overlook both experimental spectra and 3D structural
information-two indispensable sources for capturing molecular behavior in
real-world scenarios. This limitation reduces their effectiveness in tasks
where stereochemistry, spatial conformation, and experimental validation are
critical. To overcome these challenges, we propose MolSpectLLM, a molecular
foundation model pretrained on Qwen2.5-7B that unifies experimental
spectroscopy with molecular 3D structure. By explicitly modeling molecular
spectra, MolSpectLLM achieves state-of-the-art performance on spectrum-related
tasks, with an average accuracy of 0.53 across NMR, IR, and MS benchmarks.
MolSpectLLM also shows strong performance on the spectra analysis task,
obtaining 15.5% sequence accuracy and 41.7% token accuracy on
Spectra-to-SMILES, substantially outperforming large general-purpose LLMs. More
importantly, MolSpectLLM not only achieves strong performance on molecular
elucidation tasks, but also generates accurate 3D molecular structures directly
from SMILES or spectral inputs, bridging spectral analysis, molecular
elucidation, and molecular design.

*Seong-Woong Shim,Myunsoo Kim,Jae Hyeon Cho,Byung-Jun Lee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LDAR learns a distraction-aware retriever to selectively retrieve passages, outperforming long-context-only methods with fewer tokens.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RAG grounds LLMs with external info, but using full documents as context is increasingly feasible with large context windows yet has drawbacks: token inefficiency, lost-in-the-middle risk, and distraction under limited model capacity. An adaptive strategy to balance coverage and distraction is needed.

Method: Propose LDAR, an adaptive retriever trained to minimize interference from distracting passages while preserving information coverage. Evaluated across multiple LLMs and six knowledge-intensive benchmarks showing robustness.

Result: LDAR yields significantly higher performance with reduced token usage compared to long-context approaches, across diverse architectures and six benchmarks.

Conclusion: Balancing information coverage with distraction is crucial; a distraction-aware retrieval strategy can outperform naive long-context feeding, enabling efficient, high-quality knowledge-intensive reasoning.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a framework for grounding Large
Language Models (LLMs) in external, up-to-date information. However, recent
advancements in context window size allow LLMs to process inputs of up to 128K
tokens or more, offering an alternative strategy: supplying the full document
context directly to the model, rather than relying on RAG to retrieve a subset
of contexts. Nevertheless, this emerging alternative strategy has notable
limitations: (i) it is token-inefficient to handle large and potentially
redundant contexts; (ii) it exacerbates the `lost in the middle' phenomenon;
and (iii) under limited model capacity, it amplifies distraction, ultimately
degrading LLM output quality. In this paper, we propose LDAR (Learning
Distraction-Aware Retrieval), an adaptive retriever that learns to retrieve
contexts in a way that mitigates interference from distracting passages,
thereby achieving significantly higher performance with reduced token usage
compared to long-context approaches. Extensive experiments across diverse LLM
architectures and six knowledge-intensive benchmarks demonstrate the
effectiveness and robustness of our approach, highlighting the importance of
balancing the trade-off between information coverage and distraction.

*Yifei Peng,Yaoli Liu,Enbo Xia,Yu Jin,Wang-Zhou Dai,Zhong Ren,Yao-Xiang Ding,Kun Zhou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ILP-CoT combines Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) and Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) to perform abductive logical rule induction from few unstructured inputs by using MLLMs to propose rule structures and ILP to deduce rectified facts and formal rules, with pruned search spaces and evaluation on logical induction benchmarks; potential for text-to-image rule-guided generation; code released.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation:  ILP struggles with requiring extensive background knowledge and high computational cost, while MLLMs suffer from perceptual hallucinations. The paper proposes a hybrid approach that leverages MLLMs to propose likely rule structures (even under hallucinations) and uses ILP to ground and refine those rules, aiming for efficient, interpretable rule induction from limited data.

Method:  Build ILP tasks with search spaces pruned using rule-structure proposals from MLLMs. Use an ILP system to output rules built upon rectified logical facts and formal inductive reasoning, enabling abductive inference from small numbers of textual or visual inputs. Verify on challenging logical induction benchmarks and demonstrate a potential application in text-to-image customized generation. Code and data released.

Result:  Demonstrates effectiveness on challenging logical induction benchmarks and shows potential application in text-to-image customized generation with rule induction.

Conclusion:  ILP-CoT presents a viable hybrid framework that combines the strengths of MLLMs for proposing plausible rule structures with ILP’s rigorous deductive grounding to perform abductive rule induction from limited, multimodal inputs. This approach can extend structured knowledge extraction and controllable generation, with future work likely exploring scalability, robustness of MLLM proposals, and broader applications.

Abstract: We propose ILP-CoT, a method that bridges Inductive Logic Programming (ILP)
and Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for abductive logical rule
induction. The task involves both discovering logical facts and inducing
logical rules from a small number of unstructured textual or visual inputs,
which still remain challenging when solely relying on ILP, due to the
requirement of specified background knowledge and high computational cost, or
MLLMs, due to the appearance of perceptual hallucinations. Based on the key
observation that MLLMs could propose structure-correct rules even under
hallucinations, our approach automatically builds ILP tasks with pruned search
spaces based on the rule structure proposals from MLLMs, and utilizes ILP
system to output rules built upon rectified logical facts and formal inductive
reasoning. Its effectiveness is verified through challenging logical induction
benchmarks, as well as a potential application of our approach, namely
text-to-image customized generation with rule induction. Our code and data are
released at https://github.com/future-item/ILP-CoT.

TL;DR: Zubov-Net provides an adaptive stability framework for Neural ODEs by aligning regions of attraction (RoAs) with prescribed RoAs (PRoAs) to balance robustness and accuracy. It uses tripartite losses, boundary sampling, and an input-attention convex network, with theoretical guarantees and empirical robustness gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neural ODEs have intrinsic robustness due to their dynamical nature, but imposing Lyapunov-based stability often trades off accuracy. This work reframes Zubov's equation to actively shape RoAs via PRoAs, enabling a controllable balance between robustness and accuracy.

Method: Reformulate Zubov's equation as a consistency condition between RoAs and PRoAs. Optimize PRoAs to balance accuracy and robustness. Use tripartite losses (consistency, classification, separation) and a parallel boundary sampling algorithm to co-train the Neural ODE and the Lyapunov function. Employ an input-attention-based convex neural network with softmax attention to emphasize equilibrium-relevant features and normalize weights for stability. Provide theoretical guarantees: tripartite loss ensures PRoA-RoA alignment, trajectory stability, and non-overlapping PRoAs; stochastic convex separability with improved bounds and lower dimensionality requirements.

Result: The framework yields consistent alignment of RoAs and PRoAs, guarantees trajectory stability and non-overlapping PRoAs, and achieves improved robustness against stochastic noises and adversarial attacks while maintaining high classification accuracy.

Conclusion: Zubov-Net offers a principled, scalable approach to jointly learn neural dynamics and Lyapunov-based stability, enabling controllable RoA geometry to trade off robustness and accuracy. With theoretical guarantees and empirical robustness gains, it advances robust Neural ODE design and can extend to broader stable learning settings.

Abstract: Despite neural ordinary differential equations (Neural ODEs) exhibiting
intrinsic robustness under input perturbations due to their dynamical systems
nature, recent approaches often involve imposing Lyapunov-based stability
conditions to provide formal robustness guarantees. However, a fundamental
challenge remains: the tension between robustness and accuracy, primarily
stemming from the difficulty in imposing appropriate stability conditions. To
address this, we propose an adaptive stable learning framework named Zubov-Net,
which innovatively reformulates Zubov's equation into a consistency
characterization between regions of attraction (RoAs) and prescribed RoAs
(PRoAs). Building on this consistency, we introduce a new paradigm for actively
controlling the geometry of RoAs by directly optimizing PRoAs to reconcile
accuracy and robustness. Our approach is realized through tripartite losses
(consistency, classification, and separation losses) and a parallel boundary
sampling algorithm that co-optimizes the Neural ODE and the Lyapunov function.
To enhance the discriminativity of Lyapunov functions, we design an
input-attention-based convex neural network via a softmax attention mechanism
that focuses on equilibrium-relevant features and also serves as weight
normalization to maintain training stability in deep architectures.
Theoretically, we prove that minimizing the tripartite loss guarantees
consistent alignment of PRoAs-RoAs, trajectory stability, and non-overlapping
PRoAs. Moreover, we establish stochastic convex separability with tighter
probability bounds and fewer dimensionality requirements to justify the convex
design in Lyapunov functions. Experimentally, Zubov-Net maintains high
classification accuracy while significantly improving robustness against
various stochastic noises and adversarial attacks.

TL;DR: RLVR gains persist under strict parity-controlled evaluation but are inflated by contamination, evaluation pitfalls, and data leakage. A tax-aware, standardized evaluation protocol reduces these biases, yields more reliable reasoning gains, and can revise prior conclusions. Overall RLVR is valuable but requires rigorous measurement and provenance checks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To answer whether reported RLVR gains survive parity-controlled evaluation and whether RLVR is cost-free or imposes a measurable tax. The paper identifies three bias forces—an RLVR tax, evaluation pitfalls, and data contamination—and aims to quantify their impact and propose reliable evaluation protocols.

Method: - Partial-prompt contamination audit to detect data leakage. - Matched-budget reproductions comparing base and RL models under parity constraints. - Development of a tax-aware training/evaluation protocol that co-optimizes accuracy, grounding, and calibrated abstention. - Standardization of budgeting and provenance checks.

Result: Across clean, parity-controlled evaluations, several headline gaps shrink or vanish. The refined protocol yields more reliable estimates of reasoning gains, and in some cases reverses prior conclusions drawn from noisier evaluations.

Conclusion: RLVR is valuable and industry-ready, but requires reliability-focused practices. Adopting the tax-aware, provenance-conscious evaluation protocol can preserve practical gains while improving safety and measurement quality.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) is a practical and
scalable approach to enhancing large language models in areas such as math,
code, and other structured tasks. Two questions motivate this paper: how much
of the reported gains survive under strictly parity-controlled evaluation, and
whether RLVR is cost-free or exacts a measurable tax. We argue that progress is
real, but gains are often overstated due to three forces - an RLVR tax,
evaluation pitfalls, and data contamination. Using a partial-prompt
contamination audit and matched-budget reproductions across base and RL models,
we show that several headline gaps shrink or vanish under clean,
parity-controlled evaluation. We then propose a tax-aware training and
evaluation protocol that co-optimizes accuracy, grounding, and calibrated
abstention and standardizes budgeting and provenance checks. Applied to recent
RLVR setups, this protocol yields more reliable estimates of reasoning gains
and, in several cases, revises prior conclusions. Our position is constructive:
RLVR is valuable and industry-ready; we advocate keeping its practical benefits
while prioritizing reliability, safety, and measurement.

TL;DR: New Rademacher complexity bound for deep nets using Koopman operators, group representations, and RKHSs; explains why high-rank weight matrices generalize well; extends bounds to broader model classes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of existing Rademacher bounds that apply only to restricted model families and provide a bound for more realistic deep networks by leveraging Koopman representations and RKHS.

Method: Introduce an algebraic representation of neural networks and design a kernel function to construct an RKHS; derive a Rademacher complexity bound within the Koopman/group/RKHS framework.

Result: Proposes a new bound applicable to a wider range of models and offers an explanation for the generalization of high-rank weight matrices; establishes a Koopman-based approach for Rademacher bounds.

Conclusion: Koopman-based Rademacher bounds can be extended to practical neural networks via an algebraic representation and RKHS kernels, enabling broader applicability of the theory.

Abstract: We derive a new Rademacher complexity bound for deep neural networks using
Koopman operators, group representations, and reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces
(RKHSs). The proposed bound describes why the models with high-rank weight
matrices generalize well. Although there are existing bounds that attempt to
describe this phenomenon, these existing bounds can be applied to limited types
of models. We introduce an algebraic representation of neural networks and a
kernel function to construct an RKHS to derive a bound for a wider range of
realistic models. This work paves the way for the Koopman-based theory for
Rademacher complexity bounds to be valid for more practical situations.

*Zihuan Qiu,Yi Xu,Fanman Meng,Runtong Zhang,Linfeng Xu,Qingbo Wu,Hongliang Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: IVT is a plug-and-play framework for Class Incremental Learning that preserves low-loss linear connectivity to previous-task optima by periodically teleporting model parameters to transformed solutions derived from diagonal Fisher information, boosting accuracy and reducing forgetting across standard benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current CIL methods lag behind oracle models with full historical data. Insights from Linear Mode Connectivity show oracle solutions maintain low-loss linear connections to past task optima, suggesting a geometric strategy to mitigate forgetting.

Method: Increment Vector Transformation (IVT) periodically teleports the model to transformed solutions that preserve linear connectivity to the previous task optimum. The transformation is efficiently approximated with diagonal Fisher Information matrices, enabling exemplar-free and exemplar-based settings and compatibility with various initializations; IVT is a plug-and-play module.

Result: Empirical gains include CIFAR-100: last accuracy +5.12% and forgetting -2.54% over PASS; FGVCAircraft (CLIP-pretrained SLCA): average accuracy +14.93% and last accuracy +21.95%; validated on CIFAR-100, FGVCAircraft, ImageNet-Subset, and ImageNet-Full, with code to be released.

Conclusion: IVT effectively mitigates forgetting by leveraging geometry of LMC in CIL, offering a practical, efficient, and broadly compatible approach that consistently improves strong baselines.

Abstract: Class Incremental Learning (CIL) aims to sequentially acquire knowledge of
new classes without forgetting previously learned ones. Despite recent
progress, current CIL methods still exhibit significant performance gaps
compared to their oracle counterparts-models trained with full access to
historical data. Inspired by recent insights on Linear Mode Connectivity (LMC),
we revisit the geometric properties of oracle solutions in CIL and uncover a
fundamental observation: these oracle solutions typically maintain low-loss
linear connections to the optimum of previous tasks. Motivated by this finding,
we propose Increment Vector Transformation (IVT), a novel plug-and-play
framework designed to mitigate catastrophic forgetting during training. Rather
than directly following CIL updates, IVT periodically teleports the model
parameters to transformed solutions that preserve linear connectivity to
previous task optimum. By maintaining low-loss along these connecting paths,
IVT effectively ensures stable performance on previously learned tasks. The
transformation is efficiently approximated using diagonal Fisher Information
Matrices, making IVT suitable for both exemplar-free and exemplar-based
scenarios, and compatible with various initialization strategies. Extensive
experiments on CIFAR-100, FGVCAircraft, ImageNet-Subset, and ImageNet-Full
demonstrate that IVT consistently enhances the performance of strong CIL
baselines. Specifically, on CIFAR-100, IVT improves the last accuracy of the
PASS baseline by +5.12% and reduces forgetting by 2.54%. For the
CLIP-pre-trained SLCA baseline on FGVCAircraft, IVT yields gains of +14.93% in
average accuracy and +21.95% in last accuracy. The code will be released.

*Zhengyan Wan,Yidong Ouyang,Liyan Xie,Fang Fang,Hongyuan Zha,Guang Cheng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A new discrete-guidance framework for posterior sampling derives exact transition rates from a learned discrete flow-matching model, enabling single-pass sampling per step, improving efficiency and unifying previous guidance approaches; applicable to masked diffusion and demonstrated on energy-guided simulations and multimodal tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Discrete data sampling in diffusion-like models relies on first-order Taylor approximations, which are inaccurate in discrete state spaces and lead to inefficient or biased sampling. An exact transition-rate-guided approach could improve fidelity and efficiency.

Method: Derive the exact transition rate for the desired distribution given a learned discrete flow-matching model. This yields guidance that requires only a single forward pass per sampling step. The framework is general enough to subsume existing guidance methods as special cases and can be applied to masked diffusion models.

Result: Demonstrates effectiveness on energy-guided simulations and preference alignment in text-to-image generation and multimodal understanding tasks; code released at the provided repository.

Conclusion: The proposed discrete guidance framework is general, efficient, and unifies prior guidance methods, with broad applicability to discrete generative modeling and diffusion-like processes.

Abstract: Guidance provides a simple and effective framework for posterior sampling by
steering the generation process towards the desired distribution. When modeling
discrete data, existing approaches mostly focus on guidance with the
first-order Taylor approximation to improve the sampling efficiency. However,
such an approximation is inappropriate in discrete state spaces since the
approximation error could be large. A novel guidance framework for discrete
data is proposed to address this problem: We derive the exact transition rate
for the desired distribution given a learned discrete flow matching model,
leading to guidance that only requires a single forward pass in each sampling
step, significantly improving efficiency. This unified novel framework is
general enough, encompassing existing guidance methods as special cases, and it
can also be seamlessly applied to the masked diffusion model. We demonstrate
the effectiveness of our proposed guidance on energy-guided simulations and
preference alignment on text-to-image generation and multimodal understanding
tasks. The code is available through

### [243] [Multiplicative-Additive Constrained Models:Toward Joint Visualization of Interactive and Independent Effects](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21923)
*Fumin Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MACMs extend CESR with a multiplicative–additive structure that preserves visualizable shape functions while decoupling interactive and independent terms, yielding superior predictive performance over CESR and GAMs (neural-network implementation).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In high-stakes domains like healthcare, interpretability is essential. GAMs offer interpretable shape functions but omit higher-order interactions to preserve simplicity, which limits accuracy. A model that visualizes interactions among all features yet improves performance is needed.

Method: Introduce Multiplicative-Additive Constrained Models (MACMs) that combine a multiplicative part (capturing interactions) with an additive part (capturing independent effects). The additive component disentangles coefficients of interaction and main effects, broadening the hypothesis space. Both parts have visualizable shape functions, and the approach is implemented with neural networks (neural-network-based MACMs).

Result: MACMs outperform both CESR and state-of-the-art GAMs in predictive accuracy, with neural-network MACMs showing significant gains over CESR and GAM baselines.

Conclusion: MACMs provide an interpretable and more powerful alternative to CESR and GAMs by coupling a visualizable multiplicative interaction term with an additive component, expanding the hypothesis space and achieving superior predictive performance.

Abstract: Interpretability is one of the considerations when applying machine learning
to high-stakes fields such as healthcare that involve matters of life safety.
Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) enhance interpretability by visualizing
shape functions. Nevertheless, to preserve interpretability, GAMs omit
higher-order interaction effects (beyond pairwise interactions), which imposes
significant constraints on their predictive performance. We observe that Curve
Ergodic Set Regression (CESR), a multiplicative model, naturally enables the
visualization of its shape functions and simultaneously incorporates both
interactions among all features and individual feature effects. Nevertheless,
CESR fails to demonstrate superior performance compared to GAMs. We introduce
Multiplicative-Additive Constrained Models (MACMs), which augment CESR with an
additive part to disentangle the intertwined coefficients of its interactive
and independent terms, thus effectively broadening the hypothesis space. The
model is composed of a multiplicative part and an additive part, whose shape
functions can both be naturally visualized, thereby assisting users in
interpreting how features participate in the decision-making process.
Consequently, MACMs constitute an improvement over both CESR and GAMs. The
experimental results indicate that neural network-based MACMs significantly
outperform both CESR and the current state-of-the-art GAMs in terms of
predictive performance.

*Yunchen Li,Shaohui Lin,Zhou Yu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: With finite training data, deterministic generation exactly recovers the training samples; stochastic generation adds Gaussian noise to those samples. When estimation errors are present, generation becomes convex combinations of samples with mixed uniform and Gaussian noise; experiments on generation and classification support the theory.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understand the theoretical behavior of generative models when trained on finite populations and establish generative-specific notions of underfitting and overfitting.

Method: Derive closed-form expressions for the optimal velocity field and score function under a finite training set within a stochastic interpolation framework; compare deterministic and stochastic generative processes; model estimation errors; define/characterize underfitting/overfitting in generative models; validate with experiments on generation and downstream tasks.

Result: Deterministic processes exactly recover training samples; stochastic processes produce samples with added Gaussian noise; with estimation errors, generation yields convex combinations of training samples corrupted by a mixture of uniform and Gaussian noise; empirical results on generation and downstream tasks corroborate the theory.

Conclusion: Provides a finite-data theoretical framework for generative models, formalizes underfitting/overfitting in the generative setting, and is supported by empirical evidence across generation and downstream tasks.

Abstract: This paper investigates the theoretical behavior of generative models under
finite training populations. Within the stochastic interpolation generative
framework, we derive closed-form expressions for the optimal velocity field and
score function when only a finite number of training samples are available. We
demonstrate that, under some regularity conditions, the deterministic
generative process exactly recovers the training samples, while the stochastic
generative process manifests as training samples with added Gaussian noise.
Beyond the idealized setting, we consider model estimation errors and introduce
formal definitions of underfitting and overfitting specific to generative
models. Our theoretical analysis reveals that, in the presence of estimation
errors, the stochastic generation process effectively produces convex
combinations of training samples corrupted by a mixture of uniform and Gaussian
noise. Experiments on generation tasks and downstream tasks such as
classification support our theory.

*Amine Bechar,Adel Oulefki,Abbes Amira,Fatih Kurogollu,Yassine Himeur*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Fine-tune visual language LLMs on 3D representations (CWTs and recurrence plots) of 1D building energy time-series to improve anomaly detection and energy-efficiency recommendations, achieving better validation loss than raw-data fine-tuning on real-world data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Complex, nonlinear, multi-scale energy data challenge traditional analysis; need interpretable, scalable approaches that integrate time-series dynamics with visual reasoning.

Method: Convert 1D time-series into 3D encodings using continuous wavelet transforms (CWTs) and recurrence plots (RPs); fine-tune a visual-language LLM (Idefics-7B) on these encodings; evaluate on University of Sharjah energy dataset for anomaly detection and recommendation generation.

Result: Idefics-7B achieves validation losses of 0.0952 (CWTs) and 0.1064 (RPs), outperforming 0.1176 achieved by fine-tuning on raw time-series; framework monitors building states, detects recurring anomalies, and yields optimization recommendations.

Conclusion: Bridges time-series analysis and visualization; offers a scalable, interpretable framework for energy analytics that leverages 3D visual encodings and VLLMs to extract actionable insights.

Abstract: The analysis of complex building time-series for actionable insights and
recommendations remains challenging due to the nonlinear and multi-scale
characteristics of energy data. To address this, we propose a framework that
fine-tunes visual language large models (VLLMs) on 3D graphical representations
of the data. The approach converts 1D time-series into 3D representations using
continuous wavelet transforms (CWTs) and recurrence plots (RPs), which capture
temporal dynamics and localize frequency anomalies. These 3D encodings enable
VLLMs to visually interpret energy-consumption patterns, detect anomalies, and
provide recommendations for energy efficiency. We demonstrate the framework on
real-world building-energy datasets, where fine-tuned VLLMs successfully
monitor building states, identify recurring anomalies, and generate
optimization recommendations. Quantitatively, the Idefics-7B VLLM achieves
validation losses of 0.0952 with CWTs and 0.1064 with RPs on the University of
Sharjah energy dataset, outperforming direct fine-tuning on raw time-series
data (0.1176) for anomaly detection. This work bridges time-series analysis and
visualization, providing a scalable and interpretable framework for energy
analytics.

*O. Duranthon,P. Marion,C. Boyer,B. Loureiro,L. Zdeborová*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Softmax attention is Bayes-optimal in the population limit for a single-location regression task, while linear attention is not; in finite samples softmax remains better than linear attention though no longer Bayes-optimal; other activations are evaluated to identify needed properties; gradient-based optimization connections are discussed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why softmax often dominates attention mechanisms and how it compares to alternatives beyond linearized analyses, by providing a principled, high-dimensional theory of attention in a simple regression setting.

Method: A high-dimensional, physics-inspired analysis of single-location regression with attention-based predictors. The authors derive an asymptotic description via order parameters in the population limit, compare activation functions (softmax vs linear vs others), and study finite-sample asymptotics.

Result: In the population limit, softmax achieves the Bayes risk for the task, while linear attention falls short. Among other activations, certain properties are identified as necessary for optimal performance. In finite samples, softmax is no longer Bayes-optimal but still consistently outperforms linear attention; the work also discusses how these results relate to gradient-based optimization dynamics.

Conclusion: Softmax exhibits favorable theoretical properties for attention in both population and finite-sample regimes, explaining its empirical dominance and guiding principles for activation design. The analysis highlights the gap between Bayes-optimality and practical performance and connects optimization dynamics to activation choice.

Abstract: Large language models rely on attention mechanisms with a softmax activation.
Yet the dominance of softmax over alternatives (e.g., component-wise or linear)
remains poorly understood, and many theoretical works have focused on the
easier-to-analyze linearized attention. In this work, we address this gap
through a principled study of the single-location regression task, where the
output depends on a linear transformation of a single input token at a random
location. Building on ideas from statistical physics, we develop an analysis of
attention-based predictors in the high-dimensional limit, where generalization
performance is captured by a small set of order parameters. At the population
level, we show that softmax achieves the Bayes risk, whereas linear attention
fundamentally falls short. We then examine other activation functions to
identify which properties are necessary for optimal performance. Finally, we
analyze the finite-sample regime: we provide an asymptotic characterization of
the test error and show that, while softmax is no longer Bayes-optimal, it
consistently outperforms linear attention. We discuss the connection with
optimization by gradient-based algorithms.

*Xianghua Zeng,Hao Peng,Angsheng Li,Yicheng Pan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SIHD adaptively builds a hierarchical diffusion model for offline RL long-horizon tasks using structural information, with a structural entropy regularizer to promote exploration and improve generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Offline RL with long-horizon tasks and sparse rewards suffers from high variance, distributional shift, and computational challenges; hierarchical diffusion can help but fixed scales limit adaptability. SIHD aims to adapt hierarchy to data and tasks.

Method: Construct diffusion hierarchy from structural information in offline trajectories; use multi-scale diffusion layers; conditioning based on structural information gain of state communities; apply structural entropy regularizer to encourage exploration of underrepresented states and mitigate extrapolation.

Result: SIHD outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on challenging offline RL tasks and generalizes across diverse scenarios.

Conclusion: Adaptive, structure-informed hierarchical diffusion provides stable offline policy learning for long-horizon environments, with better decision-making and generalization and less reliance on dataset-specific reward predictions.

Abstract: Diffusion-based generative methods have shown promising potential for
modeling trajectories from offline reinforcement learning (RL) datasets, and
hierarchical diffusion has been introduced to mitigate variance accumulation
and computational challenges in long-horizon planning tasks. However, existing
approaches typically assume a fixed two-layer diffusion hierarchy with a single
predefined temporal scale, which limits adaptability to diverse downstream
tasks and reduces flexibility in decision making. In this work, we propose
SIHD, a novel Structural Information-based Hierarchical Diffusion framework for
effective and stable offline policy learning in long-horizon environments with
sparse rewards. Specifically, we analyze structural information embedded in
offline trajectories to construct the diffusion hierarchy adaptively, enabling
flexible trajectory modeling across multiple temporal scales. Rather than
relying on reward predictions from localized sub-trajectories, we quantify the
structural information gain of each state community and use it as a
conditioning signal within the corresponding diffusion layer. To reduce
overreliance on offline datasets, we introduce a structural entropy regularizer
that encourages exploration of underrepresented states while avoiding
extrapolation errors from distributional shifts. Extensive evaluations on
challenging offline RL tasks show that SIHD significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines in decision-making performance and demonstrates
superior generalization across diverse scenarios.

*Taeyoung Yun,Pierre-Luc St-Charles,Jinkyoo Park,Yoshua Bengio,Minsu Kim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces Active Attacks, an RL-based red-teaming method that adaptively explores attacker prompts by periodically fine-tuning the victim LLM, producing an easy-to-hard curriculum that broadens attack-mode coverage and surpasses prior RL baselines in cross-attack success rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To generate diverse, multi-modal attack prompts for safety testing of LLMs. Existing diversity-focused RL methods collapse to few modes; attacker LLMs need adaptive exploration as the victim evolves.

Method: Active Attacks integrates an RL red-teaming loop with adaptive exploration inspired by active learning. Attacker prompts are rewarded by a toxicity classifier; periodic safety fine-tuning of the victim reduces rewards in exploited regions, forcing exploration of new vulnerabilities. It acts as a plug‑in to existing RL objectives and builds an easy-to-hard curriculum across local attack modes.

Result: Significant empirical gains: cross-attack success rate improved from ~0.07% (GFlowNets baseline) to 31.28% with only ~6% additional computation, outperforming PPO, REINFORCE, and GFlowNets.

Conclusion: Active Attacks uncovers a wide range of local attack modes step by step, achieving broad multi-modal coverage; the method is simple to integrate and shows substantial improvements in red-teaming effectiveness, with released code for reproducibility.

Abstract: We address the challenge of generating diverse attack prompts for large
language models (LLMs) that elicit harmful behaviors (e.g., insults, sexual
content) and are used for safety fine-tuning. Rather than relying on manual
prompt engineering, attacker LLMs can be trained with reinforcement learning
(RL) to automatically generate such prompts using only a toxicity classifier as
a reward. However, capturing a wide range of harmful behaviors is a significant
challenge that requires explicit diversity objectives. Existing
diversity-seeking RL methods often collapse to limited modes: once high-reward
prompts are found, exploration of new regions is discouraged. Inspired by the
active learning paradigm that encourages adaptive exploration, we introduce
\textit{Active Attacks}, a novel RL-based red-teaming algorithm that adapts its
attacks as the victim evolves. By periodically safety fine-tuning the victim
LLM with collected attack prompts, rewards in exploited regions diminish, which
forces the attacker to seek unexplored vulnerabilities. This process naturally
induces an easy-to-hard exploration curriculum, where the attacker progresses
beyond easy modes toward increasingly difficult ones. As a result, Active
Attacks uncovers a wide range of local attack modes step by step, and their
combination achieves wide coverage of the multi-mode distribution. Active
Attacks, a simple plug-and-play module that seamlessly integrates into existing
RL objectives, unexpectedly outperformed prior RL-based methods -- including
GFlowNets, PPO, and REINFORCE -- by improving cross-attack success rates
against GFlowNets, the previous state-of-the-art, from 0.07% to 31.28% (a
relative gain greater than $400\ \times$) with only a 6% increase in
computation. Our code is publicly available

*Zhichao Sheng,Shilin Zhou,Chen Gong,Zhenghua Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a difficulty-adaptive reasoning method for Large Audio Language Models (LALMs) that links reasoning length to problem difficulty via a reward function, achieving better performance with shorter reasoning on easy tasks and deeper reasoning on hard tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the one-size-fits-all reasoning depth in LALMs by enabling adaptive, task-aware reasoning to balance performance and efficiency.

Method: Introduce a reward function that dynamically ties the length of reasoning to the model's estimated problem difficulty, encouraging concise reasoning for easy tasks and elaborate reasoning for complex ones; validate with extensive experiments showing improved performance and reduced reasoning length.

Result: Demonstrates that the adaptive reasoning approach improves task performance while significantly reducing average reasoning length, with further analysis offering insights into reasoning structure paradigms.

Conclusion: Adaptive difficulty-aware reasoning is beneficial for LALMs, enabling efficient and effective reasoning and guiding future exploration of reasoning structures.

Abstract: Large Audio Language Models (LALMs), powered by the chain-of-thought (CoT)
paradigm, have shown remarkable reasoning capabilities. Intuitively, different
problems often require varying depths of reasoning. While some methods can
determine whether to reason for a given problem, they typically lack a
fine-grained mechanism to modulate how much to reason. This often results in a
``one-size-fits-all'' reasoning depth, which generates redundant overthinking
for simple questions while failing to allocate sufficient thought to complex
ones. In this paper, we conduct an in-depth analysis of LALMs and find that an
effective and efficient LALM should reason smartly by adapting its reasoning
depth to the problem's complexity. To achieve this, we propose a
difficulty-adaptive reasoning method for LALMs. Specifically, we propose a
reward function that dynamically links reasoning length to the model's
perceived problem difficulty. This reward encourages shorter, concise reasoning
for easy tasks and more elaborate, in-depth reasoning for complex ones.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method is both effective and
efficient, simultaneously improving task performance and significantly reducing
the average reasoning length. Further analysis on reasoning structure paradigm
offers valuable insights for future work.

*Feng Jiang,Amina Mollaysa,Hehuan Ma,Tommaso Mansi,Junzhou Huang,Mangal Prakash,Rui Liao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GRAMDTI is a four-modal pretraining framework for drug–target interaction (DTI) prediction that uses volume-based contrastive learning across modalities, adaptive modality dropout, and IC50 weak supervision, achieving state-of-the-art results on four datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DTI prediction can benefit from rich multimodal information about small molecules and proteins; existing methods underutilize higher-order multimodal signals and rely on limited pairwise alignment.

Method: Integrates four modalities into unified representations; extends volume-based contrastive learning to four modalities; uses adaptive modality dropout to regulate each modality’s contribution during pretraining; optionally incorporates IC50 measurements as weak supervision to ground representations in interaction strength.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on four public DTI datasets, demonstrating robustness, superior performance, and the benefits of higher-order multimodal alignment, adaptive modality utilization, and auxiliary supervision.

Conclusion: Demonstrates that multimodal pretraining with adaptive modality fusion and weak supervision yields robust and generalizable DTI models and provides a blueprint for multimodal representation learning in drug discovery.

Abstract: Drug target interaction (DTI) prediction is a cornerstone of computational
drug discovery, enabling rational design, repurposing, and mechanistic
insights. While deep learning has advanced DTI modeling, existing approaches
primarily rely on SMILES protein pairs and fail to exploit the rich multimodal
information available for small molecules and proteins. We introduce GRAMDTI, a
pretraining framework that integrates multimodal molecular and protein inputs
into unified representations. GRAMDTI extends volume based contrastive learning
to four modalities, capturing higher-order semantic alignment beyond
conventional pairwise approaches. To handle modality informativeness, we
propose adaptive modality dropout, dynamically regulating each modality's
contribution during pre-training. Additionally, IC50 activity measurements,

multimodal alignment, adaptive modality utilization, and auxiliary supervision
for robust and generalizable DTI prediction.

### [251] [Stage-wise Dynamics of Classifier-Free Guidance in Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22007)
*Cheng Jin,Qitan Shi,Yuantao Gu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CFG under multimodal conditionals unfolds in three stages (Direction Shift, Mode Separation, Concentration); stronger guidance improves semantic alignment but reduces diversity; a time-varying guidance schedule improves both quality and diversity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address incomplete understanding of Classifier-Free Guidance's impact on sampling dynamics, especially under multimodal conditionals, to balance fidelity and diversity.

Method: Theoretical analysis revealing three-stage dynamics in sampling: Direction Shift (bias toward weighted mean), Mode Separation (weak purges of weaker modes), Concentration (within-mode contraction); formalization and controlled experiments varying guidance strength and schedule; proposal and validation of time-varying guidance.

Result: Three-stage dynamics are validated: early strong guidance erodes global diversity, late strong guidance suppresses fine-grained variation; a time-varying schedule improves both generated quality and diversity across setups.

Conclusion: Provides a unified framework for CFG dynamics under multimodal conditionals and practical guidance for scheduling guidance to optimize fidelity and diversity.

Abstract: Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) is widely used to improve conditional fidelity
in diffusion models, but its impact on sampling dynamics remains poorly
understood. Prior studies, often restricted to unimodal conditional
distributions or simplified cases, provide only a partial picture. We analyze
CFG under multimodal conditionals and show that the sampling process unfolds in
three successive stages. In the Direction Shift stage, guidance accelerates
movement toward the weighted mean, introducing initialization bias and norm
growth. In the Mode Separation stage, local dynamics remain largely neutral,
but the inherited bias suppresses weaker modes, reducing global diversity. In
the Concentration stage, guidance amplifies within-mode contraction,
diminishing fine-grained variability. This unified view explains a widely
observed phenomenon: stronger guidance improves semantic alignment but
inevitably reduces diversity. Experiments support these predictions, showing
that early strong guidance erodes global diversity, while late strong guidance
suppresses fine-grained variation. Moreover, our theory naturally suggests a
time-varying guidance schedule, and empirical results confirm that it
consistently improves both quality and diversity.

### [252] [Goal-Guided Efficient Exploration via Large Language Model in Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22008)
*Yajie Qi,Wei Wei,Lin Li,Lijun Zhang,Zhidong Gao,Da Wang,Huizhong Song*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SGRL introduces a structured goal-guided RL framework that uses an LLM-based goal planner and a goal-conditioned action pruner to guide exploration and long-horizon planning, achieving state-of-the-art performance on Crafter-like tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world decision-making is complex and open-ended, making exploration inefficient and long-horizon planning difficult for RL agents. Existing LLM-enhanced RL methods often incur frequent, costly LLM calls and suffer from semantic mismatch between goals and actions.

Method: SGRL consists of (1) a structured goal planner that uses LLMs to produce a reusable, structured function for goal generation with prioritized goals; it uses LLM-derived priority weights to create forward-looking goals guiding the policy. (2) A goal-conditioned action pruner that applies action masking to filter out actions not aligned with the current goal, constraining the policy to goal-consistent actions.

Result: Experimental evaluation on Crafter and Craftax-Classic shows that SGRL achieves superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: SGRL effectively combines structured goal generation and goal-aligned action pruning to improve exploration efficiency and long-horizon planning in RL, mitigating semantic mismatch and leveraging LLMs more efficiently; the approach yields state-of-the-art results on the tested tasks.

Abstract: Real-world decision-making tasks typically occur in complex and open
environments, posing significant challenges to reinforcement learning (RL)
agents' exploration efficiency and long-horizon planning capabilities. A
promising approach is LLM-enhanced RL, which leverages the rich prior knowledge
and strong planning capabilities of LLMs to guide RL agents in efficient
exploration. However, existing methods mostly rely on frequent and costly LLM
invocations and suffer from limited performance due to the semantic mismatch.
In this paper, we introduce a Structured Goal-guided Reinforcement Learning
(SGRL) method that integrates a structured goal planner and a goal-conditioned
action pruner to guide RL agents toward efficient exploration. Specifically,
the structured goal planner utilizes LLMs to generate a reusable, structured
function for goal generation, in which goals are prioritized. Furthermore, by
utilizing LLMs to determine goals' priority weights, it dynamically generates
forward-looking goals to guide the agent's policy toward more promising
decision-making trajectories. The goal-conditioned action pruner employs an
action masking mechanism that filters out actions misaligned with the current
goal, thereby constraining the RL agent to select goal-consistent policies. We
evaluate the proposed method on Crafter and Craftax-Classic, and experimental
results demonstrate that SGRL achieves superior performance compared to
existing state-of-the-art methods.

*Jianrong Ding,Muxi Chen,Chenchen Zhao,Qiang Xu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Concept-SAE introduces a dual-supervised, hybrid disentanglement approach to produce semantically grounded, localized concept tokens from sparse autoencoders, enabling causal intervention and vulnerability localization in models, moving beyond correlational interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard sparse autoencoders yield ambiguous, non-grounded features that are unreliable for causal probing of model behavior. There is a need for semantically meaningful, localized tokens to enable mechanistic understanding and intervention.

Method: A dual-supervision, hybrid disentanglement strategy to derive concept tokens that are faithful and spatially localized. The approach is quantitatively evaluated against alternatives, demonstrating superior disentanglement. Applications include direct intervention to test causal links between concepts and predictions, and systematic localization of adversarial vulnerabilities to specific layers.

Result: Tokens produced by Concept-SAE are remarkably faithful and spatially localized, outperforming alternative disentanglement methods.

Conclusion: Concept-SAE provides a validated blueprint for moving beyond correlational interpretation toward mechanistic, causal probing of model behavior and for diagnosing and localizing vulnerabilities within neural architectures.

Abstract: Standard Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) excel at discovering a dictionary of a
model's learned features, offering a powerful observational lens. However, the
ambiguous and ungrounded nature of these features makes them unreliable
instruments for the active, causal probing of model behavior. To solve this, we
introduce Concept-SAE, a framework that forges semantically grounded concept
tokens through a novel hybrid disentanglement strategy. We first quantitatively
demonstrate that our dual-supervision approach produces tokens that are
remarkably faithful and spatially localized, outperforming alternative methods
in disentanglement. This validated fidelity enables two critical applications:
(1) we probe the causal link between internal concepts and predictions via
direct intervention, and (2) we probe the model's failure modes by
systematically localizing adversarial vulnerabilities to specific layers.
Concept-SAE provides a validated blueprint for moving beyond correlational
interpretation to the mechanistic, causal probing of model behavior.

### [254] [AEGIS: Authentic Edge Growth In Sparsity for Link Prediction in Edge-Sparse Bipartite Knowledge Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22017)
*Hugh Xuechen Liu,Kıvanç Tatar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AEGIS proposes edge-only resampling to augment training data in sparse bipartite graphs, preserving nodes and avoiding fake endpoints. It uses simple uniform or inverse-degree biased sampling, plus semantic-KNN augmentation when descriptive node info is available. Evaluated on Amazon, MovieLens, and GDP graph with AUC-ROC and Brier score; results vary by dataset, with semantic-KNN providing strongest gains in dense/text-rich settings and copy-based augmentation matching baselines in some sparse domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tackle data scarcity and edge sparsity in bipartite knowledge graphs to improve link prediction without fabricating endpoints, while leveraging semantic information when available.

Method: Edge-only augmentation by resampling existing training edges. Two resampling strategies: simple uniform sampling and degree-aware inverse-degree bias. Also includes semantic KNN augmentation that uses informative node descriptions. Evaluation uses AUC-ROC (higher is better) and Brier score (lower is better) with two-tailed paired t-tests against sparse baselines. Experiments on naturally sparse graphs (game-pattern network GDP) and percolated denser benchmarks (Amazon, MovieLens).

Result: Copy-based AEGIS variants match the sparse baseline on Amazon and MovieLens; semantic KNN uniquely restores AUC and calibration; random and synthetic edges are detrimental. On GDP, semantic KNN achieves the largest AUC improvement and Brier-score reduction, with simple augmentation also lowering Brier score vs. sparse control.

Conclusion: Authenticity-constrained resampling is a data-efficient strategy for sparse bipartite link prediction; semantic augmentation provides additional gains when informative node descriptions exist.

Abstract: Bipartite knowledge graphs in niche domains are typically data-poor and
edge-sparse, which hinders link prediction. We introduce AEGIS (Authentic Edge
Growth In Sparsity), an edge-only augmentation framework that resamples
existing training edges -either uniformly simple or with inverse-degree bias
degree-aware -thereby preserving the original node set and sidestepping
fabricated endpoints. To probe authenticity across regimes, we consider
naturally sparse graphs (game design pattern's game-pattern network) and induce
sparsity in denser benchmarks (Amazon, MovieLens) via high-rate bond
percolation. We evaluate augmentations on two complementary metrics: AUC-ROC
(higher is better) and the Brier score (lower is better), using two-tailed
paired t-tests against sparse baselines. On Amazon and MovieLens, copy-based
AEGIS variants match the baseline while the semantic KNN augmentation is the
only method that restores AUC and calibration; random and synthetic edges
remain detrimental. On the text-rich GDP graph, semantic KNN achieves the
largest AUC improvement and Brier score reduction, and simple also lowers the
Brier score relative to the sparse control. These findings position
authenticity-constrained resampling as a data-efficient strategy for sparse
bipartite link prediction, with semantic augmentation providing an additional
boost when informative node descriptions are available.

### [255] [Task-Adaptive Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning for Weather Foundation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22020)
*Shilei Cao,Hehai Lin,Jiashun Cheng,Yang Liu,Guowen Li,Xuehe Wang,Juepeng Zheng,Haoyuan Liang,Meng Jin,Chengwei Qin,Hong Cheng,Haohuan Fu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: WeatherPEFT is a PEFT framework for Weather Foundation Models that uses Task-Adaptive Dynamic Prompting (TADP) and Stochastic Fisher-Guided Adaptive Selection (SFAS) to achieve high performance with far fewer trainable parameters than full fine-tuning, addressing weather-specific data heterogeneity and coverage challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Growing Weather Foundation Models demand heavy computation; current PEFT methods (designed for vision/language) fail to address weather-specific issues such as variable heterogeneity, varying resolution, and spatiotemporal coverage variations, hindering practical deployment.

Method: Two innovations: (1) Task-Adaptive Dynamic Prompting (TADP) injects encoder embedding weights into input tokens during forward pass via internal/external pattern extraction to enable context-aware feature recalibration for downstream tasks. (2) Stochastic Fisher-Guided Adaptive Selection (SFAS) uses Fisher information to identify and update task-critical parameters during backpropagation, with added randomness to stabilize selection, preserving pre-trained knowledge while adapting to tasks.

Result: Empirical evaluation on three downstream weather tasks shows WeatherPEFT closes the gap of PEFT methods to Full-Tuning, achieving parity with Full-Tuning using significantly fewer trainable parameters.

Conclusion: WeatherPEFT provides an effective and efficient framework for adapting Weather Foundation Models to diverse weather tasks, addressing heterogeneity and coverage challenges; code will be released.

Abstract: While recent advances in machine learning have equipped Weather Foundation
Models (WFMs) with substantial generalization capabilities across diverse
downstream tasks, the escalating computational requirements associated with
their expanding scale increasingly hinder practical deployment. Current
Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods, designed for vision or language
tasks, fail to address the unique challenges of weather downstream tasks, such
as variable heterogeneity, resolution diversity, and spatiotemporal coverage
variations, leading to suboptimal performance when applied to WFMs. To bridge
this gap, we introduce WeatherPEFT, a novel PEFT framework for WFMs
incorporating two synergistic innovations. First, during the forward pass,
Task-Adaptive Dynamic Prompting (TADP) dynamically injects the embedding
weights within the encoder to the input tokens of the pre-trained backbone via
internal and external pattern extraction, enabling context-aware feature
recalibration for specific downstream tasks. Furthermore, during
backpropagation, Stochastic Fisher-Guided Adaptive Selection (SFAS) not only
leverages Fisher information to identify and update the most task-critical
parameters, thereby preserving invariant pre-trained knowledge, but also
introduces randomness to stabilize the selection. We demonstrate the
effectiveness and efficiency of WeatherPEFT on three downstream tasks, where
existing PEFT methods show significant gaps versus Full-Tuning, and WeatherPEFT
achieves performance parity with Full-Tuning using fewer trainable parameters.
The code of this work will be released.

*Panagiotis Giannoulis,Yorgos Pantis,Christos Tzamos*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Vanilla GPT-2-based Sudoku solver using imitation learning of simple rules plus explicit DFS/backtracking achieves 99% accuracy, surpassing prior neuro-symbolic methods; connects to a contextual Min-Sum Set Cover framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bridge the gap in solving NP-complete combinatorial problems with language models by showing that a simple decoder-only architecture can perform search and learning for Sudoku without external tools, potentially generalizing to other NP problems.

Method: Imitate simple Sudoku rules within a decoder-only Transformer (GPT-2) and pair it with an explicit Depth-First Search exploration strategy that uses informed guessing and backtracking. The approach avoids external tools or function calls and seeks to minimize the number of guesses. The work also provides a formal connection to a contextual variant of Min-Sum Set Cover.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art Sudoku accuracy of 99% on the considered tasks, outperforming prior neuro-symbolic approaches, using a vanilla GPT-2 model with no external tooling. Demonstrates effective integration of rule imitation and DFS-based search with reduced guessing.

Conclusion: Demonstrates that LLMs can solve NP-class problems by combining simple rule-based imitation with explicit search strategies, without bespoke architectures or tools. Provides a formal link to a well-studied optimization problem (contextual Min-Sum Set Cover), suggesting a theoretical framing for LLM-based problem solving and avenues for future work in algorithmic alignment and efficiency.

Abstract: Despite their proficiency in various language tasks, Large Language Models
(LLMs) struggle with combinatorial problems like Satisfiability, Traveling
Salesman Problem, or even basic arithmetic. We address this gap through a novel
approach for solving problems in the class NP. We focus on the paradigmatic
task of Sudoku and achieve state-of-the-art accuracy (99\%) compared to prior
neuro-symbolic approaches. Unlike prior work that used custom architectures,
our method employs a vanilla decoder-only Transformer (GPT-2) without external
tools or function calling. Our method integrates imitation learning of simple
Sudoku rules with an explicit Depth-First Search (DFS) exploration strategy
involving informed guessing and backtracking. Moving beyond imitation learning,
we seek to minimize the number of guesses until reaching a solution. We provide
a rigorous analysis of this setup formalizing its connection to a contextual
variant of Min-Sum Set Cover, a well-studied problem in algorithms and
stochastic optimization.

*Haodong Pan,Yusong Wang,Nanning Zheng,Caijui Jiang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MCGM is a plug-in module that adds hierarchical global context to geometric GNNs via multi-resolution clustering, enabling efficient long-range information flow and improving predictive accuracy with fewer parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Geometric GNNs excel at capturing molecular geometry but locality-biased message passing hinders long-range interactions; existing solutions are costly, lack generality, or require tuning.

Method: Build a multi-stage hierarchy of atomic clusters using dynamic hierarchical clustering to distill global information, propagate it through learned transformations with residual connections, and integrate the module as a plug-in into diverse backbones.

Result: OE62 energy error reduced by an average of 26.2%; on AQM, energy 17.0 meV and forces 4.9 meV/Å; uses 20% fewer parameters than Neural P3M.

Conclusion: MCGM provides a lightweight, plug-and-play approach to inject global context into geometric GNNs, achieving strong accuracy gains with favorable parameter efficiency and broad applicability.

Abstract: Geometric graph neural networks (GNNs) excel at capturing molecular geometry,
yet their locality-biased message passing hampers the modeling of long-range
interactions. Current solutions have fundamental limitations: extending cutoff
radii causes computational costs to scale cubically with distance;
physics-inspired kernels (e.g., Coulomb, dispersion) are often system-specific
and lack generality; Fourier-space methods require careful tuning of multiple
parameters (e.g., mesh size, k-space cutoff) with added computational overhead.
We introduce Multi-stage Clustered Global Modeling (MCGM), a lightweight,
plug-and-play module that endows geometric GNNs with hierarchical global
context through efficient clustering operations. MCGM builds a multi-resolution
hierarchy of atomic clusters, distills global information via dynamic
hierarchical clustering, and propagates this context back through learned
transformations, ultimately reinforcing atomic features via residual
connections. Seamlessly integrated into four diverse backbone architectures,
MCGM reduces OE62 energy prediction error by an average of 26.2%. On AQM, MCGM
achieves state-of-the-art accuracy (17.0 meV for energy, 4.9 meV/{\AA} for
forces) while using 20% fewer parameters than Neural P3M. Code will be made
available upon acceptance.

*Anton Korznikov,Andrey Galichin,Alexey Dontsov,Oleg Rogov,Elena Tutubalina,Ivan Oseledets*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Orthogonal SAE (OrtSAE) introduces a training penalty to enforce feature orthogonality in sparse autoencoders, mitigating feature absorption and composition while maintaining linear scalability, yielding more distinct features and improved downstream robustness with competitive performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAEs tend to develop feature absorption (specialized features creating holes) and feature composition (independent features merging into composites), hindering interpretability and robustness. There is a need for disentangled representations that scale efficiently.

Method: A novel training procedure for OrtSAE that penalizes high pairwise cosine similarity among SAE features to enforce orthogonality. The approach scales linearly with SAE size and is evaluated across different models and layers against other methods.

Result: OrtSAE discovers 9% more distinct features, reduces feature absorption by 65% and composition by 15%, improves spurious correlation removal by 6%, and achieves comparable downstream performance to traditional SAEs.

Conclusion: Enforcing feature orthogonality via cosine-similarity penalties effectively mitigates absorption and composition, enabling disentangled representations with modest computational overhead and strong competitive performance across tasks.

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) are a technique for sparse decomposition of neural
network activations into human-interpretable features. However, current SAEs
suffer from feature absorption, where specialized features capture instances of
general features creating representation holes, and feature composition, where
independent features merge into composite representations. In this work, we
introduce Orthogonal SAE (OrtSAE), a novel approach aimed to mitigate these
issues by enforcing orthogonality between the learned features. By implementing
a new training procedure that penalizes high pairwise cosine similarity between
SAE features, OrtSAE promotes the development of disentangled features while
scaling linearly with the SAE size, avoiding significant computational
overhead. We train OrtSAE across different models and layers and compare it
with other methods. We find that OrtSAE discovers 9% more distinct features,
reduces feature absorption (by 65%) and composition (by 15%), improves
performance on spurious correlation removal (+6%), and achieves on-par
performance for other downstream tasks compared to traditional SAEs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models like Stable Diffusion lack intuitive latent-vector control (as in GANs), limiting flexible, interpretable artistic expression; a mechanism to manipulate latent representations during diffusion could enhance creative exploration.

Method: Introduce a framework (referred to as \workname) that integrates programmable latent-space operations into the diffusion process, allowing direct manipulation of latent representations—both conceptual and spatial—during generation. The framework is demonstrated through two artworks to show conceptual blending and dynamic motion capabilities.

Result: Demonstrates the viability of latent-space–level edits in diffusion-based art. The approach reveals latent-space structure, including semantic and meaningless regions, and shows creative output in Infinitepedia and Latent Motion, highlighting new avenues for exploring latent-space geometry in diffusion models.

Conclusion: Latent-space structures with both meaningful and meaningless regions exist in diffusion models, and customizing latent-space operations expands creative possibilities. The framework paves the way for richer artistic expression (conceptual blending and motion) and motivates further study of latent-space geometry in diffusion processes.

Abstract: Latent space is one of the key concepts in generative AI, offering powerful
means for creative exploration through vector manipulation. However, diffusion
models like Stable Diffusion lack the intuitive latent vector control found in
GANs, limiting their flexibility for artistic expression. This paper introduces
\workname, a framework for integrating customizable latent space operations
into the diffusion process. By enabling direct manipulation of conceptual and
spatial representations, this approach expands creative possibilities in
generative art. We demonstrate the potential of this framework through two
artworks, \textit{Infinitepedia} and \textit{Latent Motion}, highlighting its
use in conceptual blending and dynamic motion generation. Our findings reveal
latent space structures with semantic and meaningless regions, offering
insights into the geometry of diffusion models and paving the way for further
explorations of latent space.

*Suman Sanyal*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CDP is a boundary-free linear dr method that targets detour-induced local non-convexity via a PSD non-convexity structure matrix built from admissible k-NN pairs; projection uses top-k eigenvectors with verifiable guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address local non-convexity and detour distortions in point clouds with verifiable, data-driven guarantees for dimensionality reduction.

Method: Build a k-NN graph; identify admissible pairs whose Euclidean-to-shortest-path ratio is below a threshold; accumulate their normalized directions to form a PSD non-convexity structure matrix; project data using the top-k eigenvectors of this matrix; provide a-posteriori distortion certificates for admissible pairs and an average-case spectral bound for expected energy captured; report fixed- and reselected-pairs detour errors and certificate quantiles.

Result: The paper proposes a linear projection method with two guarantees (per-pair distortion certificate and an average-case spectral bound) and an evaluation protocol that quantifies detour errors and certificate quantiles across fixed and reselected pairs.

Conclusion: CDP offers a boundary-free, linear DR approach that directly targets detour-related non-convexities, with verifiable guarantees and a practical evaluation protocol to help practitioners assess data-specific distortion risks.

Abstract: We propose Convexity-Driven Projection (CDP), a boundary-free linear method
for dimensionality reduction of point clouds that targets preserving
detour-induced local non-convexity. CDP builds a $k$-NN graph, identifies
admissible pairs whose Euclidean-to-shortest-path ratios are below a threshold,
and aggregates their normalized directions to form a positive semidefinite
non-convexity structure matrix. The projection uses the top-$k$ eigenvectors of
the structure matrix. We give two verifiable guarantees. A pairwise
a-posteriori certificate that bounds the post-projection distortion for each
admissible pair, and an average-case spectral bound that links expected
captured direction energy to the spectrum of the structure matrix, yielding
quantile statements for typical distortion. Our evaluation protocol reports
fixed- and reselected-pairs detour errors and certificate quantiles, enabling
practitioners to check guarantees on their data.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MO-GRPO extends GRPO to multi-objective RL by normalizing reward components by their variance to balance contributions, mitigating reward hacking and improving stability across tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In multi-objective settings, unscaled or mis-scaled rewards can let a single objective dominate, making GRPO vulnerable to reward hacking; an automatic, scale-less approach is desirable.

Method: Propose MO-GRPO with a simple normalization that reweights reward functions according to their variances; provide analytical proof that contributions to the loss are balanced while preserving the order of preferences; evaluate on four domains.

Result: MO-GRPO yields stable learning by evenly distributing correlations among reward components and outperforms GRPO across domains including bandits, Mo-Gymnasium, WMT En-Ja/En-Zh, and instruction following.

Conclusion: A simple, variance-based normalization makes MO-GRPO a promising method for robust multi-objective RL by eliminating manual reward scaling and reducing reward hacking.

Abstract: Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) has been shown to be an effective
algorithm when an accurate reward model is available. However, such a highly
reliable reward model is not available in many real-world tasks. In this paper,
we particularly focus on multi-objective settings, in which we identify that
GRPO is vulnerable to reward hacking, optimizing only one of the objectives at
the cost of the others. To address this issue, we propose MO-GRPO, an extension
of GRPO with a simple normalization method to reweight the reward functions
automatically according to the variances of their values. We first show
analytically that MO-GRPO ensures that all reward functions contribute evenly
to the loss function while preserving the order of preferences, eliminating the
need for manual tuning of the reward functions' scales. Then, we evaluate
MO-GRPO experimentally in four domains: (i) the multi-armed bandits problem,
(ii) simulated control task (Mo-Gymnasium), (iii) machine translation tasks on
the WMT benchmark (En-Ja, En-Zh), and (iv) instruction following task. MO-GRPO
achieves stable learning by evenly distributing correlations among the
components of rewards, outperforming GRPO, showing MO-GRPO to be a promising
algorithm for multi-objective reinforcement learning problems.

TL;DR: BrainPro is a large EEG foundation model with a retrieval-based spatial learning block and a brain state-decoupling block, enabling flexible channel/region interactions across electrode layouts and state-aware self-supervised learning, achieving state-of-the-art across nine BCI datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current EEG foundation models struggle to capture channel-to-channel and region-to-region interactions across varying electrode layouts, and rarely learn state-aware representations during self-supervised pre-training. This limits flexibility and generalization across datasets and hardware.

Method: Introduce a retrieval-based spatial learning block to flexibly capture channel- and region-level interactions across varying electrode layouts. Add a brain state-decoupling block with parallel encoders and decoupling/regional reconstruction losses to enable state-aware representation learning. Pre-train on a large EEG corpus and evaluate across diverse BCI tasks.

Result: BrainPro achieves state-of-the-art performance and robust generalization across nine public BCI datasets.

Conclusion: BrainPro can adapt to diverse tasks and hardware settings; the planned release of code and pre-trained weights will facilitate adoption and replication.

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) is a non-invasive technique for recording brain
electrical activity, widely used in brain-computer interface (BCI) and
healthcare. Recent EEG foundation models trained on large-scale datasets have
shown improved performance and generalizability over traditional decoding
methods, yet significant challenges remain. Existing models often fail to
explicitly capture channel-to-channel and region-to-region interactions, which
are critical sources of information inherently encoded in EEG signals. Due to
varying channel configurations across datasets, they either approximate spatial
structure with self-attention or restrict training to a limited set of common
channels, sacrificing flexibility and effectiveness. Moreover, although EEG
datasets reflect diverse brain states such as emotion, motor, and others,
current models rarely learn state-aware representations during self-supervised
pre-training. To address these gaps, we propose BrainPro, a large EEG model
that introduces a retrieval-based spatial learning block to flexibly capture
channel- and region-level interactions across varying electrode layouts, and a
brain state-decoupling block that enables state-aware representation learning
through parallel encoders with decoupling and region-aware reconstruction
losses. This design allows BrainPro to adapt seamlessly to diverse tasks and
hardware settings. Pre-trained on an extensive EEG corpus, BrainPro achieves
state-of-the-art performance and robust generalization across nine public BCI
datasets. Our codes and the pre-trained weights will be released.

*Hua Yuan,Ning Xu,Xin Geng,Yong Rui*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes an intra-class contrastive loss during teacher training to enrich intra-class diversity in soft labels for knowledge distillation, aided by a margin loss to stabilize training; supported by theoretical analysis and empirical results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Soft labels carry multi-view intra-class variation that can help generalization, but current distillation focuses on ground-truth targets and neglects intra-class diversity, limiting student performance.

Method: Introduce an intra-class contrastive loss in teacher training to enrich intra-class information in soft labels; add a margin loss to stabilize training and speed up convergence; provide theoretical analysis of intra/inter-class distances; validate with experiments.

Result: The margin-augmented intra-class contrastive loss enhances intra-class diversity in soft labels and improves distillation performance, with reported gains in training stability and convergence; empirical results support effectiveness.

Conclusion: Incorporating intra-class contrastive learning with a margin loss during teacher training can enrich soft-label representations by capturing intra-class variation, leading to improved knowledge distillation outcomes.

Abstract: Since the advent of knowledge distillation, much research has focused on how
the soft labels generated by the teacher model can be utilized effectively.
Existing studies points out that the implicit knowledge within soft labels
originates from the multi-view structure present in the data. Feature
variations within samples of the same class allow the student model to
generalize better by learning diverse representations. However, in existing
distillation methods, teacher models predominantly adhere to ground-truth
labels as targets, without considering the diverse representations within the
same class. Therefore, we propose incorporating an intra-class contrastive loss
during teacher training to enrich the intra-class information contained in soft
labels. In practice, we find that intra-class loss causes instability in
training and slows convergence. To mitigate these issues, margin loss is
integrated into intra-class contrastive learning to improve the training
stability and convergence speed. Simultaneously, we theoretically analyze the
impact of this loss on the intra-class distances and inter-class distances. It
has been proved that the intra-class contrastive loss can enrich the
intra-class diversity. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of
the proposed method.

Motivation: Addresses a theoretical gap: there is limited understanding of when transferring a subset of upstream parameters is beneficial and what governs its effectiveness.

Method: Theoretical analysis of upstream/downstream CNNs with ReLU activations, modeling inherited parameters as carriers of universal knowledge; derivation of factors that amplify/limit transfer benefits; empirical validation via numerical and real-world experiments.

Result: Characterizes conditions under which partial parameter transfer improves the target task, and identifies key factors that amplify benefit; explains cases where transfer harms performance relative to training from scratch; supports findings with numerical and real-world data experiments.

Conclusion: Partial parameter transfer can be beneficial under specific conditions and mechanisms; awareness of universal-knowledge carriers and identified factors can guide practice; empirical validation corroborates the theory.

Abstract: Parameter transfer is a central paradigm in transfer learning, enabling
knowledge reuse across tasks and domains by sharing model parameters between
upstream and downstream models. However, when only a subset of parameters from
the upstream model is transferred to the downstream model, there remains a lack
of theoretical understanding of the conditions under which such partial
parameter reuse is beneficial and of the factors that govern its effectiveness.
To address this gap, we analyze a setting in which both the upstream and
downstream models are ReLU convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Within this
theoretical framework, we characterize how the inherited parameters act as
carriers of universal knowledge and identify key factors that amplify their
beneficial impact on the target task. Furthermore, our analysis provides
insight into why, in certain cases, transferring parameters can lead to lower
test accuracy on the target task than training a new model from scratch.
Numerical experiments and real-world data experiments are conducted to
empirically validate our theoretical findings.

### [265] [The Rogue Scalpel: Activation Steering Compromises LLM Safety](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22067)
*Anton Korznikov,Andrey Galichin,Alexey Dontsov,Oleg Y. Rogov,Ivan Oseledets,Elena Tutubalina*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Activation steering, supposedly a safe, interpretable way to steer LLMs, can backfire: random or semantically meaningful directions can increase harmful compliance; combining many random vectors yields a universal jailbreak; interpretability does not guarantee containment of model behavior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To empirically test whether activation steering provides reliable and safe control over model behavior, challenging the claim that interpretability-based steering can enforce alignment safeguards.

Method: Systematic experiments across multiple model families. Apply steering vectors to hidden states: random directions and SAE-derived interpretable directions. Measure tendency to comply with harmful prompts. Test a composite attack by summing 20 random vectors to jailbreak a single prompt and evaluate on unseen requests.

Result: Random steering increases harmful compliance from 0% to 2–27%. Steering SAE-derived benign features raises this rate by an additional 2–4%. A 20-vector universal attack markedly boosts harmful compliance on unseen prompts.

Conclusion: Safety-through-interpretability is not guaranteed. Directly manipulating model internals via activation steering can undermine alignment safeguards, suggesting the need for more robust safety mechanisms beyond interpretable directions.

Abstract: Activation steering is a promising technique for controlling LLM behavior by
adding semantically meaningful vectors directly into a model's hidden states
during inference. It is often framed as a precise, interpretable, and
potentially safer alternative to fine-tuning. We demonstrate the opposite:
steering systematically breaks model alignment safeguards, making it comply
with harmful requests. Through extensive experiments on different model
families, we show that even steering in a random direction can increase the
probability of harmful compliance from 0% to 2-27%. Alarmingly, steering benign
features from a sparse autoencoder (SAE), a common source of interpretable
directions, increases these rates by a further 2-4%. Finally, we show that
combining 20 randomly sampled vectors that jailbreak a single prompt creates a
universal attack, significantly increasing harmful compliance on unseen
requests. These results challenge the paradigm of safety through
interpretability, showing that precise control over model internals does not
guarantee precise control over model behavior.

*Li Xia,Zheng Liu,Sili Huang,Wei Tang,Xuan Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: NL-SME introduces a nonlinear surrogate for gradient inversion attacks in FedAVG by using learnable quadratic Bézier curves to model SGD trajectories, outperforming linear SMEs and revealing stronger privacy weaknesses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FL preserves data privacy but GIAs threaten data privacy; in multi-step updates, only aggregated gradients are available, and linear SMEs underestimate SGD complexity; need more expressive models to recover data.

Method: Replace linear interpolation with learnable quadratic Bézier curves controlled by points; apply regularization and dvec scaling; train NL-SME to fit observed aggregated gradients and reconstruct data.

Result: On CIFAR-100 and FEMNIST, NL-SME outperforms baselines on all metrics, achieving order-of-magnitude improvements in cosine similarity loss with maintained computational efficiency.

Conclusion: Highlights heightened privacy vulnerabilities in FL's multi-step updates and provides a direction for designing defense strategies, prompting further work on robust defenses.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) preserves privacy by keeping raw data local, yet
Gradient Inversion Attacks (GIAs) pose significant threats. In FedAVG
multi-step scenarios, attackers observe only aggregated gradients, making data
reconstruction challenging. Existing surrogate model methods like SME assume
linear parameter trajectories, but we demonstrate this severely underestimates
SGD's nonlinear complexity, fundamentally limiting attack effectiveness. We
propose Non-Linear Surrogate Model Extension (NL-SME), the first method to
introduce nonlinear parametric trajectory modeling for GIAs. Our approach
replaces linear interpolation with learnable quadratic B\'ezier curves that
capture SGD's curved characteristics through control points, combined with
regularization and dvec scaling mechanisms for enhanced expressiveness.
Extensive experiments on CIFAR-100 and FEMNIST datasets show NL-SME
significantly outperforms baselines across all metrics, achieving
order-of-magnitude improvements in cosine similarity loss while maintaining
computational efficiency.This work exposes heightened privacy vulnerabilities
in FL's multi-step update paradigm and offers novel perspectives for developing
robust defense strategies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Graph-level tasks on very large graphs face substantial scalability challenges. A scalable framework that provides multi-scale representations can improve efficiency without sacrificing accuracy too much.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable success across a range
of learning tasks. However, scaling GNNs to large graphs remains a significant
challenge, especially for graph-level tasks. In this work, we introduce
SHAKE-GNN, a novel scalable graph-level GNN framework based on a hierarchy of
Kirchhoff Forests, a class of random spanning forests used to construct
stochastic multi-resolution decompositions of graphs. SHAKE-GNN produces
multi-scale representations, enabling flexible trade-offs between efficiency
and performance. We introduce an improved, data-driven strategy for selecting
the trade-off parameter and analyse the time-complexity of SHAKE-GNN.

demonstrate that SHAKE-GNN achieves competitive performance while offering

*Marina Ceccon,Alessandro Fabris,Goran Radanović,Asia J. Biega,Gian Antonio Susto*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A time-aware recourse framework using reinforcement learning to model adaptive candidate populations and ensure durability of recommendations over a horizon T, outperforming baselines in simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional algorithmic recourse emphasizes robustness to model updates but largely ignores how applicant pools evolve in response to recommendations. In competitive, resource-constrained settings, recommendations must be durable and valid over time as populations adapt.

Method: Introduce a time-aware framework that explicitly models candidate population dynamics and a reinforcement learning–based recourse algorithm that generates feasible and valid recommendations with durability over a horizon T. Validate through extensive simulations in complex environments.

Result: The proposed approach substantially outperforms existing baselines by achieving a better balance between feasibility and long-term validity, with empirical evidence of durable recommendations across the time horizon.

Conclusion: Incorporating temporal and behavioral dynamics is crucial for practical recourse design. A durable, RL-based recourse framework better handles evolving environments and population responses, suggesting fruitful directions for future dynamic recourse research.

Abstract: Algorithmic recourse seeks to provide individuals with actionable
recommendations that increase their chances of receiving favorable outcomes
from automated decision systems (e.g., loan approvals). While prior research
has emphasized robustness to model updates, considerably less attention has
been given to the temporal dynamics of recourse--particularly in competitive,
resource-constrained settings where recommendations shape future applicant
pools. In this work, we present a novel time-aware framework for algorithmic
recourse, explicitly modeling how candidate populations adapt in response to
recommendations. Additionally, we introduce a novel reinforcement learning
(RL)-based recourse algorithm that captures the evolving dynamics of the
environment to generate recommendations that are both feasible and valid. We
design our recommendations to be durable, supporting validity over a predefined
time horizon T. This durability allows individuals to confidently reapply after
taking time to implement the suggested changes. Through extensive experiments
in complex simulation environments, we show that our approach substantially
outperforms existing baselines, offering a superior balance between feasibility
and long-term validity. Together, these results underscore the importance of
incorporating temporal and behavioral dynamics into the design of practical
recourse systems.

*Maria Iannario,Dae-Jin Lee,Manuele Leonelli*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Presents latent MMHC, a hybrid structure learner for mixed-type variables, to infer directed networks; shows superior performance in simulations and meaningful sport-psychology insights from volleyball data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Psychological attributes interact in networks; need interpretable, data-driven methods to uncover directional relationships among mixed-type traits for athlete development.

Method: Latent MMHC integrates a latent Gaussian copula with a constraint-based skeleton and a constrained score-based refinement to produce a single DAG; includes a bootstrap-aggregated variant; evaluated via simulations across sample size, sparsity, and dimension; applied to Italian female volleyball players' data.

Result: Latent MMHC achieves lower structural Hamming distance and higher edge recall than recent copula-based learners while maintaining high specificity; in application, reveals networks around goal setting and self-confidence, links between emotional arousal, motivation, and anxiety, and up- and downstream placement of Big-Five traits; scenario analyses show how skill improvements propagate to preparation, confidence, and self-esteem.

Conclusion: The approach offers an interpretable, data-driven framework for profiling psychological traits in sport and can support athlete development decisions.

Abstract: Psychological attributes rarely operate in isolation: coaches reason about
networks of related traits. We analyze a new dataset of 164 female volleyball
players from Italy's C and D leagues that combines standardized psychological
profiling with background information. To learn directed relationships among
mixed-type variables (ordinal questionnaire scores, categorical demographics,
continuous indicators), we introduce latent MMHC, a hybrid structure learner
that couples a latent Gaussian copula and a constraint-based skeleton with a
constrained score-based refinement to return a single DAG. We also study a
bootstrap-aggregated variant for stability. In simulations spanning sample
size, sparsity, and dimension, latent Max-Min Hill-Climbing (MMHC) attains
lower structural Hamming distance and higher edge recall than recent
copula-based learners while maintaining high specificity. Applied to
volleyball, the learned network organizes mental skills around goal setting and
self-confidence, with emotional arousal linking motivation and anxiety, and
locates Big-Five traits (notably neuroticism and extraversion) upstream of
skill clusters. Scenario analyses quantify how improvements in specific skills
propagate through the network to shift preparation, confidence, and
self-esteem. The approach provides an interpretable, data-driven framework for
profiling psychological traits in sport and for decision support in athlete
development.

### [270] [Countering adversarial evasion in regression analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22113)
*David Benfield,Phan Tu Vuong,Alain Zemkoho*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a pessimistic bilevel optimization approach for regression to defend against adversarial data, relaxing convexity and uniqueness assumptions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Adversarial ML challenges the assumption of a fixed data distribution; adversaries adapt data to influence outcomes in applications like spam filtering, malware detection, and fake-image generation. Pessimistic bilevel optimization has shown promise for classification but has not yet been applied to regression.

Method: Formulates a pessimistic bilevel optimization program for regression that makes no assumptions about convexity or uniqueness of the adversary's solutions, thus capturing a fully antagonistic interaction.

Result: Introduces the regression-focused pessimistic bilevel formulation and discusses its theoretical properties and potential robustness benefits; the abstract does not report empirical results.

Conclusion: Proposes a regression framework using pessimistic bilevel optimization to mitigate adversarial threats under minimal assumptions about the adversary.

Abstract: Adversarial machine learning challenges the assumption that the underlying
distribution remains consistent throughout the training and implementation of a
prediction model. In particular, adversarial evasion considers scenarios where
adversaries adapt their data to influence particular outcomes from established
prediction models, such scenarios arise in applications such as spam email
filtering, malware detection and fake-image generation, where security methods
must be actively updated to keep up with the ever-improving generation of
malicious data. Game theoretic models have been shown to be effective at
modelling these scenarios and hence training resilient predictors against such
adversaries. Recent advancements in the use of pessimistic bilevel optimsiation
which remove assumptions about the convexity and uniqueness of the adversary's
optimal strategy have proved to be particularly effective at mitigating threats
to classifiers due to its ability to capture the antagonistic nature of the
adversary. However, this formulation has not yet been adapted to regression
scenarios. This article serves to propose a pessimistic bilevel optimisation
program for regression scenarios which makes no assumptions on the convexity or
uniqueness of the adversary's solutions.

### [271] [Learning More with Less: A Dynamic Dual-Level Down-Sampling Framework for Efficient Policy Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22115)
*Chao Wang,Tao Yang,Hongtao Tian,Yunsheng Shi,Qiyao Ma,Xiaotao Liu,Ting Yao,Wenbo Ding*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: D^3S: a two-level dynamic down-sampling framework that selects informative rollouts and tokens to accelerate policy optimization in critic-free RL, with a curriculum-based schedule.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Critic-free methods reduce memory but suffer slow learning due to abundant uninformative samples. There is a need for targeted data selection to boost learning efficiency and generalization.

Method: Two-level selection: (1) sample-level selects rollouts to maximize advantage variance (Var(A)); (2) token-level prioritizes tokens by the product |A|×H to focus on uncertain, impactful updates; employs a dynamic curriculum to progressively relax down-sampling.

Result: On Qwen2.5 and Llama3.1, D^3S-enhanced methods achieve state-of-the-art performance and generalization with fewer samples and tokens across diverse reasoning benchmarks.

Conclusion: D^3S effectively prioritizes informative data to improve efficiency and robustness of critic-free RL; the approach balances rapid early learning with robust generalization, with code to be released.

Abstract: Critic-free methods like GRPO reduce memory demands by estimating advantages
from multiple rollouts but tend to converge slowly, as critical learning
signals are diluted by an abundance of uninformative samples and tokens. To
tackle this challenge, we propose the \textbf{Dynamic Dual-Level Down-Sampling
(D$^3$S)} framework that prioritizes the most informative samples and tokens
across groups to improve the efficient of policy optimization. D$^3$S operates
along two levels: (1) the sample-level, which selects a subset of rollouts to
maximize advantage variance ($\text{Var}(A)$). We theoretically proven that
this selection is positively correlated with the upper bound of the policy
gradient norms, yielding higher policy gradients. (2) the token-level, which
prioritizes tokens with a high product of advantage magnitude and policy
entropy ($|A_{i,t}|\times H_{i,t}$), focusing updates on tokens where the
policy is both uncertain and impactful. Moreover, to prevent overfitting to
high-signal data, D$^3$S employs a dynamic down-sampling schedule inspired by
curriculum learning. This schedule starts with aggressive down-sampling to
accelerate early learning and gradually relaxes to promote robust
generalization. Extensive experiments on Qwen2.5 and Llama3.1 demonstrate that
integrating D$^3$S into advanced RL algorithms achieves state-of-the-art
performance and generalization while requiring \textit{fewer} samples and
tokens across diverse reasoning benchmarks. Our code is added in the
supplementary materials and will be made publicly available.

### [272] [Mind the Missing: Variable-Aware Representation Learning for Irregular EHR Time Series using Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22121)
*Jeong Eul Kwon,Joo Heung Yoon,Hyo Kyung Lee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A variable-aware LLM framework (VITAL) for irregularly sampled EHR time series.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Irregular sampling and high missingness in EHR time series hinder learning; need models that leverage temporal structure and handle missing data effectively.

Method: VITAL re-encodes vital signs into the language space to capture temporal context with explicit missing-value encoding, while laboratories are embedded via summary statistics or a learnable [Not measured] token; the approach distinguishes variable types (vital signs vs labs).

Result: Empirical evaluation on PhysioNet datasets shows VITAL outperforms state-of-the-art methods for irregular time series and remains robust under high missingness.

Conclusion: A variable-aware, LLM-based framework can effectively model irregular clinical time series by customizing representations for different variable types and explicit missing-value handling.

Abstract: Irregular sampling and high missingness are intrinsic challenges in modeling
time series derived from electronic health records (EHRs),where clinical
variables are measured at uneven intervals depending on workflow and
intervention timing. To address this, we propose VITAL, a variable-aware, large
language model (LLM) based framework tailored for learning from irregularly
sampled physiological time series. VITAL differentiates between two distinct
types of clinical variables: vital signs, which are frequently recorded and
exhibit temporal patterns, and laboratory tests, which are measured
sporadically and lack temporal structure. It reprograms vital signs into the
language space, enabling the LLM to capture temporal context and reason over
missing values through explicit encoding. In contrast, laboratory variables are
embedded either using representative summary values or a learnable [Not
measured] token, depending on their availability. Extensive evaluations on the
benchmark datasets from the PhysioNet demonstrate that VITAL outperforms state
of the art methods designed for irregular time series. Furthermore, it
maintains robust performance under high levels of missingness, which is
prevalent in real world clinical scenarios where key variables are often
unavailable.

### [273] [Slicing Wasserstein Over Wasserstein Via Functional Optimal Transport](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22138)
*Moritz Piening,Robert Beinert*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A scalable double-sliced Wasserstein (DSW) distance for meta-measures is proposed, leveraging the 1D Wasserstein isometry to L2 quantile functions and Gaussian-process projections to achieve stable, efficient comparisons of distributions over measures across data domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Wasserstein over Wasserstein (WoW) is powerful but computationally expensive. Existing sliced WoW methods rely on parametric meta-measures or higher-order moments, which can cause numerical instability. A general, stable, scalable metric for meta-measures is needed.

Method: Introduce a general sliced Wasserstein framework for arbitrary Banach spaces. Utilize the 1D-Wasserstein isometry with quantile functions in L2([0,1]). Define 1D meta-measure slices via infinite-dimensional L2 projections parameterized by Gaussian processes. Combine with integration over the unit sphere to form the double-sliced Wasserstein (DSW) distance for general meta-measures.

Result: Show that DSW minimization is equivalent to WoW minimization for discretized meta-measures and avoids unstable higher-order moments, yielding computational savings. Numerical experiments on datasets, shapes, and images validate DSW as a scalable substitute for WoW.

Conclusion: DSW provides a stable, scalable alternative to WoW for comparing meta-measures across diverse domains, reducing computational cost and instability while maintaining fidelity on discretized representations.

Abstract: Wasserstein distances define a metric between probability measures on
arbitrary metric spaces, including meta-measures (measures over measures). The
resulting Wasserstein over Wasserstein (WoW) distance is a powerful, but
computationally costly tool for comparing datasets or distributions over images
and shapes. Existing sliced WoW accelerations rely on parametric meta-measures
or the existence of high-order moments, leading to numerical instability. As an
alternative, we propose to leverage the isometry between the 1d Wasserstein
space and the quantile functions in the function space $L_2([0,1])$. For this
purpose, we introduce a general sliced Wasserstein framework for arbitrary
Banach spaces. Due to the 1d Wasserstein isometry, this framework defines a
sliced distance between 1d meta-measures via infinite-dimensional
$L_2$-projections, parametrized by Gaussian processes. Combining this 1d
construction with classical integration over the Euclidean unit sphere yields
the double-sliced Wasserstein (DSW) metric for general meta-measures. We show
that DSW minimization is equivalent to WoW minimization for discretized
meta-measures, while avoiding unstable higher-order moments and computational
savings. Numerical experiments on datasets, shapes, and images validate DSW as
a scalable substitute for the WoW distance.

### [274] [Pushing Toward the Simplex Vertices: A Simple Remedy for Code Collapse in Smoothed Vector Quantization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22161)
*Takashi Morita*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A lightweight regularizer for smoothed vector quantization that jointly enforces near-onehot codes and full codebook usage by aligning each codebook entry with its K-nearest smoothed quantizers; improves codebook utilization and downstream performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Non-differentiable quantization obstructs gradient flow. Existing smoothing methods often optimize either approximation quality or codebook usage in isolation; a single approach that achieves both is desirable for stable training and strong representations.

Method: Introduce a simple regularization term that minimizes the distance between each simplex vertex (codebook entry) and its K-nearest smoothed quantizers (weighted combinations of codebook entries). This encourages quantizers to stay close to onehot-like vertices while ensuring diverse utilization of all codebook entries.

Result: Empirical evaluation on discrete image autoencoding and contrastive speech representation learning shows improved codebook utilization and better performance compared with prior smoothing methods.

Conclusion: The proposed regularization effectively enforces both tight onehot-like quantization and full codebook usage in a single objective, offering a simple and effective improvement over existing smoothed quantization approaches.

Abstract: Vector quantization, which discretizes a continuous vector space into a
finite set of representative vectors (a codebook), has been widely adopted in
modern machine learning. Despite its effectiveness, vector quantization poses a
fundamental challenge: the non-differentiable quantization step blocks gradient
backpropagation. Smoothed vector quantization addresses this issue by relaxing
the hard assignment of a codebook vector into a weighted combination of
codebook entries, represented as the matrix product of a simplex vector and the
codebook. Effective smoothing requires two properties: (1) smoothed quantizers
should remain close to a onehot vector, ensuring tight approximation, and (2)
all codebook entries should be utilized, preventing code collapse. Existing
methods typically address these desiderata separately. By contrast, the present
study introduces a simple and intuitive regularization that promotes both
simultaneously by minimizing the distance between each simplex vertex and its
$K$-nearest smoothed quantizers. Experiments on representative benchmarks,
including discrete image autoencoding and contrastive speech representation
learning, demonstrate that the proposed method achieves more reliable codebook
utilization and improves performance compared to prior approaches.

*Shirin Alanova,Kristina Kazistova,Ekaterina Galaeva,Alina Kostromina,Vladimir Smirnov,Redko Dmitry,Alexey Dontsov,Maxim Zhelnin,Evgeny Burnaev,Egor Shvetsov*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Post-training N:M activation pruning in LLMs outperforms weight pruning at the same sparsity in preserving generative abilities. Among patterns, 16:32 approaches unstructured sparsity in performance, but 8:16 offers the best hardware-friendly trade-off; results enable practical activation pruning methods and motivate hardware to support flexible sparsity. Code provided by authors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Efficient LLM inference is hampered by high compute and I/O costs. Activation pruning via N:M sparsity promises dynamic, input-adaptive compression and reduced I/O, but has been underexplored compared to weight pruning. This work investigates post-training activation pruning to deliver practical, hardware-friendly sparsity.

Method: Conduct a comprehensive, post-training analysis of N:M activation pruning across multiple LLMs. Evaluate pruning criteria and lightweight error mitigation techniques. Compare standard 2:4 patterns with alternative sparsity patterns (16:32 and 8:16). Assess generative quality preservation versus weight pruning at equivalent sparsity and establish hardware-friendly baselines with minimal calibration.

Result: Activation pruning preserves generative capabilities better than weight pruning at equal sparsity. Larger N:M patterns (16:32) nearly match unstructured sparsity in performance; however, the 8:16 pattern offers a favorable balance between performance and hardware implementation complexity. The study provides practical pruning methods and supports the case for hardware that supports more flexible sparsity patterns.

Conclusion: The work delivers actionable activation-pruning methods that are hardware-friendly and highlights a path for future hardware to support flexible N:M sparsity. It also provides a code resource for replication and further exploration.

Abstract: The demand for efficient large language model (LLM) inference has intensified
the focus on sparsification techniques. While semi-structured (N:M) pruning is
well-established for weights, its application to activation pruning remains
underexplored despite its potential for dynamic, input-adaptive compression and
reductions in I/O overhead. This work presents a comprehensive analysis of
methods for post-training N:M activation pruning in LLMs. Across multiple LLMs,
we demonstrate that pruning activations enables superior preservation of
generative capabilities compared to weight pruning at equivalent sparsity
levels. We evaluate lightweight, plug-and-play error mitigation techniques and
pruning criteria, establishing strong hardware-friendly baselines that require
minimal calibration. Furthermore, we explore sparsity patterns beyond NVIDIA's
standard 2:4, showing that the 16:32 pattern achieves performance nearly on par
with unstructured sparsity. However, considering the trade-off between
flexibility and hardware implementation complexity, we focus on the 8:16
pattern as a superior candidate. Our findings provide both effective practical
methods for activation pruning and a motivation for future hardware to support
more flexible sparsity patterns. Our code is available

*Durgesh Kalwar,Mayank Baranwal,Harshad Khadilkar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DYNAWEIGHT dynamically allocates weights to neighboring servers based on their local losses, accelerating decentralized learning with minimal communication and memory overhead, outperforming static schemes like Metropolis in heterogeneous-data settings; it is compatible with any server-level optimization algorithm.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In privacy-sensitive, data-centralized contexts, distributed learning is essential. In fully decentralized systems with no central aggregator, local processing dominates. Data heterogeneity across servers calls for adaptive information aggregation to speed up convergence while keeping overhead low.

Method: Introduce DYNAWEIGHT, a framework that assigns adaptive weights to neighboring servers according to their relative losses on local datasets. This dynamic weighting favors diverse information and is designed to incur minimal extra communication and memory. It is a general aggregation scheme that can be plugged into any underlying server-level optimization algorithm.

Result: Empirical evaluation on MNIST, CIFAR10, and CIFAR100 across varying server counts and graph topologies shows significant training speedups. DYNAWEIGHT provides acceleration with minimal overhead and demonstrates versatility as an aggregation component compatible with existing optimization methods.

Conclusion: DYNAWEIGHT offers a flexible, efficient aggregation mechanism for decentralized learning that improves training speed in heterogeneous data settings and can be integrated with a wide range of optimization algorithms, suggesting broad applicability in decentralized AI systems.

Abstract: In today's data-sensitive landscape, distributed learning emerges as a vital
tool, not only fortifying privacy measures but also streamlining computational
operations. This becomes especially crucial within fully decentralized
infrastructures where local processing is imperative due to the absence of
centralized aggregation. Here, we introduce DYNAWEIGHT, a novel framework to
information aggregation in multi-agent networks. DYNAWEIGHT offers substantial
acceleration in decentralized learning with minimal additional communication
and memory overhead. Unlike traditional static weight assignments, such as
Metropolis weights, DYNAWEIGHT dynamically allocates weights to neighboring
servers based on their relative losses on local datasets. Consequently, it
favors servers possessing diverse information, particularly in scenarios of
substantial data heterogeneity. Our experiments on various datasets MNIST,
CIFAR10, and CIFAR100 incorporating various server counts and graph topologies,
demonstrate notable enhancements in training speeds. Notably, DYNAWEIGHT
functions as an aggregation scheme compatible with any underlying server-level
optimization algorithm, underscoring its versatility and potential for
widespread integration.

### [277] [Learning Equivariant Functions via Quadratic Forms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22184)
*Pavan Karjol,Vivek V Kashyap,Rohan Kashyap,Prathosh A P*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A framework to learn group equivariant functions by estimating the quadratic form x^T A x for an (assumed) orthogonal symmetry, yielding invariant norm-preserving models and product-structured equivariants; extends to multi-input tuples with angular and scale-invariant components; demonstrates on polynomial regression, top quark tagging, and moment of inertia prediction, outperforming baselines in symmetry discovery and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To automatically discover and leverage symmetries in data by recovering the underlying orthogonal group via a single quadratic form, enabling inductive biases that simplify models and improve learning of equivariant functions.

Method: Learn the symmetric matrix A defining the quadratic form x^T A x from data, exploiting its diagonal form for network design to obtain a norm-preserving invariant and a product-structured equivariant model; extend to tuples with a diagonal (product) group action by decomposing equivariance into an angular component from the first vector’s normalization and a scale-invariant component from the Gram matrix of the tuple.

Result: The proposed framework yields models that successfully discover the underlying symmetry and learn the corresponding equivariant functions, outperforming baselines across tasks.

Conclusion: A principled approach to recovering and exploiting group symmetry—particularly orthogonal groups—through a quadratic-form representation leads to simpler, efficient architectures and extends naturally to multi-input settings with interpretable decompositions of equivariant behavior.

Abstract: In this study, we introduce a method for learning group (known or unknown)
equivariant functions by learning the associated quadratic form $x^T A x$
corresponding to the group from the data. Certain groups, known as orthogonal
groups, preserve a specific quadratic form, and we leverage this property to
uncover the underlying symmetry group under the assumption that it is
orthogonal. By utilizing the corresponding unique symmetric matrix and its
inherent diagonal form, we incorporate suitable inductive biases into the
neural network architecture, leading to models that are both simplified and
efficient. Our approach results in an invariant model that preserves norms,
while the equivariant model is represented as a product of a norm-invariant
model and a scale-invariant model, where the ``product'' refers to the group
action.
  Moreover, we extend our framework to a more general setting where the
function acts on tuples of input vectors via a diagonal (or product) group
action. In this extension, the equivariant function is decomposed into an
angular component extracted solely from the normalized first vector and a
scale-invariant component that depends on the full Gram matrix of the tuple.
This decomposition captures the inter-dependencies between multiple inputs
while preserving the underlying group symmetry.
  We assess the effectiveness of our framework across multiple tasks, including
polynomial regression, top quark tagging, and moment of inertia matrix
prediction. Comparative analysis with baseline methods demonstrates that our
model consistently excels in both discovering the underlying symmetry and
efficiently learning the corresponding equivariant function.

### [278] [Mechanistic Independence: A Principle for Identifiable Disentangled Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22196)
*Stefan Matthes,Zhiwei Han,Hao Shen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A unified mechanistic-independence framework enables identifiability of disentangled representations via multiple independence criteria (support, sparsity, higher-order), even under nonlinear/non-invertible mixing, with latent subspaces identified as connected components through a graph-theoretic view, without relying on latent-density statistics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Identifiability in disentangled representations remains unresolved and often depends on statistical assumptions about latent densities. A framework based on how latent factors mechanistically affect observed data should preserve identifiability despite changes in latent-density and dependencies.

Method: Introduce mechanistic independence as the organizing principle. Propose multiple related independence criteria (support-based, sparsity-based, higher-order). Prove identifiability of latent subspaces under nonlinear, non-invertible mixing. Establish a hierarchy among criteria and a graph-theoretic characterization of latent subspaces as connected components.

Result: Each independence criterion yields identifiability of latent subspaces, even with complex mixing. The framework is invariant to latent-density changes, and a hierarchy among criteria is established with a graph-based representation that connects latent subspaces as connected components.

Conclusion: The paper clarifies when disentangled representations can be identified without statistical assumptions, offering a unified framework and structural (graph-theoretic) insights into latent subspace identification.

Abstract: Disentangled representations seek to recover latent factors of variation
underlying observed data, yet their identifiability is still not fully
understood. We introduce a unified framework in which disentanglement is
achieved through mechanistic independence, which characterizes latent factors
by how they act on observed variables rather than by their latent distribution.
This perspective is invariant to changes of the latent density, even when such
changes induce statistical dependencies among factors. Within this framework,
we propose several related independence criteria -- ranging from support-based
and sparsity-based to higher-order conditions -- and show that each yields
identifiability of latent subspaces, even under nonlinear, non-invertible
mixing. We further establish a hierarchy among these criteria and provide a
graph-theoretic characterization of latent subspaces as connected components.
Together, these results clarify the conditions under which disentangled
representations can be identified without relying on statistical assumptions.

*Duc Thien Nguyen,Konstantinos Slavakis,Eleftherios Kofidis,Dimitris Pados*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces KReTTaH, a regression-based, interpretable framework for imputing missing multi-way data using kernel regression on tensors with fixed TT-rank, enhanced by Hadamard overparametrization to promote sparsity; learns on a Riemannian manifold and can incorporate graph priors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the need for interpretable, parameter-efficient imputation of high-dimensional, structured (multi-way) data. Combines nonparametric RKHS regression with low-rank tensor representations to handle missing data, particularly in time-varying graphs.

Method: Nonparametric regression in RKHS with tensor-train (TT) representations of fixed rank. Hadamard overparametrization to induce sparsity in TT parameters. Learning framed as a smooth inverse problem on the Riemannian manifold of fixed TT-rank tensors. Application to dynamic graph flows with graph-topological priors.

Result: Empirical studies on real-world graph datasets show KReTTaH consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, including nonparametric tensor-based and neural-network-based imputers, at imputing missing, time-varying edge flows.

Conclusion: KReTTaH offers a flexible, parameter-efficient, and interpretable framework for multi-way data imputation, capable of exploiting graph priors and achieving superior performance on dynamic graph flow tasks.

Abstract: A regression-based framework for interpretable multi-way data imputation,
termed Kernel Regression via Tensor Trains with Hadamard overparametrization
(KReTTaH), is introduced. KReTTaH adopts a nonparametric formulation by casting
imputation as regression via reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. Parameter
efficiency is achieved through tensors of fixed tensor-train (TT) rank, which
reside on low-dimensional Riemannian manifolds, and is further enhanced via
Hadamard overparametrization, which promotes sparsity within the TT parameter
space. Learning is accomplished by solving a smooth inverse problem posed on
the Riemannian manifold of fixed TT-rank tensors. As a representative
application, the estimation of dynamic graph flows is considered. In this
setting, KReTTaH exhibits flexibility by seamlessly incorporating graph-based
(topological) priors via its inverse problem formulation. Numerical tests on
real-world graph datasets demonstrate that KReTTaH consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art alternatives-including a nonparametric tensor- and a
neural-network-based methods-for imputing missing, time-varying edge flows.

### [280] [Reversible GNS for Dissipative Fluids with Consistent Bidirectional Dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22207)
*Mu Huang,Linning Xu,Mingyue Dai,Yidi Shao,Bo Dai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces Reversible Graph Network Simulator (R-GNS) that unifies forward and inverse dissipative fluid simulation in a single invertible graph neural network, enabling fast inverse inference and accurate forward dynamics with fewer parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Inverse inference for dissipative fluids is hard due to irreversibility and instability of optimization-based solvers. A fast, stable method that can recover plausible initial states while ensuring bidirectional consistency is needed.

Method: A mathematically invertible design based on residual reversible message passing with shared parameters within a single graph architecture to couple forward dynamics with inverse inference, rather than reversing physics.

Result: On three dissipative benchmarks (Water-3D, WaterRamps, WaterDrop), R-GNS achieves higher accuracy and consistency with only one quarter the parameters, and enables inverse inference more than 100x faster than optimization-based baselines. Forward simulation speed is on par with strong GNS baselines; goal-conditioned tasks avoid iterative optimization and reach orders-of-magnitude speedups, closely matching physically plausible target trajectories and complex shapes (e.g., characters).

Conclusion: This work presents the first reversible framework that unifies forward and inverse simulation for dissipative fluid systems, delivering faster, more accurate predictions and enabling efficient goal-directed control.

Abstract: Simulating physically plausible trajectories toward user-defined goals is a
fundamental yet challenging task in fluid dynamics. While particle-based
simulators can efficiently reproduce forward dynamics, inverse inference
remains difficult, especially in dissipative systems where dynamics are
irreversible and optimization-based solvers are slow, unstable, and often fail
to converge. In this work, we introduce the Reversible Graph Network Simulator
(R-GNS), a unified framework that enforces bidirectional consistency within a
single graph architecture. Unlike prior neural simulators that approximate
inverse dynamics by fitting backward data, R-GNS does not attempt to reverse
the underlying physics. Instead, we propose a mathematically invertible design
based on residual reversible message passing with shared parameters, coupling
forward dynamics with inverse inference to deliver accurate predictions and
efficient recovery of plausible initial states. Experiments on three
dissipative benchmarks (Water-3D, WaterRamps, and WaterDrop) show that R-GNS
achieves higher accuracy and consistency with only one quarter of the
parameters, and performs inverse inference more than 100 times faster than
optimization-based baselines. For forward simulation, R-GNS matches the speed
of strong GNS baselines, while in goal-conditioned tasks it eliminates
iterative optimization and achieves orders-of-magnitude speedups. On
goal-conditioned tasks, R-GNS further demonstrates its ability to complex
target shapes (e.g., characters "L" and "N") through vivid, physically
consistent trajectories. To our knowledge, this is the first reversible
framework that unifies forward and inverse simulation for dissipative fluid
systems.

### [281] [A Law of Data Reconstruction for Random Features (and Beyond)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22214)
*Leonardo Iurada,Simone Bombari,Tatiana Tommasi,Marco Mondelli*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A theory and method show that in the random features regime, when the number of parameters p exceeds dn (d = data dimensionality), the training data can be fully reconstructed from model parameters, revealing a data-reconstruction law across architectures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand memorization not only as label fitting but as the ability to reconstruct training data from the model, and to quantify how this capability scales with data dimensionality and parameter count.

Method: Theoretical analysis in the random-features model showing that the subspace spanned by training samples in feature space contains enough information to identify input-space samples. Proposes an optimization procedure to reconstruct the dataset from model parameters and validates the approach on random features, two-layer fully-connected networks, and deep residual networks.

Result: Demonstrates that, when p ≫ dn, the entire training dataset can be recovered; the subspace of feature-space training samples suffices to identify individual inputs; the reconstruction method performs well across tested architectures.

Conclusion: Data reconstruction memorization follows a dn-threshold law: once the parameter count surpasses dn, the training data can be fully recovered from the model, highlighting privacy and memorization concerns and suggesting bounds on p relative to dn to mitigate leakage.

Abstract: Large-scale deep learning models are known to memorize parts of the training
set. In machine learning theory, memorization is often framed as interpolation
or label fitting, and classical results show that this can be achieved when the
number of parameters $p$ in the model is larger than the number of training
samples $n$. In this work, we consider memorization from the perspective of
data reconstruction, demonstrating that this can be achieved when $p$ is larger
than $dn$, where $d$ is the dimensionality of the data. More specifically, we
show that, in the random features model, when $p \gg dn$, the subspace spanned
by the training samples in feature space gives sufficient information to
identify the individual samples in input space. Our analysis suggests an
optimization method to reconstruct the dataset from the model parameters, and
we demonstrate that this method performs well on various architectures (random
features, two-layer fully-connected and deep residual networks). Our results
reveal a law of data reconstruction, according to which the entire training
dataset can be recovered as $p$ exceeds the threshold $dn$.

### [282] [Automatic Discovery of One Parameter Subgroups of $SO(n)$](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22219)
*Pavan Karjol,Vivek V Kashyap,Rohan Kashyap,Prathosh A P*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A framework to automatically discover one-parameter subgroups of SO(n) using the Jordan form of skew-symmetric matrices, providing canonical orbit forms and symmetry-aware representations, with applications in mechanics and physics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: One-parameter subgroups of SO(n) underpin many symmetric models in robotics, quantum mechanics, and molecular analysis. Automatic discovery and interpretable representations of these subgroups can enhance learning and interpretation, especially for invariant functions.

Method: Utilizes the Jordan form of skew-symmetric matrices (the Lie algebra of SO(n)) to derive a canonical form for orbits under H_gamma. Learns subgroup parameters gamma to identify the underlying H_gamma. Constructs standardized representations for H_gamma-invariant functions to enable symmetry-aware learning.

Result: Empirically validates the approach on tasks such as double pendulum modeling, moment of inertia prediction, top quark tagging, and invariant polynomial regression, recovering meaningful subgroup structure and producing interpretable representations.

Conclusion: The framework enables automatic discovery of one-parameter subgroups with interpretable, symmetry-aware representations across diverse domains; it highlights a practical methodology for leveraging Lie-theoretic structure in learning tasks.

Abstract: We introduce a novel framework for the automatic discovery of one-parameter
subgroups ($H_{\gamma}$) of $SO(3)$ and, more generally, $SO(n)$. One-parameter
subgroups of $SO(n)$ are crucial in a wide range of applications, including
robotics, quantum mechanics, and molecular structure analysis. Our method
utilizes the standard Jordan form of skew-symmetric matrices, which define the
Lie algebra of $SO(n)$, to establish a canonical form for orbits under the
action of $H_{\gamma}$. This canonical form is then employed to derive a
standardized representation for $H_{\gamma}$-invariant functions. By learning
the appropriate parameters, the framework uncovers the underlying one-parameter
subgroup $H_{\gamma}$. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is
demonstrated through tasks such as double pendulum modeling, moment of inertia
prediction, top quark tagging and invariant polynomial regression, where it
successfully recovers meaningful subgroup structure and produces interpretable,
symmetry-aware representations.

### [283] [Fairness-Aware Reinforcement Learning (FAReL): A Framework for Transparent and Balanced Sequential Decision-Making](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22232)
*Alexandra Cimpean,Nicole Orzan,Catholijn Jonker,Pieter Libin,Ann Nowé*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A fairness-aware RL framework (fMDP) is proposed to explore multiple performance–fairness trade-offs in sequential decision problems. It encodes individuals and groups, formalizes time-aware fairness notions, and learns policies that achieve higher fairness with only modest performance loss across hiring and fraud-detection scenarios. The results show group and individual fairness notions can diverge, and the paper provides guidelines for applying the framework across settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world sequential decisions must balance performance with fairness, but the desired trade-off is hard to specify a priori. A framework that can explore multiple trade-offs and provide actionable insights can help stakeholders select appropriate policies.

Method: Introduce fMDP, an extended Markov decision process that explicitly encodes individuals and groups. Formalize fairness notions in sequential decision contexts and compute fairness measures over time. Use RL to learn policies that trade off performance and fairness and evaluate on two scenarios: job hiring and fraud detection.

Result: The framework learns policies that are more fair across multiple scenarios with only minor degradation in performance rewards. It also reveals that group and individual fairness notions do not necessarily imply one another, underscoring the value of examining both.

Conclusion: A practical framework for fairness-aware sequential decision making that enables exploration of trade-offs, guides policy selection, and is adaptable to diverse problem settings; includes guidelines for applying the approach across domains.

Abstract: Equity in real-world sequential decision problems can be enforced using
fairness-aware methods. Therefore, we require algorithms that can make suitable
and transparent trade-offs between performance and the desired fairness
notions. As the desired performance-fairness trade-off is hard to specify a
priori, we propose a framework where multiple trade-offs can be explored.
Insights provided by the reinforcement learning algorithm regarding the
obtainable performance-fairness trade-offs can then guide stakeholders in
selecting the most appropriate policy. To capture fairness, we propose an
extended Markov decision process, $f$MDP, that explicitly encodes individuals
and groups. Given this $f$MDP, we formalise fairness notions in the context of
sequential decision problems and formulate a fairness framework that computes
fairness measures over time. We evaluate our framework in two scenarios with
distinct fairness requirements: job hiring, where strong teams must be composed
while treating applicants equally, and fraud detection, where fraudulent
transactions must be detected while ensuring the burden on customers is fairly
distributed. We show that our framework learns policies that are more fair
across multiple scenarios, with only minor loss in performance reward.
Moreover, we observe that group and individual fairness notions do not
necessarily imply one another, highlighting the benefit of our framework in
settings where both fairness types are desired. Finally, we provide guidelines
on how to apply this framework across different problem settings.

### [284] [ASSESS: A Semantic and Structural Evaluation Framework for Statement Similarity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22246)
*Xiaoyang Liu,Tao Zhu,Zineng Dong,Yuntian Liu,Qingfeng Guo,Zhaoxuan Liu,Yu Chen,Tao Luo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ASSESS combines semantic and structural evaluation for statement similarity in autoformalization, via Operator Trees and a semantic-aware Tree Edit Distance (TransTED), and introduces EPLA, a benchmark with expert-annotated pairs demonstrating state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing metrics for formal statement similarity either capture syntax (string-based) but miss semantics, or validate semantic provability (proof-based) but ignore structural nuances and fail to provide graded similarity when proofs fail. There is a need for a continuous, combined semantic-structural similarity measure.

Method: Formal statements are converted into Operator Trees to capture syntax; TransTED, a Transformation Tree Edit Distance, extends traditional tree edit distance with semantic-aware transformations to compute similarity; EPLA benchmark (524 expert-annotated pairs from miniF2F and ProofNet) labels both semantic provability and structural likeness; code and dataset to be released.

Result: TransTED Similarity achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and the highest Cohen’s kappa on EPLA, outperforming existing methods. EPLA provides a rigorous, graded evaluation for both semantic and structural aspects of autoformalization statements.

Conclusion: The ASSESS framework offers a unified, continuous measure of statement similarity that integrates semantic and structural information, supported by the EPLA benchmark, with code to be released to facilitate progress in autoformalization evaluation.

Abstract: Statement autoformalization, the automated translation of statements from
natural language into formal languages, has seen significant advancements, yet
the development of automated evaluation metrics remains limited. Existing
metrics for formal statement similarity often fail to balance semantic and
structural information. String-based approaches capture syntactic structure but
ignore semantic meaning, whereas proof-based methods validate semantic
equivalence but disregard structural nuances and, critically, provide no graded
similarity score in the event of proof failure. To address these issues, we
introduce ASSESS (A Semantic and Structural Evaluation Framework for Statement
Similarity), which comprehensively integrates semantic and structural
information to provide a continuous similarity score. Our framework first
transforms formal statements into Operator Trees to capture their syntactic
structure and then computes a similarity score using our novel TransTED
(Transformation Tree Edit Distance) Similarity metric, which enhances
traditional Tree Edit Distance by incorporating semantic awareness through
transformations. For rigorous validation, we present EPLA (Evaluating
Provability and Likeness for Autoformalization), a new benchmark of 524
expert-annotated formal statement pairs derived from miniF2F and ProofNet, with
labels for both semantic provability and structural likeness. Experiments on
EPLA demonstrate that TransTED Similarity outperforms existing methods,
achieving state-of-the-art accuracy and the highest Kappa coefficient. The
benchmark, and implementation code will be made public soon.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: WIRE generalizes RoPE to graphs, providing wavelet-inspired rotary encodings with permutation equivariance and linear-attention compatibility; it recovers RoPE on grid graphs and performs well on graph-aware tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extend effective positional encodings to graph-structured data to leverage attention while respecting permutation symmetry and graph topology.

Method: Define Wavelet-Induced Rotary Encoding (WIRE) that generalizes RoPE to graphs, proving permutation equivariance, linear-attention compatibility, and (under assumptions) asymptotic dependence on resistive distance; show RoPE as a special case on grid graphs; evaluate on synthetic and real graph tasks.

Result: WIRE is effective for tasks where graph structure matters, recovering RoPE in grid cases and performing well on tasks like monochromatic subgraph detection and point-cloud segmentation, among standard graph benchmarks.

Conclusion: WIRE provides a general, theoretically principled positional encoding for graphs that extends RoPE, preserving key properties while enabling graph-aware attention mechanisms.

Abstract: We introduce WIRE: Wavelet-Induced Rotary Encodings. WIRE extends Rotary
Position Encodings (RoPE), a popular algorithm in LLMs and ViTs, to
graph-structured data. We demonstrate that WIRE is more general than RoPE,
recovering the latter in the special case of grid graphs. WIRE also enjoys a
host of desirable theoretical properties, including equivariance under node
ordering permutation, compatibility with linear attention, and (under select
assumptions) asymptotic dependence on graph resistive distance. We test WIRE on
a range of synthetic and real-world tasks, including identifying monochromatic
subgraphs, semantic segmentation of point clouds, and more standard graph
benchmarks. We find it to be effective in settings where the underlying graph
structure is important.

*Nakyeong Yang,Dong-Kyum Kim,Jea Kwon,Minsung Kim,Kyomin Jung,Meeyoung Cha*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Current unlearning methods for LLMs perform shallow erasure, creating spurious negative influence; proposed Ssiuu uses attribution-guided regularization to faithfully erase target knowledge and outperforms baselines in adversarial and benign retraining scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Memorization of private data by large language models poses privacy risks. Existing unlearning methods can be bypassed by relearning, and suffer from shallow alignment, failing to faithfully erase knowledge.

Method: Introduce Ssiuu, a new class of unlearning methods that uses attribution-guided regularization to prevent spurious negative influence and faithfully remove target knowledge during retraining.

Result: Empirical results show reliable erasure of target knowledge and superior performance over strong baselines across two retraining scenarios: (1) adversarial injection of private data, and (2) benign instruction-following benchmark.

Conclusion: Robust and faithful unlearning is essential for safe deployment of language models; Ssiuu presents a promising approach to achieve faithful knowledge erasure.

Abstract: Large language models trained on web-scale data can memorize private or
sensitive knowledge, raising significant privacy risks. Although some
unlearning methods mitigate these risks, they remain vulnerable to "relearning"
during subsequent training, allowing a substantial portion of forgotten
knowledge to resurface. In this paper, we show that widely used unlearning
methods cause shallow alignment: instead of faithfully erasing target
knowledge, they generate spurious unlearning neurons that amplify negative
influence to hide it. To overcome this limitation, we introduce Ssiuu, a new
class of unlearning methods that employs attribution-guided regularization to
prevent spurious negative influence and faithfully remove target knowledge.
Experimental results confirm that our method reliably erases target knowledge
and outperforms strong baselines across two practical retraining scenarios: (1)
adversarial injection of private data, and (2) benign attack using an
instruction-following benchmark. Our findings highlight the necessity of robust
and faithful unlearning methods for safe deployment of language models.

### [287] [Towards a more realistic evaluation of machine learning models for bearing fault diagnosis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22267)
*João Paulo Vieira,Victor Afonso Bauler,Rodrigo Kobashikawa Rosa,Danilo Silva*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Leakage-aware evaluation is essential; bearing-wise split prevents data leakage and multi-label approach with Macro AUROC; dataset diversity (unique bearings) key for generalization; validated on CWRU, PU, UORED-VAFCLS; provides guidelines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current ML-based bearing fault diagnosis often reports inflated performance due to data leakage in dataset splits; real-world generalization remains questionable. The study aims to diagnose leakage issues and establish robust evaluation protocols; also to enable detection of co-occurring faults and to assess how dataset diversity affects generalization.

Method: 1) Propose leakage-free evaluation via bearing-wise partitioning with no overlap of physical components between training and test; 2) Reformulate as multi-label classification to handle co-occurring fault types; 3) Use Macro AUROC to evaluate performance independent of class prevalence; 4) Investigate effect of dataset diversity by varying number of unique bearings in training; 5) Empirically evaluate on CWRU, PU, UORED-VAFCLS.

Result: Leakage-free evaluation yields lower, more realistic performance; spurious correlations in segment-wise/condition-wise splits inflate metrics; Macro AUROC provides stable comparison; increase in unique training bearings improves generalization; cross-dataset variability indicates the need for diverse data; leakage-aware guidelines for partitioning, model selection, validation.

Conclusion: Evaluations in ML-based bearing fault diagnosis must account for data leakage; bearing-wise partitioning and a multi-label, Macro AUROC framework yield trustworthy assessments; dataset diversity is a crucial determinant of generalization; the work provides practical guidelines to advance robust, trustworthy industrial fault diagnosis.

Abstract: Reliable detection of bearing faults is essential for maintaining the safety
and operational efficiency of rotating machinery. While recent advances in
machine learning (ML), particularly deep learning, have shown strong
performance in controlled settings, many studies fail to generalize to
real-world applications due to methodological flaws, most notably data leakage.
This paper investigates the issue of data leakage in vibration-based bearing
fault diagnosis and its impact on model evaluation. We demonstrate that common
dataset partitioning strategies, such as segment-wise and condition-wise
splits, introduce spurious correlations that inflate performance metrics. To
address this, we propose a rigorous, leakage-free evaluation methodology
centered on bearing-wise data partitioning, ensuring no overlap between the
physical components used for training and testing. Additionally, we reformulate
the classification task as a multi-label problem, enabling the detection of
co-occurring fault types and the use of prevalence-independent metrics such as
Macro AUROC. Beyond preventing leakage, we also examine the effect of dataset
diversity on generalization, showing that the number of unique training
bearings is a decisive factor for achieving robust performance. We evaluate our
methodology on three widely adopted datasets: CWRU, Paderborn University (PU),
and University of Ottawa (UORED-VAFCLS). This study highlights the importance
of leakage-aware evaluation protocols and provides practical guidelines for
dataset partitioning, model selection, and validation, fostering the
development of more trustworthy ML systems for industrial fault diagnosis
applications.

*Nassim Walha,Sebastian G. Gruber,Thomas Decker,Yinchong Yang,Alireza Javanmardi,Eyke Hüllermeier,Florian Buettner*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes Spectral Uncertainty, a Von Neumann entropy–based framework to decompose total uncertainty in LLMs into aleatoric and epistemic parts, aided by a fine-grained semantic similarity representation; claims superior accuracy over baselines on multiple models and benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a critical need for reliable predictive uncertainty in LLMs. Existing methods struggle to cleanly separate aleatoric (data-inherent) from epistemic (model-related) uncertainty. The work aims to provide a rigorous, semantically aware decomposition.

Method: Define total uncertainty via Von Neumann entropy; decompose into aleatoric and epistemic components; incorporate a fine-grained representation of semantic similarity to distinguish semantic interpretations; evaluate against baselines across diverse models and benchmark datasets.

Result: Spectral Uncertainty outperforms state-of-the-art methods in estimating both aleatoric and total uncertainty across diverse models and benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: Provides a rigorous foundation for uncertainty decomposition in LLMs using spectral methods and semantic similarity; demonstrates empirical advantages and potential for broader applicability.

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated in diverse
applications, obtaining reliable measures of their predictive uncertainty has
become critically important. A precise distinction between aleatoric
uncertainty, arising from inherent ambiguities within input data, and epistemic
uncertainty, originating exclusively from model limitations, is essential to
effectively address each uncertainty source. In this paper, we introduce
Spectral Uncertainty, a novel approach to quantifying and decomposing
uncertainties in LLMs. Leveraging the Von Neumann entropy from quantum
information theory, Spectral Uncertainty provides a rigorous theoretical
foundation for separating total uncertainty into distinct aleatoric and
epistemic components. Unlike existing baseline methods, our approach
incorporates a fine-grained representation of semantic similarity, enabling
nuanced differentiation among various semantic interpretations in model
responses. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that Spectral Uncertainty
outperforms state-of-the-art methods in estimating both aleatoric and total
uncertainty across diverse models and benchmark datasets.

*Xingjian Wu,Zhengyu Li,Hanyin Cheng,Xiangfei Qiu,Jilin Hu,Chenjuan Guo,Bin Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PatchMoE is a task-aware MoE framework for time series that uses Recurrent Noisy Gating and token-level routing across time and channels with a load-balancing loss, achieving state-of-the-art results on five downstream tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) struggles in time series due to task-agnostic routing and poor modeling of channel correlations. Time-series tasks (e.g., forecasting, classification) exhibit hierarchical representations that vary by task, necessitating task-aware routing and better cross-task knowledge utilization.

Method: PatchMoE introduces a general MoE-based time-series framework. It employs Recurrent Noisy Gating to exploit hierarchical representations for different tasks. Routing operates on time-series tokens in both temporal and channel dimensions and is guided by a Temporal & Channel Load Balancing Loss to model temporal and channel correlations.

Result: Extensive experiments on five downstream tasks demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, validating the effectiveness of task-aware routing and the proposed load-balancing strategy.

Conclusion: PatchMoE provides task-aware knowledge utilization for time-series analysis by enabling task-specific routing and capturing temporal-channel correlations, achieving strong generalization across diverse time-series tasks.

Abstract: Time Series Analysis is widely used in various real-world applications such
as weather forecasting, financial fraud detection, imputation for missing data
in IoT systems, and classification for action recognization. Mixture-of-Experts
(MoE), as a powerful architecture, though demonstrating effectiveness in NLP,
still falls short in adapting to versatile tasks in time series analytics due
to its task-agnostic router and the lack of capability in modeling channel
correlations. In this study, we propose a novel, general MoE-based time series
framework called PatchMoE to support the intricate ``knowledge'' utilization
for distinct tasks, thus task-aware. Based on the observation that hierarchical
representations often vary across tasks, e.g., forecasting vs. classification,
we propose a Recurrent Noisy Gating to utilize the hierarchical information in
routing, thus obtaining task-sepcific capability. And the routing strategy is
operated on time series tokens in both temporal and channel dimensions, and
encouraged by a meticulously designed Temporal \& Channel Load Balancing Loss
to model the intricate temporal and channel correlations. Comprehensive
experiments on five downstream tasks demonstrate the state-of-the-art
performance of PatchMoE.

### [290] [Conditional Denoising Diffusion Autoencoders for Wireless Semantic Communications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22282)
*Mehdi Letafati,Samad Ali,Matti Latva-aho*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Diffusion autoencoders are proposed for wireless semantic communication to map semantics to the ground-truth distribution, using a semantic encoder at the transmitter and a conditional diffusion model at the receiver to denoise with channel latents. The method aims to decouple encoding/decoding and model signal distribution; it is claimed to be a consistent estimator and is evaluated on CIFAR-10/MNIST with extensions to multi-user scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address gaps in current SemCom work that overemphasizes channel-adaptive neural encoding/decoding and tightly-coupled autoencoders. There is a need to explicitly model the signal distribution and to enable scalable, decoupled decoding that can better handle diverse channels and multi-user settings.

Method: Train a semantic encoder to extract high-level semantics from source data. Use a conditional diffusion model (CDiff) at the receiver conditioned on the received latent signals to perform signal-space denoising and steer reconstruction toward the transmitter's intended semantics. Prove consistency: the decoder is a consistent estimator of the ground-truth data. Evaluate via simulations on CIFAR-10 and MNIST, compare against autoencoders and VAEs, and extend to multi-user scenarios to identify dominating factors.

Result: The diffusion-based SemCom framework shows improved semantic fidelity over legacy autoencoders and VAEs on CIFAR-10 and MNIST. It demonstrates robustness to channel impairments and provides a decoupled transmitter/receiver design with scalable decoding. Multi-user experiments reveal key interference and design factors, suggesting practical guidelines for deployment.

Conclusion: Diffusion autoencoder-based wireless SemCom is a promising direction that achieves better alignment with ground-truth distributions and offers scalability advantages over traditional autoencoder-based schemes. Further work is needed to optimize computational efficiency, latency, and performance in more realistic channel models and complex multi-user networks.

Abstract: Semantic communication (SemCom) systems aim to learn the mapping from
low-dimensional semantics to high-dimensional ground-truth. While this is more
akin to a "domain translation" problem, existing frameworks typically emphasize
on channel-adaptive neural encoding-decoding schemes, lacking full exploration
of signal distribution. Moreover, such methods so far have employed
autoencoder-based architectures, where the encoding is tightly coupled to a
matched decoder, causing scalability issues in practice. To address these gaps,
diffusion autoencoder models are proposed for wireless SemCom. The goal is to
learn a "semantic-to-clean" mapping, from the semantic space to the
ground-truth probability distribution. A neural encoder at semantic transmitter
extracts the high-level semantics, and a conditional diffusion model (CDiff) at
the semantic receiver exploits the source distribution for signal-space
denoising, while the received semantic latents are incorporated as the
conditioning input to "steer" the decoding process towards the semantics
intended by the transmitter. It is analytically proved that the proposed
decoder model is a consistent estimator of the ground-truth data. Furthermore,
extensive simulations over CIFAR-10 and MNIST datasets are provided along with
design insights, highlighting the performance compared to legacy autoencoders
and variational autoencoders (VAE). Simulations are further extended to the
multi-user SemCom, identifying the dominating factors in a more realistic
setup.

### [291] [A Multi-Level Framework for Multi-Objective Hypergraph Partitioning: Combining Minimum Spanning Tree and Proximal Gradient](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22294)
*Yingying Li,Mingxuan Xie,Hailong You,Yongqiang Yao,Hongwei Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: An efficient hypergraph partitioning framework that combines a multi-objective non-convex constrained relaxation with MST-based strategies and refinement, achieving consistent, modest improvements over KaHyPar and state-of-the-art on weighted graphs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve hypergraph partition quality and scalability by escaping local optima and handling large-scale data, through diverse vertex representations, scalable MST-based partitioning, and refinement procedures.

Method: Introduce a novel multi-objective non-convex constrained relaxation model; employ a modified accelerated proximal gradient to generate diverse k-dimensional vertex features; design two MST-based strategies for small- and large-scale data (Prim-based MST with pruning for small data; representative-node subset to form a smaller MST for large data, followed by node assignment); apply refinement strategies including greedy migration, swapping, and recursive MST-based clustering.

Result: Average cut size reductions of ~2–5% vs KaHyPar in 2-, 3-, and 4-way partitioning, with up to 35% improvements on specific instances; on weighted vertex sets, outperform KaHyPar, hMetis, Mt-KaHyPar, and K-SpecPart; refinement improves hMetis partitions by up to 16%; comprehensive evaluation validates competitiveness and characterizes performance trade-offs.

Conclusion: The framework delivers competitive partition quality across scales and weight configurations, driven by the integration of non-convex optimization, MST-based partitioning, and refinement, with clear trade-offs and robust performance evidence.

Abstract: This paper proposes an efficient hypergraph partitioning framework based on a
novel multi-objective non-convex constrained relaxation model. A modified
accelerated proximal gradient algorithm is employed to generate diverse
$k$-dimensional vertex features to avoid local optima and enhance partition
quality. Two MST-based strategies are designed for different data scales: for
small-scale data, the Prim algorithm constructs a minimum spanning tree
followed by pruning and clustering; for large-scale data, a subset of
representative nodes is selected to build a smaller MST, while the remaining
nodes are assigned accordingly to reduce complexity. To further improve
partitioning results, refinement strategies including greedy migration,
swapping, and recursive MST-based clustering are introduced for partitions.
  Experimental results on public benchmark sets demonstrate that the proposed
algorithm achieves reductions in cut size of approximately 2\%--5\% on average
compared to KaHyPar in 2, 3, and 4-way partitioning, with improvements of up to
35\% on specific instances. Particularly on weighted vertex sets, our algorithm
outperforms state-of-the-art partitioners including KaHyPar, hMetis,
Mt-KaHyPar, and K-SpecPart, highlighting its superior partitioning quality and
competitiveness. Furthermore, the proposed refinement strategy improves hMetis
partitions by up to 16\%. A comprehensive evaluation based on virtual instance
methodology and parameter sensitivity analysis validates the algorithm's
competitiveness and characterizes its performance trade-offs.

### [292] [Aurora: Towards Universal Generative Multimodal Time Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22295)
*Xingjian Wu,Jianxin Jin,Wanghui Qiu,Peng Chen,Yang Shu,Bin Yang,Chenjuan Guo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Aurora is a multimodal time series foundation model that enables cross-domain generalization and zero-shot inference by leveraging text and image modalities. It uses tokenization, encoding, and distillation to extract domain knowledge, injected via a Modality-Guided Multi-head Self-Attention, with Prototype-Guided Flow Matching for probabilistic forecasting, and achieves state-of-the-art results on TimeMMD, TSFM-Bench, and ProbTS.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cross-domain generalization in time series forecasting is hampered by domain-specific patterns. Unimodal foundation models lack explicit incorporation of text/image knowledge, while end-to-end multimodal models often can't perform zero-shot cross-domain inference.

Method: Pretrain on a Cross-domain Multimodal Time Series Corpus. Extract and distill domain knowledge from text/image modalities through tokenization and encoding. Use Modality-Guided Multi-head Self-Attention to inject multimodal knowledge into temporal representations. Decode by producing conditions and prototypes for future tokens, enabling Prototype-Guided Flow Matching for probabilistic forecasting.

Result: Reported state-of-the-art performance on both unimodal and multimodal settings across TimeMMD, TSFM-Bench, and ProbTS benchmarks.

Conclusion: Aurora demonstrates strong cross-domain generalization and zero-shot inference by leveraging multimodal domain knowledge, effectively guiding temporal modeling and probabilistic forecasting.

Abstract: Cross-domain generalization is very important in Time Series Forecasting
because similar historical information may lead to distinct future trends due
to the domain-specific characteristics. Recent works focus on building unimodal
time series foundation models and end-to-end multimodal supervised models.
Since domain-specific knowledge is often contained in modalities like texts,
the former lacks the explicit utilization of them, thus hindering the
performance. The latter is tailored for end-to-end scenarios and does not
support zero-shot inference for cross-domain scenarios. In this work, we
introduce Aurora, a Multimodal Time Series Foundation Model, which supports
multimodal inputs and zero-shot inference. Pretrained on Corss-domain
Multimodal Time Series Corpus, Aurora can adaptively extract and focus on key
domain knowledge contained in corrsponding text or image modalities, thus
possessing strong Cross-domain generalization capability. Through tokenization,
encoding, and distillation, Aurora can extract multimodal domain knowledge as
guidance and then utilizes a Modality-Guided Multi-head Self-Attention to
inject them into the modeling of temporal representations. In the decoding
phase, the multimodal representations are used to generate the conditions and
prototypes of future tokens, contributing to a novel Prototype-Guided Flow
Matching for generative probabilistic forecasting. Comprehensive experiments on
well-recognized benchmarks, including TimeMMD, TSFM-Bench and ProbTS,
demonstrate the consistent state-of-the-art performance of Aurora on both
unimodal and multimodal scenarios.

### [293] [HEAPr: Hessian-based Efficient Atomic Expert Pruning in Output Space](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22299)
*Ke Li,Zheng Yang,Zhongbin Zhou,Feng Xue,Zhonglin Jiang,Wenxiao Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HEAPr introduces atomic-expert pruning for mixture-of-experts (MoE) models, using second-order OBS-like importance to prune at the atomic-expert level, achieving near lossless compression at 20–25% with ~20% FLOPs reduction on models like DeepSeek MoE and Qwen MoE.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reduce memory and compute bottlenecks of large MoE-based LLMs to enable practical deployment without large accuracy losses.

Method: Decompose each expert into smaller atomic experts; compute importance using second-order information transformed from expert parameters to atomic parameters and then to atomic outputs; reduce space complexity from O(d^4) to O(d^2); require two forward passes and one backward pass on a small calibration set; prune atomic experts to meet target compression.

Result: HEAPr outperforms existing expert-level pruning methods across various compression ratios and benchmarks; achieves near lossless compression at 20–25% pruning and ~20% FLOPs reduction on MoE models (e.g., DeepSeek MoE, Qwen MoE family).

Conclusion: Fine-grained atomic-expert pruning guided by second-order importance is effective and practical for large MoE LLMs, enabling substantial memory/compute savings with minimal accuracy loss and offering a scalable pruning paradigm.

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures in large language models (LLMs)
deliver exceptional performance and reduced inference costs compared to dense
LLMs. However, their large parameter counts result in prohibitive memory
requirements, limiting practical deployment. While existing pruning methods
primarily focus on expert-level pruning, this coarse granularity often leads to
substantial accuracy degradation. In this work, we introduce HEAPr, a novel
pruning algorithm that decomposes experts into smaller, indivisible atomic
experts, enabling more precise and flexible atomic expert pruning. To measure
the importance of each atomic expert, we leverage second-order information
based on principles similar to Optimal Brain Surgeon (OBS) theory. To address
the computational and storage challenges posed by second-order information,
HEAPr exploits the inherent properties of atomic experts to transform the
second-order information from expert parameters into that of atomic expert
parameters, and further simplifies it to the second-order information of atomic
expert outputs. This approach reduces the space complexity from $O(d^4)$, where
d is the model's dimensionality, to $O(d^2)$. HEAPr requires only two forward
passes and one backward pass on a small calibration set to compute the
importance of atomic experts. Extensive experiments on MoE models, including
DeepSeek MoE and Qwen MoE family, demonstrate that HEAPr outperforms existing
expert-level pruning methods across a wide range of compression ratios and
benchmarks. Specifically, HEAPr achieves nearly lossless compression at
compression ratios of 20% ~ 25% in most models, while also reducing FLOPs
nearly by 20%. The code can be found at

### [294] [SoDaDE: Solvent Data-Driven Embeddings with Small Transformer Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22302)
*Gabriel Kitso Gibberd,Jose Pablo Folch,Antonio Del Rio Chanona*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SoDaDE provides a data-driven solvent fingerprint using a small transformer trained on solvent properties, enabling improved yield predictions and low-data, solvent-specific representations for green solvent research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generic fingerprints lack solvent-specific physical context and climate-relevant considerations; chemical data are limited, motivating domain-specific representations that can work with small datasets to support green solvent replacement.

Method: Develop a small transformer-based embedding (SoDaDE) trained on solvent property data to produce solvent fingerprints; validate by predicting yields on a published dataset and comparing with prior representations; demonstrate a workflow applicable to other domains.

Result: SoDaDE outperforms previous representations in yield prediction on the tested dataset; shows that meaningful solvent fingerprints can be learned from small datasets; establishes a reusable workflow for data-driven fingerprints in chemistry.

Conclusion: Data-driven, solvent-specific fingerprints are feasible and beneficial, particularly for green solvent research, and the approach can be extended to other applications with limited data.

Abstract: Computational representations have become crucial in unlocking the recent
growth of machine learning algorithms for chemistry. Initially hand-designed,
machine learning has shown that meaningful representations can be learnt from
data. Chemical datasets are limited and so the representations learnt from data
are generic, being trained on broad datasets which contain shallow information
on many different molecule types. For example, generic fingerprints lack
physical context specific to solvents. However, the use of harmful solvents is
a leading climate-related issue in the chemical industry, and there is a surge
of interest in green solvent replacement. To empower this research, we propose
a new solvent representation scheme by developing Solvent Data Driven
Embeddings (SoDaDE). SoDaDE uses a small transformer model and solvent property
dataset to create a fingerprint for solvents. To showcase their effectiveness,
we use SoDaDE to predict yields on a recently published dataset, outperforming
previous representations. We demonstrate through this paper that data-driven
fingerprints can be made with small datasets and set-up a workflow that can be
explored for other applications.

### [295] [Adaptive Policy Backbone via Shared Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22310)
*Bumgeun Park,Donghwan Lee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Adaptive Policy Backbone (APB) is a meta-transfer RL method that inserts lightweight linear adapters around a shared backbone to enable parameter-efficient fine-tuning, preserving prior knowledge while adapting to new tasks, including out-of-distribution (OOD) ones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reinforcement learning often requires large interaction data. Priors (datasets or reference policies) help but their usefulness degrades when training and deployment tasks differ. There is a need for methods that adapt to task mismatch, especially for OOD tasks, without overhauling core knowledge.

Method: APB inserts simple linear adapters before and after a shared backbone, enabling parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) within a meta-transfer RL framework. This allows adapting to new tasks with minimal parameter updates while preserving prior knowledge.

Result: APB improves sample efficiency compared to standard RL and enables adaptation to OOD tasks where existing meta-RL baselines typically fail.

Conclusion: APB provides a practical PEFT-based approach for RL with priors, achieving better data efficiency and robustness to task mismatch by maintaining a stable backbone and small, adaptable adapters.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has achieved impressive results across domains,
yet learning an optimal policy typically requires extensive interaction data,
limiting practical deployment. A common remedy is to leverage priors, such as
pre-collected datasets or reference policies, but their utility degrades under
task mismatch between training and deployment. While prior work has sought to
address this mismatch, it has largely been restricted to in-distribution
settings. To address this challenge, we propose Adaptive Policy Backbone (APB),
a meta-transfer RL method that inserts lightweight linear layers before and
after a shared backbone, thereby enabling parameter-efficient fine-tuning
(PEFT) while preserving prior knowledge during adaptation. Our results show
that APB improves sample efficiency over standard RL and adapts to
out-of-distribution (OOD) tasks where existing meta-RL baselines typically
fail.

### [296] [Progressive Weight Loading: Accelerating Initial Inference and Gradually Boosting Performance on Resource-Constrained Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22319)
*Hyunwoo Kim,Junha Lee,Mincheol Choi,Jeonghwan Lee,Jaeshin Cho*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Progressive Weight Loading (PWL) enables fast initial inference with a small student model and gradually substitutes teacher layers to converge to the full teacher accuracy, balancing latency and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large DL models cause high memory and compute; loading times and initial latency hurt mobile and latency-sensitive deployments; KD compresses but at performance cost; PWL aims to preserve speed while maintaining or achieving teacher-level accuracy.

Method: Train a method to align intermediate features between student and teacher layers and improve student output; start inference with lightweight student, progressively replace layers with pre-trained teacher layers during deployment; evaluate across VGG, ResNet, ViT.

Result: PWL maintains competitive distillation performance and shows gradual accuracy improvement as teacher layers are loaded, eventually matching final teacher accuracy without sacrificing initial inference speed.

Conclusion: PWL is well-suited for dynamic, resource-constrained deployments requiring responsiveness and high performance, offering a practical trade-off between latency and accuracy.

Abstract: Deep learning models have become increasingly large and complex, resulting in
higher memory consumption and computational demands. Consequently, model
loading times and initial inference latency have increased, posing significant
challenges in mobile and latency-sensitive environments where frequent model
loading and unloading are required, which directly impacts user experience.
While Knowledge Distillation (KD) offers a solution by compressing large
teacher models into smaller student ones, it often comes at the cost of reduced
performance. To address this trade-off, we propose Progressive Weight Loading
(PWL), a novel technique that enables fast initial inference by first deploying
a lightweight student model, then incrementally replacing its layers with those
of a pre-trained teacher model. To support seamless layer substitution, we
introduce a training method that not only aligns intermediate feature
representations between student and teacher layers, but also improves the
overall output performance of the student model. Our experiments on VGG,
ResNet, and ViT architectures demonstrate that models trained with PWL maintain
competitive distillation performance and gradually improve accuracy as teacher
layers are loaded-matching the final accuracy of the full teacher model without
compromising initial inference speed. This makes PWL particularly suited for
dynamic, resource-constrained deployments where both responsiveness and
performance are critical.

### [297] [Distributed Associative Memory via Online Convex Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22321)
*Bowen Wang,Matteo Zecchin,Osvaldo Simeone*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Distributed online gradient descent for local associative memories at agents connected by routing trees; achieves sublinear regret and outperforms online optimization baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Associative memory enables cue-response recall and is increasingly implicated in modern neural architectures (e.g., Transformers). In a distributed setting, agents maintain local AMs and exchange selective information to recall both their own and others’ associations. The work addresses scalable memory-based learning via a routing-tree communication topology.

Method: Each agent maintains a local associative memory and updates it via online gradient descent. Updates are coordinated through communication over routing trees, enabling information sharing while preserving locality. The paper provides a theoretical regret analysis showing sublinear regret and validates the approach with experiments comparing against existing online optimization baselines.

Result: The proposed protocol consistently outperforms standard online optimization baselines across experiments, demonstrating improved learning and recall in the distributed AM setting.

Conclusion: Distributed online gradient descent with routing-tree communication is an effective framework for scalable, memory-augmented learning in multi-agent systems, achieving sublinear regret and practical performance gains over baselines.

Abstract: An associative memory (AM) enables cue-response recall, and associative
memorization has recently been noted to underlie the operation of modern neural
architectures such as Transformers. This work addresses a distributed setting
where agents maintain a local AM to recall their own associations as well as
selective information from others. Specifically, we introduce a distributed
online gradient descent method that optimizes local AMs at different agents
through communication over routing trees. Our theoretical analysis establishes
sublinear regret guarantees, and experiments demonstrate that the proposed
protocol consistently outperforms existing online optimization baselines.

### [298] [Spectral Collapse Drives Loss of Plasticity in Deep Continual Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22335)
*Naicheng He,Kaicheng Guo,Arjun Prakash,Saket Tiwari,Ruo Yu Tao,Tyrone Serapio,Amy Greenwald,George Konidaris*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Hessian spectral collapse at new-task onset causes loss of plasticity in deep continual learning; introducing tau-trainability to define a necessary training condition and unifying plasticity-preserving methods; using Kronecker-factored Hessian to motivate two regularizers—preserving high feature rank and L2 penalties—for sustained plasticity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why deep networks forget or fail to learn new tasks in continual learning, and to identify conditions under which training can succeed, by linking plasticity loss to curvature (Hessian) properties and unifying existing methods.

Method: Analyze Hessian spectra at new-task initialization; define tau-trainability as a criterion for trainability; relate plasticity-preserving algorithms to this framework; employ Kronecker-factored approximation of the Hessian to motivate two regularizers: (1) maintain high effective feature rank, (2) apply L2 penalties; validate via experiments.

Result: Regularizers designed around Hessian structure and feature rank help prevent spectral collapse and preserve plasticity; combining both regularizers yields effective continual learning performance on both supervised and reinforcement learning tasks.

Conclusion: Hessian spectral collapse is a precursor to plasticity loss; tau-trainability captures the necessary condition for successful training; Kronecker-factored Hessian insights motivate practical regularizers that preserve plasticity across tasks in continual learning.

Abstract: We investigate why deep neural networks suffer from \emph{loss of plasticity}
in deep continual learning, failing to learn new tasks without reinitializing
parameters. We show that this failure is preceded by Hessian spectral collapse
at new-task initialization, where meaningful curvature directions vanish and
gradient descent becomes ineffective. To characterize the necessary condition
for successful training, we introduce the notion of $\tau$-trainability and
show that current plasticity preserving algorithms can be unified under this
framework. Targeting spectral collapse directly, we then discuss the Kronecker
factored approximation of the Hessian, which motivates two regularization
enhancements: maintaining high effective feature rank and applying $L2$
penalties. Experiments on continual supervised and reinforcement learning tasks
confirm that combining these two regularizers effectively preserves plasticity.

*Marie Brockschmidt,Maresa Schröder,Stefan Feuerriegel*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SurvDiff introduces a diffusion-based generator for synthetic survival data that jointly models covariates, event times, and censoring, achieving superior fidelity and downstream task performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clinical survival data require faithful replication of both the event-time distribution and the censoring mechanism in synthetic data; existing generative approaches may not capture censoring well, hindering downstream survival analyses.

Method: An end-to-end diffusion model (SurvDiff) that jointly generates mixed-type covariates, event times, and right-censoring, guided by a survival-tailored loss that encodes time-to-event structure and optimizes downstream survival tasks.

Result: SurvDiff consistently outperforms state-of-the-art generative baselines on multiple medical datasets in both distributional fidelity and downstream evaluation metrics.

Conclusion: SurvDiff is the first diffusion model explicitly designed for generating synthetic survival data, capable of reproducing realistic event-time distributions and censoring mechanisms.

Abstract: Survival analysis is a cornerstone of clinical research by modeling
time-to-event outcomes such as metastasis, disease relapse, or patient death.
Unlike standard tabular data, survival data often come with incomplete event
information due to dropout, or loss to follow-up. This poses unique challenges
for synthetic data generation, where it is crucial for clinical research to
faithfully reproduce both the event-time distribution and the censoring
mechanism. In this paper, we propose SurvDiff, an end-to-end diffusion model
specifically designed for generating synthetic data in survival analysis.
SurvDiff is tailored to capture the data-generating mechanism by jointly
generating mixed-type covariates, event times, and right-censoring, guided by a
survival-tailored loss function. The loss encodes the time-to-event structure
and directly optimizes for downstream survival tasks, which ensures that
SurvDiff (i) reproduces realistic event-time distributions and (ii) preserves
the censoring mechanism. Across multiple datasets, we show that \survdiff
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art generative baselines in both
distributional fidelity and downstream evaluation metrics across multiple
medical datasets. To the best of our knowledge, SurvDiff is the first diffusion
model explicitly designed for generating synthetic survival data.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Formalizes in-context environment learning (ICEL) for world models, identifying environment recognition and environment learning as two core mechanisms, deriving their error bounds, and empirically validating their existence and dependence on data distribution and architecture; highlights long context and diverse environments as essential for ICEL.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current static world models struggle with novel or rare configurations, limiting adaptability. ICEL aims to enable self-adapting world models by leveraging long context and diverse environments.

Method: Formalize ICEL, derive error upper-bounds for environment recognition and environment learning, and conduct empirical studies to observe distinct ICEL mechanisms and how data distribution and model architecture affect ICEL.

Result: Two ICEL mechanisms exist (environment recognition and environment learning); error bounds derived; empirical evidence shows emergence of ICEL mechanisms and that performance depends on context length, data diversity, and architecture.

Conclusion: ICEL shows promise for self-adapting world models; long context and diverse environments are key factors; future work could optimize data strategies and architectures to maximize ICEL potential.

Abstract: The capability of predicting environmental dynamics underpins both biological
neural systems and general embodied AI in adapting to their surroundings. Yet
prevailing approaches rest on static world models that falter when confronted
with novel or rare configurations. We investigate in-context environment
learning (ICEL), shifting attention from zero-shot performance to the growth
and asymptotic limits of the world model. Our contributions are three-fold: (1)
we formalize in-context learning of a world model and identify two core
mechanisms: environment recognition and environment learning; (2) we derive
error upper-bounds for both mechanisms that expose how the mechanisms emerge;
and (3) we empirically confirm that distinct ICL mechanisms exist in the world
model, and we further investigate how data distribution and model architecture
affect ICL in a manner consistent with theory. These findings demonstrate the
potential of self-adapting world models and highlight the key factors behind
the emergence of ICEL, most notably the necessity of long context and diverse
environments.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Stochastic activations randomly switch between SiLU and ReLU in the feed-forward of LLMs to address dead-gradient issues, reduce inference cost, and diversify generation, with competitive performance overall.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ReLU's dead-region gradient can hinder optimization and learning dynamics. A stochastic mix with SiLU may retain gradient flow benefits while enabling sparse inference at deployment; also aims to offer a simple mechanism to diversify text generation.

Method: Introduce a Bernoulli-driven switch between SiLU and ReLU in the feed-forward blocks during training. During pre-training use stochastic activations; fine-tune with ReLU so inference yields sparse latent vectors and faster CPU inference. Evaluate generation by continuing stochastic activations, comparing to deterministic nonlinearities (notably SiLU with temperature scaling).

Result: Pretraining with stochastic activations + ReLU finetuning yields CPU FLOP reductions and speedups, with better results than training from scratch with ReLU. In generation, stochastic activations perform reasonably well, only slightly below the best deterministic nonlinearity (SiLU with temperature scaling), while offering a controlled way to increase text diversity.

Conclusion: Stochastic activations provide a practical approach to speed up inference and tune generation diversity, with competitive performance. Further work should examine hyperparameter sensitivity (Bernoulli probability), stability, and broader task evaluations.

Abstract: We introduce stochastic activations. This novel strategy randomly selects
between several non-linear functions in the feed-forward layer of a large
language model. In particular, we choose between SILU or RELU depending on a
Bernoulli draw. This strategy circumvents the optimization problem associated
with RELU, namely, the constant shape for negative inputs that prevents the
gradient flow. We leverage this strategy in two ways:
  (1) We use stochastic activations during pre-training and fine-tune the model
with RELU, which is used at inference time to provide sparse latent vectors.
This reduces the inference FLOPs and translates into a significant speedup in
the CPU. Interestingly, this leads to much better results than training from
scratch with the RELU activation function.
  (2) We evaluate stochastic activations for generation. This strategy performs
reasonably well: it is only slightly inferior to the best deterministic
non-linearity, namely SILU combined with temperature scaling. This offers an
alternative to existing strategies by providing a controlled way to increase
the diversity of the generated text.

### [302] [Neural Feature Geometry Evolves as Discrete Ricci Flow](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22362)
*Moritz Hehl,Max von Renesse,Melanie Weber*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Neural feature geometry in deep nets evolves on similarity graphs in a manner akin to discrete Ricci flow, with nonlinear activations shaping the geometry; class separability emerges with community structure in graph representations; a local geometric-evolution framework yields practical design heuristics like geometry-informed early stopping and depth selection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To deepen understanding of neural feature representations by analyzing their geometric evolution on approximated data manifolds, linking continuous neural transformations to discrete geometric flow, and to derive practically useful diagnostics for model design.

Method: Construct geometric graphs over inferred data manifolds to capture local similarities; study how these graphs evolve during feedforward training and relate their evolution to discrete Ricci flow dynamics; perform large-scale empirical analysis on over 20,000 fully-connected networks trained on binary classification tasks across synthetic and real-world datasets; develop a framework for locally evaluating geometric transformations by comparison with discrete Ricci flow.

Result: Nonlinear activations significantly influence the shaping of feature geometry during training; the graph-based feature transformations exhibit dynamics resembling discrete Ricci flow; emergence of class separability aligns with the rise of community structure in the graph representations; the proposed geometric framework enables local assessment and yields design principles.

Conclusion: Viewing neural feature geometry through the lens of discrete Ricci flow provides an interpretable, graph-based diagnostic tool. This perspective supports practical guidelines for model design, including geometry-informed early stopping and depth selection, and suggests a path toward more principled architecture choices grounded in the evolution of feature geometry.

Abstract: Deep neural networks learn feature representations via complex geometric
transformations of the input data manifold. Despite the models' empirical
success across domains, our understanding of neural feature representations is
still incomplete. In this work we investigate neural feature geometry through
the lens of discrete geometry. Since the input data manifold is typically
unobserved, we approximate it using geometric graphs that encode local
similarity structure. We provide theoretical results on the evolution of these
graphs during training, showing that nonlinear activations play a crucial role
in shaping feature geometry in feedforward neural networks. Moreover, we
discover that the geometric transformations resemble a discrete Ricci flow on
these graphs, suggesting that neural feature geometry evolves analogous to
Ricci flow. This connection is supported by experiments on over 20,000
feedforward neural networks trained on binary classification tasks across both
synthetic and real-world datasets. We observe that the emergence of class
separability corresponds to the emergence of community structure in the
associated graph representations, which is known to relate to discrete Ricci
flow dynamics. Building on these insights, we introduce a novel framework for
locally evaluating geometric transformations through comparison with discrete
Ricci flow dynamics. Our results suggest practical design principles, including
a geometry-informed early-stopping heuristic and a criterion for selecting
network depth.

TL;DR: LALMs' chain-of-thoughts are generally faithful explanations of their decisions, even under targeted perturbations, across two audio-language reasoning datasets (SAKURA, MMAR).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine whether CoTs from audio-language models faithfully reflect the model's decision process, addressing concerns from prior work on text-based LLMs and the added complexity of audio inputs for reasoning.

Method: Apply targeted interventions to CoTs (paraphrasing, filler token injection, early answering, introducing mistakes) and evaluate faithfulness across two challenging datasets, SAKURA and MMAR (and multiple tasks).

Result: Experiments suggest that LALMs produce CoTs that appear faithful to their underlying decision processes, even after perturbations.

Conclusion: CoTs from LALMs can be reliable explanations for audio-language reasoning, though findings are cautious and may depend on datasets and tasks; further work is needed to confirm generalizability and safety implications.

Abstract: Faithfulness measures whether chain-of-thought (CoT) representations
accurately reflect a model's decision process and can be used as reliable
explanations. Prior work has shown that CoTs from text-based LLMs are often
unfaithful. This question has not been explored for large audio-language models
(LALMs), where faithfulness is critical for safety-sensitive applications.
Reasoning in LALMs is also more challenging, as models must first extract
relevant clues from audio before reasoning over them. In this paper, we
investigate the faithfulness of CoTs produced by several LALMs by applying
targeted interventions, including paraphrasing, filler token injection, early
answering, and introducing mistakes, on two challenging reasoning datasets:
SAKURA and MMAR. After going through the aforementioned interventions across
several datasets and tasks, our experiments suggest that, LALMs generally
produce CoTs that appear to be faithful to their underlying decision processes.

TL;DR: SpinGPT is an LLM-based agent for Spin & Go that matches solver actions well and yields competitive results against Slumbot, showing promise for multi-player imperfect-information games.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CFR's exponential complexity with more players and lack of equilibrium guarantees in multi-player settings limit CFR in tournaments; recent LLM successes motivate applying LLMs to complex multi-player poker.

Method: Two-stage training: Supervised Fine-Tuning on 320k expert decisions; Reinforcement Learning on 270k solver-generated hands; evaluation with tolerant accuracy (78%); deep-stack heuristic yielding 13.4 ± 12.9 BB/100 vs Slumbot over 30k hands.

Result: SpinGPT achieves 78% tolerant accuracy to solver actions; competitive heads-up performance against Slumbot; demonstrates feasibility of LLMs for multi-player imperfect-information games.

Conclusion: LLMs are a promising new approach for complex multi-player poker and could extend the reach of AI in imperfect-information games beyond CFR.

Abstract: The Counterfactual Regret Minimization (CFR) algorithm and its variants have
enabled the development of pokerbots capable of beating the best human players
in heads-up (1v1) cash games and competing with them in six-player formats.
However, CFR's computational complexity rises exponentially with the number of
players. Furthermore, in games with three or more players, following Nash
equilibrium no longer guarantees a non-losing outcome. These limitations, along
with others, significantly restrict the applicability of CFR to the most
popular formats: tournaments. Motivated by the recent success of Large Language
Models (LLM) in chess and Diplomacy, we present SpinGPT, the first LLM tailored
to Spin & Go, a popular three-player online poker format. SpinGPT is trained in
two stages: (1) Supervised Fine-Tuning on 320k high-stakes expert decisions;
(2) Reinforcement Learning on 270k solver-generated hands. Our results show
that SpinGPT matches the solver's actions in 78% of decisions (tolerant
accuracy). With a simple deep-stack heuristic, it achieves 13.4 +/- 12.9 BB/100
versus Slumbot in heads-up over 30,000 hands (95% CI). These results suggest
that LLMs could be a new way to deal with multi-player imperfect-information
games like poker.

*Bo Wang,Imran Khan,Martin White,Natalia Beloff*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A federated, multi-modal phishing detector enabling URL/HTML/IMAGE inputs with modality-agnostic inference; uses role-aware bucket aggregation on FedProx with hard gating.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To detect phishing in privacy-preserving federated settings while supporting multiple data modalities and avoiding fixed modality binding during inference; address cross-embedding conflicts and training instability.

Method: Introduce role-aware bucket aggregation on top of FedProx, inspired by Mixture-of-Experts and FedMM, using hard gating to select modality-specific experts and aggregate separately; no learnable routing; separate modality parameter aggregation; modality-specific heads; embeddings: GraphCodeBERT for URLs, early three-way embedding for HTML; evaluate on datasets TR-OP and WebPhish.

Result: Fusion head achieves Acc 97.5% and FPR 2.4% on TR-OP across two data types; image subset Ablation: Acc 95.5%, FPR 5.9%; Text: GraphCodeBERT for URLs; on WebPhish (HTML): 96.5%/1.8%; on TR-OP (raw HTML): 95.1%/4.6%.

Conclusion: Bucket aggregation with hard-gated experts enables stable federated training under strict privacy and improves usability and flexibility of multi-modal phishing detection.

Abstract: We present a federated, multi-modal phishing website detector that supports
URL, HTML, and IMAGE inputs without binding clients to a fixed modality at
inference: any client can invoke any modality head trained elsewhere.
Methodologically, we propose role-aware bucket aggregation on top of FedProx,
inspired by Mixture-of-Experts and FedMM. We drop learnable routing and use
hard gating (selecting the IMAGE/HTML/URL expert by sample modality), enabling
separate aggregation of modality-specific parameters to isolate cross-embedding
conflicts and stabilize convergence. On TR-OP, the Fusion head reaches Acc
97.5% with FPR 2.4% across two data types; on the image subset (ablation) it
attains Acc 95.5% with FPR 5.9%. For text, we use GraphCodeBERT for URLs and an
early three-way embedding for raw, noisy HTML. On WebPhish (HTML) we obtain Acc
96.5% / FPR 1.8%; on TR-OP (raw HTML) we obtain Acc 95.1% / FPR 4.6%. Results
indicate that bucket aggregation with hard-gated experts enables stable
federated training under strict privacy, while improving the usability and
flexibility of multi-modal phishing detection.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A meta-learning ensemble integrating supervised, unsupervised, deep learning, LASSO feature selection, and ECOC meta-classifier with permutation feature importance, applied to Corporate Credit Ratings dataset; improves classification of credit rating migrations and default probability estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tackle high-dimensional data, interpretability, rare events, and multi-class imbalance in credit risk; provide holistic, transparent risk assessment.

Method: Combine XGBoost, Random Forest, SVM, Decision Tree, KNN, MLP; LASSO for feature selection/dimensionality reduction; Error-Correcting Output Codes as meta-classifier for multi-class imbalances; permutation feature importance across classes; evaluation on Corporate Credit Ratings dataset (2,029 US companies).

Result: Meta-learning framework significantly enhances accuracy for credit rating migration classification and default probability estimation compared to baselines.

Conclusion: Supports more accurate and reliable credit risk decision support; demonstrates effective integration of diverse modeling paradigms and interpretability tools to address core challenges.

Abstract: Effective credit risk management is fundamental to financial decision-making,
necessitating robust models for default probability prediction and financial
entity classification. Traditional machine learning approaches face significant
challenges when confronted with high-dimensional data, limited
interpretability, rare event detection, and multi-class imbalance problems in
risk assessment. This research proposes a comprehensive meta-learning framework
that synthesizes multiple complementary models: supervised learning algorithms,
including XGBoost, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, and Decision Tree;
unsupervised methods such as K-Nearest Neighbors; deep learning architectures
like Multilayer Perceptron; alongside LASSO regularization for feature
selection and dimensionality reduction; and Error-Correcting Output Codes as a
meta-classifier for handling imbalanced multi-class problems. We implement
Permutation Feature Importance analysis for each prediction class across all
constituent models to enhance model transparency. Our framework aims to
optimize predictive performance while providing a more holistic approach to
credit risk assessment. This research contributes to the development of more
accurate and reliable computational models for strategic financial decision
support by addressing three fundamental challenges in credit risk modeling. The
empirical validation of our approach involves an analysis of the Corporate
Credit Ratings dataset with credit ratings for 2,029 publicly listed US
companies. Results demonstrate that our meta-learning framework significantly
enhances the accuracy of financial entity classification regarding credit
rating migrations (upgrades and downgrades) and default probability estimation.

*Luca Bergamin,Roberto Confalonieri,Fabio Aiolli*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Differentiable L0 regularization is applied to a logic-based neural network (MLLP) to reduce the complexity of its discrete interpretable version (CRS) without sacrificing performance, compared against a random weight binarization baseline; highlights a trade-off between CRS simplicity and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance interpretability and sparsity in concept-rule-based networks by using a differentiable L0 penalty, addressing the gap between high performance and transparent, compact models.

Method: Incorporate a differentiable approximation of L0 regularization into the Multi-layer Logical Perceptron (MLLP); train with this regularizer to reduce CRS complexity; compare results to Random Binarization of network weights as a baseline; analyze the resulting complexity-performance trade-off.

Result: The differentiable L0 regularization approach yields a sparser, less complex CRS while preserving (or closely matching) performance, and it outperforms the Random Binarization baseline in producing compact, accurate models.

Conclusion: Differentiable L0 regularization effectively reduces complexity in logic-based neural networks (MLLP/CRS) without sacrificing performance, supporting its use for interpretable AI systems and guiding future work on scalable, sparse, interpretable architectures.

Abstract: Deep neural networks are widely used in practical applications of AI,
however, their inner structure and complexity made them generally not easily
interpretable. Model transparency and interpretability are key requirements for
multiple scenarios where high performance is not enough to adopt the proposed
solution. In this work, a differentiable approximation of $L_0$ regularization
is adapted into a logic-based neural network, the Multi-layer Logical
Perceptron (MLLP), to study its efficacy in reducing the complexity of its
discrete interpretable version, the Concept Rule Set (CRS), while retaining its
performance. The results are compared to alternative heuristics like Random
Binarization of the network weights, to determine if better results can be
achieved when using a less-noisy technique that sparsifies the network based on
the loss function instead of a random distribution. The trade-off between the
CRS complexity and its performance is discussed.

### [308] [Partial Parameter Updates for Efficient Distributed Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22418)
*Anastasiia Filippova,Angelos Katharopoulos,David Grangier,Ronan Collobert*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A memory- and compute-efficient low-communication distributed training method that freezes most parameters during local steps, updating only a fixed subset to reduce memory and FLOPs, while still performing a full forward pass. It matches prior low-communication approaches in perplexity on a 1.3B-parameter model trained on 32 nodes under the same budgets, with lower computation and peak memory.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reduce memory footprint, computation, and communication overhead in distributed training. Existing low-communication methods rely on multiple local updates with infrequent global sync and often incur higher memory and FLOPs due to backprop across all parameters.

Method: During local steps, each node updates only a fixed subset of parameters while keeping the remaining parameters frozen. A full forward pass is performed over all parameters, which eliminates the need for cross-node activation exchange during backpropagation.

Result: Experiments on a 1.3B-parameter language model trained across 32 nodes show the method matches the perplexity of prior low-communication approaches under identical token and bandwidth budgets, while reducing training FLOPs and peak memory usage.

Conclusion: Constraining backpropagation to a fixed subset of parameters substantially reduces memory and compute without sacrificing model performance under given communication budgets; the approach eliminates cross-node activation exchange and can enable more scalable distributed training.

Abstract: We introduce a memory- and compute-efficient method for low-communication
distributed training. Existing methods reduce communication by performing
multiple local updates between infrequent global synchronizations. We
demonstrate that their efficiency can be significantly improved by restricting
backpropagation: instead of updating all the parameters, each node updates only
a fixed subset while keeping the remainder frozen during local steps. This
constraint substantially reduces peak memory usage and training FLOPs, while a
full forward pass over all parameters eliminates the need for cross-node
activation exchange. Experiments on a $1.3$B-parameter language model trained
across $32$ nodes show that our method matches the perplexity of prior
low-communication approaches under identical token and bandwidth budgets while
reducing training FLOPs and peak memory.

*Filipe C. L. Duarte,Paulo S. G. de Mattos Neto,Paulo R. A. Firmino*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Hybrid statistical-ML mortality forecasts: ARIMA-LSTM with a recursive multi-step approach provides superior accuracy across 12 datasets and 21 models, showing the importance of both the multi-step method and ML-choice.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In a context of declining interest rates and economic stabilization, accurate mortality forecasting is vital for insurance, pensions, and public health planning. Multi-step forecasts are needed but data-limited; hybrid models help capture linear and nonlinear patterns.

Method: Compared several multi-step forecasting strategies (Recursive, Direct, Multi-Input Multi-Output) and ML models within hybrid systems; evaluated across 12 datasets and 21 configurations; found ARIMA-LSTM with recursive approach often outperforms others.

Result: Performance is highly sensitive to the chosen multi-step approach and ML model; ARIMA-LSTM recursive hybrid achieved the best results in most cases.

Conclusion: Selecting an appropriate multi-step strategy and ML model is crucial for improving forecast accuracy in mortality rate forecasting; recursive ARIMA-LSTM hybrid is a strong default, with potential for further improvements by exploring additional hybrids and datasets.

Abstract: The decline in interest rates and economic stabilization has heightened the
importance of accurate mortality rate forecasting, particularly in insurance
and pension markets. Multi-step-ahead predictions are crucial for public
health, demographic planning, and insurance risk assessments; however, they
face challenges when data are limited. Hybrid systems that combine statistical
and Machine Learning (ML) models offer a promising solution for handling both
linear and nonlinear patterns. This study evaluated the impact of different
multi-step forecasting approaches (Recursive, Direct, and Multi-Input
Multi-Output) and ML models on the accuracy of hybrid systems. Results from 12
datasets and 21 models show that the selection of both the multi-step approach
and the ML model is essential for improving performance, with the ARIMA-LSTM
hybrid using a recursive approach outperforming other models in most cases.

### [310] [Global Convergence in Neural ODEs: Impact of Activation Functions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22436)
*Tianxiang Gao,Siyuan Sun,Hailiang Liu,Hongyang Gao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Activation smoothness and nonlinearity are crucial for training Neural ODEs: smoothness ensures globally unique forward/backward solutions, nonlinearity preserves the NTK spectrum, together enabling global convergence under gradient descent in overparameterized regimes, supported by numerical experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address training challenges in Neural ODEs—particularly gradient accuracy and convergence—by understanding how activation function properties influence forward/backward dynamics and kernel behavior.

Method: Theoretical analysis connecting activation function smoothness to well-posed forward and backward ODEs and sufficient nonlinearity to maintain NV (NTK) spectral properties during training; analysis is complemented by numerical experiments to validate theory and derive practical scaling guidelines.

Result: Proves global convergence of Neural ODEs under gradient descent in overparameterized regimes; demonstrates that smooth activations yield unique solutions for forward and backward passes while nonlinearities preserve NTK spectrum; numerical experiments validate theory and offer guidelines for scaling Neural ODEs for faster training and improved performance.

Conclusion: Activation function design—ensuring smoothness and sufficient nonlinearity—is key to training stability and global convergence in Neural ODEs, providing theoretical guarantees and practical guidelines for scaling and deployment.

Abstract: Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) have been successful in various
applications due to their continuous nature and parameter-sharing efficiency.
However, these unique characteristics also introduce challenges in training,
particularly with respect to gradient computation accuracy and convergence
analysis. In this paper, we address these challenges by investigating the
impact of activation functions. We demonstrate that the properties of
activation functions, specifically smoothness and nonlinearity, are critical to
the training dynamics. Smooth activation functions guarantee globally unique
solutions for both forward and backward ODEs, while sufficient nonlinearity is
essential for maintaining the spectral properties of the Neural Tangent Kernel
(NTK) during training. Together, these properties enable us to establish the
global convergence of Neural ODEs under gradient descent in overparameterized
regimes. Our theoretical findings are validated by numerical experiments, which
not only support our analysis but also provide practical guidelines for scaling
Neural ODEs, potentially leading to faster training and improved performance in
real-world applications.

*Peter Shaw,James Cohan,Jacob Eisenstein,Kristina Toutanova*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper defines asymptotically optimal description length objectives (AO-DLO) grounded in Kolmogorov complexity to tackle model complexity in neural networks. It proves such objectives exist for Transformers, makes them tractable via a variational objective with an adaptive Gaussian mixture prior, and empirically shows these objectives promote low-complexity, well-generalizing solutions, though optimization is challenging; the work outlines a framework toward training models with better compression and generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MDL and Occam's razor offer a principled approach to model complexity, but neural networks lack a universal complexity measure. The authors seek a theoretically grounded, asymptotically optimal description length objective that can apply to powerful models like Transformers, with concrete guarantees and practical tractability.

Method: (1) Prove the existence of asymptotically optimal description length objectives for Transformers by leveraging their computational universality. (2) Propose a tractable, differentiable variational objective based on an adaptive Gaussian mixture prior. (3) Empirically evaluate on an algorithmic task, showing the objective favors low-complexity solutions and strong generalization, while noting optimization challenges with random initialization.

Result: Theoretical framework establishing AO-DLO existence for Transformers; a variational, tractable surrogate using adaptive Gaussian mixtures; empirical evidence that the objective promotes compression and generalization, but standard optimizers may fail to reach such solutions from random starts.

Conclusion: The work provides a rigorous framework for constructing description-length objectives with strong asymptotic guarantees and demonstrates a practical variational approach that could enable more compressed, generalizable neural networks in the future, while acknowledging current optimization hurdles.

Abstract: The Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle offers a formal framework for
applying Occam's razor in machine learning. However, its application to neural
networks such as Transformers is challenging due to the lack of a principled,
universal measure for model complexity. This paper introduces the theoretical
notion of asymptotically optimal description length objectives, grounded in the
theory of Kolmogorov complexity. We establish that a minimizer of such an
objective achieves optimal compression, for any dataset, up to an additive
constant, in the limit as model resource bounds increase. We prove that
asymptotically optimal objectives exist for Transformers, building on a new
demonstration of their computational universality. We further show that such
objectives can be tractable and differentiable by constructing and analyzing a
variational objective based on an adaptive Gaussian mixture prior. Our
empirical analysis shows that this variational objective selects for a
low-complexity solution with strong generalization on an algorithmic task, but
standard optimizers fail to find such solutions from a random initialization,
highlighting key optimization challenges. More broadly, by providing a
theoretical framework for identifying description length objectives with strong
asymptotic guarantees, we outline a potential path towards training neural
networks that achieve greater compression and generalization.

*Fanjin Meng,Yuan Yuan,Jingtao Ding,Jie Feng,Chonghua Han,Yong Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MoveFM-R integrates mobility foundation models with language models by introducing semantically enhanced location encoding, a progressive curriculum, and an interactive self-reflection mechanism, enabling semantically guided, realistic trajectory generation and strong zero-shot generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MFMs are limited by data scale and a shallow understanding of semantics, while LLMs lack innate spatio-temporal statistics necessary for plausible mobility trajectories. There is a gap between continuous geographic coordinates and discrete language tokens, as well as between MFM latent vectors and LLM semantics.

Method: Three core innovations: (1) semantically enhanced location encoding to bridge geography-language gap, (2) a progressive curriculum to align the LLM’s reasoning with mobility patterns, and (3) an interactive self-reflection mechanism for conditional trajectory generation.

Result: MoveFM-R significantly outperforms both MFM-based and LLM-based baselines, demonstrates robust zero-shot generalization, and excels at generating realistic trajectories from natural language instructions.

Conclusion: By combining the statistical power of MFMs with the deep semantic understanding of LLMs, MoveFM-R establishes a new paradigm for interpretable and powerful mobility modeling, enabling semantically guided trajectory generation and broader applicability.

Abstract: Mobility Foundation Models (MFMs) have advanced the modeling of human
movement patterns, yet they face a ceiling due to limitations in data scale and
semantic understanding. While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer powerful
semantic reasoning, they lack the innate understanding of spatio-temporal
statistics required for generating physically plausible mobility trajectories.
To address these gaps, we propose MoveFM-R, a novel framework that unlocks the
full potential of mobility foundation models by leveraging language-driven
semantic reasoning capabilities. It tackles two key challenges: the vocabulary
mismatch between continuous geographic coordinates and discrete language
tokens, and the representation gap between the latent vectors of MFMs and the
semantic world of LLMs. MoveFM-R is built on three core innovations: a
semantically enhanced location encoding to bridge the geography-language gap, a
progressive curriculum to align the LLM's reasoning with mobility patterns, and
an interactive self-reflection mechanism for conditional trajectory generation.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that MoveFM-R significantly outperforms
existing MFM-based and LLM-based baselines. It also shows robust generalization
in zero-shot settings and excels at generating realistic trajectories from
natural language instructions. By synthesizing the statistical power of MFMs
with the deep semantic understanding of LLMs, MoveFM-R pioneers a new paradigm
that enables a more comprehensive, interpretable, and powerful modeling of
human mobility. The implementation of MoveFM-R is available online at
https://anonymous.4open.science/r/MoveFM-R-CDE7/.

*Changhun Kim,Timon Conrad,Redwanul Karim,Julian Oelhaf,David Riebesel,Tomás Arias-Vergara,Andreas Maier,Johann Jäger,Siming Bayer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Edge-aware PIGNN with a backtracking line-search delivers accurate, fast AC power-flow inference, outperforming NR and PIGNN baselines on multi-bus grids.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current physics-informed GNNs (PIGNNs) struggle to maintain parity-accurate results at fast inference; the physics loss is inactive during inference, hindering adoption for large-scenario tasks.

Method: Introduce an edge-aware attention mechanism with per-edge biases encoding line physics to capture grid anisotropy, plus a backtracking line-search-based global correction operator to enforce a decrease criterion at inference. Train/test on HV/MV scenario generator with NR only for references.

Result: On held-out HV cases with 4–32-bus grids, the model achieves RMSE of 0.00033 p.u. in voltage and 0.08 degrees in angle, surpassing PIGNN-MLP by 99.5% and 87.1% respectively. Streaming micro-batches yield 2–5x faster batched inference than NR on 4–1024-bus grids.

Conclusion: The combination delivers both high accuracy and substantial speed gains, enabling practical adoption of PIGNN-based power-flow solvers for large-scale, multi-scenario workloads; the inference-time physics enforcement comes from the correction operator, addressing the prior inoperativeness of physics loss.

Abstract: Physics-informed graph neural networks (PIGNNs) have emerged as fast AC
power-flow solvers that can replace classic Newton--Raphson (NR) solvers,
especially when thousands of scenarios must be evaluated. However, current
PIGNNs still need accuracy improvements at parity speed; in particular, the
physics loss is inoperative at inference, which can deter operational adoption.
We address this with PIGNN-Attn-LS, combining an edge-aware attention mechanism
that explicitly encodes line physics via per-edge biases, capturing the grid's
anisotropy, with a backtracking line-search-based globalized correction
operator that restores an operative decrease criterion at inference. Training
and testing use a realistic High-/Medium-Voltage scenario generator, with NR
used only to construct reference states. On held-out HV cases consisting of
4--32-bus grids, PIGNN-Attn-LS achieves a test RMSE of 0.00033 p.u. in voltage
and 0.08$^\circ$ in angle, outperforming the PIGNN-MLP baseline by 99.5\% and
87.1\%, respectively. With streaming micro-batches, it delivers 2--5$\times$
faster batched inference than NR on 4--1024-bus grids.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A physics-informed neural operator for the lattice Boltzmann equation enabling long-horizon predictions and kinetic super-resolution by embedding moment-matching and equivariance constraints, grid-invariant and collision-model-agnostic, validated on complex flows.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce the computational cost of LBE simulations by avoiding step-by-step collision-kernel integration, and to enable generalization across lattice resolutions and across diverse kinetic datasets.

Method: A neural operator framework that enforces intrinsic LBE moment-matching constraints and global distribution equivariance, is discretization-invariant (trained on coarse lattices and generalizes to finer lattices), and is agnostic to the specific collision model; applied to diverse kinetic datasets and flow scenarios.

Result: Demonstrates robustness in complex flows (von Karman vortex shedding, ligament breakup, bubble adhesion) and the ability to predict over large time horizons without explicit collision-kernel solving, enabling kinetic super-resolution.

Conclusion: Provides a data-driven pathway for modeling kinetic systems, expanding LBE modeling capability beyond stepwise integration, with cross-grid generalization and collision-model-agnostic applicability.

Abstract: The lattice Boltzmann equation (LBE), rooted in kinetic theory, provides a
powerful framework for capturing complex flow behaviour by describing the
evolution of single-particle distribution functions (PDFs). Despite its
success, solving the LBE numerically remains computationally intensive due to
strict time-step restrictions imposed by collision kernels. Here, we introduce
a physics-informed neural operator framework for the LBE that enables
prediction over large time horizons without step-by-step integration,
effectively bypassing the need to explicitly solve the collision kernel. We
incorporate intrinsic moment-matching constraints of the LBE, along with global
equivariance of the full distribution field, enabling the model to capture the
complex dynamics of the underlying kinetic system. Our framework is
discretization-invariant, enabling models trained on coarse lattices to
generalise to finer ones (kinetic super-resolution). In addition, it is
agnostic to the specific form of the underlying collision model, which makes it
naturally applicable across different kinetic datasets regardless of the
governing dynamics. Our results demonstrate robustness across complex flow
scenarios, including von Karman vortex shedding, ligament breakup, and bubble
adhesion. This establishes a new data-driven pathway for modelling kinetic
systems.

*Boshra Ariguib,Mathias Niepert,Andrei Manolache*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: C-FREE is a simple, negative-free self-supervised framework that combines 2D molecular graphs with ensembles of 3D conformers via ego-nets, predicting subgraph embeddings in latent space; it achieves state-of-the-art MoleculeNet performance and robust transfer to diverse chemical domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-quality molecular representations are scarce due to limited labeled data; many self-supervised methods rely on 2D topology, hand-crafted augmentations, or complex objectives, leaving 3D information underutilized; there is a need to leverage 3D structure for improved prediction and design.

Method: Integrate 2D graphs with multiple conformers using fixed-radius ego-nets as modeling units; learn by predicting subgraph embeddings from complementary latent-space neighborhoods; use a hybrid GNN-Transformer backbone; avoid negatives, positional encodings, or expensive pre-processing.

Result: Pretraining on GEOM yields state-of-the-art results on MoleculeNet, outperforming contrastive, generative, and multimodal SSL methods; strong transfer to datasets of varying sizes and chemistries, confirming 3D-informed representations improve generalization.

Conclusion: 3D-informed molecular representations via simple, negative-free SSL on ego-nets facilitate better property prediction and molecular design, with strong transfer across chemical domains.

Abstract: High-quality molecular representations are essential for property prediction
and molecular design, yet large labeled datasets remain scarce. While
self-supervised pretraining on molecular graphs has shown promise, many
existing approaches either depend on hand-crafted augmentations or complex
generative objectives, and often rely solely on 2D topology, leaving valuable
3D structural information underutilized. To address this gap, we introduce
C-FREE (Contrast-Free Representation learning on Ego-nets), a simple framework
that integrates 2D graphs with ensembles of 3D conformers. C-FREE learns
molecular representations by predicting subgraph embeddings from their
complementary neighborhoods in the latent space, using fixed-radius ego-nets as
modeling units across different conformers. This design allows us to integrate
both geometric and topological information within a hybrid Graph Neural Network
(GNN)-Transformer backbone, without negatives, positional encodings, or
expensive pre-processing. Pretraining on the GEOM dataset, which provides rich
3D conformational diversity, C-FREE achieves state-of-the-art results on
MoleculeNet, surpassing contrastive, generative, and other multimodal
self-supervised methods. Fine-tuning across datasets with diverse sizes and
molecule types further demonstrates that pretraining transfers effectively to
new chemical domains, highlighting the importance of 3D-informed molecular
representations.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes UniPrompt to unify Graph Prompt Learning by theoretically analyzing GPL mechanisms, identifying representation-level prompts as akin to downstream classifier fine-tuning, and showing UniPrompt can adapt pretrained models while preserving graph structure to achieve strong in-domain and cross-domain performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GPL lacks consensus on how prompts interact with pretrained graph models and struggles with data distribution shifts across downstream tasks; a unified theory and adaptable method are needed.

Method: The paper theoretically analyzes existing GPL approaches to show representation-level prompts function like fine-tuning a classifier; based on this, proposes UniPrompt that adapts pretrained models to graphs without modifying the graph structure; validates compatibility with various pretrained models and tests on in-domain and cross-domain tasks including distribution shifts.

Result: UniPrompt integrates with various pretrained models and achieves strong performance in both in-domain and cross-domain scenarios, demonstrating improved adaptability to distribution shifts while preserving graph structure.

Conclusion: GPL should focus on unlocking the capabilities of pretrained models rather than modifying inputs; a unified approach like UniPrompt provides robust, adaptable graph learning across diverse tasks.

Abstract: Graph Prompt Learning (GPL) has emerged as a promising paradigm that bridges
graph pretraining models and downstream scenarios, mitigating label dependency
and the misalignment between upstream pretraining and downstream tasks.
Although existing GPL studies explore various prompt strategies, their
effectiveness and underlying principles remain unclear. We identify two
critical limitations: (1) Lack of consensus on underlying mechanisms: Despite
current GPLs have advanced the field, there is no consensus on how prompts
interact with pretrained models, as different strategies intervene at varying
spaces within the model, i.e., input-level, layer-wise, and
representation-level prompts. (2) Limited scenario adaptability: Most methods
fail to generalize across diverse downstream scenarios, especially under data
distribution shifts (e.g., homophilic-to-heterophilic graphs). To address these
issues, we theoretically analyze existing GPL approaches and reveal that
representation-level prompts essentially function as fine-tuning a simple
downstream classifier, proposing that graph prompt learning should focus on
unleashing the capability of pretrained models, and the classifier adapts to
downstream scenarios. Based on our findings, we propose UniPrompt, a novel GPL
method that adapts any pretrained models, unleashing the capability of
pretrained models while preserving the structure of the input graph. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our method can effectively integrate with various
pretrained models and achieve strong performance across in-domain and

### [317] [OFMU: Optimization-Driven Framework for Machine Unlearning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22483)
*Sadia Asif,Mohammad Mohammadi Amiri*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: OFMU is a penalty-based bi-level optimization framework for machine unlearning that prioritizes forgetting via an inner maximization with a similarity-aware gradient penalty and outer minimization to preserve utility, offering convergence guarantees and improved forgetting-utility trade-offs on vision and language tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a growing need to unlearn targeted data in deployed LLMs and other models without full retraining, due to regulatory, privacy, and safety requirements. Traditional scalarization approaches for multi-objective forgetting/retention often yield unstable training and degraded utility.

Method: A two-loop bi-level optimization. Inner loop performs forgetting with a similarity-aware penalty to decorrelate gradients between forgetting and retention objectives; outer loop minimizes retention to restore utility. The framework includes convergence proofs for convex and non-convex regimes and a scalable algorithm with provable rates.

Result: Empirical results on vision and language benchmarks show OFMU consistently outperforms existing unlearning methods in forgetting efficacy while preserving retained utility.

Conclusion: OFMU provides a scalable, theoretically grounded approach to machine unlearning, achieving better forgetting-utility trade-offs and offering convergence guarantees, thereby supporting regulatory/privacy-safe deployment in practice.

Abstract: Large language models deployed in sensitive applications increasingly require
the ability to unlearn specific knowledge, such as user requests, copyrighted
materials, or outdated information, without retraining from scratch to ensure
regulatory compliance, user privacy, and safety. This task, known as machine
unlearning, aims to remove the influence of targeted data (forgetting) while
maintaining performance on the remaining data (retention). A common approach is
to formulate this as a multi-objective problem and reduce it to a
single-objective problem via scalarization, where forgetting and retention
losses are combined using a weighted sum. However, this often results in
unstable training dynamics and degraded model utility due to conflicting
gradient directions. To address these challenges, we propose OFMU, a
penalty-based bi-level optimization framework that explicitly prioritizes
forgetting while preserving retention through a hierarchical structure. Our
method enforces forgetting via an inner maximization step that incorporates a
similarity-aware penalty to decorrelate the gradients of the forget and
retention objectives, and restores utility through an outer minimization step.
To ensure scalability, we develop a two-loop algorithm with provable
convergence guarantees under both convex and non-convex regimes. We further
provide a rigorous theoretical analysis of convergence rates and show that our
approach achieves better trade-offs between forgetting efficacy and model
utility compared to prior methods. Extensive experiments across vision and
language benchmarks demonstrate that OFMU consistently outperforms existing
unlearning methods in both forgetting efficacy and retained utility.

*Samuele Punzo,Silvia Giulia Galfrè,Francesco Massafra,Alessandro Maglione,Corrado Priami,Alina Sîrbu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A ML-based pipeline integrates eight PBMC microarray datasets to discover MS biomarkers using XGBoost with Bayesian hyperparameter optimization; SHAP identifies key features, which are compared to Differential Expression Analysis (DEA). SHAP and DEA yield overlapping and unique biomarkers; enrichment connects SHAP features to MS-relevant pathways, illustrating the value of combining explainable AI with traditional statistics for mechanistic insight.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To identify robust biomarkers for Multiple Sclerosis by leveraging multi-dataset machine learning with model explainability, and to assess whether explainable AI features align with classical differential expression signals to provide complementary information and mechanistic insight.

Method: Integrate eight publicly available PBMC microarray datasets; robust preprocessing; train an XGBoost classifier; optimize hyperparameters via Bayesian search; compute SHAP values to identify top features for model prediction; compare SHAP-selected genes with those from Differential Expression Analysis (DEA); perform enrichment analysis to link SHAP genes to MS-related pathways.

Result: SHAP identified key features that overlap with but also extend beyond DEA genes; SHAP-identified genes show enrichment in sphingolipid signaling, Th1/Th2/Th17 differentiation, and Epstein-Barr virus infection pathways, supporting biological relevance; the study highlights complementary strengths of xAI and traditional statistics in biomarker discovery.

Conclusion: Explainable AI (SHAP) combined with classical differential expression analysis provides complementary biomarker discovery insights in MS; the approach validates biologically relevant pathways and demonstrates the value of integrating xAI with conventional statistics to deepen understanding of disease mechanisms.

Abstract: We present a machine learning pipeline for biomarker discovery in Multiple
Sclerosis (MS), integrating eight publicly available microarray datasets from
Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMC). After robust preprocessing we
trained an XGBoost classifier optimized via Bayesian search. SHapley Additive
exPlanations (SHAP) were used to identify key features for model prediction,
indicating thus possible biomarkers. These were compared with genes identified
through classical Differential Expression Analysis (DEA). Our comparison
revealed both overlapping and unique biomarkers between SHAP and DEA,
suggesting complementary strengths. Enrichment analysis confirmed the
biological relevance of SHAP-selected genes, linking them to pathways such as
sphingolipid signaling, Th1/Th2/Th17 cell differentiation, and Epstein-Barr
virus infection all known to be associated with MS. This study highlights the
value of combining explainable AI (xAI) with traditional statistical methods to
gain deeper insights into disease mechanism.

### [319] [Learning from Delayed Feedback in Games via Extra Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22426)
*Yuma Fujimoto,Kenshi Abe,Kaito Ariu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper investigates time-delayed rewards in learning in games and proposes Weighted OFTRL (WOFTRL) to offset delays. It shows that delays degrade regret and convergence for optimistic FTRL, but with sufficient optimistic weighting the method achieves constant regret (O(1)) in general-sum games and best-iterate convergence to Nash equilibria in zero-sum poly-matrix games, supported by experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In multi-agent learning, agents update strategies based on past rewards. Delays in observing rewards create misalignment among agents and degrade learning performance. The study seeks a method that remains robust to such delays.

Method: Introduce Weighted OFTRL (WOFTRL) by amplifying the next reward prediction by a factor n. Argue that the optimistic weight offsets time delay. Prove that if the optimistic weight exceeds the time delay, regret is O(1) in general-sum normal-form games, and strategies converge (best-iterate) to Nash equilibria in poly-matrix zero-sum games. Support with experiments.

Result: Theoretical guarantees: O(1)-regret in general-sum normal-form games; best-iterate convergence to Nash equilibria in poly-matrix zero-sum games. Empirical results corroborate the theory.

Conclusion: WOFTRL can overcome time-delayed feedback in learning in games when the optimistic weight is sufficiently large relative to the delay, restoring favorable regret and convergence properties. The approach is supported by experiments.

Abstract: This study raises and addresses the problem of time-delayed feedback in
learning in games. Because learning in games assumes that multiple agents
independently learn their strategies, a discrepancy in optimization often
emerges among the agents. To overcome this discrepancy, the prediction of the
future reward is incorporated into algorithms, typically known as Optimistic
Follow-the-Regularized-Leader (OFTRL). However, the time delay in observing the
past rewards hinders the prediction. Indeed, this study firstly proves that
even a single-step delay worsens the performance of OFTRL from the aspects of
regret and convergence. This study proposes the weighted OFTRL (WOFTRL), where
the prediction vector of the next reward in OFTRL is weighted $n$ times. We
further capture an intuition that the optimistic weight cancels out this time
delay. We prove that when the optimistic weight exceeds the time delay, our
WOFTRL recovers the good performances that the regret is constant
($O(1)$-regret) in general-sum normal-form games, and the strategies converge
to the Nash equilibrium as a subsequence (best-iterate convergence) in
poly-matrix zero-sum games. The theoretical results are supported and
strengthened by our experiments.

### [320] [Activation Function Design Sustains Plasticity in Continual Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22562)
*Lute Lillo,Nick Cheney*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Activation design (Smooth-Leaky variants) preserves plasticity in continual learning across supervised and RL tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In continual learning, models face plasticity loss beyond forgetting; the role of non-linearities is understudied and activation choices may offer a robust, architecture-agnostic solution.

Method: Propose two drop-in nonlinearities (Smooth-Leaky and Randomized Smooth-Leaky), analyze their negative-branch shape and saturation, and evaluate on supervised class-incremental benchmarks and RL with non-stationary MuJoCo environments; introduce a stress protocol and diagnostics to link activation shape to adaptation.

Result: Activation choice emerges as a primary lever to mitigate plasticity loss, with the proposed activations sustaining adaptation without added capacity or task-specific tuning across domains.

Conclusion: Thoughtful activation design provides a lightweight, domain-general strategy to maintain plasticity in continual learning.

Abstract: In independent, identically distributed (i.i.d.) training regimes, activation
functions have been benchmarked extensively, and their differences often shrink
once model size and optimization are tuned. In continual learning, however, the
picture is different: beyond catastrophic forgetting, models can progressively
lose the ability to adapt (referred to as loss of plasticity) and the role of
the non-linearity in this failure mode remains underexplored. We show that
activation choice is a primary, architecture-agnostic lever for mitigating
plasticity loss. Building on a property-level analysis of negative-branch shape
and saturation behavior, we introduce two drop-in nonlinearities (Smooth-Leaky
and Randomized Smooth-Leaky) and evaluate them in two complementary settings:
(i) supervised class-incremental benchmarks and (ii) reinforcement learning
with non-stationary MuJoCo environments designed to induce controlled
distribution and dynamics shifts. We also provide a simple stress protocol and
diagnostics that link the shape of the activation to the adaptation under
change. The takeaway is straightforward: thoughtful activation design offers a
lightweight, domain-general way to sustain plasticity in continual learning
without extra capacity or task-specific tuning.

### [321] [From Parameters to Behavior: Unsupervised Compression of the Policy Space](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22566)
*Davide Tenedini,Riccardo Zamboni,Mirco Mutti,Marcello Restelli*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Unsupervised compression of policy parameter space into a latent manifold to improve sample efficiency and enable latent-space policy gradient, achieving up to 1e5× parameter reduction with preserved expressivity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DRL is notoriously sample-inefficient due to high-dimensional, redundant parameter space, and inefficiencies are compounded in multi-task settings; a compressed, functionally organized parameter space could improve learning efficiency and transfer.

Method: Train a generative model g: Z -> Θ using a behavioral reconstruction loss so that Z is organized by functional similarity rather than parameter proximity. Optimize policies in the latent space Z, and argue that intrinsic dimensionality depends on environment complexity. Validate on continuous control tasks and demonstrate large compression with retained expressivity.

Result: The policy parameterization can be compressed by up to five orders of magnitude while preserving most of its expressivity. The learned latent manifold enables task-specific adaptation via Policy Gradient methods operating in Z.

Conclusion: The approach reduces sample inefficiency by leveraging a functionally organized latent space for policy parameters, reveals that the intrinsic dimensionality is environment-dependent, and enables efficient multi-task adaptation and transfer through latent-space optimization.

Abstract: Despite its recent successes, Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) is
notoriously sample-inefficient. We argue that this inefficiency stems from the
standard practice of optimizing policies directly in the high-dimensional and
highly redundant parameter space $\Theta$. This challenge is greatly compounded
in multi-task settings. In this work, we develop a novel, unsupervised approach
that compresses the policy parameter space $\Theta$ into a low-dimensional
latent space $\mathcal{Z}$. We train a generative model
$g:\mathcal{Z}\to\Theta$ by optimizing a behavioral reconstruction loss, which
ensures that the latent space is organized by functional similarity rather than
proximity in parameterization. We conjecture that the inherent dimensionality
of this manifold is a function of the environment's complexity, rather than the
size of the policy network. We validate our approach in continuous control
domains, showing that the parameterization of standard policy networks can be
compressed up to five orders of magnitude while retaining most of its
expressivity. As a byproduct, we show that the learned manifold enables
task-specific adaptation via Policy Gradient operating in the latent space
$\mathcal{Z}$.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SPEAR: a curriculum-based self-imitation learning framework for LLM agentic tools that balances exploration and exploitation across training stages using a replay buffer, intrinsic rewards, and entropy regularization to avoid entropy collapse and instability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Exploration-exploitation in long-horizon, sparse-reward LLM tool-use tasks is challenging; entropy-only methods destabilize training due to distribution shift; there is a need for progressive, experience-guided exploration that stabilizes learning.

Method: Extend vanilla self-imitation learning with a staged curriculum that gradually shifts entropy; use a replay buffer of self-generated trajectories; intrinsic rewards for skill exploration; tool-use exploration via early tool-call reward; strengthen self-imitation later to exploit successful patterns; recalibrate advantages in the replay; clip high-covariance tokens between probability and advantage to stabilize trajectory entropy.

Result: The abstract presents a training recipe and theoretical/empirical goals but does not report experimental results; claims improved stability and balanced exploration, but no numeric outcomes are provided in the abstract.

Conclusion: SPEAR offers a principled, curriculum-driven SIL framework to progressively balance exploration and exploitation in agentic LLMs, aiming for stable training, better tool-use skills, and reduced entropy-related instability.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) is the dominant paradigm for sharpening strategic
tool use capabilities of LLMs on long-horizon, sparsely-rewarded agent tasks,
yet it faces a fundamental challenge of exploration-exploitation trade-off.
Existing studies stimulate exploration through the lens of policy entropy, but
such mechanical entropy maximization is prone to RL training instability due to
the multi-turn distribution shifting. In this paper, we target the progressive
exploration-exploitation balance under the guidance of the agent own
experiences without succumbing to either entropy collapsing or runaway
divergence. We propose SPEAR, a curriculum-based self-imitation learning (SIL)
recipe for training agentic LLMs. It extends the vanilla SIL framework, where a
replay buffer stores self-generated promising trajectories for off-policy
update, by gradually steering the policy evolution within a well-balanced range
of entropy across stages. Specifically, our approach incorporates a curriculum
to manage the exploration process, utilizing intrinsic rewards to foster
skill-level exploration and facilitating action-level exploration through SIL.
At first, the auxiliary tool call reward plays a critical role in the
accumulation of tool-use skills, enabling broad exposure to the unfamiliar
distributions of the environment feedback with an upward entropy trend. As
training progresses, self-imitation gets strengthened to exploit existing
successful patterns from replayed experiences for comparative action-level
exploration, accelerating solution iteration without unbounded entropy growth.
To further stabilize training, we recalibrate the advantages of experiences in
the replay buffer to address the potential policy drift. Reugularizations such
as the clipping of tokens with high covariance between probability and
advantage are introduced to the trajectory-level entropy control to curb
over-confidence.

### [323] [Overclocking Electrostatic Generative Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22454)
*Daniil Shlenskii,Alexander Korotin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces Inverse Poisson Flow Matching (IPFM), a distillation framework for electrostatic generative models (PFGM++) that speeds sampling across all dimensionalities D by training a generator to match the teacher's electrostatic field. As D→∞, IPFM recovers Score Identity Distillation (SiD). Empirically, IPFM yields near-teacher or better samples with few evaluations, with faster convergence at finite D than the diffusion limit.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reduce compute in electrostatic generative models (like PFGM++) that rely on expensive ODE sampling; enable efficient distillation across all D (including finite D) to improve sampling speed and optimization properties.

Method: Formulates distillation as an inverse problem: learn a generator whose induced electrostatic field matches that of the teacher. Derives a tractable training objective for IPFM. Analyzes asymptotic connection to SiD as D→∞ and demonstrates empirical effectiveness, achieving high-quality samples with few function evaluations. Reports faster convergence for finite D compared to D→∞.

Result: IPFM yields distilled generators that closely match or surpass teacher sample quality with only a few function evaluations. Finite-D distillation converges faster than the diffusion limit (D→∞), aligning with prior findings that finite-D PFGM++ models have favorable optimization and sampling properties.

Conclusion: IPFM provides a general, efficient distillation framework for electrostatic generative models across all D, reducing computational cost while preserving or improving sample quality; finite-D regimes offer additional optimization/sampling advantages.

Abstract: Electrostatic generative models such as PFGM++ have recently emerged as a
powerful framework, achieving state-of-the-art performance in image synthesis.
PFGM++ operates in an extended data space with auxiliary dimensionality $D$,
recovering the diffusion model framework as $D\to\infty$, while yielding
superior empirical results for finite $D$. Like diffusion models, PFGM++ relies
on expensive ODE simulations to generate samples, making it computationally
costly. To address this, we propose Inverse Poisson Flow Matching (IPFM), a
novel distillation framework that accelerates electrostatic generative models
across all values of $D$. Our IPFM reformulates distillation as an inverse
problem: learning a generator whose induced electrostatic field matches that of
the teacher. We derive a tractable training objective for this problem and show
that, as $D \to \infty$, our IPFM closely recovers Score Identity Distillation
(SiD), a recent method for distilling diffusion models. Empirically, our IPFM
produces distilled generators that achieve near-teacher or even superior sample
quality using only a few function evaluations. Moreover, we observe that
distillation converges faster for finite $D$ than in the $D \to \infty$
(diffusion) limit, which is consistent with prior findings that finite-$D$
PFGM++ models exhibit more favorable optimization and sampling properties.

### [324] [Quantile Advantage Estimation for Entropy-Safe Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22611)
*Junkang Wu,Kexin Huang,Jiancan Wu,An Zhang,Xiang Wang,Xiangnan He*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Replace the mean baseline in reinforcement learning with a group-wise K-quantile baseline (QAE) to stabilize entropy and improve RLVR performance; introduces a two-regime gate for hard vs easy queries and yields theoretical entropy bounds and empirical gains, highlighting baseline design as key to scaling RLVR.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mean baselines in reward estimation can cause entropy oscillations (collapse or explosion) when reward outliers skew negative-advantage samples; a robust, quantile-based baseline could stabilize RLVR and improve scaling.

Method: Quantile Advantage Estimation (QAE) replaces the mean with a K-quantile baseline across samples, creating a response-level two-regime gate: reinforce rare successes on hard queries (p <= 1 - K) and target remaining failures on easy queries (p > 1 - K). Under first-order softmax updates, derive two-sided entropy safety bounds preventing entropy collapse and explosion.

Result: Entropy is stabilized; credit assignment becomes sparse (roughly 80% of responses get zero advantage); sustained pass@1 gains observed on Qwen3-8B/14B-Base across AIME 2024/2025 and AMC 2023.

Conclusion: Baseline design in RLVR—not token-level heuristics—is the primary lever for scaling; a quantile-based baseline can curb entropy issues and boost performance.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) strengthens LLM
reasoning, but training often oscillates between {entropy collapse} and
{entropy explosion}. We trace both hazards to the mean baseline used in
value-free RL (e.g., GRPO and DAPO), which improperly penalizes
negative-advantage samples under reward outliers. We propose {Quantile
Advantage Estimation} (QAE), replacing the mean with a group-wise K-quantile
baseline. QAE induces a response-level, two-regime gate: on hard queries (p <=
1 - K) it reinforces rare successes, while on easy queries (p > 1 - K) it
targets remaining failures. Under first-order softmax updates, we prove
{two-sided entropy safety}, giving lower and upper bounds on one-step entropy
change that curb explosion and prevent collapse. Empirically, this minimal
modification stabilizes entropy, sparsifies credit assignment (with tuned K,
roughly 80% of responses receive zero advantage), and yields sustained pass@1
gains on Qwen3-8B/14B-Base across AIME 2024/2025 and AMC 2023. These results
identify {baseline design} -- rather than token-level heuristics -- as the
primary mechanism for scaling RLVR.

*Robert Parker,Oscar Dowson,Nicole LoGiudice,Manuel Garcia,Russell Bent*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Reduced-space neural network optimization (gray-box) accelerates solver performance by not exposing intermediate variables; feasible for GPU-based evaluation and interior-point methods, demonstrated on MNIST adversarial generation and neural-surrogate security-constrained OPF.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Full-space formulations expose internal network variables and constraints to the optimizer, causing slower solves and more iterations. A reduced-space, gray-box approach keeps the network as a black box and evaluates outputs/derivatives on GPU to improve efficiency for optimization problems that incorporate trained neural networks.

Method: Develop a reduced-space formulation where the neural network is treated as a gray box; intermediate variables/constraints are not exposed to the solver. Network outputs and derivatives are evaluated on the GPU. Compare performance to full-space formulations using interior-point methods. Apply to two problems: (1) adversarial generation for an MNIST classifier, (2) security-constrained optimal power flow with a neural-network surrogate enforcing transient feasibility.

Result: The reduced-space formulation yields faster solves and fewer iterations than the full-space approach in an interior-point method. This benefit is demonstrated on two problems: MNIST-based adversarial generation and security-constrained OPF with a neural surrogate enforcing transient feasibility.

Conclusion: Treating trained neural networks as gray boxes in a reduced-space formulation is effective for optimization, enabling GPU-based evaluation and improved solver efficiency, with demonstrated gains on image-classification adversarial generation and power-system optimization problems.

Abstract: We propose a reduced-space formulation for optimizing over trained neural
networks where the network's outputs and derivatives are evaluated on a GPU. To
do this, we treat the neural network as a "gray box" where intermediate
variables and constraints are not exposed to the optimization solver. Compared
to the full-space formulation, in which intermediate variables and constraints
are exposed to the optimization solver, the reduced-space formulation leads to
faster solves and fewer iterations in an interior point method. We demonstrate
the benefits of this method on two optimization problems: Adversarial
generation for a classifier trained on MNIST images and security-constrained
optimal power flow with transient feasibility enforced using a neural network
surrogate.

*Aayush Mishra,Daniel Khashabi,Anqi Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: IA2 is a self-distillation priming method that aligns SFT models with ICL activation patterns, improving post-SFT accuracy and calibration across multiple benchmarks and model families.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ICL can generalize well in data-scarce settings but incurs high inference cost; SFT and ICL adapt models via different internal mechanisms. Leveraging ICL's internal computations (activation patterns) could improve SFT performance.

Method: IA2 (ICL Activation Alignment) uses self-distillation to replicate ICL-like activation patterns in SFT models. It is applied as a priming step before SFT to encourage SFT models to adopt ICL-like internal reasoning.

Result: Using IA2 as a priming step before SFT significantly improves both accuracy and calibration on 12 benchmarks across 2 model families.

Conclusion: IA2 provides a practical method to boost SFT by borrowing ICL-like internal computations and offers a conceptual glimpse into the distinct mechanisms underlying model adaptation.

Abstract: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) is used to specialize model behavior by training
weights to produce intended target responses for queries. In contrast,
In-Context Learning (ICL) adapts models during inference with instructions or
demonstrations in the prompt. ICL can offer better generalizability and more
calibrated responses compared to SFT in data scarce settings, at the cost of
more inference compute. In this work, we ask the question: Can ICL's internal
computations be used to improve the qualities of SFT? We first show that ICL
and SFT produce distinct activation patterns, indicating that the two methods
achieve adaptation through different functional mechanisms. Motivated by this
observation and to use ICL's rich functionality, we introduce ICL Activation
Alignment (IA2), a self-distillation technique which aims to replicate ICL's
activation patterns in SFT models and incentivizes ICL-like internal reasoning.
Performing IA2 as a priming step before SFT significantly improves the accuracy
and calibration of model outputs, as shown by our extensive empirical results
on 12 popular benchmarks and 2 model families. This finding is not only
practically useful, but also offers a conceptual window into the inner
mechanics of model adaptation.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: IIET and IIAD offer an efficient, optimizable high-order Transformer framework that outperforms vanilla Transformers and PCformer, delivering notable accuracy gains and large reductions in inference cost with controllable trade-offs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-order numerical methods boost Transformer performance but bring substantial computational overhead; standard efficiency techniques like distillation may hurt such models; need an optimizable, efficient ODE-based Transformer architecture.

Method: Propose IIET (Iterative Implicit Euler Transformer) to simplify high-order methods via an iterative implicit Euler approach; introduce IIAD (Iteration Influence-Aware Distillation) to balance accuracy and efficiency; develop efficient variant E-IIET; evaluate on lm-evaluation-harness and compare to vanilla Transformers and PCformer.

Result: IIET increases average accuracy by 2.65% over vanilla Transformers and 0.8% over PCformer; E-IIET reduces inference overhead by 55% while preserving 99.4% of task accuracy; the most efficient IIET variant yields >1.6% average gain over vanilla with comparable speed.

Conclusion: IIET/IIAD enable superior performance-efficiency trade-offs for high-order Transformer architectures; distillation may be detrimental for such models; the iterative implicit Euler approach yields compression-friendly, faster models with robust accuracy improvements.

Abstract: High-order numerical methods enhance Transformer performance in tasks like
NLP and CV, but introduce a performance-efficiency trade-off due to increased
computational overhead. Our analysis reveals that conventional efficiency
techniques, such as distillation, can be detrimental to the performance of
these models, exemplified by PCformer. To explore more optimizable ODE-based
Transformer architectures, we propose the \textbf{I}terative \textbf{I}mplicit
\textbf{E}uler \textbf{T}ransformer \textbf{(IIET)}, which simplifies
high-order methods using an iterative implicit Euler approach. This
simplification not only leads to superior performance but also facilitates
model compression compared to PCformer. To enhance inference efficiency, we
introduce \textbf{I}teration \textbf{I}nfluence-\textbf{A}ware
\textbf{D}istillation \textbf{(IIAD)}. Through a flexible threshold, IIAD
allows users to effectively balance the performance-efficiency trade-off. On
lm-evaluation-harness, IIET boosts average accuracy by 2.65\% over vanilla
Transformers and 0.8\% over PCformer. Its efficient variant, E-IIET,
significantly cuts inference overhead by 55\% while retaining 99.4\% of the
original task accuracy. Moreover, the most efficient IIET variant achieves an
average performance gain exceeding 1.6\% over vanilla Transformer with
comparable speed.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A theoretical framework showing that end-to-end training of Discrete Flow Matching (DFM) yields distributions that converge to the true data distribution as training data grows, by bounding the generated distribution error via the risk of the learned velocity field and decomposing that risk into approximation (Transformer capacity) and estimation (finite-sample) errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide formal guarantees for discrete generative modeling with DFM, linking the learned velocity-field dynamics to distributional convergence and quantifying how model capacity and data size affect the outcome.

Method: Decompose the total variation distance between generated and target distributions into the risk of the learned velocity field. Bound this risk by (i) Approximation Error due to Transformer capacity in representing the true velocity, and (ii) Estimation Error due to finite-sample training. Combine these bounds to derive a formal convergence result showing TV distance → 0 as training data size grows.

Result: The paper provides the first formal proof that a trained DFM model's generated distribution converges to the true data distribution as the training set size increases, with explicit bounds arising from approximability of the velocity field and statistical estimation rates.

Conclusion: End-to-end DFM training is provably consistent: with sufficient data and appropriate Transformer capacity, the generated distribution converges to the true distribution. The analysis exposes the key drivers—model expressivity and data sufficiency—for practitioners and suggests avenues to optimize data utilization and architecture design.

Abstract: We provide a theoretical analysis for end-to-end training Discrete Flow
Matching (DFM) generative models. DFM is a promising discrete generative
modeling framework that learns the underlying generative dynamics by training a
neural network to approximate the transformative velocity field. Our analysis
establishes a clear chain of guarantees by decomposing the final distribution
estimation error. We first prove that the total variation distance between the
generated and target distributions is controlled by the risk of the learned
velocity field. We then bound this risk by analyzing its two primary sources:
(i) Approximation Error, where we quantify the capacity of the Transformer
architecture to represent the true velocity, and (ii) Estimation Error, where
we derive statistical convergence rates that bound the error from training on a
finite dataset. By composing these results, we provide the first formal proof
that the distribution generated by a trained DFM model provably converges to
the true data distribution as the training set size increases.

### [329] [Learning Admissible Heuristics for A*: Theory and Practice](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22626)
*Ehsan Futuhi,Nathan R. Sturtevant*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces Cross-Entropy Admissibility (CEA) to train admissible heuristics, achieving near-admissible, better-guided heuristics on Rubik's Cube than PDBs, with theoretical sample-complexity and generalization guarantees for neural (ReLU) heuristics, including goal-dependent cases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Admissible heuristics guarantee optimal A* solutions but deep learning often ignores admissibility, risking poor guarantees and generalization beyond training data. The work seeks to enforce admissibility during learning and to establish sample complexity and network-based generalization bounds.

Method: Formulates heuristic learning as constrained optimization using a Cross-Entropy Admissibility loss to enforce admissibility during training. Validates on Rubik's Cube with comparisons to compressed pattern databases. Theoretically analyzes sample complexity via PDB abstractions and graph structure; replaces the hypothesis class with ReLU networks to derive bounds depending on width/depth; provides generalization guarantees for goal-dependent heuristics.

Result: Near-admissible heuristics obtained with stronger guidance than PDB heuristics on Rubik's Cube. Tighter sample-complexity bounds for A*-generalization when using PDB abstractions and cube graph structure. Generalization guarantees for neural heuristics depend primarily on network size rather than graph size, and the authors derive the first such guarantees for goal-dependent heuristics.

Conclusion: CEA is a promising approach to enforce admissibility in learned heuristics, yielding better practical performance and solid theoretical generalization insights. The results connect structured abstractions (PDBs) with neural networks to achieve both strong guidance and provable guarantees for A*-search performance.

Abstract: Heuristic functions are central to the performance of search algorithms such
as A-star, where admissibility - the property of never overestimating the true
shortest-path cost - guarantees solution optimality. Recent deep learning
approaches often disregard admissibility and provide limited guarantees on
generalization beyond the training data. This paper addresses both of these
limitations. First, we pose heuristic learning as a constrained optimization
problem and introduce Cross-Entropy Admissibility (CEA), a loss function that
enforces admissibility during training. On the Rubik's Cube domain, this method
yields near-admissible heuristics with significantly stronger guidance than
compressed pattern database (PDB) heuristics. Theoretically, we study the
sample complexity of learning heuristics. By leveraging PDB abstractions and
the structural properties of graphs such as the Rubik's Cube, we tighten the
bound on the number of training samples needed for A-star to generalize.
Replacing a general hypothesis class with a ReLU neural network gives bounds
that depend primarily on the network's width and depth, rather than on graph
size. Using the same network, we also provide the first generalization
guarantees for goal-dependent heuristics.

### [330] [Bayesian Transfer Operators in Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22482)
*Septimus Boshoff,Sebastian Peitz,Stefan Klus*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Unifies Gaussian process regression with dynamic mode decomposition to address scalability and hyperparameter/dictionary learning in kernel-based Koopman methods, improving noise robustness and computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The Koopman operator provides a linear framework for nonlinear dynamics, but kernel-based approaches suffer from poor scalability (sparsity) and require careful hyperparameter tuning and dictionary learning. Integrating Gaussian process regression offers probabilistic modeling and automatic regularization to address these issues.

Method: Proposes a GP-based Koopman/DMD framework that uses Gaussian process regression to estimate Koopman operators or modes from data, enabling compact representations and learning of hyperparameters and dictionary elements within the DMD/Koopman setting.

Result: The approach reduces computational demands and enhances resilience to sensor noise, with improved adaptation through data-driven hyperparameter and dictionary learning.

Conclusion: Unifying GP regression with dynamic mode decomposition yields a scalable, noise-robust kernel-based Koopman analysis framework.

Abstract: The Koopman operator, as a linear representation of a nonlinear dynamical
system, has been attracting attention in many fields of science. Recently,
Koopman operator theory has been combined with another concept that is popular
in data science: reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. We follow this thread into
Gaussian process methods, and illustrate how these methods can alleviate two
pervasive problems with kernel-based Koopman algorithms. The first being
sparsity: most kernel methods do not scale well and require an approximation to
become practical. We show that not only can the computational demands be
reduced, but also demonstrate improved resilience against sensor noise. The
second problem involves hyperparameter optimization and dictionary learning to
adapt the model to the dynamical system. In summary, the main contribution of
this work is the unification of Gaussian process regression and dynamic mode
decomposition.

### [331] [Dual Optimistic Ascent (PI Control) is the Augmented Lagrangian Method in Disguise](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22500)
*Juan Ramirez,Simon Lacoste-Julien*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Establishes equivalence between dual optimistic ascent on the standard Lagrangian and gradient-descent-ascent on the Augmented Lagrangian, enabling ALM guarantees for optimistic dual methods and showing linear convergence to all local solutions with guidance for tuning the optimism hyper-parameter.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Constrained optimization is a powerful tool for enforcing neural-network requirements. Existing first-order min-max Lagrangian methods suffer from oscillations and may miss some local solutions. Although Augmented Lagrangian methods (ALM) address these issues, practitioners favor dual optimistic ascent (PI control) on the standard Lagrangian, which works well empirically but lacks formal guarantees.

Method: The paper proves a previously unknown equivalence: dual optimistic ascent on the Lagrangian is equivalent to gradient-descent-ascent on the Augmented Lagrangian. This allows transferring ALM’s robust convergence guarantees to the dual optimistic setting, leading to linear convergence to all local solutions and yielding principled guidance for tuning the optimism hyper-parameter.

Result: Proves linear convergence of dual optimistic methods to all local solutions by leveraging ALM guarantees; establishes a rigorous equivalence to justify PI control as a surrogate for ALM; provides guidelines for tuning the optimism parameter.

Conclusion: Bridges the empirical success of dual optimistic methods with rigorous theory, offering a principled framework for constrained DL and enabling reliable convergence guarantees for popular dual-optimistic schemes.

Abstract: Constrained optimization is a powerful framework for enforcing requirements
on neural networks. These constrained deep learning problems are typically
solved using first-order methods on their min-max Lagrangian formulation, but
such approaches often suffer from oscillations and can fail to find all local
solutions. While the Augmented Lagrangian method (ALM) addresses these issues,
practitioners often favor dual optimistic ascent schemes (PI control) on the
standard Lagrangian, which perform well empirically but lack formal guarantees.
In this paper, we establish a previously unknown equivalence between these
approaches: dual optimistic ascent on the Lagrangian is equivalent to gradient
descent-ascent on the Augmented Lagrangian. This finding allows us to transfer
the robust theoretical guarantees of the ALM to the dual optimistic setting,
proving it converges linearly to all local solutions. Furthermore, the
equivalence provides principled guidance for tuning the optimism
hyper-parameter. Our work closes a critical gap between the empirical success
of dual optimistic methods and their theoretical foundation.

*Zahid Iqbal*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes DL-SH, DL-MH, and I-DL-MH to address client heterogeneity and non-IID data in Federated Learning, plus incentives for participation; reports strong empirical gains over baselines in varied datasets and model architectures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address core FL challenges: (1) some clients cannot train the same models due to resource/needs; (2) statistical heterogeneity (non-IID data) reduces global performance; (3) need for cost-effective incentives to encourage client participation.

Method: Introduce DL-SH for efficient, privacy-preserving, and communication-efficient learning under heterogeneity; DL-MH to manage fully heterogeneous models; I-DL-MH extends DL-MH with incentives to boost client engagement within FL; comprehensive experiments across IID and multiple non-IID distributions, diverse datasets and model architectures.

Result: Significant performance gains and reduced communication costs; DL-SH yields up to 153% improvement in global accuracy; I-DL-MH yields up to 225% improvement under non-IID conditions; outperforms current state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: The proposed DL-SH, DL-MH, and I-DL-MH effectively tackle heterogeneity and incentivize participation in Federated Learning, showing strong empirical performance across varied settings.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a promising decentralized learning
(DL) approach that enables the use of distributed data without compromising
user privacy. However, FL poses several key challenges. First, it is frequently
assumed that every client can train the same machine learning models, however,
not all clients are able to meet this assumption because of differences in
their business needs and computational resources. Second, statistical
heterogeneity (a.k.a. non-IID data) poses a major challenge in FL, which can
lead to lower global model performance. Third, while addressing these
challenges, there is a need for a cost-effective incentive mechanism to
encourage clients to participate in FL training. In response to these
challenges, we propose several methodologies: DL-SH, which facilitates
efficient, privacy-preserving, and communication-efficient learning in the
context of statistical heterogeneity; DL-MH, designed to manage fully
heterogeneous models while tackling statistical disparities; and I-DL-MH, an
incentive-based extension of DL-MH that promotes client engagement in federated
learning training by providing incentives within this complex federated
learning framework. Comprehensive experiments were carried out to assess the
performance and scalability of the proposed approaches across a range of
complex experimental settings. This involved utilizing various model
architectures, in diverse data distributions, including IID and several non-IID
scenarios, as well as multiple datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that
the proposed approaches significantly enhance accuracy and decrease
communication costs while effectively addressing statistical heterogeneity and
model heterogeneity in comparison to existing state-of-the-art approaches and
baselines, with DL-SH improving global model accuracy by 153%, and I-DL-MH
achieving a 225% improvement under non-IID conditions.

### [333] [JointDiff: Bridging Continuous and Discrete in Multi-Agent Trajectory Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22522)
*Guillem Capellera,Luis Ferraz,Antonio Rubio,Alexandre Alahi,Antonio Agudo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: JointDiff unifies continuous spatio-temporal data and synchronous discrete events in a diffusion framework to jointly generate trajectories and events, with cross-domain conditioning (CrossGuid) and controllable generation via weak-possessor-guidance and text guidance; introduces a unified sports benchmark with textual annotations; achieves state-of-the-art results in joint modeling for interactive systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional generative models treat continuous data and discrete events separately, creating a gap in accurately modeling interactive, multi-agent systems where these modalities co-evolve (e.g., sports plays with ball possessions). A joint model promises more realistic, controllable generation and better downstream utility.

Method: Proposes JointDiff, a diffusion-based framework that jointly models continuous spatio-temporal trajectories and synchronous discrete events. Introduces CrossGuid conditioning for multi-agent domains, plus two controllable generation schemes: weak-possessor-guidance (specifying intended ball possessors) and text-guidance (language-driven conditioning). Provides a unified sports benchmark enhanced with textual descriptions for soccer/football datasets.

Result: JointDiff achieves state-of-the-art performance on the proposed joint-modeling task, demonstrating effective non-controllable generation and two controllable modes. The CrossGuid conditioning and guidance signals enable fine-grained control over game dynamics, and the unified benchmark supports richer evaluation with textual descriptions.

Conclusion: Joint modeling of continuous and discrete modalities is crucial for realistic and controllable generative models in interactive systems like sports. The JointDiff framework, with its CrossGuid conditioning and guidance mechanisms, offers a versatile approach likely extensible to other multi-agent domains with combined modalities.

Abstract: Generative models often treat continuous data and discrete events as separate
processes, creating a gap in modeling complex systems where they interact
synchronously. To bridge this gap, we introduce JointDiff, a novel diffusion
framework designed to unify these two processes by simultaneously generating
continuous spatio-temporal data and synchronous discrete events. We demonstrate
its efficacy in the sports domain by simultaneously modeling multi-agent
trajectories and key possession events. This joint modeling is validated with
non-controllable generation and two novel controllable generation scenarios:
weak-possessor-guidance, which offers flexible semantic control over game
dynamics through a simple list of intended ball possessors, and text-guidance,
which enables fine-grained, language-driven generation. To enable the
conditioning with these guidance signals, we introduce CrossGuid, an effective
conditioning operation for multi-agent domains. We also share a new unified
sports benchmark enhanced with textual descriptions for soccer and football
datasets. JointDiff achieves state-of-the-art performance, demonstrating that
joint modeling is crucial for building realistic and controllable generative
models for interactive systems.

*Chenyu Liu,Yuqiu Deng,Tianyu Liu,Jinan Zhou,Xinliang Zhou,Ziyu Jia,Yi Ding*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ECHO introduces a decoder-centric Large EEG Model that uses sequence-to-sequence learning with in-context learning and discrete support samples to enable cross-task generalization without parameter updates, outperforming single-task LEMs in multi-task settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current large EEG models are encoder-centric and miss decoders of comparable capacity, limiting full utilization of learned representations and cross-task adaptability across diverse datasets.

Method: Propose ECHO, a decoder-centric LEM paradigm that reframes EEG modeling as sequence-to-sequence learning, modeling layered relationships among signals, labels, and tasks in sequence space, and using discrete support samples to provide contextual cues for in-context learning.

Result: Empirical evaluations across multiple datasets show ECHO consistently outperforms state-of-the-art single-task LEMs in multi-task settings, with improved generalization and adaptability even when using basic model components.

Conclusion: Decoder-centric LEMs like ECHO can better exploit learned features for flexible, cross-task EEG modeling without parameter updates, achieving robust generalization across tasks and datasets.

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG), with its broad range of applications,
necessitates models that can generalize effectively across various tasks and
datasets. Large EEG Models (LEMs) address this by pretraining encoder-centric
architectures on large-scale unlabeled data to extract universal
representations. While effective, these models lack decoders of comparable
capacity, limiting the full utilization of the learned features. To address
this issue, we introduce ECHO, a novel decoder-centric LEM paradigm that
reformulates EEG modeling as sequence-to-sequence learning. ECHO captures
layered relationships among signals, labels, and tasks within sequence space,
while incorporating discrete support samples to construct contextual cues. This
design equips ECHO with in-context learning, enabling dynamic adaptation to
heterogeneous tasks without parameter updates. Extensive experiments across
multiple datasets demonstrate that, even with basic model components, ECHO
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art single-task LEMs in multi-task
settings, showing superior generalization and adaptability.

### [335] [Learning to Price Bundles: A GCN Approach for Mixed Bundling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22557)
*Liangyu Ding,Chenghan Wu,Guokai Li,Zizhuo Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A graph convolutional network (GCN) framework is proposed to solve bundle pricing by learning from a graph representation of the mixed bundling model; it yields near-optimal solutions with substantial computational savings and scales to 30+ products, even with non-additive utilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bundle pricing is intractable due to the exponential number of candidate bundles; graph-based learning can capture structural patterns to guide pricing decisions and improve solution quality and efficiency over traditional methods.

Method: Build a graph representation of the mixed bundling model (all possible bundles with prices). Train a GCN to learn latent patterns of optimal bundles. Use two inference strategies to derive high-quality feasible solutions from the GCN outputs. Apply a local-search refinement to further improve solutions. Evaluate on instances from small to large sizes, including non-additive utilities.

Result: The GCN-based approach consistently delivers near-optimal solutions (better than 97% of the optimum) on small instances with significantly lower computation. It outperforms other heuristics like BSP on larger instances and provides high-quality solutions for problems with more than 30 products, including non-additive utilities.

Conclusion: A GCN-based framework is effective for bundle pricing, delivering high-quality solutions with reduced computation and good scalability across instance sizes and utility structures.

Abstract: Bundle pricing refers to designing several product combinations (i.e.,
bundles) and determining their prices in order to maximize the expected profit.
It is a classic problem in revenue management and arises in many industries,
such as e-commerce, tourism, and video games. However, the problem is typically
intractable due to the exponential number of candidate bundles. In this paper,
we explore the usage of graph convolutional networks (GCNs) in solving the
bundle pricing problem. Specifically, we first develop a graph representation
of the mixed bundling model (where every possible bundle is assigned with a
specific price) and then train a GCN to learn the latent patterns of optimal
bundles. Based on the trained GCN, we propose two inference strategies to
derive high-quality feasible solutions. A local-search technique is further
proposed to improve the solution quality. Numerical experiments validate the
effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed GCN-based framework. Using a GCN
trained on instances with 5 products, our methods consistently achieve
near-optimal solutions (better than 97%) with only a fraction of computational
time for problems of small to medium size. It also achieves superior solutions
for larger size of problems compared with other heuristic methods such as
bundle size pricing (BSP). The method can also provide high quality solutions
for instances with more than 30 products even for the challenging cases where
product utilities are non-additive.

*Marek Pecha,Michael Skotnica,Jana Rušajová,Bohdan Rieznikov,Vít Wandrol,Markéta Rösnerová,Jaromír Knejzlík*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Machine learning (LSTM and XGBoost) applied to the SPF seismic dataset (1992–2002) to distinguish tectonic vs mining-induced events, achieving high binary-classification F1 scores (~0.94–0.95).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In seismically active mining regions, rapid differentiation between tectonic and anthropogenic events is crucial for monitoring, safety, and interpretation of seismic data. The SPF dataset provides labeled examples to train such discriminators.

Method: Apply sequence-based and gradient-boosted tree models to the SPF dataset of five-station, STA/LTA-triggered seismic records with labeled tectonic and mining-induced events. Specifically, use Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) recurrent neural networks and XGBoost for binary classification (tectonic vs mining-induced).

Result: LSTM and XGBoost achieved F1-scores of 0.94–0.95 on binary classification, demonstrating strong performance of modern ML techniques for rapid event characterization in this region.

Conclusion: ML approaches can effectively discriminate tectonic versus mining-induced seismic events in near real-time, offering valuable support for seismic networks monitoring mining-impacted regions and improving rapid event characterization.

Abstract: The northeastern region of the Czech Republic is among the most seismically
active areas in the country. The most frequent seismic events are
mining-induced since there used to be strong mining activity in the past.
However, natural tectonic events may also occur. In addition, seismic stations
often record explosions in quarries in the region. Despite the cessation of
mining activities, mine-induced seismic events still occur. Therefore, a rapid
differentiation between tectonic and anthropogenic events is still important.
  The region is currently monitored by the OKC seismic station in
Ostrava-Kr\'{a}sn\'{e} Pole built in 1983 which is a part of the Czech Regional
Seismic Network. The station has been providing digital continuous waveform
data at 100 Hz since 2007. In the years 1992--2002, the region was co-monitored
by the Seismic Polygon Fren\v{s}t\'{a}t (SPF) which consisted of five seismic
stations using a triggered STA/LTA system.
  In this study, we apply and compare machine learning methods to the SPF
dataset, which contains labeled records of tectonic and mining-induced events.
For binary classification, a Long Short-Term Memory recurrent neural network
and XGBoost achieved an F1-score of 0.94 -- 0.95, demonstrating the potential
of modern machine learning techniques for rapid event characterization.

### [337] [EPO: Entropy-regularized Policy Optimization for LLM Agents Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22576)
*Xu Wujiang,Wentian Zhao,Zhenting Wang,Li Yu-Jhe,Jin Can,Jin Mingyu,Mei Kai,Wan Kun,Metaxas Dimitris*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes Entropy-regularized Policy Optimization (EPO) to tackle the exploration-exploitation cascade in multi-turn, sparse-reward RL for LLM agents. It introduces three mechanisms—entropy regularization for multi-turn exploration, entropy smoothing to bound entropy fluctuations, and adaptive phase-based weighting—to ensure stable learning and monotonic entropy variance, reporting substantial gains on ScienceWorld and ALFWorld.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training LLM agents in multi-turn environments with sparse rewards leads to an exploration-exploitation cascade: early premature convergence to low-entropy strategies, followed by late-stage policy collapse where traditional entropy regularization destabilizes training. A new entropy-control framework is needed for robust learning in such settings.

Method: Entropy-regularized Policy Optimization (EPO) framework combining: (1) entropy regularization adapted to multi-turn episodes to encourage exploration; (2) an entropy smoothing regularizer that constrains policy entropy within historical averages to avoid abrupt shifts; (3) adaptive phase-based weighting that modulates exploration-exploitation balance across training phases.

Result: The authors claim monotonic decrease in entropy variance with guaranteed convergence. Empirical gains include up to 152% performance improvement on ScienceWorld and up to 19.8% on ALFWorld.

Conclusion: Multi-turn sparse-reward RL for LLM agents requires distinct entropy-control strategies from traditional RL. EPO's combination of per-turn entropy, smoothing, and phase-aware weighting can stabilize training and improve performance in such settings.

Abstract: Training LLM agents in multi-turn environments with sparse rewards, where
completing a single task requires 30+ turns of interaction within an episode,
presents a fundamental challenge for reinforcement learning. We identify a
critical failure mode unique to this setting: the exploration-exploitation
cascade failure. This cascade begins with early-stage policy premature
convergence, where sparse feedback causes agents to commit to flawed,
low-entropy strategies. Subsequently, agents enter late-stage policy collapse,
where conventional entropy regularization becomes counterproductive, promoting
chaotic exploration that destabilizes training. We propose Entropy-regularized
Policy Optimization (EPO), a general framework that breaks this failure cycle
through three synergistic mechanisms: (1) adopting entropy regularization in
multi-turn settings to enhance exploration, (2) an entropy smoothing
regularizer that bounds policy entropy within historical averages to prevent
abrupt fluctuations, and (3) adaptive phase-based weighting that balances
exploration and exploitation across training. Our analysis justifies that EPO
guarantees monotonically decreasing entropy variance while maintaining
convergence. EPO achieves up to 152% performance improvement on ScienceWorld
and up to 19.8% on ALFWorld. Our work demonstrates that multi-turn
sparse-reward settings require fundamentally different entropy control than
traditional RL, with broad implications for LLM agent training.

### [338] [The Lie of the Average: How Class Incremental Learning Evaluation Deceives You?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22580)
*Guannan Lai,Da-Wei Zhou,Xin Yang,Han-Jia Ye*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: EDGE is an evaluation protocol for Class Incremental Learning (CIL) that targets extreme class sequences to better characterize the full performance distribution, using inter-task similarity to adaptively sample these extremes and provide more accurate distributional bounds than standard random-sequence evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard CIL evaluation using random sequences biases performance estimates, underestimates variance, and fails to reflect worst-case scenarios across sequences. There is a need to understand the full distribution of model performance over all possible class orderings, including extreme sequences.

Method: Introduce EDGE (Extreme case-based Distribution and Generalization Evaluation). The protocol theoretically justifies the importance of extreme sequences, shows a positive correlation between inter-task similarity and performance, and adaptively identifies and samples extreme class sequences using inter-task similarity to approximate the ground-truth performance distribution.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate that EDGE captures performance extremes and yields more accurate estimates of distributional boundaries, improving insights for model selection and robustness checking; code is released at the provided URL.

Conclusion: Robust CIL evaluation requires characterizing the entire performance distribution. Extreme sequences are crucial for reliable assessment, and EDGE provides a practical protocol to identify and sample them adaptively, offering closer approximation to ground-truth distribution and actionable guidance for practitioners.

Abstract: Class Incremental Learning (CIL) requires models to continuously learn new
classes without forgetting previously learned ones, while maintaining stable
performance across all possible class sequences. In real-world settings, the
order in which classes arrive is diverse and unpredictable, and model
performance can vary substantially across different sequences. Yet mainstream
evaluation protocols calculate mean and variance from only a small set of
randomly sampled sequences. Our theoretical analysis and empirical results
demonstrate that this sampling strategy fails to capture the full performance
range, resulting in biased mean estimates and a severe underestimation of the
true variance in the performance distribution. We therefore contend that a
robust CIL evaluation protocol should accurately characterize and estimate the
entire performance distribution. To this end, we introduce the concept of
extreme sequences and provide theoretical justification for their crucial role
in the reliable evaluation of CIL. Moreover, we observe a consistent positive
correlation between inter-task similarity and model performance, a relation
that can be leveraged to guide the search for extreme sequences. Building on
these insights, we propose EDGE (Extreme case-based Distribution and
Generalization Evaluation), an evaluation protocol that adaptively identifies
and samples extreme class sequences using inter-task similarity, offering a
closer approximation of the ground-truth performance distribution. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that EDGE effectively captures performance extremes and
yields more accurate estimates of distributional boundaries, providing
actionable insights for model selection and robustness checking. Our code is
available at https://github.com/AIGNLAI/EDGE.

*Elaheh Akbari,Ping He,Ahmadreza Moradipari,Yikun Bai,Soheil Kolouri*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: One-step flow-matching with optimal transport improves fidelity and diversity for continuous-data generation, enabling faster inference without sacrificing performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Flow-matching models are powerful but slow due to sequential sampling; while Mean Flows reduce steps, they may not faithfully replicate the original multi-step process in many continuous domains. There is a need to retain fidelity and diversity while speeding up inference.

Method: Incorporate optimal transport-based sampling strategies into the Mean Flow framework to align one-step generation with the distribution of multi-step flow-matching trajectories.

Result: Demonstrates superior one-step inference accuracy in both controlled low-dimensional settings and high-dimensional tasks, including image generation, image-to-image translation, and point cloud generation. The approach preserves fidelity and diversity relative to the original process.

Conclusion: OT-enabled Mean Flows offer a practical, high-fidelity, and faster one-step generative modeling approach across diverse continuous domains.

Abstract: Flow-matching generative models have emerged as a powerful paradigm for
continuous data generation, achieving state-of-the-art results across domains
such as images, 3D shapes, and point clouds. Despite their success, these
models suffer from slow inference due to the requirement of numerous sequential
sampling steps. Recent work has sought to accelerate inference by reducing the
number of sampling steps. In particular, Mean Flows offer a one-step generation
approach that delivers substantial speedups while retaining strong generative
performance. Yet, in many continuous domains, Mean Flows fail to faithfully
approximate the behavior of the original multi-step flow-matching process. In
this work, we address this limitation by incorporating optimal transport-based
sampling strategies into the Mean Flow framework, enabling one-step generators
that better preserve the fidelity and diversity of the original multi-step flow
process. Experiments on controlled low-dimensional settings and on
high-dimensional tasks such as image generation, image-to-image translation,
and point cloud generation demonstrate that our approach achieves superior
inference accuracy in one-step generative modeling.

TL;DR: End-to-end language-in-the-loop system (VISION) for autonomous culvert inspection using a vision-language model to propose ROIs with rationales, fused stereo depth for scale, and a constrained planner to reposition for close-ups; deployed on a canal-culvert quadruped; external eval shows 61.4% initial ROI agreement with experts and 80% after re-imaging.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automate dangerous, geometry-challenging culvert inspections to improve safety and efficiency, leveraging open-vocabulary VLMs and planning without domain-specific fine-tuning.

Method: Prompt a vision-language model to generate ROI proposals with rationales and confidences; fuse stereo depth to recover scale; use a planner aware of culvert constraints to command repositioning moves for targeted close-ups; onboard see-decide-move-reimage loop; deploy on a quadruped in a culvert; produce high-resolution images for reporting without fine-tuning.

Result: External evaluation by NY Canal Corporation: initial ROI proposals agreed with subject-matter experts at 61.4%, final post-re-imaging assessments reached 80% agreement; system operates end-to-end on-board, delivering detailed images for reporting without domain-specific fine-tuning.

Conclusion: VISION demonstrates that language-informed perception combined with constrained planning can yield expert-aligned, grounded findings for infrastructure inspection in challenging environments, with potential generalization to similar inspection tasks beyond culverts.

Abstract: Culverts on canals such as the Erie Canal, built originally in 1825, require
frequent inspections to ensure safe operation. Human inspection of culverts is
challenging due to age, geometry, poor illumination, weather, and lack of easy
access. We introduce VISION, an end-to-end, language-in-the-loop autonomy
system that couples a web-scale vision-language model (VLM) with constrained
viewpoint planning for autonomous inspection of culverts. Brief prompts to the
VLM solicit open-vocabulary ROI proposals with rationales and confidences,
stereo depth is fused to recover scale, and a planner -- aware of culvert
constraints -- commands repositioning moves to capture targeted close-ups.
Deployed on a quadruped in a culvert under the Erie Canal, VISION closes the
see, decide, move, re-image loop on-board and produces high-resolution images
for detailed reporting without domain-specific fine-tuning. In an external
evaluation by New York Canal Corporation personnel, initial ROI proposals
achieved 61.4\% agreement with subject-matter experts, and final
post-re-imaging assessments reached 80\%, indicating that VISION converts
tentative hypotheses into grounded, expert-aligned findings.

TL;DR: Mono-actuated soft-rigid robot GeoGami uses origami surfaces with a compliant skeleton to enable shape-changing locomotion with a single actuator.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reduce actuator count and improve repeatability in origami-based robots with high DOF by integrating surface compliance and a mono-actuated design; enable environment-adaptive locomotion.

Method: Design a GeoGami platform combining origami surface compliance with a geometric compliant skeleton, driven by a single actuator via a central gearbox; analyze alternative cable-driven actuation; develop a stiffness model; demonstrate shape transformation and rolling.

Result: Prototype demonstration of shape transformation and locomotion; stiffness model; description of gearbox; evaluation of surface transformation and rolling capabilities; analysis of alternative actuation methods.

Conclusion: GeoGami enables shape-changing locomotion with reduced actuation, expanding capabilities of soft-robotic platforms to access varied environments; suggests a path toward underactuated, adaptable robots.

Abstract: This paper presents the design of a new soft-rigid robotic platform,
"GeoGami". We leverage origami surface capabilities to achieve shape
contraction and to support locomotion with underactuated forms. A key challenge
is that origami surfaces have high degrees of freedom and typically require
many actuators; we address repeatability by integrating surface compliance. We
propose a mono-actuated GeoGami mobile platform that combines origami surface
compliance with a geometric compliant skeleton, enabling the robot to transform
and locomote using a single actuator. We demonstrate the robot, develop a
stiffness model, and describe the central gearbox mechanism. We also analyze
alternative cable-driven actuation methods for the skeleton to enable surface
transformation. Finally, we evaluate the GeoGami platform for capabilities,
including shape transformation and rolling. This platform opens new
capabilities for robots that change shape to access different environments and
that use shape transformation for locomotion.

### [343] [Wall Inspector: Quadrotor Control in Wall-proximity Through Model Compensation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21496)
*Peiwen Yang,Weisong Wen,Runqiu Yang,Yingming Chen,Cheuk Chi Tsang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A suction-force model is developed for wall-proximity effects on quadrotors and a suction-compensated MPC (SC-MPC) is proposed to maintain accurate, stable trajectory tracking; validated experimentally with significant performance gains and open-sourced.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Near-wall flight incurs unmodeled aerodynamic effects (vortices and suction) that destabilize quadrotors and increase collision risk; existing controllers struggle to compensate for wall-induced disturbances.

Method: 1) Develop a physics-based suction force model dependent on rotor speed and wall distance. 2) Formulate SC-MPC as a factor-graph optimization that integrates system dynamics, trajectory tracking goals, input smoothness, and actuator limits. 3) Identify model parameters via extensive experiments across varying conditions. 4) Validate on a ducted quadrotor platform and provide open-source implementation.

Result: SC-MPC achieves RMSE of 2.1 cm (X) and 2.0 cm (Y) for position; improvements of 74% (X) and 79% (Y) over cascaded PID, and 60% (X) and 53% (Y) over standard MPC. MAE of 1.2 cm (X) and 1.4 cm (Y). Demonstrated on a ducted quadrotor with collision protection; implementation released publicly at the provided link.

Conclusion: A physics-based suction model combined with SC-MPC substantially improves safe, precise wall-proximity flights and offers a reproducible resource for the community through open-source release.

Abstract: The safe operation of quadrotors in near-wall urban or indoor environments
(e.g., inspection and search-and-rescue missions) is challenged by unmodeled
aerodynamic effects arising from wall-proximity. It generates complex vortices
that induce destabilizing suction forces, potentially leading to hazardous
vibrations or collisions. This paper presents a comprehensive solution
featuring (1) a physics-based suction force model that explicitly characterizes
the dependency on both rotor speed and wall distance, and (2) a
suction-compensated model predictive control (SC-MPC) framework designed to
ensure accurate and stable trajectory tracking during wall-proximity
operations. The proposed SC-MPC framework incorporates an enhanced dynamics
model that accounts for suction force effects, formulated as a factor graph
optimization problem integrating system dynamics constraints, trajectory
tracking objectives, control input smoothness requirements, and actuator
physical limitations. The suction force model parameters are systematically
identified through extensive experimental measurements across varying
operational conditions. Experimental validation demonstrates SC-MPC's superior
performance, achieving 2.1 cm root mean squared error (RMSE) in X-axis and 2.0
cm RMSE in Y-axis position control - representing 74% and 79% improvements over
cascaded proportional-integral-derivative (PID) control, and 60% and 53%
improvements over standard MPC respectively. The corresponding mean absolute
error (MAE) metrics (1.2 cm X-axis, 1.4 cm Y-axis) similarly outperform both
baselines. The evaluation platform employs a ducted quadrotor design that
provides collision protection while maintaining aerodynamic efficiency. To
facilitate reproducibility and community adoption, we have open-sourced our
complete implementation, available at
https://anonymous.4open.science/r/SC-MPC-6A61.

### [344] [DroneFL: Federated Learning for Multi-UAV Visual Target Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21523)
*Xiaofan Yu,Yuwei Wu,Katherine Mao,Ye Tian,Vijay Kumar,Tajana Rosing*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: DroneFL is a lightweight federated learning framework for multi-UAV target tracking that uses a frozen YOLO backbone and a shallow transformer, with altitude-based adaptive instance normalization, enabling real-time onboard operation and cloud-level model fusion to improve tracking accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-UAV target tracking faces resource constraints, heterogeneous data due to differing targets and fields of view, and tight coupling between trajectory prediction and planning. Federated learning promises distributed learning without centralizing data, but remains underexplored for this domain. DroneFL addresses these gaps.

Method: Design a lightweight local model: a frozen YOLO backbone plus a shallow transformer for onboard training. Periodic cloud aggregation to share global models. Introduce a position-invariant architecture with altitude-based adaptive instance normalization to mitigate data heterogeneity. In the cloud, fuse predictions from multiple UAVs and compute optimal trajectories balancing target prediction accuracy and tracking performance. Realizes real-time operation on a Raspberry Pi 5 and maintains a low cloud data rate (~1.56 KBps).

Result: Compared with a distributed non-FL baseline, DroneFL reduces target prediction error by 6%–83% and tracking distance by 0.4%–4.6%. It runs in real time on a Raspberry Pi 5 and maintains an average cloud data rate of about 1.56 KBps.

Conclusion: DroneFL demonstrates the feasibility and practical gains of applying federated learning to coordinated multi-UAV target tracking, delivering improved prediction and tracking with limited onboard resources. Future work could address greater data heterogeneity, scalability, and robustness in diverse, dynamic environments.

Abstract: Multi-robot target tracking is a fundamental problem that requires
coordinated monitoring of dynamic entities in applications such as precision
agriculture, environmental monitoring, disaster response, and security
surveillance. While Federated Learning (FL) has the potential to enhance
learning across multiple robots without centralized data aggregation, its use
in multi-Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) target tracking remains largely
underexplored. Key challenges include limited onboard computational resources,
significant data heterogeneity in FL due to varying targets and the fields of
view, and the need for tight coupling between trajectory prediction and
multi-robot planning. In this paper, we introduce DroneFL, the first federated
learning framework specifically designed for efficient multi-UAV target
tracking. We design a lightweight local model to predict target trajectories
from sensor inputs, using a frozen YOLO backbone and a shallow transformer for
efficient onboard training. The updated models are periodically aggregated in
the cloud for global knowledge sharing. To alleviate the data heterogeneity
that hinders FL convergence, DroneFL introduces a position-invariant model
architecture with altitude-based adaptive instance normalization. Finally, we
fuse predictions from multiple UAVs in the cloud and generate optimal
trajectories that balance target prediction accuracy and overall tracking
performance. Our results show that DroneFL reduces prediction error by 6%-83%
and tracking distance by 0.4%-4.6% compared to a distributed non-FL framework.
In terms of efficiency, DroneFL runs in real time on a Raspberry Pi 5 and has
on average just 1.56 KBps data rate to the cloud.

### [345] [Plan2Evolve: LLM Self-Evolution for Improved Planning Capability via Automated Domain Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21543)
*Jinbang Huang,Zhiyuan Li,Zhanguang Zhang,Xingyue Quan,Jianye Hao,Yingxue Zhang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Plan2Evolve is an LLM self-evolving framework where the model generates planning domains to produce symbolic problem-plan traces, converts these into extended CoT explanations, and uses the resulting data to fine-tune a planning-enhanced LLM with better planning success, generalization, and lower inference costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses limitation where planning domains are viewed only as search utilities and CoT data is costly; seeks scalable, self-generated reasoning data to improve planning and generalization.

Method: Base model generates planning domains; these domains act as engines to produce symbolic problem-plan traces (reasoning traces). The model then expands these traces into natural-language extended CoT trajectories, aligning symbolic structures with natural language reasoning, and uses the data to fine-tune the model.

Result: Data enable fine-tuning to yield improved planning success, stronger cross-task generalization, and reduced inference costs.

Conclusion: Plan2Evolve demonstrates a self-evolving loop that expands the model's reasoning data outside its intrinsic capacity, improving planning performance and generalization while reducing inference costs.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently shown strong potential in robotic
task planning, particularly through automatic planning domain generation that
integrates symbolic search. Prior approaches, however, have largely treated
these domains as search utilities, with limited attention to their potential as
scalable sources of reasoning data. At the same time, progress in reasoning
LLMs has been driven by chain-of-thought (CoT) supervision, whose application
in robotics remains dependent on costly, human-curated datasets. We propose
Plan2Evolve, an LLM self-evolving framework in which the base model generates
planning domains that serve as engines for producing symbolic problem-plan
pairs as reasoning traces. These pairs are then transformed into extended CoT
trajectories by the same model through natural-language explanations, thereby
explicitly aligning symbolic planning structures with natural language
reasoning. The resulting data extend beyond the model's intrinsic planning
capacity, enabling model fine-tuning that yields a planning-enhanced LLM with
improved planning success, stronger cross-task generalization, and reduced
inference costs.

*Zhixin Zhang,Liang Zhao,Pawel Ladosz*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: PL-VIWO2 is a filter-based visual-inertial-wheel odometry system that fuses IMU, wheel encoder, and camera (mono/stereo) with a line-feature framework, SE(2) wheel pre-integration, and MCC for dynamic feature rejection, delivering robust, real-time long-term odometry in urban driving and outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-based odometry often degrades in complex outdoor urban environments due to dynamic objects, textureless regions, and drift. Integrating wheel measurements and geometric line information aims to enhance robustness, accuracy, and long-term stability for autonomous driving.

Method: PL-VIWO2 introduces three main components: (1) a line feature processing framework that exploits the geometric relationship between 2D points and lines for fast, robust line tracking and triangulation; (2) an SE(2)-constrained SE(3) wheel pre-integration that leverages the planar motion of ground vehicles for accurate wheel updates within a filter-based estimator; (3) an efficient motion consistency check (MCC) that jointly uses IMU and wheel measurements to reject dynamic features. The system supports monocular and stereo cameras.

Result: Extensive experiments on Monte Carlo simulations and public autonomous driving datasets show that PL-VIWO2 achieves higher accuracy, efficiency, and robustness than state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: PL-VIWO2 provides robust, real-time long-term visual-inertial-wheel odometry for autonomous driving by effectively fusing IMU, wheel, and camera data through line geometry, plane-constrained wheel pre-integration, and IMU-wheel MCC, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Vision-based odometry has been widely adopted in autonomous driving owing to
its low cost and lightweight setup; however, its performance often degrades in
complex outdoor urban environments. To address these challenges, we propose
PL-VIWO2, a filter-based visual-inertial-wheel odometry system that integrates
an IMU, wheel encoder, and camera (supporting both monocular and stereo) for
long-term robust state estimation. The main contributions are: (i) a novel line
feature processing framework that exploits the geometric relationship between
2D feature points and lines, enabling fast and robust line tracking and
triangulation while ensuring real-time performance; (ii) an SE(2)-constrained
SE(3) wheel pre-integration method that leverages the planar motion
characteristics of ground vehicles for accurate wheel updates; and (iii) an
efficient motion consistency check (MCC) that filters out dynamic features by
jointly using IMU and wheel measurements. Extensive experiments on Monte Carlo
simulations and public autonomous driving datasets demonstrate that PL-VIWO2
outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy, efficiency, and
robustness.

*HaoZhe Xu,Cheng Cheng,HongRui Sang,Zhipeng Wang,Qiyong He,Xiuxian Li,Bin He*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A GPS-denied UAV-quadruped docking framework using a DRL-stabilized quadruped torso and a three-phase UAV controller to achieve robust docking on challenging terrains, validated in simulation and real-world.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enable autonomous docking in GPS-denied environments and heterogeneous systems. Existing work focuses on wheeled platforms; quadrapeds offer better terrain adaptability but require stable landing surfaces amidst posture variations.

Method: Quadruped: Hybrid Internal Model with Horizontal Alignment (HIM-HA), learned via deep reinforcement learning, to actively stabilize the torso and provide a level platform. UAV: three-phase strategy—(1) long-range acquisition with a median-filtered YOLOv8 detector; (2) close-range tracking with a constraint-aware controller integrating a Nonsingular Fast Terminal Sliding Mode Controller (NFTSMC) and a logarithmic Barrier Function to guarantee finite-time convergence under field-of-view (FOV) constraints; (3) terminal descent guided by a Safety Period (SP) mechanism that verifies tracking accuracy and platform stability.

Result: Validated in both simulation and real-world experiments, achieving docking on outdoor staircases higher than 17 cm and on rough slopes steeper than 30 degrees.

Conclusion: The framework enables robust autonomous UAV-quadruped docking in GPS-denied environments by combining a DRL-driven torso stabilization for a stable landing platform with a three-phase UAV docking strategy that accounts for perception constraints and safety during descent.

Abstract: Autonomous docking between Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and ground robots
is essential for heterogeneous systems, yet most existing approaches target
wheeled platforms whose limited mobility constrains exploration in complex
terrains. Quadruped robots offer superior adaptability but undergo frequent
posture variations, making it difficult to provide a stable landing surface for
UAVs. To address these challenges, we propose an autonomous UAV-quadruped
docking framework for GPS-denied environments. On the quadruped side, a Hybrid
Internal Model with Horizontal Alignment (HIM-HA), learned via deep
reinforcement learning, actively stabilizes the torso to provide a level
platform. On the UAV side, a three-phase strategy is adopted, consisting of
long-range acquisition with a median-filtered YOLOv8 detector, close-range
tracking with a constraint-aware controller that integrates a Nonsingular Fast
Terminal Sliding Mode Controller (NFTSMC) and a logarithmic Barrier Function
(BF) to guarantee finite-time error convergence under field-of-view (FOV)
constraints, and terminal descent guided by a Safety Period (SP) mechanism that
jointly verifies tracking accuracy and platform stability. The proposed
framework is validated in both simulation and real-world scenarios,
successfully achieving docking on outdoor staircases higher than 17 cm and
rough slopes steeper than 30 degrees. Supplementary materials and videos are

### [348] [Real-Time Indoor Object SLAM with LLM-Enhanced Priors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21602)
*Yang Jiao,Yiding Qiu,Henrik I. Christensen*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: LLMs provide object geometry priors (size and orientation) as prior factors in a graph-based object-level SLAM to mitigate sparse observations, enabling real-time performance and improving accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Object-level SLAM often suffers from under-constrained optimization due to sparse observations. Traditional priors are labor-intensive and not easily generalizable across object categories.

Method: Leverage large language models to obtain commonsense geometric attributes (size and orientation) for objects and integrate these as prior factors in a graph-based SLAM pipeline. Develop a complete pipeline with robust data association on sparse object-level features and demonstrate real-time operation. Evaluate on the TUM RGB-D and 3RScan datasets, with real-world validation in supplementary materials.

Result: Mapping accuracy improved by 36.8% over the latest baseline; robust data association under sparse observations; real-time SLAM demonstrated in practice.

Conclusion: LLM-derived commonsense priors effectively alleviate under-constrained object-level SLAM, especially during initialization with limited observations, and the integrated pipeline generalizes across datasets with real-time performance.

Abstract: Object-level Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM), which incorporates
semantic information for high-level scene understanding, faces challenges of
under-constrained optimization due to sparse observations. Prior work has
introduced additional constraints using commonsense knowledge, but obtaining
such priors has traditionally been labor-intensive and lacks generalizability
across diverse object categories. We address this limitation by leveraging
large language models (LLMs) to provide commonsense knowledge of object
geometric attributes, specifically size and orientation, as prior factors in a
graph-based SLAM framework. These priors are particularly beneficial during the
initial phase when object observations are limited. We implement a complete
pipeline integrating these priors, achieving robust data association on sparse
object-level features and enabling real-time object SLAM. Our system, evaluated
on the TUM RGB-D and 3RScan datasets, improves mapping accuracy by 36.8\% over
the latest baseline. Additionally, we present real-world experiments in the
supplementary video, demonstrating its real-time performance.

### [349] [Generating Stable Placements via Physics-guided Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21664)
*Philippe Nadeau,Miguel Rogel,Ivan Bilić,Ivan Petrović,Jonathan Kelly*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Integrates stability into diffusion-based sampling for multi-object placements by conditioning on scene/object point clouds and using a stability-aware loss; uses an offline planner for placement labels; no retraining needed. Claims 56% robustness to perturbations and 47% runtime speedup over a leading geometric method across four scenes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Stable object placement in cluttered scenes requires penetration-free contact and force equilibrium; existing methods rely on simulations or heuristics, which are costly or brittle. A physics-informed generative prior could produce stable placements more efficiently.

Method: Train a diffusion model conditioned on scene and object point clouds to act as a geometry-aware prior. Gather multi-modal placement labels via an offline sampling-based planner. Combine the learned prior with a stability-aware loss using the compositional nature of score-based models to bias sampling toward stable regions. No extra retraining is needed and the approach can be applied to off-the-shelf models.

Result: On four benchmark scenes where stability can be computed, the physics-guided diffusion model achieves placements that are 56% more robust to forceful perturbations and runs 47% faster than a state-of-the-art geometric method.

Conclusion: Integrating physics-informed stability into the diffusion sampling process yields more robust and efficient placements. The method acts as a flexible, plug-and-play prior that does not require retraining and leverages existing planners and models.

Abstract: Stably placing an object in a multi-object scene is a fundamental challenge
in robotic manipulation, as placements must be penetration-free, establish
precise surface contact, and result in a force equilibrium. To assess
stability, existing methods rely on running a simulation engine or resort to
heuristic, appearance-based assessments. In contrast, our approach integrates
stability directly into the sampling process of a diffusion model. To this end,
we query an offline sampling-based planner to gather multi-modal placement
labels and train a diffusion model to generate stable placements. The diffusion
model is conditioned on scene and object point clouds, and serves as a
geometry-aware prior. We leverage the compositional nature of score-based
generative models to combine this learned prior with a stability-aware loss,
thereby increasing the likelihood of sampling from regions of high stability.
Importantly, this strategy requires no additional re-training or fine-tuning,
and can be directly applied to off-the-shelf models. We evaluate our method on
four benchmark scenes where stability can be accurately computed. Our
physics-guided models achieve placements that are 56% more robust to forceful
perturbations while reducing runtime by 47% compared to a state-of-the-art
geometric method.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: An end-to-end reinforcement learning framework for humanoid table tennis uses a lightweight ball-state predictor and dense, physics-guided rewards to map ball observations to whole-body joint commands, achieving high in-sim performance and zero-shot deployment on a 23-DOF humanoid.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Humanoid table tennis requires rapid perception, proactive whole-body motion, and agile footwork, which are difficult for unified controllers to achieve with traditional methods.

Method: Policy learns to map ball-position observations directly to whole-body joint commands for arm striking and leg locomotion. A lightweight predictor estimates future ball states from recent observations and augments the policy inputs. A physics-based predictor produces dense future-state rewards to improve exploration and learning. Training occurs in simulation, with evaluation across serve ranges; zero-shot deployment on a Booster T1 humanoid.

Result: In simulation, the policy achieves high performance (hit rate ≥96% and success rate ≥92%) across serve ranges. Ablation studies show that both the learned predictor and the predictive reward design are critical for end-to-end learning. Zero-shot deployment on a 23-DOF Booster T1 demonstrates coordinated footwork and fast, accurate returns.

Conclusion: The work demonstrates a practical path toward versatile, competitive humanoid table tennis through end-to-end RL with predictive signals and physics-guided rewards, enabling effective sim-to-real transfer and robust in-action control.

Abstract: Humanoid table tennis (TT) demands rapid perception, proactive whole-body
motion, and agile footwork under strict timing -- capabilities that remain
difficult for unified controllers. We propose a reinforcement learning
framework that maps ball-position observations directly to whole-body joint
commands for both arm striking and leg locomotion, strengthened by predictive
signals and dense, physics-guided rewards. A lightweight learned predictor, fed
with recent ball positions, estimates future ball states and augments the
policy's observations for proactive decision-making. During training, a
physics-based predictor supplies precise future states to construct dense,
informative rewards that lead to effective exploration. The resulting policy
attains strong performance across varied serve ranges (hit rate $\geq$ 96% and
success rate $\geq$ 92%) in simulations. Ablation studies confirm that both the
learned predictor and the predictive reward design are critical for end-to-end
learning. Deployed zero-shot on a physical Booster T1 humanoid with 23 revolute
joints, the policy produces coordinated lateral and forward-backward footwork
with accurate, fast returns, suggesting a practical path toward versatile,
competitive humanoid TT.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: VLBiMan enables generalizable, cross-embodiment bimanual manipulation from a single human example by combining task-aware decomposition with vision-language grounded adaptation, preserving invariant primitives, and enabling hybrid arm control without policy retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods either need many demonstrations (imitation learning) or lack flexibility in dynamic scenes (modular approaches). There is a need for efficient, generalizable dual-arm manipulation that adapts to scene changes and different embodiments with minimal supervision.

Method: Proposes VLBiMan: derive reusable primitives from a single human example via task-aware decomposition; keep invariant primitives as anchors; adapt adjustable components through vision-language grounding; use semantic parsing and geometric feasibility constraints to resolve scene ambiguities; supports mixed synchronous/asynchronous control of both arms; claims no policy retraining; cross-embodiment transfer.

Result: Empirical validation across tool-use and multi-object tasks showing: reduced demonstrations relative to imitation baselines; compositional generalization via atomic skill splicing for long-horizon tasks; robustness to semantically similar novel objects and disturbances; strong cross-embodiment transfer across platforms without retraining.

Conclusion: Bringing together human priors with vision-language anchored adaptation, VLBiMan advances practical, versatile dual-arm manipulation in unstructured environments, enabling efficient generalization with minimal data.

Abstract: Achieving generalizable bimanual manipulation requires systems that can learn
efficiently from minimal human input while adapting to real-world uncertainties
and diverse embodiments. Existing approaches face a dilemma: imitation policy
learning demands extensive demonstrations to cover task variations, while
modular methods often lack flexibility in dynamic scenes. We introduce VLBiMan,
a framework that derives reusable skills from a single human example through
task-aware decomposition, preserving invariant primitives as anchors while
dynamically adapting adjustable components via vision-language grounding. This
adaptation mechanism resolves scene ambiguities caused by background changes,
object repositioning, or visual clutter without policy retraining, leveraging
semantic parsing and geometric feasibility constraints. Moreover, the system
inherits human-like hybrid control capabilities, enabling mixed synchronous and
asynchronous use of both arms. Extensive experiments validate VLBiMan across
tool-use and multi-object tasks, demonstrating: (1) a drastic reduction in
demonstration requirements compared to imitation baselines, (2) compositional
generalization through atomic skill splicing for long-horizon tasks, (3)
robustness to novel but semantically similar objects and external disturbances,
and (4) strong cross-embodiment transfer, showing that skills learned from
human demonstrations can be instantiated on different robotic platforms without
retraining. By bridging human priors with vision-language anchored adaptation,
our work takes a step toward practical and versatile dual-arm manipulation in
unstructured settings.

TL;DR: TIC-inspired playful deception in robot ice-cream handovers boosts enjoyment and engagement but lowers perceived safety and trust, highlighting trade-offs for entertainment-oriented HRI.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore bounded, culturally familiar deception in human–robot interaction and its effects on user trust, enjoyment, and engagement.

Method: Developed a robotic manipulator with a custom end-effector; implemented five Turkish Ice Cream–inspired deception policies that deceptively delay the handover of an ice-cream–shaped object; conducted a mixed-design study with 91 participants, examining the effects of playful deception and interaction duration on user experience.

Result: TIC-inspired deception significantly increases enjoyment and engagement but reduces perceived safety and trust, indicating multi-dimensional trade-offs across user experience dimensions.

Conclusion: Playful deception can be a valuable design strategy for entertainment- and engagement-focused HRI, but its complex trade-offs (e.g., safety/trust vs. enjoyment/engagement) require careful, deliberate consideration.

Abstract: Playful deception, a common feature in human social interactions, remains
underexplored in Human-Robot Interaction (HRI). Inspired by the Turkish Ice
Cream (TIC) vendor routine, we investigate how bounded, culturally familiar
forms of deception influence user trust, enjoyment, and engagement during
robotic handovers. We design a robotic manipulator equipped with a custom
end-effector and implement five TIC-inspired trick policies that deceptively
delay the handover of an ice cream-shaped object. Through a mixed-design user
study with 91 participants, we evaluate the effects of playful deception and
interaction duration on user experience. Results reveal that TIC-inspired
deception significantly enhances enjoyment and engagement, though reduces
perceived safety and trust, suggesting a structured trade-off across the
multi-dimensional aspects. Our findings demonstrate that playful deception can
be a valuable design strategy for interactive robots in entertainment and
engagement-focused contexts, while underscoring the importance of deliberate
consideration of its complex trade-offs. You can find more information,

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A multi-skill learning framework (CAMP) uses a conditional adversarial motion prior and skill-conditioned rewards to enable a quadruped to learn and switch among multiple locomotion skills from expert demonstrations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robots struggle to acquire diverse locomotion skills with a single policy and to transition smoothly between them; existing methods often rely on single-skill policies or lack fluid skill transitions.

Method: Propose CAMP: a multi-skill learning framework based on Conditional Adversarial Motion Priors. It introduces a skill discriminator and skill-conditioned reward design to achieve precise skill reconstruction and enable active control and reuse of multiple skills.

Result: Demonstrates efficient acquisition and reuse of a diverse set of locomotion skills from expert demonstrations, with improved skill reconstruction and smoother transitions between skills.

Conclusion: The framework provides a practical solution for learning generalizable, multi-skill policies for quadruped locomotion in complex environments.

Abstract: Despite growing interest in developing legged robots that emulate biological
locomotion for agile navigation of complex environments, acquiring a diverse
repertoire of skills remains a fundamental challenge in robotics. Existing
methods can learn motion behaviors from expert data, but they often fail to
acquire multiple locomotion skills through a single policy and lack smooth
skill transitions. We propose a multi-skill learning framework based on
Conditional Adversarial Motion Priors (CAMP), with the aim of enabling
quadruped robots to efficiently acquire a diverse set of locomotion skills from
expert demonstrations. Precise skill reconstruction is achieved through a novel
skill discriminator and skill-conditioned reward design. The overall framework
supports the active control and reuse of multiple skills, providing a practical
solution for learning generalizable policies in complex environments.

### [354] [Improved Vehicle Maneuver Prediction using Game Theoretic Priors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21873)
*Nishant Doshi*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Hybrid framework that combines Level-k game theory with traditional motion-based prediction to forecast the target vehicle's rational maneuver by exploiting interactions with surrounding vehicles. The online optimization outputs a maneuver that can serve as a prior or be integrated with a classifier, aiming to improve lane-change prediction and enhance ACC-based systems (e.g., iQ-Cruise) for potential fuel savings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pure trajectory/classification approaches miss inter-vehicle scene context, especially for lane changes. Level-k game theory provides a human-like, hierarchical reasoning framework to model interactions and rational choices in a multi-agent driving scenario.

Method: Assume knowledge of surrounding vehicles’ states. Use online optimization within a Level-k game-theoretic framework to compute the most rational maneuver for the target vehicle. Output can be used as a prior or integrated with a traditional motion-based classifier. Applicable to decision-making systems like ACC or iQ-Cruise to improve efficiency.

Result: The abstract presents a conceptual framework without reported empirical results or experiments.

Conclusion: Incorporating game-theoretic reasoning can enhance maneuver prediction and decision-making systems, potentially improving efficiency (e.g., fuel savings) if the surrounding-state information is accurate and integration with classifiers is effective.

Abstract: Conventional maneuver prediction methods use some sort of classification
model on temporal trajectory data to predict behavior of agents over a set time
horizon. Despite of having the best precision and recall, these models cannot
predict a lane change accurately unless they incorporate information about the
entire scene. Level-k game theory can leverage the human-like hierarchical
reasoning to come up with the most rational decisions each agent can make in a
group. This can be leveraged to model interactions between different vehicles
in presence of each other and hence compute the most rational decisions each
agent would make. The result of game theoretic evaluation can be used as a
"prior" or combined with a traditional motion-based classification model to
achieve more accurate predictions. The proposed approach assumes that the
states of the vehicles around the target lead vehicle are known. The module
will output the most rational maneuver prediction of the target vehicle based
on an online optimization solution. These predictions are instrumental in
decision making systems like Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) or Traxen's
iQ-Cruise further improving the resulting fuel savings.

TL;DR: WAVE is a worm-gear-based variable-stiffness actuator that decouples external forces from the drive, uses a spring to absorb impacts, and enables continuous stiffness tuning via spring precompression. Experimental validation and manipulator demonstrations show near-zero motor load at rest under load, improved safety, and robust contact-rich operation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance safety and versatility in robotic manipulation by decoupling backdrivable restoring forces from external interactions and providing adjustable stiffness through an energy-absorbing compliant element.

Method: Integrate a non-backdrivable worm gear with a spring-based elastic element to decouple the motor from external forces, convert impact into stored elastic energy, and adjust stiffness by changing the spring precompression; derive and validate a stiffness model; demonstrate on a manipulator incorporating WAVE.

Result: Experimental results validate the stiffness model; motor loads approach zero at rest even under external load; demonstration of decoupled external forces and robust performance in contact-intensive tasks.

Conclusion: WAVE provides decoupled force transmission, adjustable stiffness, and protective operation suitable for safe, robust manipulation in challenging environments.

Abstract: Robotic manipulators capable of regulating both compliance and stiffness
offer enhanced operational safety and versatility. Here, we introduce Worm
Gear-based Adaptive Variable Elasticity (WAVE), a variable stiffness actuator
(VSA) that integrates a non-backdrivable worm gear. By decoupling the driving
motor from external forces using this gear, WAVE enables precise force
transmission to the joint, while absorbing positional discrepancies through
compliance. WAVE is protected from excessive loads by converting impact forces
into elastic energy stored in a spring. In addition, the actuator achieves
continuous joint stiffness modulation by changing the spring's precompression
length. We demonstrate these capabilities, experimentally validate the proposed
stiffness model, show that motor loads approach zero at rest--even under
external loading--and present applications using a manipulator with WAVE. This
outcome showcases the successful decoupling of external forces. The protective
attributes of this actuator allow for extended operation in contact-intensive
tasks, and for robust robotic applications in challenging environments.

*Jialiang Li,Wenzheng Wu,Gaojing Zhang,Yifan Han,Wenzhao Lian*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: SAGE is a Scene Graph-Aware framework for long-horizon manipulation that bridges task planning and visuo-motor control via semantic scene graphs, with a graph-based planner using VLMs/LLMs and a decoupled image-editing pipeline to generate sub-goal images; it achieves state-of-the-art results on long-horizon tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a persistent gap between high-level symbolic planning and low-level control in long-horizon manipulation; existing planning methods generalize poorly and image-conditioned control struggles on unseen tasks.

Method: Two components: (1) a scene graph-based task planner using VLMs and LLMs to parse environment and reason about physically-grounded scene state transitions; (2) a decoupled structural image editing pipeline that converts target sub-goal graphs into images via inpainting and composition.

Result: Extensive experiments show SAGE achieves state-of-the-art performance on distinct long-horizon tasks.

Conclusion: Semantic scene graphs enable bridging semantic reasoning and pixel-level control, enabling controllable synthesis of accurate novel sub-goal images and improved long-horizon manipulation performance.

Abstract: Successfully solving long-horizon manipulation tasks remains a fundamental
challenge. These tasks involve extended action sequences and complex object
interactions, presenting a critical gap between high-level symbolic planning
and low-level continuous control. To bridge this gap, two essential
capabilities are required: robust long-horizon task planning and effective
goal-conditioned manipulation. Existing task planning methods, including
traditional and LLM-based approaches, often exhibit limited generalization or
sparse semantic reasoning. Meanwhile, image-conditioned control methods
struggle to adapt to unseen tasks. To tackle these problems, we propose SAGE, a
novel framework for Scene Graph-Aware Guidance and Execution in Long-Horizon
Manipulation Tasks. SAGE utilizes semantic scene graphs as a structural
representation for scene states. A structural scene graph enables bridging
task-level semantic reasoning and pixel-level visuo-motor control. This also
facilitates the controllable synthesis of accurate, novel sub-goal images. SAGE
consists of two key components: (1) a scene graph-based task planner that uses
VLMs and LLMs to parse the environment and reason about physically-grounded
scene state transition sequences, and (2) a decoupled structural image editing
pipeline that controllably converts each target sub-goal graph into a
corresponding image through image inpainting and composition. Extensive
experiments have demonstrated that SAGE achieves state-of-the-art performance
on distinct long-horizon tasks.

### [357] [Learnable Conformal Prediction with Context-Aware Nonconformity Functions for Robotic Planning and Perception](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21955)
*Divake Kumar,Sina Tayebati,Francesco Migliarba,Ranganath Krishnan,Amit Ranjan Trivedi*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Learnable Conformal Prediction (LCP) replaces fixed nonconformity scores in conformal prediction with a lightweight neural function that uses geometric, semantic, and task-specific features to produce context-aware uncertainty sets, preserving coverage guarantees while significantly tightening prediction intervals across robotics tasks and benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conformal prediction offers distribution-free coverage but relies on fixed nonconformity scores that ignore context, leading to overly conservative or unsafe intervals, especially under novel, noisy, or out-of-distribution inputs in robotics. A context-aware, lightweight approach is needed for reliable uncertainty quantification in resource-constrained autonomous systems.

Method: Introduce a lightweight neural function to compute nonconformity scores using geometric, semantic, and task-specific features, replacing fixed scores in conformal prediction. Preserve CP guarantees (distribution-free coverage) while enabling online adaptation and reduced set sizes. Evaluate across seven benchmarks on three robotic tasks (classification on CIFAR-100/ImageNet; object detection on COCO/BDD100K/Cityscapes; path planning in cluttered environments). Report runtime/memory overheads and hardware efficiency.

Result: LCP maintains CP guarantees while achieving substantial improvements: classification set sizes reduced by ~18%; detection intervals tightened by ~52%; path-planning safety improved from 72% to 91%. Across seven benchmarks, LCP outperforms Standard CP and ensembles. In CIFAR-100/ImageNet, set sizes reduced by 4.7–9.9%. In object detection, bounding boxes become 46–54% tighter. Path planning achieves 91.5% success with 4.5% path inflation (vs 12.2% for CP). Overhead is light: ~4.8% runtime overhead, 42 KB memory; hardware tests show <1% memory and 15.9% inference overhead, sustaining 39 FPS and 7.4x energy efficiency versus ensembles.

Conclusion: LCP provides context-aware, theoretically guaranteed uncertainty quantification for robotics with low computational and memory footprints, online adaptability, and improved practical performance across diverse perception and planning tasks, making it well-suited for resource-constrained autonomous systems.

Abstract: Deep learning models in robotics often output point estimates with poorly
calibrated confidences, offering no native mechanism to quantify predictive
reliability under novel, noisy, or out-of-distribution inputs. Conformal
prediction (CP) addresses this gap by providing distribution-free coverage
guarantees, yet its reliance on fixed nonconformity scores ignores context and
can yield intervals that are overly conservative or unsafe. We address this
with Learnable Conformal Prediction (LCP), which replaces fixed scores with a
lightweight neural function that leverages geometric, semantic, and
task-specific features to produce context-aware uncertainty sets.
  LCP maintains CP's theoretical guarantees while reducing prediction set sizes
by 18% in classification, tightening detection intervals by 52%, and improving
path planning safety from 72% to 91% success with minimal overhead. Across
three robotic tasks on seven benchmarks, LCP consistently outperforms Standard
CP and ensemble baselines. In classification on CIFAR-100 and ImageNet, it
achieves smaller set sizes (4.7-9.9% reduction) at target coverage. For object
detection on COCO, BDD100K, and Cityscapes, it produces 46-54% tighter bounding
boxes. In path planning through cluttered environments, it improves success to
91.5% with only 4.5% path inflation, compared to 12.2% for Standard CP.
  The method is lightweight (approximately 4.8% runtime overhead, 42 KB memory)
and supports online adaptation, making it well suited to resource-constrained
autonomous systems. Hardware evaluation shows LCP adds less than 1% memory and
15.9% inference overhead, yet sustains 39 FPS on detection tasks while being
7.4 times more energy-efficient than ensembles.

*Lingguang Wang,Ömer Şahin Taş,Marlon Steiner,Christoph Stiller*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: FlowDrive is a learning-based trajectory planner that uses reweighting to balance training data and a flow-matching framework with moderated guidance to generate diverse, scene-consistent trajectories; it achieves state-of-the-art results on nuPlan and interPlan, especially after light post-processing (FlowDrive*).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long-tailed driving data causes models to perform poorly on rare but dangerous scenarios; there is a need for data-balancing and generative trajectory methods to improve safety-critical performance.

Method: 1) Compare data-balancing strategies and find trajectory-pattern reweighting effective. 2) Propose FlowDrive: a conditional rectified flow that maps noise to trajectory distributions with few flow steps. 3) Introduce moderated, in-the-loop guidance by injecting small perturbations between flow steps to increase diversity while staying scene-consistent. 4) Evaluate on nuPlan and interPlan; compare to rule-based refinements. 5) FlowDrive* adds light post-processing.

Result: FlowDrive achieves state-of-the-art results among learning-based planners on nuPlan and interPlan; FlowDrive* attains overall state-of-the-art across nearly all benchmark splits.

Conclusion: Balancing data with trajectory-pattern reweighting plus flow-based trajectory generation and moderated guidance yields improved performance and diversity in learning-based planners, achieving robust, state-of-the-art results on challenging autonomous driving benchmarks.

Abstract: Learning-based planners are sensitive to the long-tailed distribution of
driving data. Common maneuvers dominate datasets, while dangerous or rare
scenarios are sparse. This imbalance can bias models toward the frequent cases
and degrade performance on critical scenarios. To tackle this problem, we
compare balancing strategies for sampling training data and find reweighting by
trajectory pattern an effective approach. We then present FlowDrive, a
flow-matching trajectory planner that learns a conditional rectified flow to
map noise directly to trajectory distributions with few flow-matching steps. We
further introduce moderated, in-the-loop guidance that injects small
perturbation between flow steps to systematically increase trajectory diversity
while remaining scene-consistent. On nuPlan and the interaction-focused
interPlan benchmarks, FlowDrive achieves state-of-the-art results among
learning-based planners and approaches methods with rule-based refinements.
After adding moderated guidance and light post-processing (FlowDrive*), it
achieves overall state-of-the-art performance across nearly all benchmark
splits.

*Sigmund Hennum Høeg,Aksel Vaaler,Chaoqi Liu,Olav Egeland,Yilun Du*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Integrating discrete symbolic planning with continuous diffusion to generate long-horizon robot trajectories, improving performance and enabling conditioning vs pure diffusion baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long-horizon tasks require robust planning; diffusion models alone struggle with complex decisions and mode confusion; integrating symbolic planning can guide trajectory generation.

Method: Propose a novel mix of discrete variable diffusion for symbolic plans and continuous diffusion for trajectories, enabling conditioning on partial or complete symbolic conditions.

Result: Hybrid diffusion dramatically outperforms baselines, enabling flexible trajectory synthesis and conditioning.

Conclusion: Hybrid discrete-continuous diffusion effectively combines planning and control for long-horizon robotic tasks, offering controllable, adaptable trajectory generation.

Abstract: Constructing robots to accomplish long-horizon tasks is a long-standing
challenge within artificial intelligence. Approaches using generative methods,
particularly Diffusion Models, have gained attention due to their ability to
model continuous robotic trajectories for planning and control. However, we
show that these models struggle with long-horizon tasks that involve complex
decision-making and, in general, are prone to confusing different modes of
behavior, leading to failure. To remedy this, we propose to augment continuous
trajectory generation by simultaneously generating a high-level symbolic plan.
We show that this requires a novel mix of discrete variable diffusion and
continuous diffusion, which dramatically outperforms the baselines. In
addition, we illustrate how this hybrid diffusion process enables flexible
trajectory synthesis, allowing us to condition synthesized actions on partial
and complete symbolic conditions.

*Tomoya Yoshida,Shuhei Kurita,Taichi Nishimura,Shinsuke Mori*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: EgoScaler enables 6DoF trajectory extraction from raw egocentric videos without auxiliary data, enabling large-scale VLA pre-training that improves task success, matches real-robot data, and benefits from mixing datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need scalable, annotation-free data to train Vision-Language-Action models for object manipulation; reliance on hand-pose or teleoperation is costly and limits scale.

Method: Apply EgoScaler to four large egocentric video datasets to recover 6DoF object trajectories; automatically refine noisy/incomplete trajectories; assemble a large-scale dataset; pre-train a π0 architecture in simulation and real robots.

Result: Pre-training on the EgoScaler dataset improves task success by >20% compared to training from scratch; performance competitive with real-robot datasets; combining EgoScaler data with real-robot data yields further improvements.

Conclusion: Egocentric video data, when auto-processed with EgoScaler, offer a scalable and effective resource for advancing VLA research, approaching real-robot data performance and enabling diffusion of data-scale benefits across manipulation tasks.

Abstract: Egocentric videos capture how humans manipulate objects and tools, providing
diverse motion cues for learning object manipulation. Unlike the costly,
expert-driven manual teleoperation commonly used in training
Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs), egocentric videos offer a scalable
alternative. However, prior studies that leverage such videos for training
robot policies typically rely on auxiliary annotations, such as detailed
hand-pose recordings. Consequently, it remains unclear whether VLAs can be
trained directly from raw egocentric videos. In this work, we address this
challenge by leveraging EgoScaler, a framework that extracts 6DoF object
manipulation trajectories from egocentric videos without requiring auxiliary
recordings. We apply EgoScaler to four large-scale egocentric video datasets
and automatically refine noisy or incomplete trajectories, thereby constructing
a new large-scale dataset for VLA pre-training. Our experiments with a
state-of-the-art $\pi_0$ architecture in both simulated and real-robot
environments yield three key findings: (i) pre-training on our dataset improves
task success rates by over 20\% compared to training from scratch, (ii) the
performance is competitive with that achieved using real-robot datasets, and
(iii) combining our dataset with real-robot data yields further improvements.
These results demonstrate that egocentric videos constitute a promising and
scalable resource for advancing VLA research.

*Yuping Gu,Bangchao Huang,Haoran Sun,Ronghan Xu,Jiayi Yin,Wei Zhang,Fang Wan,Jia Pan,Chaoyang Song*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A computational framework for designing 1-DoF overconstrained robotic limbs that achieve self-collision-free, energy-efficient full-cycle motion along a desired spatial trajectory, validated on automata and hexapod robots.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While multi-DoF limbs are common, 1-DoF designs offer simplicity, robustness, cost-effectiveness, and efficiency. Overconstrained linkages can introduce motion diversity but must avoid self-collision and energy waste. This work aims to develop a general optimization-based approach to design such limbs and plan energy-efficient trajectories.

Method: 1) Generalized geometric optimization for self-collision-free design of linkage-based limbs; 2) Spatial trajectory generation for overconstrained linkages by optimizing similarity and dynamic-related metrics; 3) Geometry optimization of linkage shape to ensure smooth, collision-free motion driven by a single actuator; 4) Validation through experiments on personalized automata and bio-inspired hexapod robots.

Result: The hexapod robot with overconstrained limbs demonstrated outstanding energy efficiency during forward walking; experimental validation supported the proposed framework.

Conclusion: The approach enables energy-efficient, self-collision-free 1-DoF overconstrained limbs capable of following specified spatial trajectories, offering a practical design framework for compact, low-cost robotic systems with single-actuator actuation.

Abstract: While it is expected to build robotic limbs with multiple degrees of freedom
(DoF) inspired by nature, a single DoF design remains fundamental, providing
benefits that include, but are not limited to, simplicity, robustness,
cost-effectiveness, and efficiency. Mechanisms, especially those with multiple
links and revolute joints connected in closed loops, play an enabling factor in
introducing motion diversity for 1-DoF systems, which are usually constrained
by self-collision during a full-cycle range of motion. This study presents a
novel computational approach to designing one-degree-of-freedom (1-DoF)
overconstrained robotic limbs for a desired spatial trajectory, while achieving
energy-efficient, self-collision-free motion in full-cycle rotations. Firstly,
we present the geometric optimization problem of linkage-based robotic limbs in
a generalized formulation for self-collision-free design. Next, we formulate
the spatial trajectory generation problem with the overconstrained linkages by
optimizing the similarity and dynamic-related metrics. We further optimize the
geometric shape of the overconstrained linkage to ensure smooth and
collision-free motion driven by a single actuator. We validated our proposed
method through various experiments, including personalized automata and
bio-inspired hexapod robots. The resulting hexapod robot, featuring
overconstrained robotic limbs, demonstrated outstanding energy efficiency
during forward walking.

### [362] [An Adaptive ICP LiDAR Odometry Based on Reliable Initial Pose](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22058)
*Qifeng Wang,Weigang Li,Lei Nie,Xin Xu,Wenping Liu,Zhe Xu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: An adaptive ICP-based LiDAR odometry method using a reliable initial pose and adaptive threshold to improve registration accuracy in dynamic environments; validated on KITTI showing improved accuracy over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classic ICP-based LiDAR odometry can get trapped in local optima when the initial pose is unreliable, and it struggles in dynamic environments. An adaptive approach that ensures a reliable initial alignment and adjusts to changes could improve accuracy and robustness.

Method: 1) Use density-filtered distributed coarse registration to obtain a rough initial pose. 2) Select a reliable initial pose by comparing it with a motion-prediction pose to reduce initial misalignment. 3) Combine current and historical errors to dynamically adjust the ICP convergence threshold for dynamic environments. 4) Perform point-to-plane adaptive ICP from the current frame to a local map using the reliable initial pose and adaptive threshold.

Result: Experiments on the KITTI dataset show the proposed method outperforms existing approaches and achieves higher LiDAR odometry accuracy.

Conclusion: The approach yields higher-precision LiDAR odometry in dynamic scenarios by ensuring a reliable initial pose and adapting the registration criterion to real-time changes.

Abstract: As a key technology for autonomous navigation and positioning in mobile
robots, light detection and ranging (LiDAR) odometry is widely used in
autonomous driving applications. The Iterative Closest Point (ICP)-based
methods have become the core technique in LiDAR odometry due to their efficient
and accurate point cloud registration capability. However, some existing
ICP-based methods do not consider the reliability of the initial pose, which
may cause the method to converge to a local optimum. Furthermore, the absence
of an adaptive mechanism hinders the effective handling of complex dynamic
environments, resulting in a significant degradation of registration accuracy.
To address these issues, this paper proposes an adaptive ICP-based LiDAR
odometry method that relies on a reliable initial pose. First, distributed
coarse registration based on density filtering is employed to obtain the
initial pose estimation. The reliable initial pose is then selected by
comparing it with the motion prediction pose, reducing the initial error
between the source and target point clouds. Subsequently, by combining the
current and historical errors, the adaptive threshold is dynamically adjusted
to accommodate the real-time changes in the dynamic environment. Finally, based
on the reliable initial pose and the adaptive threshold, point-to-plane
adaptive ICP registration is performed from the current frame to the local map,
achieving high-precision alignment of the source and target point clouds.
Extensive experiments on the public KITTI dataset demonstrate that the proposed
method outperforms existing approaches and significantly enhances the accuracy
of LiDAR odometry.

*Ethan Fulcher,J. Diego Caporale,Yifeng Zhang,John Ruck,Feifei Qian*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Comparing a sensing-oriented crawling gait vs a locomotion-oriented trotting gait for proprioceptive terrain sensing reveals crawl offers higher crust rupture detection accuracy and lower variance, while trot shows larger magnitude/variance in substrate strength measurements. Gait design affects sensing during locomotion for planetary exploration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable fast, dense terrain measurements during locomotion by legged robots and to understand terramechanical properties of deformable terrains for rovers on Earth and other worlds.

Method: Experimental comparison of two gait strategies on a lab transect with three substrate types (rigid, loose sand, loose sand with crust). Proprioceptive sensing via low-gear direct-drive actuators; quantify strength/texture via penetration resistance and crust rupture detection.

Result: Both gaits distinguish substrate resistance differences; trot shows larger magnitude and variance; crawl detects crust ruptures with higher accuracy; results inform gait design for sensing during locomotion.

Conclusion: Gait choice materially affects in-situ sensing accuracy; slower sensing-oriented gaits can improve detection of brittle surface features; insights guide scouting and scientific measurements on other worlds.

Abstract: In-situ robotic exploration is an important tool for advancing knowledge of
geological processes that describe the Earth and other Planetary bodies. To
inform and enhance operations for these roving laboratories, it is imperative
to understand the terramechanical properties of their environments, especially
for traversing on loose, deformable substrates. Recent research suggested that
legged robots with direct-drive and low-gear ratio actuators can sensitively
detect external forces, and therefore possess the potential to measure terrain
properties with their legs during locomotion, providing unprecedented sampling
speed and density while accessing terrains previously too risky to sample. This
paper explores these ideas by investigating the impact of gait on
proprioceptive terrain sensing accuracy, particularly comparing a
sensing-oriented gait, Crawl N' Sense, with a locomotion-oriented gait,
Trot-Walk. Each gait's ability to measure the strength and texture of
deformable substrate is quantified as the robot locomotes over a laboratory
transect consisting of a rigid surface, loose sand, and loose sand with
synthetic surface crusts. Our results suggest that with both the
sensing-oriented crawling gait and locomotion-oriented trot gait, the robot can
measure a consistent difference in the strength (in terms of penetration
resistance) between the low- and high-resistance substrates; however, the
locomotion-oriented trot gait contains larger magnitude and variance in
measurements. Furthermore, the slower crawl gait can detect brittle ruptures of
the surface crusts with significantly higher accuracy than the faster trot
gait. Our results offer new insights that inform legged robot "sensing during
locomotion" gait design and planning for scouting the terrain and producing
scientific measurements on other worlds to advance our understanding of their
geology and formation.

*Xiaohuan Pei,Yuxing Chen,Siyu Xu,Yunke Wang,Yuheng Shi,Chang Xu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Action-aware dynamic pruning (ADP) reduces VLA-model computation by gating and selecting tokens based on recent action trajectories, achieving faster inference with maintained or improved manipulation performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-Language-Action models for robotic manipulation incur high cost from dense multi-modal tokens. Token redundancy varies with manipulation stage and action dynamics; exploiting this can speed up inference without sacrificing perceptual accuracy.

Method: Introduce an action-aware trajectory gating mechanism that conditions token pruning on recent action trajectories. Combine text-driven token selection with dynamics-aware retention ratios inferred from past motion windows to adaptively balance coarse vs. fine manipulation stages.

Result: Significant reductions in FLOPs and action inference latency (e.g., 1.35x speedup on OpenVLA-OFT) with competitive or improved success rates (e.g., ~25.8% improvement on OpenVLA) across LIBERO suites and real-world scenarios.

Conclusion: ADP provides a simple plug-in to make VLA-based robotic policies more efficient by aligning token pruning with manipulation dynamics, enabling better efficiency–performance trade-offs in practice.

Abstract: Robotic manipulation with Vision-Language-Action models requires efficient
inference over long-horizon multi-modal context, where attention to dense
visual tokens dominates computational cost. Existing methods optimize inference
speed by reducing visual redundancy within VLA models, but they overlook the
varying redundancy across robotic manipulation stages. We observe that the
visual token redundancy is higher in coarse manipulation phase than in
fine-grained operations, and is strongly correlated with the action dynamic.
Motivated by this observation, we propose \textbf{A}ction-aware
\textbf{D}ynamic \textbf{P}runing (\textbf{ADP}), a multi-modal pruning
framework that integrates text-driven token selection with action-aware
trajectory gating. Our method introduces a gating mechanism that conditions the
pruning signal on recent action trajectories, using past motion windows to
adaptively adjust token retention ratios in accordance with dynamics, thereby
balancing computational efficiency and perceptual precision across different
manipulation stages. Extensive experiments on the LIBERO suites and diverse
real-world scenarios demonstrate that our method significantly reduces FLOPs
and action inference latency (\textit{e.g.} $1.35 \times$ speed up on
OpenVLA-OFT) while maintaining competitive success rates (\textit{e.g.} 25.8\%
improvements with OpenVLA) compared to baselines, thereby providing a simple
plug-in path to efficient robot policies that advances the efficiency and
performance frontier of robotic manipulation. Our project website is:

*Alireza Aliyari,Gholamreza Vossoughi*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Robust nonlinear model predictive control via multi-stage NMPC for a 2-DoF exoskeleton; demonstrates improved robustness to uncertainties and unknown payloads, outperforming non-robust NMPC.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Uncertainties in human-robot interaction and nonlinear dynamics degrade performance of linearized robust MPC; need methods that handle nonlinearities without excessive conservatism.

Method: Proposes multi-stage RNMPC (multi-scenario NMPC) solving a nonlinear optimization to control a two-degree-of-freedom exoskeleton, focusing on minimizing human-robot interaction forces during swing with unknown loads; evaluated via simulations and experiments.

Result: Significant robustness improvements; lower tracking errors and interaction forces under uncertainties; RMS thigh and shank interaction forces reduced by 77% and 94% respectively when a 2 kg payload and external disturbances are present.

Conclusion: Multi-stage NMPC is effective for robust control of exoskeletons under uncertainties, outperforming non-robust NMPC; potential for safer, more reliable human-robot collaboration.

Abstract: The use of exoskeleton robots is increasing due to the rising number of
musculoskeletal injuries. However, their effectiveness depends heavily on the
design of control systems. Designing robust controllers is challenging because
of uncertainties in human-robot systems. Among various control strategies,
Model Predictive Control (MPC) is a powerful approach due to its ability to
handle constraints and optimize performance. Previous studies have used
linearization-based methods to implement robust MPC on exoskeletons, but these
can degrade performance due to nonlinearities in the robot's dynamics. To
address this gap, this paper proposes a Robust Nonlinear Model Predictive
Control (RNMPC) method, called multi-stage NMPC, to control a
two-degree-of-freedom exoskeleton by solving a nonlinear optimization problem.
This method uses multiple scenarios to represent system uncertainties. The
study focuses on minimizing human-robot interaction forces during the swing
phase, particularly when the robot carries unknown loads. Simulations and
experimental tests show that the proposed method significantly improves
robustness, outperforming non-robust NMPC. It achieves lower tracking errors
and interaction forces under various uncertainties. For instance, when a 2 kg
unknown payload is combined with external disturbances, the RMS values of thigh
and shank interaction forces for multi-stage NMPC are reduced by 77 and 94
percent, respectively, compared to non-robust NMPC.

*Haoqi Yuan,Ziye Huang,Ye Wang,Chuan Mao,Chaoyi Xu,Zongqing Lu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: DemoGrasp presents a simple, data-efficient approach to universal dexterous grasping by editing a single successful demonstration trajectory (wrist pose and finger angles) and optimizing a universal policy via reinforcement learning on hundreds of objects in a single-step MDP, yielding high simulated success and strong cross-domain transfer to unseen objects and real-world data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dexterous grasping with multi-fingered hands remains challenging due to high-dimensional, long-horizon RL exploration; existing methods rely on complex rewards/curricula and often fail to generalize across object diversity and embodiments.

Method: Extracts a grasping trajectory from one successful demonstration and edits it by changing wrist pose for grasp location and hand joints for grasp type. Formulated as a single-step MDP; train a universal policy across hundreds of objects in parallel in simulation using a simple reward (binary success + collision penalty). Evaluation includes simulation on DexGraspNet with Shadow Hand and cross-object embodiment transfer; vision-based imitation to real objects; supports RGB/depth and language-guided grasping.

Result: In simulation, achieve 95% success on DexGraspNet objects; superior to prior methods. Demonstrates strong transfer: average 84.6% across six unseen object datasets with different dexterous hand embodiments, trained on 175 objects. Vision-based imitation grasps 110 unseen real objects; robust to spatial, background, lighting changes; works with RGB and depth; extends to language-guided grasping in clutter.

Conclusion: A simple demonstration-editing paradigm coupled with a single-step RL objective yields universal dexterous grasping with strong generalization to unseen objects, embodiments, and real-world scenarios, suggesting data-efficient strategies for dexterous manipulation and potential for multimodal extensions.

Abstract: Universal grasping with multi-fingered dexterous hands is a fundamental
challenge in robotic manipulation. While recent approaches successfully learn
closed-loop grasping policies using reinforcement learning (RL), the inherent
difficulty of high-dimensional, long-horizon exploration necessitates complex
reward and curriculum design, often resulting in suboptimal solutions across
diverse objects. We propose DemoGrasp, a simple yet effective method for
learning universal dexterous grasping. We start from a single successful
demonstration trajectory of grasping a specific object and adapt to novel
objects and poses by editing the robot actions in this trajectory: changing the
wrist pose determines where to grasp, and changing the hand joint angles
determines how to grasp. We formulate this trajectory editing as a single-step
Markov Decision Process (MDP) and use RL to optimize a universal policy across
hundreds of objects in parallel in simulation, with a simple reward consisting
of a binary success term and a robot-table collision penalty. In simulation,
DemoGrasp achieves a 95% success rate on DexGraspNet objects using the Shadow
Hand, outperforming previous state-of-the-art methods. It also shows strong
transferability, achieving an average success rate of 84.6% across diverse
dexterous hand embodiments on six unseen object datasets, while being trained
on only 175 objects. Through vision-based imitation learning, our policy
successfully grasps 110 unseen real-world objects, including small, thin items.
It generalizes to spatial, background, and lighting changes, supports both RGB
and depth inputs, and extends to language-guided grasping in cluttered scenes.

TL;DR: Introduces DHAGrasp, a text-guided dual-hand grasp generator trained on a large-scale SymOpt dataset built from single-hand data and symmetries, achieving diverse, semantically consistent dual-hand grasps and strong generalization to unseen objects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dual-hand grasp data with semantic labels are scarce; existing datasets mostly cover single-hand grasps and lack rich part annotations. Leveraging object/hand symmetries and existing datasets can create a scalable, semantically rich dual-hand grasp dataset to enable robust dual-hand manipulation.

Method: 1) SymOpt pipeline constructs a large dual-hand grasp dataset from existing single-hand datasets by exploiting object and hand symmetries. 2) DHAGrasp is a two-stage, text-guided generator that learns from a small set of segmented objects and scales to a larger pool of unsegmented objects, using a novel dual-hand affordance representation.

Result: Experiments show DHAGrasp yields diverse, semantically consistent dual-hand grasps and outperforms strong baselines in grasp quality and generalization to unseen objects.

Conclusion: The approach demonstrates the feasibility of scalable dual-hand grasp synthesis guided by affordances and language, enabling robust dual-hand manipulation on unseen objects; a project page is provided.

Abstract: Learning to generate dual-hand grasps that respect object semantics is
essential for robust hand-object interaction but remains largely underexplored
due to dataset scarcity. Existing grasp datasets predominantly focus on
single-hand interactions and contain only limited semantic part annotations. To
address these challenges, we introduce a pipeline, SymOpt, that constructs a
large-scale dual-hand grasp dataset by leveraging existing single-hand datasets
and exploiting object and hand symmetries. Building on this, we propose a
text-guided dual-hand grasp generator, DHAGrasp, that synthesizes Dual-Hand
Affordance-aware Grasps for unseen objects. Our approach incorporates a novel
dual-hand affordance representation and follows a two-stage design, which
enables effective learning from a small set of segmented training objects while
scaling to a much larger pool of unsegmented data. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method produces diverse and semantically consistent
grasps, outperforming strong baselines in both grasp quality and generalization
to unseen objects. The project page is at

### [368] [Actions as Language: Fine-Tuning VLMs into VLAs Without Catastrophic Forgetting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22195)
*Asher J. Hancock,Xindi Wu,Lihan Zha,Olga Russakovsky,Anirudha Majumdar*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Introduces VLM2VLA, a data-alignment approach that expresses actions in natural language, enabling LoRA-based fine-tuning of vision-language-action models that preserves VLM reasoning and achieves zero-shot generalization and multilingual instruction following.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fine-tuning VLMs on robotics data causes catastrophic forgetting due to distribution mismatch between internet-scale pretraining and robot data. Need to preserve core VLM capabilities while learning actions.

Method: Represent low-level actions with natural language to align robotics data with VLM pretraining; train VLAs using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) only, avoiding backbone modification and large-scale co-training.

Result: Preserves the VLM's core capabilities; enables zero-shot generalization to novel tasks requiring open-world semantic reasoning; supports multilingual instruction following; validated by extensive VQA studies and 800+ real-world robotics experiments.

Conclusion: Data-level alignment with natural-language actions plus LoRA enables effective VLA training without catastrophic forgetting or expensive co-training, maintaining broad VLM capabilities while enabling robotics-specific learning.

Abstract: Fine-tuning vision-language models (VLMs) on robot teleoperation data to
create vision-language-action (VLA) models is a promising paradigm for training
generalist policies, but it suffers from a fundamental tradeoff: learning to
produce actions often diminishes the VLM's foundational reasoning and
multimodal understanding, hindering generalization to novel scenarios,
instruction following, and semantic understanding. We argue that this
catastrophic forgetting is due to a distribution mismatch between the VLM's
internet-scale pretraining corpus and the robotics fine-tuning data. Inspired
by this observation, we introduce VLM2VLA: a VLA training paradigm that first
resolves this mismatch at the data level by representing low-level actions with
natural language. This alignment makes it possible to train VLAs solely with
Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), thereby minimally modifying the VLM backbone and
averting catastrophic forgetting. As a result, the VLM can be fine-tuned on
robot teleoperation data without fundamentally altering the underlying
architecture and without expensive co-training on internet-scale VLM datasets.
Through extensive Visual Question Answering (VQA) studies and over 800
real-world robotics experiments, we demonstrate that VLM2VLA preserves the
VLM's core capabilities, enabling zero-shot generalization to novel tasks that
require open-world semantic reasoning and multilingual instruction following.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: MimicDreamer translates scalable human demonstrations into robot-ready supervision to bridge the domain gap in Vision-Language-Action models, enabling effective policy training from synthesized data and boosting performance when combined with real robot data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the domain shift between human demonstration videos and robot-executed videos in VLA models, which hinders generalization and makes robot data collection expensive. The work leverages scalable human videos by aligning vision, viewpoint, and actions to produce usable robot supervision.

Method: Three components: (1) H2R Aligner—a video diffusion model that transfers motion from human manipulation footage to robot demonstrations; (2) EgoStabilizer—a viewpoint stabilizer that canonicalizes egocentric videos using homography and inpaints occlusions/distortions from warping; (3) Action alignment via mapping human hand trajectories to the robot frame and solving a constrained inverse kinematics problem to produce feasible, low-jitter joint commands with accurate pose tracking. The VLA policy is then trained on these synthesized videos; evaluation includes few-shot execution on real robots and scaling experiments with varying amounts of human data.

Result: Models trained purely on synthesized human-to-robot videos achieve few-shot execution on real robots. Scaling training with human data significantly boosts performance compared to models trained only on real robot data, with an average improvement of 14.7 percentage points in success rate across six manipulation tasks.

Conclusion: MimicDreamer demonstrates that synthetic, aligned human-to-robot demonstrations can effectively train VLA policies, enabling strong performance with limited real-robot data and substantial gains when incorporating large-scale human demonstrations.

Abstract: Vision Language Action (VLA) models derive their generalization capability
from diverse training data, yet collecting embodied robot interaction data
remains prohibitively expensive. In contrast, human demonstration videos are
far more scalable and cost-efficient to collect, and recent studies confirm
their effectiveness in training VLA models. However, a significant domain gap
persists between human videos and robot-executed videos, including unstable
camera viewpoints, visual discrepancies between human hands and robotic arms,
and differences in motion dynamics. To bridge this gap, we propose
MimicDreamer, a framework that turns fast, low-cost human demonstrations into
robot-usable supervision by jointly aligning vision, viewpoint, and actions to
directly support policy training. For visual alignment, we propose H2R Aligner,
a video diffusion model that generates high-fidelity robot demonstration videos
by transferring motion from human manipulation footage. For viewpoint
stabilization, EgoStabilizer is proposed, which canonicalizes egocentric videos
via homography and inpaints occlusions and distortions caused by warping. For
action alignment, we map human hand trajectories to the robot frame and apply a
constrained inverse kinematics solver to produce feasible, low-jitter joint
commands with accurate pose tracking. Empirically, VLA models trained purely on
our synthesized human-to-robot videos achieve few-shot execution on real
robots. Moreover, scaling training with human data significantly boosts
performance compared to models trained solely on real robot data; our approach
improves the average success rate by 14.7\% across six representative
manipulation tasks.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A hierarchical, zero-shot robotic imitation framework (Super-Mimic) that parses human demonstration videos into language-grounded subtasks and uses a future dynamics predictor to generate dynamics-aware video rollouts, achieving >20% improvement over zero-shot baselines on long-horizon tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable generalization to long-horizon manipulation tasks in a zero-shot setting, addressing the gap where multimodal foundation models struggle to convert static visual input into executable action sequences.

Method: Two-stage approach: (1) Human Intent Translator (HIT) parses videos to produce a sequence of language-grounded subtasks; (2) Future Dynamics Predictor (FDP) uses these subtasks to synthesize plausible, dynamics-aware video rollouts for each step, capturing object interactions and contact points to guide a low-level controller.

Result: Extensive experiments on long-horizon manipulation tasks show that Super-Mimic significantly outperforms state-of-the-art zero-shot methods by over 20%.

Conclusion: Coupling video-driven intent parsing with prospective dynamics modeling is an effective strategy for building general-purpose robotic systems.

Abstract: Generalizing to long-horizon manipulation tasks in a zero-shot setting
remains a central challenge in robotics. Current multimodal foundation based
approaches, despite their capabilities, typically fail to decompose high-level
commands into executable action sequences from static visual input alone. To
address this challenge, we introduce Super-Mimic, a hierarchical framework that
enables zero-shot robotic imitation by directly inferring procedural intent
from unscripted human demonstration videos. Our framework is composed of two
sequential modules. First, a Human Intent Translator (HIT) parses the input
video using multimodal reasoning to produce a sequence of language-grounded
subtasks. These subtasks then condition a Future Dynamics Predictor (FDP),
which employs a generative model that synthesizes a physically plausible video
rollout for each step. The resulting visual trajectories are dynamics-aware,
explicitly modeling crucial object interactions and contact points to guide the
low-level controller. We validate this approach through extensive experiments
on a suite of long-horizon manipulation tasks, where Super-Mimic significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art zero-shot methods by over 20\%. These results
establish that coupling video-driven intent parsing with prospective dynamics
modeling is a highly effective strategy for developing general-purpose robotic
systems.

### [371] [Leveraging Large Language Models for Robot-Assisted Learning of Morphological Structures in Preschool Children with Language Vulnerabilities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22287)
*Stina Sundstedt,Mattias Wingren,Susanne Hägglund,Daniel Ventus*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A Furhat-based robot, guided by a large language model, is being developed to play the word game Alias with preschoolers to improve expressive morphology, aiming to outperform human tutors and scale across languages; the long-term goal is a robust LLM-based Robot-Assisted Language Learning system.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need for scalable, precise, and engaging instruction in morphology for language-vulnerable preschoolers. Implicit-learning approaches demand real-time production of morphologically correct forms, which is cognitively demanding for educators/parents. A social robot powered by LLMs could manage gameplay, dialogue, and turn-taking, provide targeted morpho-syntactic targets, and act as a model tutor for both children and professionals, potentially addressing basic communication needs across languages.

Method: The TalBot project integrates the Furhat conversational robot with a large language model to manage the word-retrieval game 'Alias' with children, handling gameplay, dialogue, affect, and turn-taking. The next step is to leverage LLM capabilities to generate and deliver specific morphological targets during the game, with the hypothesis that the robot could outperform humans in this targeting task. The work emphasizes a multiprofessional team and aims to generalize across languages.

Result: No empirical results are reported yet; the paper outlines a conceptual framework and prototype demonstrating feasibility and potential advantages of LLM-driven robot-delivered morphological targets in play-based language learning; evaluation and data are forthcoming.

Conclusion: The long-term objective is a robust LLM-based Robot-Assisted Language Learning (RALL) intervention capable of teaching a variety of morphological structures across languages. The robot could serve as a scalable model and tutor for children and professionals, and LLM capabilities may support basic communication needs for children with language vulnerabilities.

Abstract: Preschool children with language vulnerabilities -- such as developmental
language disorders or immigration related language challenges -- often require
support to strengthen their expressive language skills. Based on the principle
of implicit learning, speech-language therapists (SLTs) typically embed target
morphological structures (e.g., third person -s) into everyday interactions or
game-based learning activities. Educators are recommended by SLTs to do the
same. This approach demands precise linguistic knowledge and real-time
production of various morphological forms (e.g., "Daddy wears these when he
drives to work"). The task becomes even more demanding when educators or parent
also must keep children engaged and manage turn-taking in a game-based
activity. In the TalBot project our multiprofessional team have developed an
application in which the Furhat conversational robot plays the word retrieval
game "Alias" with children to improve language skills. Our application
currently employs a large language model (LLM) to manage gameplay, dialogue,
affective responses, and turn-taking. Our next step is to further leverage the
capacity of LLMs so the robot can generate and deliver specific morphological
targets during the game. We hypothesize that a robot could outperform humans at
this task. Novel aspects of this approach are that the robot could ultimately
serve as a model and tutor for both children and professionals and that using
LLM capabilities in this context would support basic communication needs for
children with language vulnerabilities. Our long-term goal is to create a
robust LLM-based Robot-Assisted Language Learning intervention capable of
teaching a variety of morphological structures across different languages.

### [372] [IMU-Preintegrated Radar Factors for Asynchronous Radar-LiDAR-Inertial SLAM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22288)
*Johan Hatleskog,Morten Nissov,Kostas Alexis*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: IMU-preintegration aligns radar measurements to LiDAR timestamps using high-rate IMU data, reducing the node creation rate to the LiDAR frequency and cutting optimization cost by up to 56% while preserving pose accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Radar-LiDAR-inertial smoothers need many nodes due to lack of time synchronization between sensors; doubling node count at equal rates causes high computational burden that hampers real-time performance on resource-constrained hardware.

Method: Introduce IMU-preintegrated radar factors that propagate the most recent LiDAR state to the radar timestamp using high-rate inertial data. This keeps node creation at the LiDAR rate, reduces node count by ~50% when sensor rates are equal, and lowers computational load. Validation on a single-board computer demonstrates maintained absolute pose error with up to 56% faster optimization.

Result: The approach preserves the absolute pose error of the conventional baseline while reducing the aggregated factor graph optimization time by up to 56% on a 4-core A73/A53-based SBC with 8 GB RAM.

Conclusion: IMU-preintegrated radar factors enable real-time capable radar-LiDAR-inertial smoothers on resource-constrained hardware by keeping node creation at LiDAR rate without sacrificing accuracy, yielding substantial optimization-time reductions.

Abstract: Fixed-lag Radar-LiDAR-Inertial smoothers conventionally create one factor
graph node per measurement to compensate for the lack of time synchronization
between radar and LiDAR. For a radar-LiDAR sensor pair with equal rates, this
strategy results in a state creation rate of twice the individual sensor
frequencies. This doubling of the number of states per second yields high
optimization costs, inhibiting real-time performance on resource-constrained
hardware. We introduce IMU-preintegrated radar factors that use high-rate
inertial data to propagate the most recent LiDAR state to the radar measurement
timestamp. This strategy maintains the node creation rate at the LiDAR
measurement frequency. Assuming equal sensor rates, this lowers the number of
nodes by 50 % and consequently the computational costs. Experiments on a single
board computer (which has 4 cores each of 2.2 GHz A73 and 2 GHz A53 with 8 GB
RAM) show that our method preserves the absolute pose error of a conventional
baseline while simultaneously lowering the aggregated factor graph optimization
time by up to 56 %.

TL;DR: IoRT-based proactive bed-exit system using privacy-preserving thermal sensing and two robots to anticipate needs and prevent falls; pilot study shows the approach can reduce risk and deliver timely assistance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hospital patient falls are costly; traditional post-fall or reactive systems have high false positives and fail to address underlying reasons for bed exits. There's a need for proactive, personalized, and coordinated human-robot-robot care.

Method: Proposed modular IoRT framework for distributed sensing, intent prediction from low-res thermal data, and two coordinated robots responding to predicted intent and patient input; privacy-preserving real-time bed-exit prediction; pilot study and error analysis.

Result: Demonstrates low-resolution thermal sensing for preemptive bed-exit detection; user study and systematic error analysis provide insights for aware, multi-agent interactions; shows feasibility and design implications.

Conclusion: Interactive, connected robotic systems can move from passive monitoring to timely, meaningful assistance, enabling safer and more responsive hospital care.

Abstract: Hospital patient falls remain a critical and costly challenge worldwide.
While conventional fall prevention systems typically rely on post-fall
detection or reactive alerts, they also often suffer from high false positive
rates and fail to address the underlying patient needs that lead to bed-exit
attempts. This paper presents a novel system architecture that leverages the
Internet of Robotic Things (IoRT) to orchestrate human-robot-robot interaction
for proactive and personalized patient assistance. The system integrates a
privacy-preserving thermal sensing model capable of real-time bed-exit
prediction, with two coordinated robotic agents that respond dynamically based
on predicted intent and patient input. This orchestrated response could not
only reduce fall risk but also attend to the patient's underlying motivations
for movement, such as thirst, discomfort, or the need for assistance, before a
hazardous situation arises. Our contributions with this pilot study are
three-fold: (1) a modular IoRT-based framework enabling distributed sensing,
prediction, and multi-robot coordination; (2) a demonstration of low-resolution
thermal sensing for accurate, privacy-preserving preemptive bed-exit detection;
and (3) results from a user study and systematic error analysis that inform the
design of situationally aware, multi-agent interactions in hospital settings.
The findings highlight how interactive and connected robotic systems can move
beyond passive monitoring to deliver timely, meaningful assistance, empowering
safer, more responsive care environments.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Introduces RoboView-Bias, a benchmark to quantify visual bias in robotic manipulation; constructs 2,127 task instances; finds pervasive biases from viewpoint and color; shows semantic grounding layer reduces bias by ~54.5% on MOKA.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmarks emphasize generalization and robustness to perturbations but do not systematically quantify visual bias, hindering understanding of how perception affects decision-making stability in embodied agents.

Method: A structured variant-generation framework to isolate visual factors and a perceptual-fairness validation protocol, yielding 2,127 task instances. Evaluates three representative embodied agents across two paradigms to measure biases and their interactions.

Result: All agents exhibit significant visual biases; camera viewpoint is the most critical factor; agents perform best on highly saturated colors, suggesting inherited visual preferences from underlying VLMs; visual biases show strong, asymmetric coupling with viewpoint amplifying color-related bias.

Conclusion: Systematic analysis of visual bias is a prerequisite for safe and reliable general-purpose embodied agents; the benchmark enables measurement and mitigation of biases, with a semantic grounding layer reducing bias by ~54.5% on MOKA.

Abstract: The safety and reliability of embodied agents rely on accurate and unbiased
visual perception. However, existing benchmarks mainly emphasize generalization
and robustness under perturbations, while systematic quantification of visual
bias remains scarce. This gap limits a deeper understanding of how perception
influences decision-making stability. To address this issue, we propose
RoboView-Bias, the first benchmark specifically designed to systematically
quantify visual bias in robotic manipulation, following a principle of factor
isolation. Leveraging a structured variant-generation framework and a
perceptual-fairness validation protocol, we create 2,127 task instances that
enable robust measurement of biases induced by individual visual factors and
their interactions. Using this benchmark, we systematically evaluate three
representative embodied agents across two prevailing paradigms and report three
key findings: (i) all agents exhibit significant visual biases, with camera
viewpoint being the most critical factor; (ii) agents achieve their highest
success rates on highly saturated colors, indicating inherited visual
preferences from underlying VLMs; and (iii) visual biases show strong,
asymmetric coupling, with viewpoint strongly amplifying color-related bias.
Finally, we demonstrate that a mitigation strategy based on a semantic
grounding layer substantially reduces visual bias by approximately 54.5\% on
MOKA. Our results highlight that systematic analysis of visual bias is a
prerequisite for developing safe and reliable general-purpose embodied agents.

*Leonel Giacobbe,Jingdao Chen,Chuangchuang Sun*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A learning-based, tactile-reactive multi-agent MPC for grasping diverse soft and rigid objects using two GelSight Mini sensors; achieves higher success and stability than PD or MPC baselines in real-time collaborative grasping tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current grasping approaches are tuned for rigid items and often rely on single-agent, non-tactile control, which struggles with fragile or deformable objects and large/heavy items. There is a need for real-time tactile feedback and collaborative multi-agent control to extend grasping capabilities.

Method: Proposes a multi-agent Model Predictive Control (MPC) framework trained on real contact interactions, using tactile data from two GelSight sensors to infer contact dynamics and object compliance. The system operates in closed loop with tactile-encoded state estimation and a coordination strategy for cooperative control to adapt force and position for diverse geometries and stiffness profiles.

Result: The approach outperforms independent PD and MPC baselines in success rates for achieving and maintaining stable grasps across objects with varying sizes and stiffness, demonstrating robust performance in real-time collaborative grasping.

Conclusion: Integrating tactile sensing with a learning-based multi-agent MPC enables robust, intelligent collaborative grasping across a wide range of objects, advancing the capabilities of multi-agent robotic systems.

Abstract: Grasping is a core task in robotics with various applications. However, most
current implementations are primarily designed for rigid items, and their
performance drops considerably when handling fragile or deformable materials
that require real-time feedback. Meanwhile, tactile-reactive grasping focuses
on a single agent, which limits their ability to grasp and manipulate large,
heavy objects. To overcome this, we propose a learning-based, tactile-reactive
multi-agent Model Predictive Controller (MPC) for grasping a wide range of
objects with different softness and shapes, beyond the capabilities of
preexisting single-agent implementations. Our system uses two Gelsight Mini
tactile sensors [1] to extract real-time information on object texture and
stiffness. This rich tactile feedback is used to estimate contact dynamics and
object compliance in real time, enabling the system to adapt its control policy
to diverse object geometries and stiffness profiles. The learned controller
operates in a closed loop, leveraging tactile encoding to predict grasp
stability and adjust force and position accordingly. Our key technical
contributions include a multi-agent MPC formulation trained on real contact
interactions, a tactile-data driven method for inferring grasping states, and a
coordination strategy that enables collaborative control. By combining tactile
sensing and a learning-based multi-agent MPC, our method offers a robust,
intelligent solution for collaborative grasping in complex environments,
significantly advancing the capabilities of multi-agent systems. Our approach
is validated through extensive experiments against independent PD and MPC
baselines. Our pipeline outperforms the baselines regarding success rates in
achieving and maintaining stable grasps across objects of varying sizes and
stiffness.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: OntoBOT unifies task, action, environment, and capability representations by extending SOMA and DOLCE, enabling context-aware reasoning and knowledge sharing across four embodied service robots, addressing interoperability and platform dependence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current service-robot systems are tightly coupled to specific platforms and lack interoperable, reusable representations of tasks, environments, and robot capabilities. Ontology-based knowledge sharing is needed to support formal reasoning and system integration in real-world deployments.

Method: Extend existing ontologies (SOMA, DOLCE) to create OntoBOT, a unified model of tasks, actions, environments, and robot capabilities. Evaluate competency questions across four embodied agents (TIAGo, HSR, UR3, Stretch) to demonstrate context-aware reasoning, task-oriented execution, and knowledge sharing.

Result: OntoBOT provides a cohesive representation linking tasks, actions, environments, and robot capabilities, enabling formal reasoning about task execution and facilitating knowledge sharing. Demonstrates generalizability across four agents, supporting context-aware and task-driven execution.

Conclusion: OntoBOT extends established ontologies to bridge environment, action, and capability representations, enabling interoperable, formal reasoning and knowledge sharing in service robotics across multiple platforms.

Abstract: Personal service robots are increasingly used in domestic settings to assist
older adults and people requiring support. Effective operation involves not
only physical interaction but also the ability to interpret dynamic
environments, understand tasks, and choose appropriate actions based on
context. This requires integrating both hardware components (e.g. sensors,
actuators) and software systems capable of reasoning about tasks, environments,
and robot capabilities. Frameworks such as the Robot Operating System (ROS)
provide open-source tools that help connect low-level hardware with
higher-level functionalities. However, real-world deployments remain tightly
coupled to specific platforms. As a result, solutions are often isolated and
hard-coded, limiting interoperability, reusability, and knowledge sharing.
Ontologies and knowledge graphs offer a structured way to represent tasks,
environments, and robot capabilities. Existing ontologies, such as the
Socio-physical Model of Activities (SOMA) and the Descriptive Ontology for
Linguistic and Cognitive Engineering (DOLCE), provide models for activities,
spatial relationships, and reasoning structures. However, they often focus on
specific domains and do not fully capture the connection between environment,
action, robot capabilities, and system-level integration. In this work, we
propose the Ontology for roBOts and acTions (OntoBOT), which extends existing
ontologies to provide a unified representation of tasks, actions, environments,
and capabilities. Our contributions are twofold: (1) we unify these aspects
into a cohesive ontology to support formal reasoning about task execution, and
(2) we demonstrate its generalizability by evaluating competency questions
across four embodied agents - TIAGo, HSR, UR3, and Stretch - showing how
OntoBOT enables context-aware reasoning, task-oriented execution, and knowledge
sharing in service robotics.

TL;DR: UnderwaterVLA proposes a dual-brain, Vision-Language-Action framework with hydrodynamics-informed MPC to enable robust autonomous underwater navigation in turbid/widely varying conditions, achieving 19-27% higher task completion and reduced navigation errors in field tests.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Underwater operations suffer from hydrodynamic disturbances, limited communication bandwidth, and degraded sensing in turbid waters, necessitating robust, adaptable autonomy with less reliance on underwater-specific training.

Method: Three innovations: (1) dual-brain architecture separating high-level mission reasoning from low-level reactive control; (2) Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models for underwater robotics with structured chain-of-thought reasoning for interpretable decisions; (3) hydrodynamics-informed Model Predictive Control (MPC) that compensates for fluid effects in real time without task-specific training.

Result: Field tests show reduced navigation errors in degraded visual conditions and higher task completion by 19% to 27% over baseline.

Conclusion: The approach reduces reliance on underwater-specific training data, enhances adaptability across environments, and offers a scalable, cost-effective path toward next-generation intelligent AUVs.

Abstract: This paper presents UnderwaterVLA, a novel framework for autonomous
underwater navigation that integrates multimodal foundation models with
embodied intelligence systems. Underwater operations remain difficult due to
hydrodynamic disturbances, limited communication bandwidth, and degraded
sensing in turbid waters. To address these challenges, we introduce three
innovations. First, a dual-brain architecture decouples high-level mission
reasoning from low-level reactive control, enabling robust operation under
communication and computational constraints. Second, we apply
Vision-Language-Action(VLA) models to underwater robotics for the first time,
incorporating structured chain-of-thought reasoning for interpretable
decision-making. Third, a hydrodynamics-informed Model Predictive Control(MPC)
scheme compensates for fluid effects in real time without costly task-specific
training. Experimental results in field tests show that UnderwaterVLA reduces
navigation errors in degraded visual conditions while maintaining higher task
completion by 19% to 27% over baseline. By minimizing reliance on
underwater-specific training data and improving adaptability across
environments, UnderwaterVLA provides a scalable and cost-effective path toward
the next generation of intelligent AUVs.

TL;DR: A market-based, decentralized task allocation method for heterogeneous robot teams under uncertain task requirements, using probabilistic capability models to align complementary skills with uncertain tasks, achieving polynomial-time solutions and improved robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In dynamic environments with heterogeneous robots, task requirements are uncertain and interdependent rewards complicate allocation; efficient strategies are needed to minimize failures and resource waste.

Method: Model task requirements as probability distributions over capabilities. Use a market-based mechanism to allocate tasks by optimizing a joint team objective, explicitly capturing coupled rewards between robots in a decentralized setting with strict communication assumptions, yielding a polynomial-time solution.

Result: Comparative experiments against benchmark algorithms show the approach is effective in mitigating failures and improving resource use; however, incorporating coupled rewards remains challenging in decentralized formulations.

Conclusion: The proposed market-based allocation aligns robots with uncertain tasks by exploiting complementary skills, reducing failures and resource waste; the work also identifies existing challenges in handling coupled rewards in decentralized systems and suggests directions for future improvement.

Abstract: This paper proposes a task allocation algorithm for teams of heterogeneous
robots in environments with uncertain task requirements. We model these
requirements as probability distributions over capabilities and use this model
to allocate tasks such that robots with complementary skills naturally position
near uncertain tasks, proactively mitigating task failures without wasting
resources. We introduce a market-based approach that optimizes the joint team
objective while explicitly capturing coupled rewards between robots, offering a
polynomial-time solution in decentralized settings with strict communication
assumptions. Comparative experiments against benchmark algorithms demonstrate
the effectiveness of our approach and highlight the challenges of incorporating

Method: Develop an ontological model to capture differences between plans; analyze limitations of baseline ontology-based narration; propose a novel algorithm that leverages divergent knowledge to build contrastive narratives; evaluate empirically.

Result: Novel algorithm yields explanations that surpass baseline in quality; improved ability to justify plan choice; explanations are more informative and aligned with human preferences.

Conclusion: Ontology-driven contrastive narration is effective for explainable planning; shows promise for trust and collaboration in HRI; future work may address scalability, user studies, and integration with planning under uncertainty.

Abstract: Mutual understanding of artificial agents' decisions is key to ensuring a
trustworthy and successful human-robot interaction. Hence, robots are expected
to make reasonable decisions and communicate them to humans when needed. In
this article, the focus is on an approach to modeling and reasoning about the
comparison of two competing plans, so that robots can later explain the
divergent result. First, a novel ontological model is proposed to formalize and
reason about the differences between competing plans, enabling the
classification of the most appropriate one (e.g., the shortest, the safest, the
closest to human preferences, etc.). This work also investigates the
limitations of a baseline algorithm for ontology-based explanatory narration.
To address these limitations, a novel algorithm is presented, leveraging
divergent knowledge between plans and facilitating the construction of
contrastive narratives. Through empirical evaluation, it is observed that the
explanations excel beyond the baseline method.

*Katrina Ashton,Chahyon Ku,Shrey Shah,Wen Jiang,Kostas Daniilidis,Bernadette Bucher*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: HELIOS proposes a hierarchical scene representation for language-specified mobile manipulation in novel, partially observed environments, achieving SOTA on OVMM and enabling zero-shot real-world transfer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges include partial observability, grounding semantic language instructions to the scene, and actively updating knowledge as new observations arrive; there is a need for an efficient exploration-exploitation strategy in search.

Method: Build a multi-layer representation: 2D semantic/occupancy maps for navigation and 3D Gaussian representations for task-relevant objects; fuse multi-view observations with explicit multi-view consistency; formulate a search objective balancing exploration of uncertain regions with exploitation of semantic information; evaluate on OVMM in Habitat and demonstrate zero-shot transfer to real-world robot.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results on the OVMM benchmark; demonstrates zero-shot transfer to real-world settings (office) on a Spot robot.

Conclusion: A hierarchical, multi-layer scene representation coupled with an active search objective enables language-guided mobile manipulation in novel, partially observed environments and generalizes to real-world deployment without additional data.

Abstract: Language-specified mobile manipulation tasks in novel environments
simultaneously face challenges interacting with a scene which is only partially
observed, grounding semantic information from language instructions to the
partially observed scene, and actively updating knowledge of the scene with new
observations. To address these challenges, we propose HELIOS, a hierarchical
scene representation and associated search objective to perform language
specified pick and place mobile manipulation tasks. We construct 2D maps
containing the relevant semantic and occupancy information for navigation while
simultaneously actively constructing 3D Gaussian representations of
task-relevant objects. We fuse observations across this multi-layered
representation while explicitly modeling the multi-view consistency of the
detections of each object. In order to efficiently search for the target
object, we formulate an objective function balancing exploration of unobserved
or uncertain regions with exploitation of scene semantic information. We
evaluate HELIOS on the OVMM benchmark in the Habitat simulator, a pick and
place benchmark in which perception is challenging due to large and complex
scenes with comparatively small target objects. HELIOS achieves
state-of-the-art results on OVMM. As our approach is zero-shot, HELIOS can also
transfer to the real world without requiring additional data, as we illustrate
by demonstrating it in a real world office environment on a Spot robot.

### [381] [An Intention-driven Lane Change Framework Considering Heterogeneous Dynamic Cooperation in Mixed-traffic Environment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22550)
*Xiaoyun Qiu,Haichao Liu,Yue Pan,Jun Ma,Xinhu Zheng*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: An intention-driven lane-change framework for mixed-traffic that recognizes driving styles, estimates cooperation, uses behavior cloning and IRL for decision-making, and MPC-guided trajectory planning to produce safe, socially compliant maneuvers, achieving high recognition metrics on NGSIM and outperforming baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In mixed-traffic environments, autonomous vehicles must navigate with diverse human-driven vehicle behaviors and uncertain intents. Existing methods oversimplify interactions, leading to unsafe or inefficient lane changes. There is a need to model inter-driver heterogeneity and cooperation to enable context-aware, human-like decisions.

Method: The framework comprises: (1) a deep learning classifier trained on NGSIM to identify human driving styles in real time; (2) a cooperation score with intrinsic and interactive components to estimate surrounding drivers’ intentions and willingness to cooperate with the ego vehicle; (3) decision-making that combines behavior cloning with inverse reinforcement learning to decide when to initiate a lane change; (4) trajectory generation using model predictive control integrated with IRL-based intention inference to ensure collision-free, socially compliant maneuvers.

Result: The model achieved 94.2% accuracy and 94.3% F1-score on lane change recognition, outperforming rule-based and learning-based baselines by 4–15%. The results demonstrate the value of modeling inter-driver heterogeneity and the framework’s potential to enable context-aware, human-like autonomous driving in complex traffic.

Conclusion: Modeling inter-driver heterogeneity and cooperation can improve lane-change decisions in mixed traffic, enabling context-aware, socially compliant, and safer autonomous driving; the framework offers a path toward more human-like behavior in complex traffic scenarios.

Abstract: In mixed-traffic environments, where autonomous vehicles (AVs) interact with
diverse human-driven vehicles (HVs), unpredictable intentions and heterogeneous
behaviors make safe and efficient lane change maneuvers highly challenging.
Existing methods often oversimplify these interactions by assuming uniform
patterns. We propose an intention-driven lane change framework that integrates
driving-style recognition, cooperation-aware decision-making, and coordinated
motion planning. A deep learning classifier trained on the NGSIM dataset
identifies human driving styles in real time. A cooperation score with
intrinsic and interactive components estimates surrounding drivers' intentions
and quantifies their willingness to cooperate with the ego vehicle.
Decision-making combines behavior cloning with inverse reinforcement learning
to determine whether a lane change should be initiated. For trajectory
generation, model predictive control is integrated with IRL-based intention
inference to produce collision-free and socially compliant maneuvers.
Experiments show that the proposed model achieves 94.2\% accuracy and 94.3\%
F1-score, outperforming rule-based and learning-based baselines by 4-15\% in
lane change recognition. These results highlight the benefit of modeling
inter-driver heterogeneity and demonstrate the potential of the framework to
advance context-aware and human-like autonomous driving in complex traffic
environments.

*Farida Mohsen,Ali Safa*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: RGB-only framework MINT-RVAE for predicting human interaction intent with frame-level precision in HRI; uses synthetic sequence generation to handle class imbalance; achieves AUROC 0.95 and releases a frame-labeled dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need fast, accurate intent detection for robots; most methods rely on RGB-D; real-world data often imbalanced across interactive vs. non-interactive frames; frame-level onset prediction enables faster robot responses.

Method: Introduces MINT-RVAE for synthetic sequence generation to balance training data, along with new loss functions and training strategies; operates on RGB input with frame-level interaction intent prediction; includes a new dataset with frame-level labels.

Result: Achieves AUROC of 0.95, surpassing prior methods in the 0.90–0.912 range; supports precise frame onset prediction using only RGB input.

Conclusion: RGB-only intent recognition with synthetic data generation and tailored training can reach state-of-the-art performance in HRI, reducing sensor requirements and enabling prompt robot responses; dataset released to support future research.

Abstract: Efficiently detecting human intent to interact with ubiquitous robots is
crucial for effective human-robot interaction (HRI) and collaboration. Over the
past decade, deep learning has gained traction in this field, with most
existing approaches relying on multimodal inputs, such as RGB combined with
depth (RGB-D), to classify time-sequence windows of sensory data as interactive
or non-interactive. In contrast, we propose a novel RGB-only pipeline for
predicting human interaction intent with frame-level precision, enabling faster
robot responses and improved service quality. A key challenge in intent
prediction is the class imbalance inherent in real-world HRI datasets, which
can hinder the model's training and generalization. To address this, we
introduce MINT-RVAE, a synthetic sequence generation method, along with new
loss functions and training strategies that enhance generalization on
out-of-sample data. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance (AUROC:
0.95) outperforming prior works (AUROC: 0.90-0.912), while requiring only RGB
input and supporting precise frame onset prediction. Finally, to support future
research, we openly release our new dataset with frame-level labeling of human
interaction intent.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A self-supervised framework (EgoDemoGen) generates paired novel egocentric demonstrations via retargeted actions and synthesized videos, boosting egocentric viewpoint-robust imitation learning with sizable gains in simulation and on real robots; gains plateau with more EgoDemoGen data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Imitation learning in robotics suffers when policies trained from a single egocentric viewpoint encounter viewpoint shifts; improving robustness requires diverse egocentric data and realistic video demonstrations.

Method: EgoDemoGen creates paired novel demonstrations by retargeting actions into a new egocentric frame and synthesizing the corresponding egocentric videos via EgoViewTransfer; EgoViewTransfer is conditioned on a reprojected view and a robot-only video of the retargeted actions; trained with self-supervised double reprojection; evaluated on RoboTwin2.0 sim and real robot with mixed EgoDemoGen and standard demonstrations.

Result: In simulation, policy success rate improved by +17.0% for standard viewpoint and +17.7% for novel viewpoint. On real robot, improvements are +18.3% and +25.8%. Gains increase with more EgoDemoGen data, but with diminishing returns.

Conclusion: EgoDemoGen offers a practical route to egocentric viewpoint-robust robotic manipulation, enhancing imitation learning robustness across viewpoints.

Abstract: Imitation learning based policies perform well in robotic manipulation, but
they often degrade under *egocentric viewpoint shifts* when trained from a
single egocentric viewpoint. To address this issue, we present **EgoDemoGen**,
a framework that generates *paired* novel egocentric demonstrations by
retargeting actions in the novel egocentric frame and synthesizing the
corresponding egocentric observation videos with proposed generative video
repair model **EgoViewTransfer**, which is conditioned by a novel-viewpoint
reprojected scene video and a robot-only video rendered from the retargeted
joint actions. EgoViewTransfer is finetuned from a pretrained video generation
model using self-supervised double reprojection strategy. We evaluate
EgoDemoGen on both simulation (RoboTwin2.0) and real-world robot. After
training with a mixture of EgoDemoGen-generated novel egocentric demonstrations
and original standard egocentric demonstrations, policy success rate improves
**absolutely** by **+17.0%** for standard egocentric viewpoint and by
**+17.7%** for novel egocentric viewpoints in simulation. On real-world robot,
the **absolute** improvements are **+18.3%** and **+25.8%**. Moreover,
performance continues to improve as the proportion of EgoDemoGen-generated
demonstrations increases, with diminishing returns. These results demonstrate
that EgoDemoGen provides a practical route to egocentric viewpoint-robust
robotic manipulation.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A 14B generative world model (WoW) trained on 2M robot interactions learns a probabilistic physics model and, with SOPHIA-guided refinement and an inverse dynamics module, achieves strong physical reasoning and state-of-the-art on a new WoWBench benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video models rely on passive observation and struggle with causal physics; authentic physical intuition likely requires extensive, causally rich real-world interactions. The paper tests this by training on real robot data and coupling imagination with action.

Method: Train WoW, a 14B generative model, on 2M robot interaction trajectories; find that physics emerges as a distribution of plausible outcomes leading to hallucinations; introduce SOPHIA to evaluate and iteratively refine DiT-generated outputs via language instruction evolution; train a co-conditioned Inverse Dynamics Model to convert refined plans into executable robotic actions; establish WoWBench to assess physical consistency and causal reasoning; evaluate with human and autonomous agents; plan to open-source models, data, and benchmarks.

Result: WoW exhibits physics understanding as a probabilistic distribution with stochastic instabilities and hallucinations; SOPHIA-guided constraints can steer outputs toward physical realism; WoWBench yields state-of-the-art performance in physical causality, collision dynamics, and object permanence; findings support the claim that large-scale real-world interaction is essential for physical intuition.

Conclusion: The work provides systematic evidence that authentic physical intuition requires real-world interaction and an imagination-to-action loop; introduces a benchmark (WoWBench) and a framework (WoW + SOPHIA + Inverse Dynamics) for grounding abstract physics in causally rich data; authors plan to open-source.

Abstract: Humans develop an understanding of intuitive physics through active
interaction with the world. This approach is in stark contrast to current video
models, such as Sora, which rely on passive observation and therefore struggle
with grasping physical causality. This observation leads to our central
hypothesis: authentic physical intuition of the world model must be grounded in
extensive, causally rich interactions with the real world. To test this
hypothesis, we present WoW, a 14-billion-parameter generative world model
trained on 2 million robot interaction trajectories. Our findings reveal that
the model's understanding of physics is a probabilistic distribution of
plausible outcomes, leading to stochastic instabilities and physical
hallucinations. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this emergent capability can
be actively constrained toward physical realism by SOPHIA, where
vision-language model agents evaluate the DiT-generated output and guide its
refinement by iteratively evolving the language instructions. In addition, a
co-trained Inverse Dynamics Model translates these refined plans into
executable robotic actions, thus closing the imagination-to-action loop. We
establish WoWBench, a new benchmark focused on physical consistency and causal
reasoning in video, where WoW achieves state-of-the-art performance in both
human and autonomous evaluation, demonstrating strong ability in physical
causality, collision dynamics, and object permanence. Our work provides
systematic evidence that large-scale, real-world interaction is a cornerstone
for developing physical intuition in AI. Models, data, and benchmarks will be
open-sourced.

*Wenkai Guo,Guanxing Lu,Haoyuan Deng,Zhenyu Wu,Yansong Tang,Ziwei Wang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A plug-in framework that endows Vision-Language-Action models with long-horizon planning via world-model rollouts and MCTS, improving robotic manipulation without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLAs perform well on short-horizon actions but struggle with long-horizon tasks due to compounding errors; scalable, test-time planning is needed to foresee outcomes and correct deviations.

Method: Sample and roll out possible action trajectories using a world model; seed rollouts with stepwise VLA predictions; apply Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to explore action sequences; use Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) for confidence-based exploration to reduce VLA queries; evaluate intermediate states with offline reward shaping to guide long-term planning and correct deviations.

Result: Significant improvements over state-of-the-art VLAs observed in both simulators and real-world robotic manipulation tasks, validating the effectiveness of the VLA-Reasoner framework.

Conclusion: VLA-Reasoner demonstrates a viable pathway to scalable test-time computation for robotic manipulation by augmenting VLAs with planning capabilities that foresee future states and optimize long-horizon actions.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs) achieve strong performance in general
robotic manipulation tasks by scaling imitation learning. However, existing
VLAs are limited to predicting short-sighted next-action, which struggle with
long-horizon trajectory tasks due to incremental deviations. To address this
problem, we propose a plug-in framework named VLA-Reasoner that effectively
empowers off-the-shelf VLAs with the capability of foreseeing future states via
test-time scaling. Specifically, VLA-Reasoner samples and rolls out possible
action trajectories where involved actions are rationales to generate future
states via a world model, which enables VLA-Reasoner to foresee and reason
potential outcomes and search for the optimal actions. We further leverage
Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to improve search efficiency in large action
spaces, where stepwise VLA predictions seed the root. Meanwhile, we introduce a
confidence sampling mechanism based on Kernel Density Estimation (KDE), to
enable efficient exploration in MCTS without redundant VLA queries. We evaluate
intermediate states in MCTS via an offline reward shaping strategy, to score
predicted futures and correct deviations with long-term feedback. We conducted
extensive experiments in both simulators and the real world, demonstrating that
our proposed VLA-Reasoner achieves significant improvements over the
state-of-the-art VLAs. Our method highlights a potential pathway toward
scalable test-time computation of robotic manipulation.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: DAWN is a diffusion-based, end-to-end framework for language-conditioned robotic manipulation that uses diffusion-based motion abstractions (structured pixel motion) to connect high-level intent with low-level actions, achieving state-of-the-art results on CALVIN and demonstrating transfer to real-world settings with minimal finetuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation:  bridge the gap between high-level motion intent and low-level robot actions, provide interpretable intermediate motion representations, and enable scalable, robust robot learning across sim-to-real domains.

Method: Model both high-level and low-level controllers as diffusion processes, using a structured pixel-motion representation as the intermediate abstraction; train the system end-to-end for language-conditioned manipulation; validate on CALVIN and MetaWorld and demonstrate real-world transfer with minimal finetuning.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on CALVIN with strong multi-task capabilities; validated on MetaWorld; demonstrates reliable sim-to-real transfer with limited real-world data and minimal finetuning.

Conclusion: Diffusion-based motion abstractions combined with motion-centric representations offer a strong, scalable baseline for robust language-conditioned robot learning and practical real-world deployment.

Abstract: We present DAWN (Diffusion is All We Need for robot control), a unified
diffusion-based framework for language-conditioned robotic manipulation that
bridges high-level motion intent and low-level robot action via structured
pixel motion representation. In DAWN, both the high-level and low-level
controllers are modeled as diffusion processes, yielding a fully trainable,
end-to-end system with interpretable intermediate motion abstractions. DAWN
achieves state-of-the-art results on the challenging CALVIN benchmark,
demonstrating strong multi-task performance, and further validates its
effectiveness on MetaWorld. Despite the substantial domain gap between
simulation and reality and limited real-world data, we demonstrate reliable
real-world transfer with only minimal finetuning, illustrating the practical
viability of diffusion-based motion abstractions for robotic control. Our
results show the effectiveness of combining diffusion modeling with
motion-centric representations as a strong baseline for scalable and robust

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A training-free AVLN framework (SPF) uses 2D spatial grounding with vision-language models to iteratively annotate 2D waypoints from free-form instructions, converting them to 3D actions for closed-loop UAV navigation with strong simulation and real-world performance and broad generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLM-based AVLN approaches often treat action prediction as text generation, which is inefficient and brittle for dynamic environments. SPF aims to leverage 2D grounding to produce actionable waypoints, enabling training-free, robust navigation across diverse environments and instructions.

Method: SPF decomposes vague instructions into iterative 2D waypoint annotations on the input image using vision-language models. These waypoints and predicted travel distance are converted into 3D displacement vectors as UAV actions. The method adaptively adjusts travel distance, operates in closed-loop control to track dynamic targets, and demonstrates broad generalization across different VLMs in DRL simulations and real-world tests.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on a DRL simulation benchmark with an absolute margin of 63% over the previous best. In real-world evaluations, SPF outperforms strong baselines by a large margin. Comprehensive ablations support design choices and show generalization to different VLMs.

Conclusion: SPF provides a training-free, generalizable AVLN framework that effectively translates free-form language into actionable 3D commands via iterative 2D grounding, enabling robust UAV navigation across varied environments and instructions with strong empirical validation.

Abstract: We present See, Point, Fly (SPF), a training-free aerial vision-and-language
navigation (AVLN) framework built atop vision-language models (VLMs). SPF is
capable of navigating to any goal based on any type of free-form instructions
in any kind of environment. In contrast to existing VLM-based approaches that
treat action prediction as a text generation task, our key insight is to
consider action prediction for AVLN as a 2D spatial grounding task. SPF
harnesses VLMs to decompose vague language instructions into iterative
annotation of 2D waypoints on the input image. Along with the predicted
traveling distance, SPF transforms predicted 2D waypoints into 3D displacement
vectors as action commands for UAVs. Moreover, SPF also adaptively adjusts the
traveling distance to facilitate more efficient navigation. Notably, SPF
performs navigation in a closed-loop control manner, enabling UAVs to follow
dynamic targets in dynamic environments. SPF sets a new state of the art in DRL
simulation benchmark, outperforming the previous best method by an absolute
margin of 63%. In extensive real-world evaluations, SPF outperforms strong
baselines by a large margin. We also conduct comprehensive ablation studies to
highlight the effectiveness of our design choice. Lastly, SPF shows remarkable
generalization to different VLMs. Project page: https://spf-web.pages.dev

### [388] [Towards mitigating information leakage when evaluating safety monitors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21344)
*Gerard Boxo,Aman Neelappa,Shivam Raval*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Framework to evaluate white-box monitors for deception in LLMs; introduces content filtering, score filtering, and prompt-distilled model organisms to mitigate leakage; findings show content filtering most effective, score filtering moderate, model organisms can harm performance; overall trade-offs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To obtain a reliable assessment of model monitors that detect harmful behaviors without leakage from elicitation prompts or revealed reasoning, ensuring performance reflects genuine model behavior.

Method: Provide a systematic evaluation framework with three mitigation strategies: content filtering (removing deception-related text from inputs), score filtering (aggregating only over task-relevant tokens), and prompt distilled fine-tuned model organisms (models trained to exhibit deceptive behavior without explicit prompting); identify and measure two leakage forms (elicitation and reasoning) across multiple deception benchmarks; quantify impact on monitor performance (AUROC).

Result: Content filtering reduces probe AUROC by about 30%; score filtering reduces AUROC by about 15%; prompt-distilled model organisms can improve evaluation but may reduce monitor performance by up to 40% even after re-training.

Conclusion: Mitigation via content filtering provides the strongest removal of elicitation signal while preserving evaluation integrity; score filtering offers a smaller, less interpretable gain; model organisms offer more realistic evaluation at the cost of reduced monitor effectiveness; overall, a combination of strategies is advisable to obtain robust monitor assessments and understand trade-offs.

Abstract: White box monitors that analyze model internals offer promising advantages
for detecting potentially harmful behaviors in large language models, including
lower computational costs and integration into layered defense systems.However,
training and evaluating these monitors requires response exemplars that exhibit
the target behaviors, typically elicited through prompting or fine-tuning. This
presents a challenge when the information used to elicit behaviors inevitably
leaks into the data that monitors ingest, inflating their effectiveness. We
present a systematic framework for evaluating a monitor's performance in terms
of its ability to detect genuine model behavior rather than superficial
elicitation artifacts. Furthermore, we propose three novel strategies to
evaluate the monitor: content filtering (removing deception-related text from
inputs), score filtering (aggregating only over task-relevant tokens), and
prompt distilled fine-tuned model organisms (models trained to exhibit
deceptive behavior without explicit prompting). Using deception detection as a
representative case study, we identify two forms of leakage that inflate
monitor performance: elicitation leakage from prompts that explicitly request
harmful behavior, and reasoning leakage from models that verbalize their
deceptive actions. Through experiments on multiple deception benchmarks, we
apply our proposed mitigation strategies and measure performance retention. Our
evaluation of the monitors reveal three crucial findings: (1) Content filtering
is a good mitigation strategy that allows for a smooth removal of elicitation
signal and can decrease probe AUROC by 30\% (2) Score filtering was found to
reduce AUROC by 15\% but is not as straightforward to attribute to (3) A
finetuned model organism improves monitor evaluations but reduces their
performance by upto 40\%, even when re-trained.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes decision pivots as minimal, verifiable checkpoints in chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning. It mines shared pivots from diverse reasoning paths, compresses traces into pivot-focused short-paths using an auxiliary verifier, and self-trains the model on its outputs, enabling reasoning alignment without ground-truth reasoning data or external metrics. Evaluated on LogiQA, MedQA, and MATH500 with positive results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of verifying chain-of-thought traces at scale. CoT reasoning is informative but hard to audit; the authors seek verifiable checkpoints (decision pivots) that all correct reasoning paths share, enabling scalable self-training without annotated reasoning data.

Method: 1) Sample diverse reasoning paths and mine shared decision pivots. 2) Compress traces into pivot-focused short-path reasoning using an auxiliary verifier. 3) Post-train the model on self-generated outputs, aligning reasoning with the pivots.

Result: The method is reported to be effective on standard benchmarks LogiQA, MedQA, and MATH500, demonstrating improved alignment and verifiability without ground-truth reasoning data or external metrics.

Conclusion: Decision pivots offer a minimal, verifiable backbone for reasoning. A self-training pipeline exploiting these pivots can align LLM reasoning without relying on ground-truth reasoning data, achieving competitive results on multiple benchmarks.

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning exposes the intermediate thinking process of
large language models (LLMs), yet verifying those traces at scale remains
unsolved. In response, we introduce the idea of decision pivots-minimal,
verifiable checkpoints that any correct reasoning path must visit. We
hypothesize that correct reasoning, though stylistically diverse, converge on
the same pivot set, while incorrect ones violate at least one pivot. Leveraging
this property, we propose a self-training pipeline that (i) samples diverse
reasoning paths and mines shared decision pivots, (ii) compresses each trace
into pivot-focused short-path reasoning using an auxiliary verifier, and (iii)
post-trains the model using its self-generated outputs. The proposed method
aligns reasoning without ground truth reasoning data or external metrics.
Experiments on standard benchmarks such as LogiQA, MedQA, and MATH500 show the
effectiveness of our method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Climate data science is hindered by fragmented, heterogeneous data sources and the steep technical expertise required to locate, access, and process datasets, which limits participation and reproducibility. A unifying KG paired with AI agents promises a lower threshold for engagement and a shared, extensible commons.

Method: We present a proof-of-concept system that integrates a curated knowledge graph with AI agents designed for cloud-native scientific workflows. The KG organizes datasets, tools, and workflows and supports natural language interaction and automated data access; AI agents (powered by generative AI services) enable NL queries, data retrieval, and streamlined analysis. The design leverages existing cloud-ready API data portals and emphasizes open-source development to invite community contributions, with end-to-end demonstrations showing non-specialists identifying relevant datasets and executing analyses.

Result: The approach lowers the technical barrier, enabling non-specialists to identify and analyze relevant climate datasets and to run scalable, agentic workflows that are reproducible and extensible. The KG acts as a unifying layer aligning datasets, tools, and workflows, and the open-source design supports community-driven evolution of the shared commons.

Conclusion: This work demonstrates a pathway to democratize access to climate data and to establish a reproducible, extensible framework for human–AI collaboration in scientific research, with the KG serving as a foundational shared commons that can evolve through community contributions.

Abstract: Climate data science faces persistent barriers stemming from the fragmented
nature of data sources, heterogeneous formats, and the steep technical
expertise required to identify, acquire, and process datasets. These challenges
limit participation, slow discovery, and reduce the reproducibility of
scientific workflows. In this paper, we present a proof of concept for
addressing these barriers through the integration of a curated knowledge graph
(KG) with AI agents designed for cloud-native scientific workflows. The KG
provides a unifying layer that organizes datasets, tools, and workflows, while
AI agents -- powered by generative AI services -- enable natural language
interaction, automated data access, and streamlined analysis. Together, these
components drastically lower the technical threshold for engaging in climate
data science, enabling non-specialist users to identify and analyze relevant
datasets. By leveraging existing cloud-ready API data portals, we demonstrate
that "a knowledge graph is all you need" to unlock scalable and agentic
workflows for scientific inquiry. The open-source design of our system further
supports community contributions, ensuring that the KG and associated tools can

### [391] [EEG-Based Consumer Behaviour Prediction: An Exploration from Classical Machine Learning to Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21567)
*Mohammad Parsa Afshar,Aryan Azimi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: EEG-based neuromarketing using Graph Neural Networks offers modest gains over classical models, with GNNs outperforming on some basic metrics, and the study provides a broad comparison across ML models including SVM and non-traditional GNNs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To predict consumer behavior from EEG signals and to evaluate whether Graph Neural Networks can outperform traditional ML models in EEG-based neuromarketing, thereby deepening understanding of the brain-behavior link in decision making.

Method: Preprocess NeuMa EEG data, extract and clean features; construct brain connectivity features for graph-based models; train and compare multiple models, including SVM, ensemble methods, and various Graph Neural Network architectures; evaluate across standard performance metrics.

Result: GNNs generally perform better on some basic criteria where classical models were unsatisfactory, but there is no significant difference overall; classical models remain competitive in certain aspects.

Conclusion: Combining EEG analysis with diverse ML models is a promising approach for neuromarketing; GNNs are viable alternatives to classical methods, and the study offers a comprehensive model comparison, including less-used Graph Neural Networks in this field.

Abstract: Prediction of consumer behavior is one of the important purposes in
marketing, cognitive neuroscience, and human-computer interaction. The
electroencephalography (EEG) data can help analyze the decision process by
providing detailed information about the brain's neural activity. In this
research, a comparative approach is utilized for predicting consumer behavior
by EEG data. In the first step, the features of the EEG data from the NeuMa
dataset were extracted and cleaned. For the Graph Neural Network (GNN) models,
the brain connectivity features were created. Different machine learning
models, such as classical models and Graph Neural Networks, are used and
compared. The GNN models with different architectures are implemented to have a
comprehensive comparison; furthermore, a wide range of classical models, such
as ensemble models, are applied, which can be very helpful to show the
difference and performance of each model on the dataset. Although the results
did not show a significant difference overall, the GNN models generally
performed better in some basic criteria where classical models were not
satisfactory. This study not only shows that combining EEG signal analysis and
machine learning models can provide an approach to deeper understanding of
consumer behavior, but also provides a comprehensive comparison between the
machine learning models that have been widely used in previous studies in the
EEG-based neuromarketing such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), and the models
which are not used or rarely used in the field, like Graph Neural Networks.

### [392] [GeoEvolve: Automating Geospatial Model Discovery via Multi-Agent Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21593)
*Peng Luo,Xiayin Lou,Yu Zheng,Zhuo Zheng,Stefano Ermon*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GeoEvolve is a two-loop, multi-agent LLM framework that integrates evolutionary search with a geospatial knowledge base to automatically design geospatial algorithms, yielding improvements in kriging and spatial uncertainty quantification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Geospatial problems demand domain knowledge and multi-step reasoning that current LLM-based discovery approaches (e.g., AlphaEvolve) lack, hindering performance and trust in automated algorithm design.

Method: GeoEvolve uses two nested loops: an inner code evolver mutates and generates candidate geospatial algorithms; an outer agent controller selects global elites and queries a GeoKnowRAG module (a structured geospatial knowledge base) to inject theoretical priors from geography. Domain-guided retrieval steers evolution toward theoretically meaningful and computationally efficient algorithms. The framework is evaluated on spatial interpolation (kriging) and spatial uncertainty quantification (geospatial conformal prediction).

Result: GeoEvolve automatically improves and discovers new geospatial algorithms, achieving a 13–21% reduction in RMSE for spatial interpolation and a 17% improvement in uncertainty estimation performance. Ablation studies show that domain-guided retrieval is essential for stable, high-quality evolution.

Conclusion: The work demonstrates that knowledge-guided, automated evolution can yield more trustworthy and efficient geospatial models, offering a scalable path for AI-for-Science discovery in geospatial modeling.

Abstract: Geospatial modeling provides critical solutions for pressing global
challenges such as sustainability and climate change. Existing large language
model (LLM)-based algorithm discovery frameworks, such as AlphaEvolve, excel at
evolving generic code but lack the domain knowledge and multi-step reasoning
required for complex geospatial problems. We introduce GeoEvolve, a multi-agent
LLM framework that couples evolutionary search with geospatial domain knowledge
to automatically design and refine geospatial algorithms. GeoEvolve operates in
two nested loops: an inner loop leverages a code evolver to generate and mutate
candidate solutions, while an outer agentic controller evaluates global elites
and queries a GeoKnowRAG module -- a structured geospatial knowledge base that
injects theoretical priors from geography. This knowledge-guided evolution
steers the search toward theoretically meaningful and computationally efficient
algorithms. We evaluate GeoEvolve on two fundamental and classical tasks:
spatial interpolation (kriging) and spatial uncertainty quantification
(geospatial conformal prediction). Across these benchmarks, GeoEvolve
automatically improves and discovers new algorithms, incorporating geospatial
theory on top of classical models. It reduces spatial interpolation error
(RMSE) by 13-21% and enhances uncertainty estimation performance by 17\%.
Ablation studies confirm that domain-guided retrieval is essential for stable,
high-quality evolution. These results demonstrate that GeoEvolve provides a
scalable path toward automated, knowledge-driven geospatial modeling, opening
new opportunities for trustworthy and efficient AI-for-Science discovery.

*Mafalda Malafaia,Peter A. N. Bosman,Coen Rasch,Tanja Alderliesten*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Interpretable multimodal survival analysis using MultiFIX, combining CT imaging and clinical data with Grad-CAM and genetic programming, achieving strong C-indices on RADCURE head/neck cancer data and enabling transparent risk stratification via Cox regression.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the need for accurate survival prediction in oncology that is both multimodal and transparent, to support validation and clinical trust.

Method: MultiFIX framework: deep learning extracts survival-relevant features from CT imaging; Grad-CAM provides imaging explanations; clinical variables are encoded as symbolic expressions via genetic programming; transparent Cox regression computes risk scores and stratifies patients into survival groups.

Result: On RADCURE dataset: C-index 0.838 for prediction and 0.826 for stratification, outperforming clinical and academic baselines; results align with known prognostic markers.

Conclusion: Interpretability-driven multimodal AI like MultiFIX shows promise for precision oncology, enabling validation and trust; further validation on diverse cohorts and broader explanation assessments needed.

Abstract: Accurate and interpretable survival analysis remains a core challenge in
oncology. With growing multimodal data and the clinical need for transparent
models to support validation and trust, this challenge increases in complexity.
We propose an interpretable multimodal AI framework to automate survival
analysis by integrating clinical variables and computed tomography imaging. Our
MultiFIX-based framework uses deep learning to infer survival-relevant features
that are further explained: imaging features are interpreted via Grad-CAM,
while clinical variables are modeled as symbolic expressions through genetic
programming. Risk estimation employs a transparent Cox regression, enabling
stratification into groups with distinct survival outcomes. Using the
open-source RADCURE dataset for head and neck cancer, MultiFIX achieves a
C-index of 0.838 (prediction) and 0.826 (stratification), outperforming the
clinical and academic baseline approaches and aligning with known prognostic
markers. These results highlight the promise of interpretable multimodal AI for
precision oncology with MultiFIX.

### [394] [Semantic F1 Scores: Fair Evaluation Under Fuzzy Class Boundaries](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21633)
*Georgios Chochlakis,Jackson Trager,Vedant Jhaveri,Nikhil Ravichandran,Alexandros Potamianos,Shrikanth Narayanan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Semantic F1: a soft, similarity-based two-step F1 for multi-label classification that grants partial credit for semantically related labels via a label similarity matrix; robust to label-set size and ontology-free.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional F1 treats semantically related but nonidentical labels as mismatches, which misrepresents performance in domains with fuzzy boundaries, human disagreement, or overlapping categories. The proposed metric aims to reflect semantic relatedness and support fairer, more interpretable evaluation across tasks, modalities, and label-set sizes.

Method: Introduce a label similarity matrix to compute soft precision-like and recall-like scores in two steps, enabling comparison of label sets of arbitrary sizes without discarding labels or forcing exact matches. The approach yields Semantic F1 scores that reward partial credit for semantically related predictions and is robust to misspecification of the similarity matrix.

Result: The authors provide theoretical justification and extensive empirical validation on synthetic and real data, showing Semantic F1 offers greater interpretability and ecological validity than conventional F1 and existing similarity-based metrics.

Conclusion: Semantic F1 is a domain-agnostic, ontology-light evaluation tool that requires only a domain-appropriate similarity matrix and can be applied across tasks and modalities, offering fairer evaluations by acknowledging label overlap and annotator disagreement.

Abstract: We propose Semantic F1 Scores, novel evaluation metrics for subjective or
fuzzy multi-label classification that quantify semantic relatedness between
predicted and gold labels. Unlike the conventional F1 metrics that treat
semantically related predictions as complete failures, Semantic F1 incorporates
a label similarity matrix to compute soft precision-like and recall-like
scores, from which the Semantic F1 scores are derived. Unlike existing
similarity-based metrics, our novel two-step precision-recall formulation
enables the comparison of label sets of arbitrary sizes without discarding
labels or forcing matches between dissimilar labels. By granting partial credit
for semantically related but nonidentical labels, Semantic F1 better reflects
the realities of domains marked by human disagreement or fuzzy category
boundaries. In this way, it provides fairer evaluations: it recognizes that
categories overlap, that annotators disagree, and that downstream decisions
based on similar predictions lead to similar outcomes. Through theoretical
justification and extensive empirical validation on synthetic and real data, we
show that Semantic F1 demonstrates greater interpretability and ecological
validity. Because it requires only a domain-appropriate similarity matrix,
which is robust to misspecification, and not a rigid ontology, it is applicable
across tasks and modalities.

*Abhishek Jindal,Dmitry Kalashnikov,Oscar Chang,Divya Garikapati,Anirudha Majumdar,Pierre Sermanet,Vikas Sindhwani*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A scalable, multi-modal benchmark and training framework to assess and improve safety in Embodied AI, focusing on physical safety risks, reasoning, and interventions, with thinking traces and a public benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Safety risks are direct and immediate when AI agents operate in the physical world. Current foundation models struggle with common-sense physical safety, necessitating a scalable benchmark and methods to teach explicit embodiment-safe reasoning.

Method: 1) Create a continuous physical safety benchmark grounded in real-world injury narratives and operational constraints. 2) Use generative models to produce photorealistic images/videos illustrating transitions from safe to unsafe states for multi-modal evaluation. 3) Evaluate major foundation models on risk perception, safety reasoning, and intervention triggering. 4) Develop a post-training paradigm to teach embodiment-specific safety constraints via system instructions, producing interpretable thinking traces. 5) Release theBenchmark for public use.

Result: Findings indicate varying deployment readiness of foundation models for safety-critical tasks; the approach yields insights into risk perception and safety reasoning, and achieves state-of-the-art performance in constraint satisfaction after the post-training paradigm; thinking traces enhance interpretability.

Conclusion: The proposed benchmark and post-training strategy advance safe deployment of embodied AI by enabling scalable evaluation, improving safety reasoning, and providing interpretable traces, with the benchmark being released publicly.

Abstract: When AI interacts with the physical world -- as a robot or an assistive agent
-- new safety challenges emerge beyond those of purely ``digital AI". In such
interactions, the potential for physical harm is direct and immediate. How well
do state-of-the-art foundation models understand common-sense facts about
physical safety, e.g. that a box may be too heavy to lift, or that a hot cup of
coffee should not be handed to a child? In this paper, our contributions are
three-fold: first, we develop a highly scalable approach to continuous physical
safety benchmarking of Embodied AI systems, grounded in real-world injury
narratives and operational safety constraints. To probe multi-modal safety
understanding, we turn these narratives and constraints into photorealistic
images and videos capturing transitions from safe to unsafe states, using
advanced generative models. Secondly, we comprehensively analyze the ability of
major foundation models to perceive risks, reason about safety, and trigger
interventions; this yields multi-faceted insights into their deployment
readiness for safety-critical agentic applications. Finally, we develop a
post-training paradigm to teach models to explicitly reason about
embodiment-specific safety constraints provided through system instructions.
The resulting models generate thinking traces that make safety reasoning
interpretable and transparent, achieving state of the art performance in
constraint satisfaction evaluations. The benchmark will be released at

### [396] [Align2Speak: Improving TTS for Low Resource Languages via ASR-Guided Online Preference Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21718)
*Shehzeen Hussain,Paarth Neekhara,Xuesong Yang,Edresson Casanova,Subhankar Ghosh,Roy Fejgin,Ryan Langman,Mikyas Desta,Leili Tavabi,Jason Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A GRPO-based framework adapts multilingual TTS to low-resource languages using IPA-based multilingual pretraining, limited paired data fine-tuning, and unpaired-text optimization with ASR, speaker verification, and audio quality rewards, yielding intelligible, speaker-consistent TTS and improvements over baseline fine-tuning and DPO in high-resource settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Low-resource languages lack large paired text-speech data for TTS. While ASR models benefit from multilingual pretraining and abundant data, TTS does not. The work aims to leverage unpaired data and cross-linguistic transfer to build high-quality TTS for under-resourced languages.

Method: 1) Train a language-agnostic TTS foundation using multilingual data with IPA tokens. 2) Fine-tune on limited paired data from the target languages to capture prosody. 3) Use Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to optimize the model with unpaired text and speaker prompts, guided by a multi-objective reward from pretrained ASR, speaker verification, and audio quality estimation models.

Result: The pipeline yields intelligible and speaker-consistent speech for low-resource languages, outperforming fine-tuning alone. Additionally, the GRPO framework improves TTS performance in high-resource languages, surpassing offline alignment methods such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) in intelligibility, speaker similarity, and audio quality.

Conclusion: A GRPO-based framework is effective for cross-language TTS adaptation, enabling high-quality synthesis in low-resource languages and offering gains in high-resource settings over existing alignment-based approaches.

Abstract: Developing high-quality text-to-speech (TTS) systems for low-resource
languages is challenging due to the scarcity of paired text and speech data. In
contrast, automatic speech recognition (ASR) models for such languages are
often more accessible, owing to large-scale multilingual pre-training efforts.
We propose a framework based on Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to
adapt an autoregressive, multilingual TTS model to new languages. Our method
first establishes a language-agnostic foundation for TTS synthesis by training
a multilingual baseline with International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) tokens.
Next, we fine-tune this model on limited paired data of the new languages to
capture the target language's prosodic features. Finally, we apply GRPO to
optimize the model using only unpaired text and speaker prompts, guided by a
multi-objective reward from pretrained ASR, speaker verification, and audio
quality estimation models. Experiments demonstrate that this pipeline produces
intelligible and speaker-consistent speech in low-resource languages,
substantially outperforming fine-tuning alone. Furthermore, our GRPO-based
framework also improves TTS performance in high-resource languages, surpassing
offline alignment methods such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) yielding
superior intelligibility, speaker similarity, and audio quality.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RoT uses a retrievable thought-graph to assemble problem-specific templates, reducing tokens, latency, and cost while preserving accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address inefficiency of long reasoning traces in large reasoning models, which raises latency and cost during inference.

Method: Construct a thought graph of reasoning steps with sequential and semantic edges; during inference retrieve query-relevant nodes and apply reward-guided traversal to assemble a dynamic template that guides generation, enabling reuse of prior reasoning.

Result: On reasoning benchmarks across multiple models, RoT reduces output tokens by up to 40%, inference latency by 82%, and cost by 59% while maintaining accuracy; prompts grow little.

Conclusion: RoT provides a scalable framework for efficient LRM reasoning through dynamic, retrieval-based template construction.

Abstract: Large reasoning models improve accuracy by producing long reasoning traces,
but this inflates latency and cost, motivating inference-time efficiency. We
propose Retrieval-of-Thought (RoT), which reuses prior reasoning as composable
``thought" steps to guide new problems. RoT organizes steps into a thought
graph with sequential and semantic edges to enable fast retrieval and flexible
recombination. At inference, RoT retrieves query-relevant nodes and applies
reward-guided traversal to assemble a problem-specific template that guides
generation. This dynamic template reuse reduces redundant exploration and,
therefore, reduces output tokens while preserving accuracy. We evaluate RoT on
reasoning benchmarks with multiple models, measuring accuracy, token usage,
latency, and memory overhead. Findings show small prompt growth but substantial
efficiency gains, with RoT reducing output tokens by up to 40%, inference
latency by 82%, and cost by 59% while maintaining accuracy. RoT establishes a
scalable paradigm for efficient LRM reasoning via dynamic template construction
through retrieval.

### [398] [Lifelong Learning with Behavior Consolidation for Vehicle Routing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21765)
*Jiyuan Pei,Yi Mei,Jialin Liu,Mengjie Zhang,Xin Yao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Introduces Lifelong Learning Router with Behavior Consolidation (LLR-BC) for neural VRP solvers to learn sequential tasks, align new-task decisions with buffered past decisions, and emphasize low-confidence decisions to combat forgetting and enhance zero-shot generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neural solvers for routing are typically trained on fixed distributions and scales, leading to catastrophic forgetting and poor adaptation to new tasks; a lifelong learning approach is needed to handle sequentially arriving tasks with diverse distributions.

Method: LLR-BC consolidates prior knowledge by aligning the behavior of the solver trained on a new task with buffered decisions from previously learned tasks in a decision-seeking framework. It weights decisions with lower confidence more heavily for consolidation to preserve crucial experiences and buffers past task behaviors to guide current learning.

Result: Extensive experiments on capacitated vehicle routing problems and traveling salesman problems show that LLR-BC effectively trains high-performing neural solvers in a lifelong learning setting, mitigating forgetting, maintaining plasticity, and improving zero-shot generalization.

Conclusion: LLR-BC enables sequential task learning for neural VRP solvers, preserving prior knowledge while remaining adaptable to new tasks, and enhances zero-shot generalization through behavior consolidation.

Abstract: Recent neural solvers have demonstrated promising performance in learning to
solve routing problems. However, existing studies are primarily based on
one-off training on one or a set of predefined problem distributions and
scales, i.e., tasks. When a new task arises, they typically rely on either
zero-shot generalization, which may be poor due to the discrepancies between
the new task and the training task(s), or fine-tuning the pretrained solver on
the new task, which possibly leads to catastrophic forgetting of knowledge
acquired from previous tasks. This paper explores a novel lifelong learning
paradigm for neural VRP solvers, where multiple tasks with diverse
distributions and scales arise sequentially over time. Solvers are required to
effectively and efficiently learn to solve new tasks while maintaining their
performance on previously learned tasks. Consequently, a novel framework called
Lifelong Learning Router with Behavior Consolidation (LLR-BC) is proposed.
LLR-BC consolidates prior knowledge effectively by aligning behaviors of the
solver trained on a new task with the buffered ones in a decision-seeking way.
To encourage more focus on crucial experiences, LLR-BC assigns greater
consolidated weights to decisions with lower confidence. Extensive experiments
on capacitated vehicle routing problems and traveling salesman problems
demonstrate LLR-BC's effectiveness in training high-performance neural solvers
in a lifelong learning setting, addressing the catastrophic forgetting issue,
maintaining their plasticity, and improving zero-shot generalization ability.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: UltraHorizon is a long-horizon, partially observable benchmark for exploration across three environments that probes core capabilities (reasoning, planning, memory, tool use) through sustained tasks; LLM agents underperform versus humans and scaling alone is ineffective; an eight-type error analysis is provided; code to be released.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the lack of benchmarks for long-horizon, partially observable tasks relevant to real-world problems (software development, finance, science) by focusing on exploration as a unifying task to assess foundational skills.

Method: Three environments are used in long-horizon discovery tasks where agents must iteratively uncover hidden rules through sustained reasoning, planning, memory management, tool use, and environment interaction. Heavy configurations yield ~200k+ tokens and 400+ tool calls; standard configurations yield ~35k+ tokens and 60+ tool calls. An extensive trajectory analysis identifies eight error types, attributed to in-context locking and functional fundamental capability gaps.

Result: LLM-based agents consistently underperform relative to humans across configurations; scaling alone does not bridge the gap. A detailed error taxonomy (eight types) reveals the nature of failures, with in-context locking and gaps in functional capabilities identified as core causes. The authors also provide a code repository for reproducibility.

Conclusion: Findings demonstrate a persistent gap in long-horizon abilities for AI agents; simply scaling LMs is insufficient. UltraHorizon provides a benchmark and diagnostic framework to study and improve long-horizon reasoning, planning, memory, and tool-use capabilities across real-world-like tasks.

Abstract: Autonomous agents have recently achieved remarkable progress across diverse
domains, yet most evaluations focus on short-horizon, fully observable tasks.
In contrast, many critical real-world tasks, such as large-scale software
development, commercial investment, and scientific discovery, unfold in
long-horizon and partially observable scenarios where success hinges on
sustained reasoning, planning, memory management, and tool use. Existing
benchmarks rarely capture these long-horizon challenges, leaving a gap in
systematic evaluation. To bridge this gap, we introduce \textbf{UltraHorizon} a
novel benchmark that measures the foundational capabilities essential for
complex real-world challenges. We use exploration as a unifying task across
three distinct environments to validate these core competencies. Agents are
designed in long-horizon discovery tasks where they must iteratively uncover
hidden rules through sustained reasoning, planning, memory and tools
management, and interaction with environments. Under the heaviest scale
setting, trajectories average \textbf{200k+} tokens and \textbf{400+} tool
calls, whereas in standard configurations they still exceed \textbf{35k} tokens
and involve more than \textbf{60} tool calls on average. Our extensive
experiments reveal that LLM-agents consistently underperform in these settings,
whereas human participants achieve higher scores, underscoring a persistent gap
in agents' long-horizon abilities. We also observe that simple scaling fails in
our task. To better illustrate the failure of agents, we conduct an in-depth
analysis of collected trajectories. We identify eight types of errors and
attribute them to two primary causes: in-context locking and functional
fundamental capability gaps.

*Junliang Liu,Jingyu Xiao,Wenxin Tang,Wenxuan Wang,Zhixian Wang,Minrui Zhang,Shuanghe Yu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A new benchmark (WebRSSBench) evaluates multimodal LLMs on web understanding across eight tasks focusing on reasoning, robustness, and safety, using 3799 QA pairs from 729 websites. Evaluated on 12 models, revealing gaps in multi-step reasoning, layout robustness, and safety sensitivity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need for end-to-end evaluation of web-oriented AI agents beyond perception and UI code generation, specifically targeting reasoning, robustness to UI/content perturbations, and safety in web interactions.

Method: WebRSSBench comprises eight tasks requiring multi-step inference over page structure, text, widgets, and safety-critical interactions. It uses data from 729 websites (3799 QA pairs). The workflow includes standardized prompts, deterministic evaluation scripts, and multi-stage quality control with automatic checks and targeted human verification. Twelve multimodal LLMs were evaluated.

Result: 12 MLLMs show significant gaps: weaknesses in compositional and cross-element reasoning over realistic layouts; reduced robustness to UI perturbations (layout rearrangements, style changes); and conservative in recognizing or avoiding safety-critical or irreversible actions. Code is available at the linked GitHub repository.

Conclusion: WebRSSBench exposes critical weaknesses of current MLLMs for end-to-end web tasks and provides a framework and dataset to spur improvements in reasoning, robustness, and safety for web-oriented AI systems.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are increasingly positioned as AI
collaborators for building complex web-related applications like GUI agents and
front-end code generation. However, existing benchmarks largely emphasize
visual perception or UI code generation, showing insufficient evaluation on the
reasoning, robustness and safety capability required for end-to-end web
applications. To bridge the gap, we introduce a comprehensive web understanding
benchmark, named WebRSSBench, that jointly evaluates Reasoning, Robustness, and
Safety across eight tasks, such as position relationship reasoning, color
robustness, and safety critical detection, etc. The benchmark is constructed
from 729 websites and contains 3799 question answer pairs that probe multi-step
inference over page structure, text, widgets, and safety-critical interactions.
To ensure reliable measurement, we adopt standardized prompts, deterministic
evaluation scripts, and multi-stage quality control combining automatic checks
with targeted human verification. We evaluate 12 MLLMs on WebRSSBench. The
results reveal significant gaps, models still struggle with compositional and
cross-element reasoning over realistic layouts, show limited robustness when
facing perturbations in user interfaces and content such as layout
rearrangements or visual style shifts, and are rather conservative in
recognizing and avoiding safety critical or irreversible actions. Our code is
available at https://github.com/jinliang-byte/webssrbench.

### [401] [D-Artemis: A Deliberative Cognitive Framework for Mobile GUI Multi-Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21799)
*Hongze Mi,Yibo Feng,Wenjie Lu,Yuqi Wang,Jinyuan Li,Song Cao,He Cui,Tengfei Tian,Xuelin Zhang,Haotian Luo,Di Sun,Naiqiang Tan,Gang Pan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: D-Artemis is a deliberative GUI agent framework that uses app-specific tip retrieval, proactive pre-execution alignment with Thought-Action Consistency (TAC) checks and an Action Correction Agent (ACA), and a post-execution Status Reflection Agent (SRA) to improve generalization of multimodal LLMs for GUI tasks, achieving state-of-the-art on AndroidWorld (75.8% success) and ScreenSpot-V2 (96.8%).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current GUI agents face data bottlenecks in end-to-end training, high cost of delayed error detection, and risk of contradictory guidance. There is a need for a generalizable, data-efficient framework that can leverage fine-grained cues and a cognitive loop to reduce errors and improve learning.

Method: A Thinking–Alignment–Reflection cognitive loop, with a fine-grained app-specific tip retrieval mechanism to inform decisions. Pre-execution Alignment uses Thought-Action Consistency (TAC) checks and an Action Correction Agent (ACA) to mitigate execution failures. Post-execution uses a Status Reflection Agent (SRA) for strategic learning. The approach relies on general-purpose Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) without training on trajectory datasets and demonstrates strong generalization across GUI tasks. Ablation studies quantify the contribution of each component.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results on AndroidWorld (75.8% success) and ScreenSpot-V2 (96.8%); extensive ablations show each component meaningfully contributes to performance and reliability.

Conclusion: D-Artemis presents a data-efficient, generalizable GUI agent framework that leverages a deliberative cognitive loop to reduce error risk and improve learning without requiring complex trajectory training, delivering strong cross-task performance and robust ablations.

Abstract: Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents aim to automate a wide spectrum of
human tasks by emulating user interaction. Despite rapid advancements, current
approaches are hindered by several critical challenges: data bottleneck in
end-to-end training, high cost of delayed error detection, and risk of
contradictory guidance. Inspired by the human cognitive loop of Thinking,
Alignment, and Reflection, we present D-Artemis -- a novel deliberative
framework in this paper. D-Artemis leverages a fine-grained, app-specific tip
retrieval mechanism to inform its decision-making process. It also employs a
proactive Pre-execution Alignment stage, where Thought-Action Consistency (TAC)
Check module and Action Correction Agent (ACA) work in concert to mitigate the
risk of execution failures. A post-execution Status Reflection Agent (SRA)
completes the cognitive loop, enabling strategic learning from experience.
Crucially, D-Artemis enhances the capabilities of general-purpose Multimodal
large language models (MLLMs) for GUI tasks without the need for training on
complex trajectory datasets, demonstrating strong generalization. D-Artemis
establishes new state-of-the-art (SOTA) results across both major benchmarks,
achieving a 75.8% success rate on AndroidWorld and 96.8% on ScreenSpot-V2.
Extensive ablation studies further demonstrate the significant contribution of
each component to the framework.

*Gaole Dai,Shiqi Jiang,Ting Cao,Yuqing Yang,Yuanchun Li,Rui Tan,Mo Li,Lili Qiu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ProRe is a proactive reward system for GUI agents that uses a general-purpose reasoner plus domain-specific evaluator agents to actively probe the environment and collect evidence, yielding more accurate and verifiable rewards and improving policy performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GUI-based agents often lack ground-truth trajectories or application databases; traditional rule-based or model-based reward methods struggle to generalize. Static trajectory-based LLM-as-Judge methods have limited accuracy, motivating a proactive, verifiable reward framework.

Method: A general-purpose reasoner schedules targeted state-probing tasks. Domain-specific evaluator agents interact with the GUI environment to gather additional observations. The reasoner then assigns rewards based on the verified information collected through probing, enabling more accurate reward signals.

Result: Empirical evaluation on over 3,000 trajectories shows ProRe improves reward accuracy by up to 5.3% and F1 score by up to 19.4%. When integrated with state-of-the-art policy agents, the success rate improves by up to 22.4%.

Conclusion: ProRe delivers more accurate and verifiable rewards for GUI agents and enhances downstream policy performance, demonstrating the value of proactive probing to improve reward signals in GUI-related RL/IL tasks.

Abstract: Reward is critical to the evaluation and training of large language models
(LLMs). However, existing rule-based or model-based reward methods struggle to
generalize to GUI agents, where access to ground-truth trajectories or
application databases is often unavailable, and static trajectory-based
LLM-as-a-Judge approaches suffer from limited accuracy. To address these
challenges, we propose ProRe, a proactive reward system that leverages a
general-purpose reasoner and domain-specific evaluator agents (actors). The
reasoner schedules targeted state probing tasks, which the evaluator agents
then execute by actively interacting with the environment to collect additional
observations. This enables the reasoner to assign more accurate and verifiable
rewards to GUI agents. Empirical results on over 3K trajectories demonstrate
that ProRe improves reward accuracy and F1 score by up to 5.3% and 19.4%,
respectively. Furthermore, integrating ProRe with state-of-the-art policy
agents yields a success rate improvement of up to 22.4%.

### [403] [DS-STAR: Data Science Agent via Iterative Planning and Verification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21825)
*Jaehyun Nam,Jinsung Yoon,Jiefeng Chen,Jinwoo Shin,Tomas Pfister*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DS-STAR is a data science agent that combines (1) automatic data file analysis across diverse formats, including unstructured data, (2) an LLM-based judge to verify the sufficiency of the analysis plan at each stage, and (3) a sequential planning loop that starts with a simple executable plan and iteratively refines it based on feedback until sufficiency is verified, achieving state-of-the-art results on DABStep, KramaBench, and DA-Code, especially for tasks with heterogeneous, multi-file data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models struggle with heterogeneous data formats and often produce suboptimal analysis plans in open-ended data science tasks. Verifying plan sufficiency is hard without ground-truth labels. A robust, automated approach is needed to explore data sources, validate plans, and iteratively refine plans to reliably perform data science tasks.

Method: Three-part design: (1) Data file analysis module that automatically explores and extracts context from diverse data formats, including unstructured data; (2) LLM-based judge that assesses the sufficiency of the proposed analysis plan at each stage; (3) Sequential planning mechanism that starts with a simple executable plan and iteratively refines it using feedback from DS-STAR until sufficiency is verified.

Result: DS-STAR achieves state-of-the-art performance across three challenging benchmarks—DABStep, KramaBench, and DA-Code—outperforming baselines, with particular strength on hard tasks that require processing multiple data files in heterogeneous formats.

Conclusion: DS-STAR provides a reliable (iterative) framework for navigating complex, multi-source data science analyses, improving plan sufficiency verification and overall performance in data-science automation.

Abstract: Data science, which transforms raw data into actionable insights, is critical
for data-driven decision-making. However, these tasks are often complex,
involving steps for exploring multiple data sources and synthesizing findings
to deliver insightful answers. While large language models (LLMs) show
significant promise in automating this process, they often struggle with
heterogeneous data formats and generate sub-optimal analysis plans, as
verifying plan sufficiency is inherently difficult without ground-truth labels
for such open-ended tasks. To overcome these limitations, we introduce DS-STAR,
a novel data science agent. Specifically, DS-STAR makes three key
contributions: (1) a data file analysis module that automatically explores and
extracts context from diverse data formats, including unstructured types; (2) a
verification step where an LLM-based judge evaluates the sufficiency of the
analysis plan at each stage; and (3) a sequential planning mechanism that
starts with a simple, executable plan and iteratively refines it based on the
DS-STAR's feedback until its sufficiency is verified. This iterative refinement
allows DS-STAR to reliably navigate complex analyses involving diverse data
sources. Our experiments show that DS-STAR achieves state-of-the-art
performance across three challenging benchmarks: DABStep, KramaBench, and
DA-Code. Moreover, DS-STAR particularly outperforms baselines on hard tasks
that require processing multiple data files with heterogeneous formats.

*Ben Abramowitz,Nicholas Mattei*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A theoretical framework and taxonomy of decision axioms revealing a Decision-Evaluation Paradox, with implications for ML training and the use of axioms in decision making and evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Explain why axioms governing decisions may conflict with axioms used to assess those decisions, and why this matters for AI systems.

Method: Proposes a formal framework for decisions with axiom statements, defines a taxonomy based on structural properties of axioms, and analyzes the paradox between decision and evaluation.

Result: Shows that the paradox arises under realistic axiom structures; the taxonomy clarifies where tension arises and its magnitude; provides implications for deploying models on decision data.

Conclusion: Care must be exercised when training on decision data or applying axioms to both decide and judge decisions; the framework offers diagnostic guidance.

Abstract: We introduce a framework for modeling decisions with axioms that are
statements about decisions, e.g., ethical constraints. Using our framework we
define a taxonomy of decision axioms based on their structural properties and
demonstrate a tension between the use of axioms to make decisions and the use
of axioms to evaluate decisions which we call the Decision-Evaluation Paradox.
We argue that the Decision-Evaluation Paradox arises with realistic axiom
structures, and the paradox illuminates why one must be exceptionally careful
when training models on decision data or applying axioms to make and evaluate
decisions.

### [405] [DeepTravel: An End-to-End Agentic Reinforcement Learning Framework for Autonomous Travel Planning Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21842)
*Yansong Ning,Rui Liu,Jun Wang,Kai Chen,Wei Li,Jun Fang,Kan Zheng,Naiqiang Tan,Hao Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DeepTravel presents an end-to-end reinforcement learning framework for autonomous travel planning agents that can plan, execute tools, and reflect on tool responses to enable multi-step reasoning, using sandbox data caching and hierarchical reward verification, achieving strong performance with small LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address rigidity and limited autonomy in existing TP agents that rely on hand-crafted prompts and fixed workflows, enabling more flexible, autonomous, and reliable travel planning through agentic RL.

Method: Construct a sandbox environment with cached TP data; hierarchical reward modeling with trajectory-level and turn-level verifiers; reply-augmented RL with failure experience replay; deploy on app and perform online/offline evaluations.

Result: DeepTravel enables small LLMs (e.g., Qwen3 32B) to significantly outperform frontier LLMs (OpenAI o1, o3, DeepSeek R1) on travel planning tasks; demonstrated in online/offline experiments and deployment on DiDi Enterprise Solutions App.

Conclusion: Shows feasibility and benefits of autonomous, tool-augmented TP agents using agentic RL with data caching, verification, and reflective learning; potential to generalize to other tool-using agents and improve planner quality with smaller models.

Abstract: Travel planning (TP) agent has recently worked as an emerging building block
to interact with external tools and resources for travel itinerary generation,
ensuring enjoyable user experience. Despite its benefits, existing studies rely
on hand craft prompt and fixed agent workflow, hindering more flexible and
autonomous TP agent. This paper proposes DeepTravel, an end to end agentic
reinforcement learning framework for building autonomous travel planning agent,
capable of autonomously planning, executing tools, and reflecting on tool
responses to explore, verify, and refine intermediate actions in multi step
reasoning. To achieve this, we first construct a robust sandbox environment by
caching transportation, accommodation and POI data, facilitating TP agent
training without being constrained by real world APIs limitations (e.g.,
inconsistent outputs). Moreover, we develop a hierarchical reward modeling
system, where a trajectory level verifier first checks spatiotemporal
feasibility and filters unsatisfied travel itinerary, and then the turn level
verifier further validate itinerary detail consistency with tool responses,
enabling efficient and precise reward service. Finally, we propose the reply
augmented reinforcement learning method that enables TP agent to periodically
replay from a failures experience buffer, emerging notable agentic capacity. We
deploy trained TP agent on DiDi Enterprise Solutions App and conduct
comprehensive online and offline evaluations, demonstrating that DeepTravel
enables small size LLMs (e.g., Qwen3 32B) to significantly outperform existing
frontier LLMs such as OpenAI o1, o3 and DeepSeek R1 in travel planning tasks.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Shachi introduces a modular, principled framework to study emergent behaviors in LLM-driven multi-agent systems by decomposing agent policy into Configuration, Memory, and Tools, orchestrated by an LLM engine; validated on a 10-task benchmark and via a real-world tariff shock to demonstrate external validity; open-source.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the lack of principled methodologies for controlled experimentation in emergent behaviors of LLM-driven multi-agent systems and to enable systematic analysis of how architectural choices shape collective behavior.

Method: Decompose agent policy into Configuration (intrinsic traits), Memory (contextual persistence), and Tools (expanded capabilities); orchestrate with an LLM reasoning engine; validate on a comprehensive 10-task benchmark; model a real-world U.S. tariff shock to test external validity; provide an open-source framework for rigorous evaluation.

Result: Shows that architectural choices influence collective behavior; external validity demonstrated when memory and tools are configured, aligning agent behaviors with observed market reactions; offers a reusable, open-source platform for controlled experiments and reproducible studies.

Conclusion: Presents a rigorous, open-source foundation for building and evaluating LLM agents, enabling cumulative, scientifically grounded research in emergent multi-agent systems.

Abstract: The study of emergent behaviors in large language model (LLM)-driven
multi-agent systems is a critical research challenge, yet progress is limited
by a lack of principled methodologies for controlled experimentation. To
address this, we introduce Shachi, a formal methodology and modular framework
that decomposes an agent's policy into core cognitive components: Configuration
for intrinsic traits, Memory for contextual persistence, and Tools for expanded
capabilities, all orchestrated by an LLM reasoning engine. This principled
architecture moves beyond brittle, ad-hoc agent designs and enables the
systematic analysis of how specific architectural choices influence collective
behavior. We validate our methodology on a comprehensive 10-task benchmark and
demonstrate its power through novel scientific inquiries. Critically, we
establish the external validity of our approach by modeling a real-world U.S.
tariff shock, showing that agent behaviors align with observed market reactions
only when their cognitive architecture is appropriately configured with memory
and tools. Our work provides a rigorous, open-source foundation for building
and evaluating LLM agents, aimed at fostering more cumulative and
scientifically grounded research.

### [407] [TRACE: Learning to Compute on Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21886)
*Ziyang Zheng,Jiaying Zhu,Jingyi Zhou,Qiang Xu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TRACE introduces a Hierarchical Transformer backbone and function shift learning to better learn to compute on graphs, addressing architectural misalignment in MPNNs and Transformers by aligning with step-by-step computation and decoupled objective; shows strong results on electronic circuits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Learning to compute on graphs is fundamental for graph representation learning, but current dominant architectures (MPNNs and standard Transformers) are architecturally mismatched with the step-by-step, position-aware, hierarchical nature of computation, hindering capture of the true functional behavior.

Method: Use a Hierarchical Transformer that mirrors the sequential flow of computation as the backbone. Introduce function shift learning, which trains the model to predict the discrepancy between the true global function and a simple local independence-based approximation, effectively decoupling the learning problem.

Result: TRACE substantially outperforms prior architectures across benchmarks in electronic circuits, demonstrating the effectiveness of the architecturally-aligned backbone and decoupled objective.

Conclusion: An architecturally-aligned backbone together with a decoupled learning objective provides a robust paradigm for the fundamental challenge of learning to compute on graphs.

Abstract: Learning to compute, the ability to model the functional behavior of a
computational graph, is a fundamental challenge for graph representation
learning. Yet, the dominant paradigm is architecturally mismatched for this
task. This flawed assumption, central to mainstream message passing neural
networks (MPNNs) and their conventional Transformer-based counterparts,
prevents models from capturing the position-aware, hierarchical nature of
computation. To resolve this, we introduce \textbf{TRACE}, a new paradigm built
on an architecturally sound backbone and a principled learning objective.
First, TRACE employs a Hierarchical Transformer that mirrors the step-by-step
flow of computation, providing a faithful architectural backbone that replaces
the flawed permutation-invariant aggregation. Second, we introduce
\textbf{function shift learning}, a novel objective that decouples the learning
problem. Instead of predicting the complex global function directly, our model
is trained to predict only the \textit{function shift}, the discrepancy between
the true global function and a simple local approximation that assumes input
independence. We validate this paradigm on electronic circuits, one of the most
complex and economically critical classes of computational graphs. Across a
comprehensive suite of benchmarks, TRACE substantially outperforms all prior
architectures. These results demonstrate that our architecturally-aligned
backbone and decoupled learning objective form a more robust paradigm for the
fundamental challenge of learning to compute on graphs.

TL;DR: GenesisGeo presents a scalable, open-source geometry prover that combines large datasets, a 120x speedup of symbolic deduction via theorem matching, and a neuro-symbolic backbone to achieve near-IMO gold medal performance with a single model and gold-level with an ensemble.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To advance automatic theorem proving in Euclidean geometry by providing a large, diverse dataset and a fast, accurate reasoning engine, enabling high-performance solution of challenging geometry problems.

Method: Introduce GenesisGeo, accelerate the symbolic deduction engine DDARN by 120x via theorem matching with a C++ implementation, and build a neuro-symbolic prover on top of Qwen3-0.6B-Base. Evaluate on the IMO-AG-30 benchmark using a single model and a dual-model ensemble.

Result: A large-scale geometry dataset of 21.8 million problems (over 3 million with auxiliary constructions) is released; DDARN is sped up 120x; GenesisGeo (neuro-symbolic on Qwen3-0.6B-Base) solves 24/30 IMO-AG-30 problems with a single model and 26/30 with an ensemble.

Conclusion: GenesisGeo demonstrates that a scalable, open-source geometry theorem proving stack—combining large datasets, substantial symbolic-deduction acceleration, and neuro-symbolic reasoning—can achieve competitive IMO-level performance, underscoring the potential of data-driven and hybrid approaches for automated geometry reasoning.

Abstract: We present GenesisGeo, an automated theorem prover in Euclidean geometry. We
have open-sourced a large-scale geometry dataset of 21.8 million geometric

*Ruiqi Chen,Yi Mei,Fangfang Zhang,Mengjie Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Introduces DyRo-MCTS, a robustness-aware Monte Carlo Tree Search for dynamic job shop scheduling, improving offline-policy performance with minimal online cost and outpacing standard MCTS under disturbances.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dynamic job arrivals create disruptions that make scheduling policies brittle. Offline-learned policies may perform poorly when confronted with unforeseen events, so online planning is needed but must handle incomplete information and disturbances.

Method: Proposes Dynamic Robust MCTS (DyRo-MCTS) by integrating action robustness estimation into MCTS to guide search toward states that yield good immediate scheduling results and are easily adaptable to future arrivals.

Result: Experiments show DyRo-MCTS significantly improves the performance of offline-learned policies with negligible additional online planning time and consistently outperforms vanilla MCTS across diverse scheduling scenarios.

Conclusion: Robust, adaptable planning via DyRo-MCTS yields long-term, sustainable performance gains under disturbances in dynamic job shop scheduling.

Abstract: Dynamic job shop scheduling, a fundamental combinatorial optimisation problem
in various industrial sectors, poses substantial challenges for effective
scheduling due to frequent disruptions caused by the arrival of new jobs.
State-of-the-art methods employ machine learning to learn scheduling policies
offline, enabling rapid responses to dynamic events. However, these offline
policies are often imperfect, necessitating the use of planning techniques such
as Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to improve performance at online decision
time. The unpredictability of new job arrivals complicates online planning, as
decisions based on incomplete problem information are vulnerable to
disturbances. To address this issue, we propose the Dynamic Robust MCTS
(DyRo-MCTS) approach, which integrates action robustness estimation into MCTS.
DyRo-MCTS guides the production environment toward states that not only yield
good scheduling outcomes but are also easily adaptable to future job arrivals.
Extensive experiments show that DyRo-MCTS significantly improves the
performance of offline-learned policies with negligible additional online
planning time. Moreover, DyRo-MCTS consistently outperforms vanilla MCTS across
various scheduling scenarios. Further analysis reveals that its ability to make
robust scheduling decisions leads to long-term, sustainable performance gains
under disturbances.

*Carlo Dindorf,Jonas Dully,Steven Simon,Dennis Perchthaler,Stephan Becker,Hannah Ehmann,Kjell Heitmann,Bernd Stetter,Christian Diers,Michael Fröhlich*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CNN with SHAP explanations outperforms SPM for automated outlier detection in plantar pressure data; SPM is interpretable but aligns poorly and misses outliers; combining SPM and explainable ML offers complementary, explainable quality-control insights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large, multi-center plantar pressure datasets are prone to outliers from technical/procedural issues. SPM provides interpretability but is sensitive to alignment; there is a need for robust, transparent quality-control pipelines that leverage explainable ML.

Method: Compare a non-parametric, registration-dependent SPM approach with a CNN whose predictions are explained using SHAP. Data from multiple centers annotated by expert consensus with synthetic anomalies, totaling 798 valid samples and 2000 outliers. Performance assessed via nested cross-validation; explanation quality evaluated with a semantic differential survey among domain experts.

Result: The ML model achieved higher accuracy and outperformed SPM, which misclassified clinically meaningful variations and missed true outliers. Experts found both SPM and SHAP explanations clear, useful, and trustworthy, though SPM was perceived as less complex.

Conclusion: Explainable ML and SPM can play complementary roles in automated outlier detection for plantar pressure data. Emphasizing explainability helps translate complex model outputs into actionable quality-control insights for decision-making.

Abstract: Plantar pressure mapping is essential in clinical diagnostics and sports
science, yet large heterogeneous datasets often contain outliers from technical
errors or procedural inconsistencies. Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM)
provides interpretable analyses but is sensitive to alignment and its capacity
for robust outlier detection remains unclear. This study compares an SPM
approach with an explainable machine learning (ML) approach to establish
transparent quality-control pipelines for plantar pressure datasets. Data from
multiple centers were annotated by expert consensus and enriched with synthetic
anomalies resulting in 798 valid samples and 2000 outliers. We evaluated (i) a
non-parametric, registration-dependent SPM approach and (ii) a convolutional
neural network (CNN), explained using SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP).
Performance was assessed via nested cross-validation; explanation quality via a
semantic differential survey with domain experts. The ML model reached high
accuracy and outperformed SPM, which misclassified clinically meaningful
variations and missed true outliers. Experts perceived both SPM and SHAP
explanations as clear, useful, and trustworthy, though SPM was assessed less
complex. These findings highlight the complementary potential of SPM and
explainable ML as approaches for automated outlier detection in plantar
pressure data, and underscore the importance of explainability in translating
complex model outputs into interpretable insights that can effectively inform
decision-making.

TL;DR: CoBel-World equips LLM agents with a collaborative belief world to jointly model the environment and teammates' intents, enabling zero-shot belief updates, faster coordination, and reduced communication in partial-observable tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address miscoordination and redundant communication in multi-agent LLM systems under partial observability by leveraging intent inference and internal symbolic belief representations.

Method: Introduce a collaborative belief world that jointly models the physical environment and collaborators' mental states using a symbolic belief language; parse open-world task knowledge into structured beliefs; perform zero-shot Bayesian-style belief updates through LLM reasoning; proactively detect potential miscoordination and communicate adaptively.

Result: On TDW-MAT and C-WAH benchmarks, CoBel-World reduces communication costs by 22-60% and improves task completion efficiency by 4-28% compared to the strongest baseline.

Conclusion: Explicit, intent-aware belief modeling is essential for efficient and human-like collaboration in LLM-based multi-agent systems.

Abstract: Effective real-world multi-agent collaboration requires not only accurate
planning but also the ability to reason about collaborators' intents -- a
crucial capability for avoiding miscoordination and redundant communication
under partial observable environments. Due to their strong planning and
reasoning capabilities, large language models (LLMs) have emerged as promising
autonomous agents for collaborative task solving. However, existing
collaboration frameworks for LLMs overlook their reasoning potential for
dynamic intent inference, and thus produce inconsistent plans and redundant
communication, reducing collaboration efficiency. To bridge this gap, we
propose CoBel-World, a novel framework that equips LLM agents with a
collaborative belief world -- an internal representation jointly modeling the
physical environment and collaborators' mental states. CoBel-World enables
agents to parse open-world task knowledge into structured beliefs via a
symbolic belief language, and perform zero-shot Bayesian-style belief updates
through LLM reasoning. This allows agents to proactively detect potential
miscoordination (e.g., conflicting plans) and communicate adaptively. Evaluated
on challenging embodied benchmarks (i.e., TDW-MAT and C-WAH), CoBel-World
significantly reduces communication costs by 22-60% and improves task
completion efficiency by 4-28% compared to the strongest baseline. Our results
show that explicit, intent-aware belief modeling is essential for efficient and
human-like collaboration in LLM-based multi-agent systems.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RISK is a GUI agent framework for e-commerce risk management that enables multi-step, stateful web interactions. It introduces dedicated datasets and benchmarks and a reinforcement-fine-tuning approach that yields strong offline and online performance gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional scraping and single-step GUI agents struggle with aggregating diverse, embedded web data and managing dynamic, interactive content required for effective e-commerce risk assessment.

Method: RISK comprises three components: (1) RISK-Data with 8,492 single-step and 2,386 multi-step interaction trajectories; (2) RISK-Bench with 802 single-step and 320 multi-step trajectories across three difficulty levels; (3) RISK-R1 reinforcement fine-tuning framework addressing four aspects: Output Format, Single-step Level, Multi-step Level, and Task Level, with a high-fidelity browser framework for data collection.

Result: RISK-R1 outperforms baselines, achieving 6.8% offline improvement for single-step and 8.8% for multi-step; online top task success rate of 70.5%.

Conclusion: RISK offers a scalable, domain-specific solution for automating complex web interactions in e-commerce risk management, advancing the state of the art.

Abstract: E-commerce risk management requires aggregating diverse, deeply embedded web
data through multi-step, stateful interactions, which traditional scraping
methods and most existing Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents cannot handle.
These agents are typically limited to single-step tasks and lack the ability to
manage dynamic, interactive content critical for effective risk assessment. To
address this challenge, we introduce RISK, a novel framework designed to build
and deploy GUI agents for this domain. RISK integrates three components: (1)
RISK-Data, a dataset of 8,492 single-step and 2,386 multi-step interaction
trajectories, collected through a high-fidelity browser framework and a
meticulous data curation process; (2) RISK-Bench, a benchmark with 802
single-step and 320 multi-step trajectories across three difficulty levels for
standardized evaluation; and (3) RISK-R1, a R1-style reinforcement fine-tuning
framework considering four aspects: (i) Output Format: Updated format reward to
enhance output syntactic correctness and task comprehension, (ii) Single-step
Level: Stepwise accuracy reward to provide granular feedback during early
training stages, (iii) Multi-step Level: Process reweight to emphasize critical
later steps in interaction sequences, and (iv) Task Level: Level reweight to
focus on tasks of varying difficulty. Experiments show that RISK-R1 outperforms
existing baselines, achieving a 6.8% improvement in offline single-step and an
8.8% improvement in offline multi-step. Moreover, it attains a top task success
rate of 70.5% in online evaluation. RISK provides a scalable, domain-specific
solution for automating complex web interactions, advancing the state of the
art in e-commerce risk management.

### [413] [Bilinear relational structure fixes reversal curse and enables consistent model editing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21993)
*Dong-Kyum Kim,Minsung Kim,Jea Kwon,Nakyeong Yang,Meeyoung Cha*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Training LMs on relational knowledge graphs yields bilinear representations that alleviate the reversal curse and enable logically consistent edits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The reversal curse—the inability to infer unseen reverse facts from learned ones—is not an inherent limitation but may stem from how knowledge is encoded. If relational structure emerges in hidden representations, LMs could infer reverse facts and maintain consistency after edits.

Method: Train LMs from scratch on a synthetic dataset of relational knowledge graphs; analyze hidden representations to identify bilinear relational structure; test reverse-inference capabilities; perform updates/edits and examine propagation to reverse and dependent facts.

Result: Bilinear relational structure emerges in the model's hidden representations, significantly alleviating the reversal curse and enabling inference of unseen reverse facts. This structure also supports consistent propagation of edits to reverse and logically dependent facts. Models lacking this representation suffer from the reversal curse and fail to generalize edits, causing inconsistencies.

Conclusion: Relational knowledge training induces bilinear internal representations that support logically consistent behavior after editing. Model-editing success depends on the underlying representational geometry of knowledge, not solely on editing algorithms.

Abstract: The reversal curse -- a language model's (LM) inability to infer an unseen
fact ``B is A'' from a learned fact ``A is B'' -- is widely considered a
fundamental limitation. We show that this is not an inherent failure but an
artifact of how models encode knowledge. By training LMs from scratch on a
synthetic dataset of relational knowledge graphs, we demonstrate that bilinear
relational structure emerges in their hidden representations. This structure
substantially alleviates the reversal curse, enabling LMs to infer unseen
reverse facts. Crucially, we also find that this bilinear structure plays a key
role in consistent model editing. When a fact is updated in a LM with this
structure, the edit correctly propagates to its reverse and other logically
dependent facts. In contrast, models lacking this representation not only
suffer from the reversal curse but also fail to generalize edits, further
introducing logical inconsistencies. Our results establish that training on a
relational knowledge dataset induces the emergence of bilinear internal
representations, which in turn enable LMs to behave in a logically consistent
manner after editing. This implies that the success of model editing depends
critically not just on editing algorithms but on the underlying
representational geometry of the knowledge being modified.

### [414] [GSM-Agent: Understanding Agentic Reasoning Using Controllable Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21998)
*Hanlin Zhu,Tianyu Guo,Song Mei,Stuart Russell,Nikhil Ghosh,Alberto Bietti,Jiantao Jiao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GSM-Agent evaluates agentic reasoning by requiring LLMs to fetch missing premises via tools to solve grade-school problems; it uses a graph-based analysis of tool use, finds revisiting previously seen information is often missing, and proposes a tool-augmented test-time scaling to encourage revisits, aiming to advance understanding of agentic reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Disentangle agentic reasoning from pure math or domain knowledge by providing a controlled benchmark where necessary information must be gathered with tools.

Method: Present questions without premises; require proactive information gathering using tools; cluster environment documents into nodes via embeddings and map each tool call to the nearest node to form an agentic reasoning graph; analyze revisit patterns; propose a test-time scaling method that adds tools to promote revisiting nodes.

Result: GPT-5-like models reach only ~67% accuracy on GSM-Agent; the agentic reasoning graph reveals a tendency to not revisit previously visited nodes; a tool-augmented test-time scaling method is proposed to improve visitation/revisitation patterns and performance.

Conclusion: The benchmark and the graph-based framework provide a foundation for studying and pushing agentic reasoning, highlighting specific patterns (like revisitation) to target for improvement.

Abstract: As LLMs are increasingly deployed as agents, agentic reasoning - the ability
to combine tool use, especially search, and reasoning - becomes a critical
skill. However, it is hard to disentangle agentic reasoning when evaluated in
complex environments and tasks. Current agent benchmarks often mix agentic
reasoning with challenging math reasoning, expert-level knowledge, and other
advanced capabilities. To fill this gap, we build a novel benchmark, GSM-Agent,
where an LLM agent is required to solve grade-school-level reasoning problems,
but is only presented with the question in the prompt without the premises that
contain the necessary information to solve the task, and needs to proactively
collect that information using tools. Although the original tasks are
grade-school math problems, we observe that even frontier models like GPT-5
only achieve 67% accuracy. To understand and analyze the agentic reasoning
patterns, we propose the concept of agentic reasoning graph: cluster the
environment's document embeddings into nodes, and map each tool call to its
nearest node to build a reasoning path. Surprisingly, we identify that the
ability to revisit a previously visited node, widely taken as a crucial pattern
in static reasoning, is often missing for agentic reasoning for many models.
Based on the insight, we propose a tool-augmented test-time scaling method to
improve LLM's agentic reasoning performance by adding tools to encourage models
to revisit. We expect our benchmark and the agentic reasoning framework to aid
future studies of understanding and pushing the boundaries of agentic
reasoning.

TL;DR: A large-scale empirical study of model merging to produce tunable LLMs that balance reasoning depth and token efficiency, showing controllable trade-offs and Pareto improvements over parent models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Growing demand for LLMs with adjustable reasoning capabilities that can be traded off against computation; merging provides a training-free way to blend a general model with a specialized reasoning model.

Method: Systematically evaluate multiple model-merging techniques across several reasoning benchmarks. Vary merging strength to generate accuracy–efficiency curves, even when parent models have very different weight spaces, and analyze performance and token use.

Result: Merged models can be tuned to achieve desired accuracy and token efficiency, enabling a controllable trade-off; in some cases merged models outperform one parent on both accuracy and token cost (Pareto improvement). Provides practical guidelines for constructing LLMs with specific reasoning profiles.

Conclusion: This work offers the first comprehensive view of the tunable accuracy–efficiency landscape for model merging, enabling practical creation of LLMs with targeted reasoning capabilities for diverse applications.

Abstract: The growing demand for large language models (LLMs) with tunable reasoning
capabilities in many real-world applications highlights a critical need for
methods that can efficiently produce a spectrum of models balancing reasoning
depth and computational cost. Model merging has emerged as a promising,
training-free technique to address this challenge by arithmetically combining
the weights of a general-purpose model with a specialized reasoning model.
While various merging techniques exist, their potential to create a spectrum of
models with fine-grained control over reasoning abilities remains largely
unexplored. This work presents a large-scale empirical study evaluating a range
of model merging techniques across multiple reasoning benchmarks. We
systematically vary merging strengths to construct accuracy-efficiency curves,
providing the first comprehensive view of the tunable performance landscape.
Our findings reveal that model merging offers an effective and controllable
method for calibrating the trade-off between reasoning accuracy and token
efficiency, even when parent models have highly divergent weight spaces.
Crucially, we identify instances of Pareto Improvement, where a merged model
achieves both higher accuracy and lower token consumption than one of its
parents. Our study provides the first comprehensive analysis of this tunable
space, offering practical guidelines for creating LLMs with specific reasoning
profiles to meet diverse application demands.

### [416] [A2R: An Asymmetric Two-Stage Reasoning Framework for Parallel Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22044)
*Ziqi Wang,Boye Niu,Zhongli Li,Linghui Meng,Jing Liu,Zhi Zheng,Tong Xu,Hua Wu,Haifeng Wang,Enhong Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A2R proposes an asymmetric two-stage reasoning framework with an explorer and synthesizer to bridge potential and actual performance, achieving substantial gains and cost efficiency via parallel exploration and a second-stage synthesis; demonstrated improvements on Qwen models, including a smaller explorer plus larger synthesizer that beat larger monolithic models at lower cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the gap between single-pass performance and latent potential revealed across multiple solution paths; empower models with explicit parallel exploration and an integrated synthesis stage to improve complex question answering.

Method: Two-stage architecture: explorer (parallel sampling to generate diverse candidate solutions) + synthesizer (integrates references for refined reasoning). Introduces Asymmetric Scaling: small explorer with large synthesizer (A2R-Efficient). Plug-and-play; computes parallel improvements independent from sequential chain-of-thought.

Result: On Qwen3-8B-distill, 75% performance improvement vs self-consistency baseline; A2R-Efficient (Qwen3-4B explorer + Qwen3-8B synthesizer) surpasses average performance of a monolithic Qwen3-32B at ~30% lower cost.

Conclusion: A2R is a practical, scalable, plug-and-play framework that narrows the gap between latent potential and realized performance, with asymmetric two-stage design enabling efficient real-world deployment.

Abstract: Recent Large Reasoning Models have achieved significant improvements in
complex task-solving capabilities by allocating more computation at the
inference stage with a "thinking longer" paradigm. Even as the foundational
reasoning capabilities of models advance rapidly, the persistent gap between a
model's performance in a single attempt and its latent potential, often
revealed only across multiple solution paths, starkly highlights the disparity
between its realized and inherent capabilities. To address this, we present
A2R, an Asymmetric Two-Stage Reasoning framework designed to explicitly bridge
the gap between a model's potential and its actual performance. In this
framework, an "explorer" model first generates potential solutions in parallel
through repeated sampling. Subsequently,a "synthesizer" model integrates these
references for a more refined, second stage of reasoning. This two-stage
process allows computation to be scaled orthogonally to existing sequential
methods. Our work makes two key innovations: First, we present A2R as a
plug-and-play parallel reasoning framework that explicitly enhances a model's
capabilities on complex questions. For example, using our framework, the
Qwen3-8B-distill model achieves a 75% performance improvement compared to its
self-consistency baseline. Second, through a systematic analysis of the
explorer and synthesizer roles, we identify an effective asymmetric scaling
paradigm. This insight leads to A2R-Efficient, a "small-to-big" variant that
combines a Qwen3-4B explorer with a Qwen3-8B synthesizer. This configuration
surpasses the average performance of a monolithic Qwen3-32B model at a nearly
30% lower cost. Collectively, these results show that A2R is not only a
performance-boosting framework but also an efficient and practical solution for
real-world applications.

*Hadar Peer,Eyal Weiss,Ron Alterovitz,Oren Salzman*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A generalized multi-objective search framework that aggregates hidden objectives to enable standard MOS algorithms to solve diverse robotics planning problems, yielding orders-of-magnitude improvements over vanilla approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In robotics, multiple objectives often conflict and interact in ways that render off-the-shelf MOS methods ineffective. The authors propose a generalized formulation that optimizes aggregated functions of hidden (search) objectives, enabling reuse of standard MOS algorithms by appropriately extending their core operations.

Method: Introduce a generalized problem formulation using aggregation functions over hidden objectives. Extend core operations of state-of-the-art MOS algorithms to reflect these aggregations. Demonstrate on diverse robotics planning tasks (navigation, manipulation, medical-system planning under obstacle uncertainty, inspection planning, and route planning across varied road types).

Result: Empirically, the aggregation-based approach outperforms vanilla MOS algorithms applied to the same problems by orders of magnitude.

Conclusion: A unifying aggregation-based formulation enables standard MOS algorithms to handle complex objective interactions in robotics planning, with broad applicability and substantial performance gains.

Abstract: Multi-objective search (MOS) has become essential in robotics, as real-world
robotic systems need to simultaneously balance multiple, often conflicting
objectives. Recent works explore complex interactions between objectives,
leading to problem formulations that do not allow the usage of out-of-the-box
state-of-the-art MOS algorithms. In this paper, we suggest a generalized
problem formulation that optimizes solution objectives via aggregation
functions of hidden (search) objectives. We show that our formulation supports
the application of standard MOS algorithms, necessitating only to properly
extend several core operations to reflect the specific aggregation functions
employed. We demonstrate our approach in several diverse robotics planning
problems, spanning motion-planning for navigation, manipulation and planning fr
medical systems under obstacle uncertainty as well as inspection planning, and
route planning with different road types. We solve the problems using
state-of-the-art MOS algorithms after properly extending their core operations,
and provide empirical evidence that they outperform by orders of magnitude the
vanilla versions of the algorithms applied to the same problems but without
objective aggregation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Rising energy impact of ML/AI and reliance on estimation tools with simplifying assumptions; need empirical assessment of accuracy to ensure reliable, transparent sustainability metrics.

Method: Develop a validation framework; compare static and dynamic energy estimation approaches against ground-truth measurements across hundreds of AI experiments; analyze estimation inaccuracies and derive insights; provide code to extend validation to other domains/tools.

Result: Estimation methods exhibit errors up to 40%; energy demand trends generally align with actual consumption; the work validates widely used tools and offers actionable guidelines to improve accuracy; releases open-source code for broader validation.

Conclusion: Current ML energy estimation tools are imperfect but actionable improvements are possible; the study contributes empirical evidence, methodological guidelines, and open-source resources to advance resource-aware ML/AI sustainability.

Abstract: Although machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) present
fascinating opportunities for innovation, their rapid development is also
significantly impacting our environment. In response to growing
resource-awareness in the field, quantification tools such as the ML Emissions
Calculator and CodeCarbon were developed to estimate the energy consumption and
carbon emissions of running AI models. They are easy to incorporate into AI
projects, however also make pragmatic assumptions and neglect important
factors, raising the question of estimation accuracy. This study systematically
evaluates the reliability of static and dynamic energy estimation approaches
through comparisons with ground-truth measurements across hundreds of AI
experiments. Based on the proposed validation framework, investigative insights
into AI energy demand and estimation inaccuracies are provided. While generally
following the patterns of AI energy consumption, the established estimation
approaches are shown to consistently make errors of up to 40%. By providing
empirical evidence on energy estimation quality and errors, this study
establishes transparency and validates widely used tools for sustainable AI
development. It moreover formulates guidelines for improving the
state-of-the-art and offers code for extending the validation to other domains
and tools, thus making important contributions to resource-aware ML and AI
sustainability research.

*Seoyoung Lee,Seonbin Yoon,Seongbeen Lee,Hyesoo Kim,Joo Yong Sim*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Two-level planning with task mining (Log2Plan) improves GUI automation robustness and long-horizon task handling by mapping user commands to a structured task dictionary, grounding high-level plans into low-level actions via real-time GUI context, and personalizing via behavior-log mining; evaluated on 200 real-world tasks with strong improvements in success rate and speed, including over 60% success on long sequences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM/VLM planners suffer from brittle generalization, high latency, and limited long-horizon coherence due to reliance on single-shot reasoning or static plans. GUI changes and complex multi-step tasks degrade performance. There is a need for robust, adaptable GUI automation that can generalize and personalize.

Method: A structured two-level planning framework: (1) high-level planning by mapping user commands to a structured task dictionary, enabling consistent, generalizable automation; (2) task mining from user behavior logs to personalize and reuse patterns; (3) grounding of high-level plans into low-level action sequences by interpreting real-time GUI context, ensuring robust execution across interfaces.

Result: Evaluated on 200 real-world tasks, Log2Plan shows significant improvements in task success rate and execution time, maintaining over 60% success on long-horizon sequences, demonstrating robustness in multi-step workflows.

Conclusion: Log2Plan offers a robust, adaptable GUI automation solution by combining structured two-level planning with data-driven task mining, improving generalization, personalization, and efficiency across varying interfaces and complex tasks.

Abstract: GUI task automation streamlines repetitive tasks, but existing LLM or
VLM-based planner-executor agents suffer from brittle generalization, high
latency, and limited long-horizon coherence. Their reliance on single-shot
reasoning or static plans makes them fragile under UI changes or complex tasks.
Log2Plan addresses these limitations by combining a structured two-level
planning framework with a task mining approach over user behavior logs,
enabling robust and adaptable GUI automation. Log2Plan constructs high-level
plans by mapping user commands to a structured task dictionary, enabling
consistent and generalizable automation. To support personalization and reuse,
it employs a task mining approach from user behavior logs that identifies
user-specific patterns. These high-level plans are then grounded into low-level
action sequences by interpreting real-time GUI context, ensuring robust
execution across varying interfaces. We evaluated Log2Plan on 200 real-world
tasks, demonstrating significant improvements in task success rate and
execution time. Notably, it maintains over 60.0% success rate even on
long-horizon task sequences, highlighting its robustness in complex, multi-step
workflows.

*Simone Lionetti,Fabian Gröger,Philippe Gottfrois,Alvaro Gonzalez-Jimenez,Ludovic Amruthalingam,Alexander A. Navarini,Marc Pouly*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Uncertainty-aware evaluation for annotation distributions improves ML assessment; use probabilistic metrics and release raw annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clinical datasets have uncertain labels due to disagreement and uneven confidence; majority voting hides variability and can misrank models.

Method: Adopts probabilistic metrics operating on label distributions, applicable regardless of how distributions are generated (counting, confidence ratings, probabilistic models); closed-form, linear-time after sorting by model score.

Result: In simple medical imaging experiments, accounting for annotation confidence significantly changes model rankings.

Conclusion: Encourage uncertainty-aware evaluation and release raw annotations to better reflect clinical data.

Abstract: Clinical dataset labels are rarely certain as annotators disagree and
confidence is not uniform across cases. Typical aggregation procedures, such as
majority voting, obscure this variability. In simple experiments on medical
imaging benchmarks, accounting for the confidence in binary labels
significantly impacts model rankings. We therefore argue that machine-learning
evaluations should explicitly account for annotation uncertainty using
probabilistic metrics that directly operate on distributions. These metrics can
be applied independently of the annotations' generating process, whether
modeled by simple counting, subjective confidence ratings, or probabilistic
response models. They are also computationally lightweight, as closed-form
expressions have linear-time implementations once examples are sorted by model
score. We thus urge the community to release raw annotations for datasets and
to adopt uncertainty-aware evaluation so that performance estimates may better
reflect clinical data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess and benchmark how LLMs can contribute to specialized combinatorial optimization tasks, and to combine LLM-driven heuristic generation with evolutionary refinement to improve solution quality and efficiency.

Method: Introduce a systematic framework that couples LLMs with evolutionary algorithms to generate and iteratively refine heuristics for 2D bin-packing; compare LLM-generated heuristics against Finite First-Fit and Hybrid First-Fit; conduct experiments with GPT-4o.

Result: LLMs can produce more efficient heuristics with fewer computational resources; GPT-4o achieves optimal solutions within two iterations, reducing average bins from 16 to 15 and improving space utilization from 0.76–0.78 to 0.83.

Conclusion: This work advances understanding of evaluating LLMs in specialized domains, offers benchmarks for LLM performance in combinatorial optimization, and demonstrates potential for LLM-assisted heuristic design with resource efficiency.

Abstract: This paper presents an evaluation framework for assessing Large Language
Models' (LLMs) capabilities in combinatorial optimization, specifically
addressing the 2D bin-packing problem. We introduce a systematic methodology
that combines LLMs with evolutionary algorithms to generate and refine
heuristic solutions iteratively. Through comprehensive experiments comparing
LLM generated heuristics against traditional approaches (Finite First-Fit and
Hybrid First-Fit), we demonstrate that LLMs can produce more efficient
solutions while requiring fewer computational resources. Our evaluation reveals
that GPT-4o achieves optimal solutions within two iterations, reducing average
bin usage from 16 to 15 bins while improving space utilization from 0.76-0.78
to 0.83. This work contributes to understanding LLM evaluation in specialized
domains and establishes benchmarks for assessing LLM performance in
combinatorial optimization tasks.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Introduces InfiMed-Foundation-1.7B and 4B, medical-specific multimodal LLMs built with a five-dimensional data quality framework and efficient training techniques, achieving state-of-the-art medical VQA and diagnostic performance on MedEvalKit.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: General-purpose multimodal LLMs struggle with domain-specific medical knowledge, hallucinations, and high training costs. There is a need for curated, high-quality medical multimodal data and efficient learning strategies to enable reliable AI in healthcare.

Method: Curates high-quality multimodal datasets using a five-dimensional quality framework; combines high-quality general-purpose and medical data for training; employs low-to-high image resolution and multimodal sequence packing to improve training efficiency; applies a three-stage supervised fine-tuning process to extract complex medical knowledge.

Result: On MedEvalKit, InfiMed-Foundation-1.7B outperforms Qwen2.5VL-3B, and InfiMed-Foundation-4B surpasses HuatuoGPT-V-7B and MedGemma-27B-IT, achieving superior performance in medical visual QA and diagnostic tasks; InfiMed-Foundation-4B is publicly available on HuggingFace.

Conclusion: The work demonstrates that careful data quality control, optimized training efficiency, and domain-specific knowledge extraction can yield reliable medical multimodal LLMs, advancing AI-assisted healthcare; the InfiMed-Foundation models open pathways for practical clinical deployments.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown remarkable potential in
various domains, yet their application in the medical field is hindered by
several challenges. General-purpose MLLMs often lack the specialized knowledge
required for medical tasks, leading to uncertain or hallucinatory responses.
Knowledge distillation from advanced models struggles to capture
domain-specific expertise in radiology and pharmacology. Additionally, the
computational cost of continual pretraining with large-scale medical data poses
significant efficiency challenges. To address these issues, we propose
InfiMed-Foundation-1.7B and InfiMed-Foundation-4B, two medical-specific MLLMs
designed to deliver state-of-the-art performance in medical applications. We
combined high-quality general-purpose and medical multimodal data and proposed
a novel five-dimensional quality assessment framework to curate high-quality
multimodal medical datasets. We employ low-to-high image resolution and
multimodal sequence packing to enhance training efficiency, enabling the
integration of extensive medical data. Furthermore, a three-stage supervised
fine-tuning process ensures effective knowledge extraction for complex medical
tasks. Evaluated on the MedEvalKit framework, InfiMed-Foundation-1.7B
outperforms Qwen2.5VL-3B, while InfiMed-Foundation-4B surpasses HuatuoGPT-V-7B
and MedGemma-27B-IT, demonstrating superior performance in medical visual
question answering and diagnostic tasks. By addressing key challenges in data
quality, training efficiency, and domain-specific knowledge extraction, our
work paves the way for more reliable and effective AI-driven solutions in

### [423] [Structured Sparse Transition Matrices to Enable State Tracking in State-Space Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22284)
*Aleksandar Terzić,Nicolas Menet,Michael Hersche,Thomas Hofmann,Abbas Rahimi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PD-SSM introduces a structured sparse transition by factorizing the transition matrix as a column-one-hot matrix P times a complex diagonal D, achieving FSA-like expressivity with linear cost and strong guarantees, outperforming other SSMs on FSA tasks and matching neural CDEs on time-series, with code released.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Unstructured/dense transition matrices offer maximal expressivity but incur high compute/memory costs, limiting scalability; existing structured SSMs lack guaranteed ability to emulate finite-state automata (FSA) efficiently. A structured, cost-efficient approach that can track FSA states is needed.

Method: Parametrize the transition matrix as M = P D, where P is a column one-hot matrix and D is complex-valued diagonal. This yields linear-cost parallel scans, BIBO-stable dynamics, and the ability to emulate any N-state FSA with one layer of dimension N and a linear readout of size N×N. The approach is integrated into PD-SSM and evaluated in FSA state-tracking tasks and a hybrid Transformer-SSM architecture.

Result: PD-SSM significantly outperforms a wide collection of modern SSM variants on FSA state-tracking tasks. On multiclass time-series classification, performance is comparable to neural controlled differential equations. When integrated into a hybrid Transformer-SSM, the model can effectively track the states of a complex FSA encoded by variable-length English sentences.

Conclusion: PD-SSM delivers expressivity close to unstructured transitions with costs comparable to diagonal SSMs, backed by theoretical guarantees (BIBO stability, FSA emulation with dimension-N state, N×N readout) and strong empirical results across FSA and time-series tasks; code is publicly available.

Abstract: Modern state-space models (SSMs) often utilize transition matrices which
enable efficient computation but pose restrictions on the model's expressivity,
as measured in terms of the ability to emulate finite-state automata (FSA).
While unstructured transition matrices are optimal in terms of expressivity,
they come at a prohibitively high compute and memory cost even for moderate
state sizes. We propose a structured sparse parametrization of transition
matrices in SSMs that enables FSA state tracking with optimal state size and
depth, while keeping the computational cost of the recurrence comparable to
that of diagonal SSMs. Our method, PD-SSM, parametrizes the transition matrix
as the product of a column one-hot matrix ($P$) and a complex-valued diagonal
matrix ($D$). Consequently, the computational cost of parallel scans scales
linearly with the state size. Theoretically, the model is BIBO-stable and can
emulate any $N$-state FSA with one layer of dimension $N$ and a linear readout
of size $N \times N$, significantly improving on all current structured SSM
guarantees. Experimentally, the model significantly outperforms a wide
collection of modern SSM variants on various FSA state tracking tasks. On
multiclass time-series classification, the performance is comparable to that of
neural controlled differential equations, a paradigm explicitly built for
time-series analysis. Finally, we integrate PD-SSM into a hybrid
Transformer-SSM architecture and demonstrate that the model can effectively
track the states of a complex FSA in which transitions are encoded as a set of
variable-length English sentences. The code is available at

### [424] [Large Language Models as Nondeterministic Causal Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22297)
*Sander Beckers*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Presents a semantics-based, black-box counterfactual framework for LLMs, arguing that prior methods misinterpret LLMs and proposing a simpler, intended-semantics approach via nondeterministic causal models; discusses how both approaches relate.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Explain, evaluate, and compare LLM behavior through counterfactuals; address ambiguity in existing methods that modify sampling or treat LLMs deterministically; require a model-agnostic, semantics-aligned framework.

Method: Represent LLMs as nondeterministic causal models capturing intended semantics; propose a simpler counterfactual generation method that does not rely on altering the model or its internal implementation; provide theoretical grounding linking this method with prior work.

Result: A theoretical foundation and framework showing the relationship between existing and proposed methods; enables publication-level reasoning and lays groundwork for application-specific counterfactuals; no experimental results are reported in the abstract.

Conclusion: Semantics-based counterfactuals offer direct applicability to any black-box LLM and facilitate future methods for explanation, evaluation, and comparison tailored to particular objectives.

Abstract: Recent work by Chatzi et al. and Ravfogel et al. has developed, for the first
time, a method for generating counterfactuals of probabilistic Large Language
Models. Such counterfactuals tell us what would - or might - have been the
output of an LLM if some factual prompt ${\bf x}$ had been ${\bf x}^*$ instead.
The ability to generate such counterfactuals is an important necessary step
towards explaining, evaluating, and comparing, the behavior of LLMs. I argue,
however, that the existing method rests on an ambiguous interpretation of LLMs:
it does not interpret LLMs literally, for the method involves the assumption
that one can change the implementation of an LLM's sampling process without
changing the LLM itself, nor does it interpret LLMs as intended, for the method
involves explicitly representing a nondeterministic LLM as a deterministic
causal model. I here present a much simpler method for generating
counterfactuals that is based on an LLM's intended interpretation by
representing it as a nondeterministic causal model instead. The advantage of my
simpler method is that it is directly applicable to any black-box LLM without
modification, as it is agnostic to any implementation details. The advantage of
the existing method, on the other hand, is that it directly implements the
generation of a specific type of counterfactuals that is useful for certain
purposes, but not for others. I clarify how both methods relate by offering a
theoretical foundation for reasoning about counterfactuals in LLMs based on
their intended semantics, thereby laying the groundwork for novel
application-specific methods for generating counterfactuals.

*Hieu Tran,Zonghai Yao,Nguyen Luong Tran,Zhichao Yang,Feiyun Ouyang,Shuo Han,Razieh Rahimi,Hong Yu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PRIME is a dual-process, multi-agent reasoning framework for LLMs that blends fast System 1 thinking with a deliberate System 2 pipeline. It starts with a Quick Thinking Agent and, upon uncertainty, engages a specialized, modular System 2 chain (planning, hypothesis generation, retrieval, information integration, decision-making). Evaluated on LLaMA 3 and competitive with GPT-4/4o on multi-hop, knowledge-grounded tasks, PRIME aims to improve efficiency and accuracy and scale reasoning in open-source models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of single-path reasoning in LLMs by mimicking human cognition: fast but error-prone intuition (System 1) and slow, structured reasoning (System 2). The goal is to enhance efficiency and accuracy, especially for knowledge-intensive, multi-hop tasks, and to empower open-source models to approach closed-source performance.

Method: Propose PRIME, a multi-agent architecture where a Quick Thinking Agent (System 1) generates an initial answer. If uncertainty is detected, a structured System 2 reasoning pipeline is activated, composed of specialized agents for planning, hypothesis generation, retrieval, information integration, and decision-making. The framework dynamically integrates outputs from these agents and evaluates results. Experiments with LLaMA 3 models compare PRIME against state-of-the-art closed models (GPT-4, GPT-4o) on benchmarks requiring multi-hop and knowledge grounding.

Result: PRIME enables open-source LLMs to perform competitively with GPT-4 and GPT-4o on multi-hop, knowledge-grounded benchmarks. The multi-agent Pipeline improves both efficiency and accuracy in complex reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: A scalable, human-cognition-inspired framework that effectively integrates fast and slow reasoning to enhance knowledge-intensive tasks in LLMs, narrowing the gap between open-source and closed-source models and offering a practical path for improved reasoning in real-world domains.

Abstract: Inspired by the dual-process theory of human cognition from \textit{Thinking,
Fast and Slow}, we introduce \textbf{PRIME} (Planning and Retrieval-Integrated
Memory for Enhanced Reasoning), a multi-agent reasoning framework that
dynamically integrates \textbf{System 1} (fast, intuitive thinking) and
\textbf{System 2} (slow, deliberate thinking). PRIME first employs a Quick
Thinking Agent (System 1) to generate a rapid answer; if uncertainty is
detected, it then triggers a structured System 2 reasoning pipeline composed of
specialized agents for \textit{planning}, \textit{hypothesis generation},
\textit{retrieval}, \textit{information integration}, and
\textit{decision-making}. This multi-agent design faithfully mimics human
cognitive processes and enhances both efficiency and accuracy. Experimental
results with LLaMA 3 models demonstrate that PRIME enables open-source LLMs to
perform competitively with state-of-the-art closed-source models like GPT-4 and
GPT-4o on benchmarks requiring multi-hop and knowledge-grounded reasoning. This
research establishes PRIME as a scalable solution for improving LLMs in domains
requiring complex, knowledge-intensive reasoning.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A benchmark, SeekBench, assesses epistemic competence of LLM search agents via step-level traces, using 190 expert traces and 1.8k+ steps with evidence annotations to analyze grounding, adaptive search reformulation, and calibration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses a gap where evaluating final answer accuracy misses how agents reason with external evidence; calls for step-level analysis of epistemic competence in LLM search agents.

Method: SeekBench comprises 190 expert-annotated traces with over 1,800 response steps from LLM search agents; each step annotated for grounding in observed evidence, adaptive reformulation of searches after low-quality results, and calibration about sufficiency of current evidence to answer.

Result: Introduces SeekBench as the first benchmark for epistemic competence; provides a dataset and annotation scheme enabling granular analysis of reasoning grounded in evidence, adaptive search behavior, and evidence sufficiency calibration.

Conclusion: SeekBench offers a framework to diagnose and improve epistemic aspects of LLM search agents and establishes a standard for evaluating their evidence-grounded reasoning and search strategies.

Abstract: Recent work has explored training Large Language Model (LLM) search agents
with reinforcement learning (RL) for open-domain question answering (QA).
However, most evaluations focus solely on final answer accuracy, overlooking
how these agents reason with and act on external evidence. We introduce
SeekBench, the first benchmark for evaluating the \textit{epistemic competence}
of LLM search agents through step-level analysis of their response traces.
SeekBench comprises 190 expert-annotated traces with over 1,800 response steps
generated by LLM search agents, each enriched with evidence annotations for
granular analysis of whether agents (1) generate reasoning steps grounded in
observed evidence, (2) adaptively reformulate searches to recover from
low-quality results, and (3) have proper calibration to correctly assess
whether the current evidence is sufficient for providing an answer.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: EMMA combines DreamTransfer and AdaMix to generate multi-view, geometrically faithful embodied manipulation videos and reweight training on hard samples, enabling VLA policy generalization to unseen objects and domains with substantial gains, including zero-shot real-world tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Collecting large-scale real robot manipulation data is costly and time-consuming, hindering robust generalization of vision-language-action (VLA) policies across diverse appearances and environments.

Method: DreamTransfer is a diffusion Transformer-based video generator that yields multi-view-consistent, geometrically grounded embodied manipulation videos with text-controlled edits to foreground, background, and lighting while preserving 3D structure. The framework mixes real and generated data for training, and AdaMix reweights training batches to emphasize perceptually or kinematically challenging samples (hard-sample aware).

Result: DreamTransfer-produced videos exceed prior methods in multi-view consistency, geometric fidelity, and text-conditioning accuracy. VLA policies trained with generated data generalize to unseen object categories and novel visual domains using only demonstrations from a single appearance. In zero-shot real-world tasks, the approach yields over 200% relative performance gain compared with real data alone, with an additional ~13% improvement from AdaMix.

Conclusion: The EMMA framework demonstrates a practical, data-efficient path to robust VLA generalization, combining synthetic data generation with hard-sample–aware training to enable strong zero-shot transfer and improved performance with limited real data.

Abstract: Vision-language-action (VLA) models increasingly rely on diverse training
data to achieve robust generalization. However, collecting large-scale
real-world robot manipulation data across varied object appearances and
environmental conditions remains prohibitively time-consuming and expensive. To
overcome this bottleneck, we propose Embodied Manipulation Media Adaptation
(EMMA), a VLA policy enhancement framework that integrates a generative data
engine with an effective training pipeline. We introduce DreamTransfer, a
diffusion Transformer-based framework for generating multi-view consistent,
geometrically grounded embodied manipulation videos. DreamTransfer enables
text-controlled visual editing of robot videos, transforming foreground,
background, and lighting conditions without compromising 3D structure or
geometrical plausibility. Furthermore, we explore hybrid training with real and
generated data, and introduce AdaMix, a hard-sample-aware training strategy
that dynamically reweights training batches to focus optimization on
perceptually or kinematically challenging samples. Extensive experiments show
that videos generated by DreamTransfer significantly outperform prior video
generation methods in multi-view consistency, geometric fidelity, and
text-conditioning accuracy. Crucially, VLAs trained with generated data enable
robots to generalize to unseen object categories and novel visual domains using
only demonstrations from a single appearance. In real-world robotic
manipulation tasks with zero-shot visual domains, our approach achieves over a
200% relative performance gain compared to training on real data alone, and
further improves by 13% with AdaMix, demonstrating its effectiveness in
boosting policy generalization.

*Nikhil Baid,Hannah Erlebach,Paul Hellegouarch,Frederico Wieser*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ASAL++ uses multimodal foundation models to guide open-ended artificial life search; introduces EST and ETT strategies; shows EST increases novelty, ETT improves coherence; tested on Lenia with Gemma-3.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome static or single-prompt evolution in ALife search and leverage FMs to autonomously propose targets from simulation history, enabling more open-ended discovery.

Method: Two strategies: EST evolves to match one new prompt per iteration; ETT evolves to match the entire sequence of prompts; uses a second FM to generate targets based on visual history; experiments in Lenia with Gemma-3.

Result: EST yields greater visual novelty; ETT yields more coherent, interpretable evolutionary trajectories; demonstrates potential for FM-driven ALife discovery.

Conclusion: ASAL++ demonstrates a path toward more open-ended FM-guided ALife and sets groundwork for future exploration of multimodal prompts and temporal target evolution.

Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) have recently opened up new frontiers in the field of
artificial life (ALife) by providing powerful tools to automate search through
ALife simulations. Previous work aligns ALife simulations with natural language
target prompts using vision-language models (VLMs). We build on Automated
Search for Artificial Life (ASAL) by introducing ASAL++, a method for
open-ended-like search guided by multimodal FMs. We use a second FM to propose
new evolutionary targets based on a simulation's visual history. This induces
an evolutionary trajectory with increasingly complex targets.
  We explore two strategies: (1) evolving a simulation to match a single new
prompt at each iteration (Evolved Supervised Targets: EST) and (2) evolving a
simulation to match the entire sequence of generated prompts (Evolved Temporal
Targets: ETT). We test our method empirically in the Lenia substrate using
Gemma-3 to propose evolutionary targets, and show that EST promotes greater
visual novelty, while ETT fosters more coherent and interpretable evolutionary
sequences.
  Our results suggest that ASAL++ points towards new directions for FM-driven
ALife discovery with open-ended characteristics.

### [429] [GeoSketch: A Neural-Symbolic Approach to Geometric Multimodal Reasoning with Auxiliary Line Construction and Affine Transformation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22460)
*Shichao Weng,Zhiqiang Wang,Yuhua Zhou,Rui Lu,Ting Liu,Zhiyang Teng,Xiaozhang Liu,Hanmeng Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A neural-symbolic agent GeoSketch enables dynamic geometric problem solving by interactive perception, symbolic reasoning, and executable actions, trained with supervised trajectories and RL, evaluated on a GeoSketch Benchmark; outperforms static perception baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of dynamic visuospatial manipulation in Multimodal LLMs when solving geometry problems; static diagrams hinder reasoning; a need for interactive construction and verification.

Method: Three-module architecture: (1) Perception converts diagrams into structured logic forms; (2) Symbolic Reasoning applies geometric theorems to decide the next deductive step; (3) Sketch Action executes operations (e.g., draw auxiliary lines, apply affine transforms) and updates the diagram in a closed loop. Training uses a two-stage pipeline: supervised fine-tuning on 2,000 symbolic trajectories followed by reinforcement learning with dense symbolic rewards.

Result: GeoSketch significantly improves stepwise reasoning accuracy and problem-solving success over static perception methods on the GeoSketch Benchmark (390 problems). Demonstrates capability for dynamic interaction and verifiable reasoning.

Conclusion: Unifies hierarchical decision-making, executable visual actions, and symbolic verification to advance multimodal reasoning from static interpretation to dynamic, verifiable interaction, establishing a foundation for solving complex visuospatial problems.

Abstract: Geometric Problem Solving (GPS) poses a unique challenge for Multimodal Large
Language Models (MLLMs), requiring not only the joint interpretation of text
and diagrams but also iterative visuospatial reasoning. While existing
approaches process diagrams as static images, they lack the capacity for
dynamic manipulation - a core aspect of human geometric reasoning involving
auxiliary line construction and affine transformations. We present GeoSketch, a
neural-symbolic framework that recasts geometric reasoning as an interactive
perception-reasoning-action loop. GeoSketch integrates: (1) a Perception module
that abstracts diagrams into structured logic forms, (2) a Symbolic Reasoning
module that applies geometric theorems to decide the next deductive step, and
(3) a Sketch Action module that executes operations such as drawing auxiliary
lines or applying transformations, thereby updating the diagram in a closed
loop. To train this agent, we develop a two-stage pipeline: supervised
fine-tuning on 2,000 symbolic-curated trajectories followed by reinforcement
learning with dense, symbolic rewards to enhance robustness and strategic
exploration. To evaluate this paradigm, we introduce the GeoSketch Benchmark, a
high-quality set of 390 geometry problems requiring auxiliary construction or
affine transformations. Experiments on strong MLLM baselines demonstrate that
GeoSketch significantly improves stepwise reasoning accuracy and
problem-solving success over static perception methods. By unifying
hierarchical decision-making, executable visual actions, and symbolic
verification, GeoSketch advances multimodal reasoning from static
interpretation to dynamic, verifiable interaction, establishing a new
foundation for solving complex visuospatial problems.

*Chenglin Yu,Yang Yu,Songmiao Wang,Yucheng Wang,Yifan Yang,Jinjia Li,Ming Li,Hongxia Yang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: InfiAgent is a pyramid-like DAG-based multi-agent framework that generalizes the agent-as-a-tool concept, enabling automatic decomposition, dual auditing, routing, and self-evolution, with parallel atomic tasks; it shows improved performance and real-world productivity (e.g., InfiHelper producing IEEE-recognized papers).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the heavy manual design, crafted prompts, and iterative tuning required for LLM agents, which hinder scalability and cost-effectiveness across industries.

Method: Presents InfiAgent with a pyramid-like DAG architecture that automates agent-as-a-tool decomposition into hierarchical multi-agent systems, adds a dual-audit mechanism for quality and stability, introduces an agent routing function for efficient task-agent matching, enables self-evolution of the DAG based on new tasks or performance gaps, and adopts atomic task design to enable parallelism.

Result: Benchmark evaluations show a 9.9% performance gain over ADAS (a similar auto-generated agent framework). A case study of the AI research assistant InfiHelper demonstrates it can generate scientific papers that received recognition from human reviewers at top-tier IEEE conferences.

Conclusion: InfiAgent evolves into a versatile, pyramid-like multi-agent system capable of solving a wide range of problems across domains, reducing manual handcrafting and enhancing scalability and efficiency.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents have demonstrated remarkable capabilities
in organizing and executing complex tasks, and many such agents are now widely
used in various application scenarios. However, developing these agents
requires carefully designed workflows, carefully crafted prompts, and iterative
tuning, which requires LLM techniques and domain-specific expertise. These
hand-crafted limitations hinder the scalability and cost-effectiveness of LLM
agents across a wide range of industries. To address these challenges, we
propose \textbf{InfiAgent}, a Pyramid-like DAG-based Multi-Agent Framework that
can be applied to \textbf{infi}nite scenarios, which introduces several key
innovations: a generalized "agent-as-a-tool" mechanism that automatically
decomposes complex agents into hierarchical multi-agent systems; a dual-audit
mechanism that ensures the quality and stability of task completion; an agent
routing function that enables efficient task-agent matching; and an agent
self-evolution mechanism that autonomously restructures the agent DAG based on
new tasks, poor performance, or optimization opportunities. Furthermore,
InfiAgent's atomic task design supports agent parallelism, significantly
improving execution efficiency. This framework evolves into a versatile
pyramid-like multi-agent system capable of solving a wide range of problems.
Evaluations on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that InfiAgent achieves 9.9\%
higher performance compared to ADAS (similar auto-generated agent framework),
while a case study of the AI research assistant InfiHelper shows that it
generates scientific papers that have received recognition from human reviewers
at top-tier IEEE conferences.

### [431] [Estimating the Empowerment of Language Model Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22504)
*Jinyeop Song,Jeff Gore,Max Kleiman-Weiner*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Empowerment, defined as the mutual information between an LM agent’s actions and future states, is proposed as a scalable, open-ended evaluation metric for LM agents. The paper introduces EELMA to estimate effective empowerment from multi-turn interactions and validates it in language games and web-browsing tasks, showing empowerment correlates with task performance and highlights pivotal high-empowerment moments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of benchmark-centric evaluations for capable LM agents with tool access, offering a scalable, general-purpose metric that captures broad, open-ended capabilities without hand-crafted tasks.

Method: Introduce EELMA (Estimating Empowerment of Language Model Agents) to approximate effective empowerment from multi-turn text interactions; validate on language games and large-scale web-browsing scenarios; analyze how environment complexity, chain-of-thought, model scale, and memory length affect empowerment; identify high-empowerment states as pivotal moments.

Result: Empowerment strongly correlates with average task performance; environmental complexity and agentic factors (chain-of-thought, model scale, memory length) modulate empowerment; high-empowerment states are often pivotal moments for general capabilities.

Conclusion: Empowerment is a compelling general-purpose metric for evaluating and monitoring LM agents in complex, open-ended settings, enabling scalable assessment beyond fixed benchmarks.

Abstract: As language model (LM) agents become more capable and gain broader access to
real-world tools, there is a growing need for scalable evaluation frameworks of
agentic capability. However, conventional benchmark-centric evaluations are
costly to design and require human designers to come up with valid tasks that
translate into insights about general model capabilities. In this work, we
propose information-theoretic evaluation based on empowerment, the mutual
information between an agent's actions and future states, as an open-ended
method for evaluating LM agents. We introduce EELMA (Estimating Empowerment of
Language Model Agents), an algorithm for approximating effective empowerment
from multi-turn text interactions. We validate EELMA on both language games and
scaled-up realistic web-browsing scenarios. We find that empowerment strongly
correlates with average task performance, characterize the impact of
environmental complexity and agentic factors such as chain-of-thought, model
scale, and memory length on estimated empowerment, and that high empowerment
states and actions are often pivotal moments for general capabilities.
Together, these results demonstrate empowerment as an appealing general-purpose
metric for evaluating and monitoring LM agents in complex, open-ended settings.

*Rakesh Thakur,Shivaansh Kaushik,Gauri Chopra,Harsh Rohilla*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TrueGradeAI is an AI-driven, handwriting-preserving digital exam framework that uses transformer-based OCR and retrieval-augmented evaluation to provide explainable, auditable scoring while reducing paper use, bias, and delays.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional paper-based assessments suffer from excessive paper consumption, logistics, grading delays, and evaluator bias. There is a need for preserving natural handwriting, transparent scoring with evidence, bias mitigation, and auditable grading trails.

Method: Capture stylus handwriting on secure tablets; apply transformer-based OCR for transcription; use a retrieval-augmented pipeline that combines faculty solutions, cache layers, and external references; employ a large language model to assign scores with explicit, evidence-linked reasoning; provide explainable automation and auditable grading trails.

Result: Conceptual framework demonstrating scalable, transparent evaluation with auditable trails, reduced environmental impact, faster feedback, and a growing reusable knowledge base; claims improved fairness and bias mitigation.

Conclusion: The framework combines handwriting preservation with scalable, auditable scoring to reduce environmental costs, accelerate feedback, and promote fair assessment.

Abstract: This paper introduces TrueGradeAI, an AI-driven digital examination framework
designed to overcome the shortcomings of traditional paper-based assessments,
including excessive paper usage, logistical complexity, grading delays, and
evaluator bias. The system preserves natural handwriting by capturing stylus
input on secure tablets and applying transformer-based optical character
recognition for transcription. Evaluation is conducted through a
retrieval-augmented pipeline that integrates faculty solutions, cache layers,
and external references, enabling a large language model to assign scores with
explicit, evidence-linked reasoning. Unlike prior tablet-based exam systems
that primarily digitize responses, TrueGradeAI advances the field by
incorporating explainable automation, bias mitigation, and auditable grading
trails. By uniting handwriting preservation with scalable and transparent
evaluation, the framework reduces environmental costs, accelerates feedback
cycles, and progressively builds a reusable knowledge base, while actively
working to mitigate grading bias and ensure fairness in assessment.

### [433] [REMA: A Unified Reasoning Manifold Framework for Interpreting Large Language Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22518)
*Bo Li,Guanzhi Deng,Ronghao Chen,Junrong Yue,Shuo Zhang,Qinghua Zhao,Linqi Song,Lijie Wen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes a geometric view of LLM reasoning with a low-dimensional Reasoning Manifold and a framework (REMA) to diagnose failures by measuring how erroneous internal representations deviate from the manifold of correct reasoning, localizing where the reasoning chain diverges across layers and showing separability between correct and erroneous samples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Interpreting complex LLM reasoning and its failure modes remains challenging. A measurable, geometry-based signal could reveal how internal representations underlie successful vs. failed reasoning and help diagnose and fix mistakes.

Method: Define a latent, low-dimensional Reasoning Manifold from correct reasoning representations. Build REMA to quantify deviations of erroneous representations using their k-nearest-neighbors distance to the correct-manifold. Localize divergence points by tracking this deviation across model layers and comparing to baseline fluctuations from correct representations. Validate across diverse language and multimodal models and tasks.

Result: Demonstrates that the reasoning manifold is low-dimensional and that erroneous vs. correct representations are highly separable. REMA effectively analyzes the origins of reasoning failures by providing a unified geometric failure signal and a locus for divergence within the model.

Conclusion: Connects abstract reasoning failures to measurable geometric deviations, offering a new diagnostic paradigm for understanding and diagnosing internal computational processes in black-box models, with potential implications for debugging, evaluation, and improvement of LLM reasoning.

Abstract: Understanding how Large Language Models (LLMs) perform complex reasoning and
their failure mechanisms is a challenge in interpretability research. To
provide a measurable geometric analysis perspective, we define the concept of
the Reasoning Manifold, a latent low-dimensional geometric structure formed by
the internal representations corresponding to all correctly reasoned
generations. This structure can be conceptualized as the embodiment of the
effective thinking paths that the model has learned to successfully solve a
given task. Based on this concept, we build REMA, a framework that explains the
origins of failures by quantitatively comparing the spatial relationships of
internal model representations corresponding to both erroneous and correct
reasoning samples. Specifically, REMA first quantifies the geometric deviation
of each erroneous representation by calculating its k-nearest neighbors
distance to the approximated manifold formed by correct representations,
thereby providing a unified failure signal. It then localizes the divergence
points where these deviations first become significant by tracking this
deviation metric across the model's layers and comparing it against a baseline
of internal fluctuations from correct representations, thus identifying where
the reasoning chain begins to go off-track. Our extensive experiments on
diverse language and multimodal models and tasks demonstrate the
low-dimensional nature of the reasoning manifold and the high separability
between erroneous and correct reasoning representations. The results also
validate the effectiveness of the REMA framework in analyzing the origins of
reasoning failures. This research connects abstract reasoning failures to
measurable geometric deviations in representations, providing new avenues for
in-depth understanding and diagnosis of the internal computational processes of
black-box models.

### [434] [The Emergence of Altruism in Large-Language-Model Agents Society](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22537)
*Haoyang Li,Xiao Jia,Zhanzhan Zhao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: First evidence of intrinsic heterogeneity in egoistic vs altruistic tendencies among LLM agents in a Schelling-like urban migration social dilemma; two archetypes emerge: Adaptive Egoists and Altruistic Optimizers; model choice should reflect intrinsic social action logic, not just reasoning power.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses a gap in understanding how altruism emerges in large-scale LLM-based social simulations and how social norms influence behavior.

Method: Schelling-variant urban migration model with over 200 LLM agents; explicit conflict between egoistic (personal utility) and altruistic (system utility) goals; Grounded Theory-inspired coding of agent reasoning; experiments including a social-norm message board.

Result: Identifies two archetypes: Adaptive Egoists (default to self-interest but become more altruistic under social norms) and Altruistic Optimizers (inherently prioritize collective welfare at personal cost); demonstrates intrinsic heterogeneity in LLM social tendencies; provides guidance on model selection for social simulations.

Conclusion: Modeling choice should reflect intrinsic social action logic: Adaptive Egoists may better simulate complex human societies, while Altruistic Optimizers suit pro-social or welfare-focused scenarios; normative messaging can steer egoists toward altruism, informing the design of social simulations.

Abstract: Leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) for social simulation is a frontier
in computational social science. Understanding the social logics these agents
embody is critical to this attempt. However, existing research has primarily
focused on cooperation in small-scale, task-oriented games, overlooking how
altruism, which means sacrificing self-interest for collective benefit, emerges
in large-scale agent societies. To address this gap, we introduce a
Schelling-variant urban migration model that creates a social dilemma,
compelling over 200 LLM agents to navigate an explicit conflict between
egoistic (personal utility) and altruistic (system utility) goals. Our central
finding is a fundamental difference in the social tendencies of LLMs. We
identify two distinct archetypes: "Adaptive Egoists", which default to
prioritizing self-interest but whose altruistic behaviors significantly
increase under the influence of a social norm-setting message board; and
"Altruistic Optimizers", which exhibit an inherent altruistic logic,
consistently prioritizing collective benefit even at a direct cost to
themselves. Furthermore, to qualitatively analyze the cognitive underpinnings
of these decisions, we introduce a method inspired by Grounded Theory to
systematically code agent reasoning. In summary, this research provides the
first evidence of intrinsic heterogeneity in the egoistic and altruistic
tendencies of different LLMs. We propose that for social simulation, model
selection is not merely a matter of choosing reasoning capability, but of
choosing an intrinsic social action logic. While "Adaptive Egoists" may offer a
more suitable choice for simulating complex human societies, "Altruistic
Optimizers" are better suited for modeling idealized pro-social actors or
scenarios where collective welfare is the primary consideration.

### [435] [StepORLM: A Self-Evolving Framework With Generative Process Supervision For Operations Research Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22558)
*Chenyu Zhou,Tianyi Xu,Jianghao Lin,Dongdong Ge*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: StepORLM introduces a co-evolving LLM framework for OR problems that uses a generative process reward model (GenPRM) and external solver verification to align policy via Weighted Direct Preference Optimization (W-DPO), achieving state-of-the-art results at 8B parameters and enabling GenPRM as a universal process verifier that boosts inference scaling for other models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses two core limitations in RL-based LLM supervision for OR: the credit assignment problem (correct final answers can reinforce flawed reasoning) and the myopic nature of conventional discriminative supervision that overlooks interdependent, multi-step modeling processes.

Method: A co-evolutionary loop where a policy model and a GenPRM iteratively improve each other. Dual feedback consists of definitive outcome-based verification from an external solver and holistic process evaluation from the GenPRM. The policy is aligned via Weighted Direct Preference Optimization (W-DPO) while the GenPRM is refined over time.

Result: The approach yields an 8B-parameter StepORLM that achieves state-of-the-art performance across six benchmarks, outperforming much larger generalist models, agentic methods, and specialized baselines. Additionally, the co-evolved GenPRM acts as a powerful and universally applicable process verifier, boosting inference scaling for StepORLM and other existing LLMs.

Conclusion: Co-evolving GenPRM provides a universal process verification capability and, together with the policy optimization loop, leads to strong performance on OR tasks and improved inference scalability across LLMs.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promising capabilities for solving
Operations Research (OR) problems. While reinforcement learning serves as a
powerful paradigm for LLM training on OR problems, existing works generally
face two key limitations. First, outcome reward suffers from the credit
assignment problem, where correct final answers can reinforce flawed reasoning.
Second, conventional discriminative process supervision is myopic, failing to
evaluate the interdependent steps of OR modeling holistically. To this end, we
introduce StepORLM, a novel self-evolving framework with generative process
supervision. At its core, StepORLM features a co-evolutionary loop where a
policy model and a generative process reward model (GenPRM) iteratively improve
on each other. This loop is driven by a dual-feedback mechanism: definitive,
outcome-based verification from an external solver, and nuanced, holistic
process evaluation from the GenPRM. The combined signal is used to align the
policy via Weighted Direct Preference Optimization (W-DPO) and simultaneously
refine the GenPRM. Our resulting 8B-parameter StepORLM establishes a new
state-of-the-art across six benchmarks, significantly outperforming vastly
larger generalist models, agentic methods, and specialized baselines. Moreover,
the co-evolved GenPRM is able to act as a powerful and universally applicable
process verifier, substantially boosting the inference scaling performance of
both our own model and other existing LLMs.

*Qi Mao,Tinghan Yang,Jiahao Li,Bin Li,Libiao Jin,Yan Lu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: UniMIC is a token-based multimodal interactive coding framework that replaces raw pixels/text with compact tokens to enable low-bitrate edge-cloud communication for large multimodal models, using transformer-based entropy models to reduce redundancy; achieves strong performance across text-to-image generation, inpainting, outpainting, and VQA at ultra-low bitrates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current codecs are optimized for unimodal, one-way communication and degrade in bidirectional, multimodal interactions between edge devices and cloud AI agents; there is a need for a unified, efficient communication medium that preserves LMM performance at low bitrates.

Method: Introduce UniMIC: a Unified token-based Multimodal Interactive Coding framework that transmits compact token representations instead of raw pixels or plain text. Enhance compression with lightweight Transformer-based entropy models with scenario-specific designs (generic, masked, and text-conditioned) to minimize inter-token redundancy; designed to be compatible with LMMs across tasks.

Result: Experiments on text-to-image generation, text-guided inpainting, outpainting, and visual question answering show substantial bitrate savings and robustness at ultra-low bitrates (<0.05 bpp) without degrading downstream task performance.

Conclusion: UniMIC presents a practical and forward-looking paradigm for next-generation multimodal interactive communication, effectively bridging edge devices and cloud AI agents.

Abstract: The rapid progress of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) and cloud-based AI
agents is transforming human-AI collaboration into bidirectional, multimodal
interaction. However, existing codecs remain optimized for unimodal, one-way
communication, resulting in repeated degradation under conventional
compress-transmit-reconstruct pipelines. To address this limitation, we propose
UniMIC, a Unified token-based Multimodal Interactive Coding framework that
bridges edge devices and cloud AI agents. Instead of transmitting raw pixels or
plain text, UniMIC employs compact tokenized representations as the
communication medium, enabling efficient low-bitrate transmission while
maintaining compatibility with LMMs. To further enhance compression,
lightweight Transformer-based entropy models with scenario-specific
designs-generic, masked, and text-conditioned-effectively minimize inter-token
redundancy. Extensive experiments on text-to-image generation, text-guided
inpainting, outpainting, and visual question answering show that UniMIC
achieves substantial bitrate savings and remains robust even at ultra-low
bitrates (<0.05bpp), without compromising downstream task performance. These
results establish UniMIC as a practical and forward-looking paradigm for
next-generation multimodal interactive communication.

### [437] [Dynamic Experts Search: Enhancing Reasoning in Mixture-of-Experts LLMs at Test Time](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22572)
*Yixuan Han,Fan Ma,Ruijie Quan,Yi Yang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Dynamic Experts Search (DES) enhances test-time scaling for MoE LLMs by controlling how many experts are activated during inference, introducing Dynamic MoE and Expert Configuration Inheritance to create diverse, stable reasoning trajectories without extra cost, leading to improved accuracy across math, code, and knowledge benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current test-time strategies focus on output-level sampling and overlook the potential benefits of architectural diversity. In MoE LLMs, activating different numbers of experts yields complementary solution sets with stable accuracy, suggesting a new architectural dimension for reasoning enhancement.

Method: DES combines two components: (1) Dynamic MoE, which allows explicit control of the number of active experts at inference time to generate diverse reasoning trajectories without additional cost; (2) Expert Configuration Inheritance, which keeps a consistent set of active experts within a reasoning path while allowing variation across runs to balance stability and diversity. The approach is evaluated across multiple MoE architectures, verifiers, and reasoning benchmarks (math, code, knowledge).

Result: DES consistently outperforms existing TTS baselines, improving accuracy and stability across tasks and architectures without incurring extra computational cost.

Conclusion: DES represents an architecture-aware test-time scaling strategy that leverages the flexible MoE structure to enhance reasoning, offering a practical and scalable path for improving LLM performance.

Abstract: Test-Time Scaling (TTS) enhances the reasoning ability of large language
models (LLMs) by allocating additional computation during inference. However,
existing approaches primarily rely on output-level sampling while overlooking
the role of model architecture. In mainstream Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) LLMs, we
observe that varying the number of activated experts yields complementary
solution sets with stable accuracy, revealing a new and underexplored source of
diversity. Motivated by this observation, we propose Dynamic Experts Search
(DES), a TTS strategy that elevates expert activation into a controllable
dimension of the search space. DES integrates two key components: (1) Dynamic
MoE, which enables direct control of expert counts during inference to generate
diverse reasoning trajectories without additional cost; and (2) Expert
Configuration Inheritance, which preserves consistent expert counts within a
reasoning path while varying them across runs, thereby balancing stability and
diversity throughout the search. Extensive experiments across MoE
architectures, verifiers and reasoning benchmarks (i.e., math, code and
knowledge) demonstrate that DES reliably outperforms TTS baselines, enhancing
accuracy and stability without additional cost. These results highlight DES as
a practical and scalable form of architecture-aware TTS, illustrating how
structural flexibility in modern LLMs can advance reasoning.

*Siwei Wang,Yifei Shen,Haoran Sun,Shi Feng,Shang-Hua Teng,Li Dong,Yaru Hao,Wei Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RL methods improve LLM planning but lack a solid theory. Using a graph-based abstraction, the paper analyzes policy gradient (PG) and Q-learning to reveal: SFT can create spurious co-occurrence solutions; RL aids planning mainly via exploration; PG suffers diversity collapse; Q-learning offers off-policy learning and diversity retention at convergence, but requires careful reward design to avoid reward hacking. Real-world validation on Blocksworld confirms these dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To uncover the theoretical basis, benefits, and limits of RL-enhanced planning in LLMs by comparing PG and Q-learning within a tractable graph-based framework, and to assess practical implications for real benchmarks.

Method: Develop a graph-based abstraction of planning tasks; perform theoretical analyses of policy gradient and Q-learning; examine factors such as exploration, diversity, and reward design; validate findings on the Blocksworld benchmark.

Result: SFT can introduce co-occurrence-based spurious solutions; RL improves planning mainly through exploration; PG experiences diversity collapse; Q-learning provides off-policy learning and preserves diversity at convergence; reward design is critical to prevent reward hacking; empirical results on Blocksworld align with the theory.

Conclusion: RL-guided planning in LLMs benefits from exploration and can be more robust under Q-learning than PG, but careful reward shaping is essential to avoid hacking; these effects generalize to real-world planning benchmarks, informing design of RL-based planning systems.

Abstract: Recent reinforcement learning (RL) methods have substantially enhanced the
planning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), yet the theoretical
basis for their effectiveness remains elusive. In this work, we investigate
RL's benefits and limitations through a tractable graph-based abstraction,
focusing on policy gradient (PG) and Q-learning methods. Our theoretical
analyses reveal that supervised fine-tuning (SFT) may introduce
co-occurrence-based spurious solutions, whereas RL achieves correct planning
primarily through exploration, underscoring exploration's role in enabling
better generalization. However, we also show that PG suffers from diversity
collapse, where output diversity decreases during training and persists even
after perfect accuracy is attained. By contrast, Q-learning provides two key
advantages: off-policy learning and diversity preservation at convergence. We
further demonstrate that careful reward design is necessary to prevent reward
hacking in Q-learning. Finally, applying our framework to the real-world
planning benchmark Blocksworld, we confirm that these behaviors manifest in
practice.
