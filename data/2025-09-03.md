### [2] [AMMKD: Adaptive Multimodal Multi-teacher Distillation for Lightweight Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00039)
*Yuqi Li,Chuanguang Yang,Junhao Dong,Zhengtao Yao,Haoyan Xu,Zeyu Dong,Hansheng Zeng,Zhulin An,Yingli Tian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AMMKD is a lightweight adaptive multi-teacher distillation framework for cross-modal retrieval, combining feature fusion, precomputed text features, KL scatter alignment, and dynamic teacher weighting to achieve strong performance with reduced model size.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable mobile-friendly image-text retrieval by addressing the large size and computational demands of state-of-the-art visual-language pretraining (VLP) models.

Method: A feature fusion network merges discriminative features from image and text modalities. Two CLIP teacher models are pre-trained; text features are pre-computed and stored as class vectors via the teacher text encoder to improve efficiency. KL scatter is used to align teacher and student outputs. An adaptive dynamic weighting scheme treats multi-teacher distillation as a multi-objective optimization problem, using gradient-space diversity to adjust each teacher's influence.

Result: Extensive experiments on three benchmarks show AMMKD achieves superior performance while significantly reducing model complexity.

Conclusion: AMMKD is an effective and flexible approach for building lightweight yet strong retrieval models in multimodal settings.

Abstract: The success of large-scale visual language pretraining (VLP) models has
driven widespread adoption of image-text retrieval tasks. However, their
deployment on mobile devices remains limited due to large model sizes and
computational complexity. We propose Adaptive Multi-Modal Multi-Teacher
Knowledge Distillation (AMMKD), a novel framework that integrates multi-modal
feature fusion, multi-teacher distillation, and adaptive optimization to
deliver lightweight yet effective retrieval models. Specifically, our method
begins with a feature fusion network that extracts and merges discriminative
features from both the image and text modalities. To reduce model parameters
and further improve performance, we design a multi-teacher knowledge
distillation framework to pre-train two CLIP teacher models. We decouple
modalities by pre-computing and storing text features as class vectors via the
teacher text encoder to enhance efficiency. To better align teacher and student
outputs, we apply KL scatter for probability distribution matching. Finally, we
design an adaptive dynamic weighting scheme that treats multi-teacher
distillation as a multi-objective optimization problem. By leveraging gradient
space diversity, we dynamically adjust the influence of each teacher, reducing
conflicts and guiding the student toward more optimal learning directions.
Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that AMMKD
achieves superior performance while significantly reducing model complexity,
validating its effectiveness and flexibility.

### [4] [Performance is not All You Need: Sustainability Considerations for Algorithms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00045)
*Xiang Li,Chong Zhang,Hongpeng Wang,Shreyank Narayana Gowda,Yushi Li,Xiaobo Jin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A two-dimensional sustainability evaluation framework for DL models using sustainable harmonic mean (FMS) and area under the sustainability curve (ASC) to balance energy consumption and accuracy, validated across multimodal tasks; enables cross-task energy-efficient benchmarking and green AI practice.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning training incurs high carbon emissions; traditional single performance metrics ignore energy costs; need metrics that jointly consider accuracy and energy to guide efficient AI.

Method: Introduce FMS (harmonic mean of accuracy and energy efficiency) and ASC (area under accuracy-energy curve across a training/evaluation cycle). Build benchmarks across image classification, segmentation, pose estimation, and batch/online learning; provide open-source code for replicability.

Result: The indicators quantify energy-performance trade-offs and generalize across tasks; experiments show the framework can quantitatively compare cross-task algorithms and support adoption of energy-efficient standards in practice.

Conclusion: A practical, universal framework for evaluating algorithm energy efficiency that can help transition green AI from theory to practice and inform industry energy standards.

Abstract: This work focuses on the high carbon emissions generated by deep learning
model training, specifically addressing the core challenge of balancing
algorithm performance and energy consumption. It proposes an innovative
two-dimensional sustainability evaluation system. Different from the
traditional single performance-oriented evaluation paradigm, this study
pioneered two quantitative indicators that integrate energy efficiency ratio
and accuracy: the sustainable harmonic mean (FMS) integrates accumulated energy
consumption and performance parameters through the harmonic mean to reveal the
algorithm performance under unit energy consumption; the area under the
sustainability curve (ASC) constructs a performance-power consumption curve to
characterize the energy efficiency characteristics of the algorithm throughout
the cycle. To verify the universality of the indicator system, the study
constructed benchmarks in various multimodal tasks, including image
classification, segmentation, pose estimation, and batch and online learning.
Experiments demonstrate that the system can provide a quantitative basis for
evaluating cross-task algorithms and promote the transition of green AI
research from theory to practice. Our sustainability evaluation framework code
can be found here, providing methodological support for the industry to
establish algorithm energy efficiency standards.

### [5] [MESTI-MEGANet: Micro-expression Spatio-Temporal Image and Micro-expression Gradient Attention Networks for Micro-expression Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00056)
*Luu Tu Nguyen,Vu Tram Anh Khuong,Thanh Ha Le,Thi Duyen Ngo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MESTI converts a video into a single image that preserves micro-movements; MEGANet with Gradient Attention improves micro-expression recognition; together they achieve state-of-the-art on CASMEII and SAMM.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MER is hard due to subtle, fleeting expressions; existing inputs fail to capture micro-movements; need a modality that preserves spatio-temporal cues and a network that can extract fine-grained motion.

Method: Propose MESTI as a single-image dynamic input; design MEGANet with Gradient Attention block; evaluate across CNNs (VGG19, ResNet50, EfficientNetB0); compare to Apex Frame, Optical Flow, Dynamic Image; test on CASMEII and SAMM; demonstrate improvements.

Result: MESTI outperforms traditional modalities; replacing inputs in existing MER networks with MESTI yields improvements; MEGANet with MESTI or Dynamic Image achieves state-of-the-art on CASMEII and SAMM; MEGANet+MESTI achieves highest accuracy to date.

Conclusion: MESTI is a superior input modality for MER; MEGANet's Gradient Attention enhances micro-movement feature extraction; the combination sets new benchmarks and broadens potential MER applications.

Abstract: Micro-expression recognition (MER) is a challenging task due to the subtle
and fleeting nature of micro-expressions. Traditional input modalities, such as
Apex Frame, Optical Flow, and Dynamic Image, often fail to adequately capture
these brief facial movements, resulting in suboptimal performance. In this
study, we introduce the Micro-expression Spatio-Temporal Image (MESTI), a novel
dynamic input modality that transforms a video sequence into a single image
while preserving the essential characteristics of micro-movements.
Additionally, we present the Micro-expression Gradient Attention Network
(MEGANet), which incorporates a novel Gradient Attention block to enhance the
extraction of fine-grained motion features from micro-expressions. By combining
MESTI and MEGANet, we aim to establish a more effective approach to MER.
Extensive experiments were conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of MESTI,
comparing it with existing input modalities across three CNN architectures
(VGG19, ResNet50, and EfficientNetB0). Moreover, we demonstrate that replacing
the input of previously published MER networks with MESTI leads to consistent
performance improvements. The performance of MEGANet, both with MESTI and
Dynamic Image, is also evaluated, showing that our proposed network achieves
state-of-the-art results on the CASMEII and SAMM datasets. The combination of
MEGANet and MESTI achieves the highest accuracy reported to date, setting a new
benchmark for micro-expression recognition. These findings underscore the
potential of MESTI as a superior input modality and MEGANet as an advanced
recognition network, paving the way for more effective MER systems in a variety
of applications.

### [6] [Scaffold Diffusion: Sparse Multi-Category Voxel Structure Generation with Discrete Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00062)
*Justin Jung*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Scaffold Diffusion introduces a discrete diffusion language model that treats voxels as tokens to generate sparse multi-category 3D voxel structures, achieving coherent 3D outputs at very high sparsity (over 98%) on Minecraft house structures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D voxel generation is limited by cubic memory scaling and severe class imbalance due to sparsity; a generative method that can handle sparse, multi-category voxel data and extend diffusion models to non-sequential, spatial domains is needed.

Method: Proposes Scaffold Diffusion, which models voxels as discrete tokens and uses a discrete diffusion process (diffusion language model) to generate 3D voxel grids. Demonstrates that discrete diffusion can produce spatially coherent 3D structures, extending beyond typical sequential domains like text. Trains and evaluates on Minecraft house structures from the 3D-Craft dataset, including highly sparse data.

Result: Compared to prior baselines and an auto-regressive formulation, Scaffold Diffusion yields more realistic and coherent 3D structures, performing well even with data sparsity >98%. An interactive viewer is provided to visualize samples and the generation process.

Conclusion: Discrete diffusion is a promising framework for 3D sparse voxel generative modeling, enabling realistic generation of highly sparse multi-category voxel structures.

Abstract: Generating realistic sparse multi-category 3D voxel structures is difficult
due to the cubic memory scaling of voxel structures and moreover the
significant class imbalance caused by sparsity. We introduce Scaffold
Diffusion, a generative model designed for sparse multi-category 3D voxel
structures. By treating voxels as tokens, Scaffold Diffusion uses a discrete
diffusion language model to generate 3D voxel structures. We show that discrete
diffusion language models can be extended beyond inherently sequential domains
such as text to generate spatially coherent 3D structures. We evaluate on
Minecraft house structures from the 3D-Craft dataset and demonstrate that,
unlike prior baselines and an auto-regressive formulation, Scaffold Diffusion
produces realistic and coherent structures even when trained on data with over
98% sparsity. We provide an interactive viewer where readers can visualize
generated samples and the generation process. Our results highlight discrete
diffusion as a promising framework for 3D sparse voxel generative modeling.

### [7] [Dual-Stage Global and Local Feature Framework for Image Dehazing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00108)
*Anas M. Ali,Anis Koubaa,Bilel Benjdira*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduces SGLC, a global-and-local feature fusion framework for high-resolution image dehazing, combining a Global Features Generator and Local Features Enhancer; plugged into Uformer; demonstrates PSNR gains on high-res datasets; model-agnostic.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-resolution dehazing is challenging due to difficulty fusing global scene context with fine-grained details; downsampling or patch-based processing leads to performance loss; need a framework to preserve global and local information.

Method: Two components: Global Features Generator to capture scene-level context and generate initial dehazed output; Local Features Enhancer refines with detailed, pixel-level features; integrates with Uformer; claims model-agnostic; can augment other dehazing networks.

Result: Experimental results show considerable PSNR improvement using SGLC on high-resolution datasets; demonstrates effectiveness on high-res imagery; SGLC is a plug-in module for existing networks.

Conclusion: SGLC bridges global and local cues for robust high-resolution dehazing; versatile, architecture-agnostic; enables better preservation of scene-level information and fine details in high-res images.

Abstract: Addressing the challenge of removing atmospheric fog or haze from digital
images, known as image dehazing, has recently gained significant traction in
the computer vision community. Although contemporary dehazing models have
demonstrated promising performance, few have thoroughly investigated
high-resolution imagery. In such scenarios, practitioners often resort to
downsampling the input image or processing it in smaller patches, which leads
to a notable performance degradation. This drop is primarily linked to the
difficulty of effectively combining global contextual information with
localized, fine-grained details as the spatial resolution grows. In this
chapter, we propose a novel framework, termed the Streamlined Global and Local
Features Combinator (SGLC), to bridge this gap and enable robust dehazing for
high-resolution inputs. Our approach is composed of two principal components:
the Global Features Generator (GFG) and the Local Features Enhancer (LFE). The
GFG produces an initial dehazed output by focusing on broad contextual
understanding of the scene. Subsequently, the LFE refines this preliminary
output by enhancing localized details and pixel-level features, thereby
capturing the interplay between global appearance and local structure. To
evaluate the effectiveness of SGLC, we integrated it with the Uformer
architecture, a state-of-the-art dehazing model. Experimental results on
high-resolution datasets reveal a considerable improvement in peak
signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) when employing SGLC, indicating its potency in
addressing haze in large-scale imagery. Moreover, the SGLC design is
model-agnostic, allowing any dehazing network to be augmented with the proposed
global-and-local feature fusion mechanism. Through this strategy, practitioners
can harness both scene-level cues and granular details, significantly improving
visual fidelity in high-resolution environments.

### [8] [Self-supervised large-scale kidney abnormality detection in drug safety assessment studies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00131)
*Ivan Slootweg,Natalia P. García-De-La-Puente,Geert Litjens,Salma Dammak*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A large-scale self-supervised approach improves abnormality detection for kidney toxicologic pathology over a kNN baseline on UNI foundation-model features, but performance is modest (AUC 0.62; NPV 89%), suggesting potential for ruling out normals and reducing screening costs with further development.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable scalable, cost-effective screening of thousands of kidney histology slides in preclinical drug safety studies by detecting subtle abnormalities without exhaustive manual review.

Method: Extract features from whole-slide images using the UNI foundation model. Compare a simple k-nearest neighbor classifier on these features (baseline) to a self-supervised method applied to the same features for abnormality detection across 158 compounds. Evaluate using AUC and NPV.

Result: KNN on UNI FM features performs at chance level. A self-supervised method on the same features yields better-than-chance performance with AUC = 0.62 and NPV = 89%.

Conclusion: The approach shows potential to rule out normal slides and cut costs/time in drug safety studies, but the modest AUC indicates substantial room for improvement before deployment; further development and validation across datasets and models are needed.

Abstract: Kidney abnormality detection is required for all preclinical drug
development. It involves a time-consuming and costly examination of hundreds to
thousands of whole-slide images per drug safety study, most of which are
normal, to detect any subtle changes indicating toxic effects. In this study,
we present the first large-scale self-supervised abnormality detection model
for kidney toxicologic pathology, spanning drug safety assessment studies from
158 compounds. We explore the complexity of kidney abnormality detection on
this scale using features extracted from the UNI foundation model (FM) and show
that a simple k-nearest neighbor classifier on these features performs at
chance, demonstrating that the FM-generated features alone are insufficient for
detecting abnormalities. We then demonstrate that a self-supervised method
applied to the same features can achieve better-than-chance performance, with
an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.62 and a
negative predictive value of 89%. With further development, such a model can be
used to rule out normal slides in drug safety assessment studies, reducing the
costs and time associated with drug development.

### [9] [Waste-Bench: A Comprehensive Benchmark for Evaluating VLLMs in Cluttered Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00176)
*Muhammad Ali,Salman Khan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A dataset and evaluation framework for Vision LLMs in cluttered real-world waste classification, revealing robustness gaps and prompting further improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To push VLLMs beyond standard natural images by testing them on cluttered environments with deformed objects, addressing real-world waste classification challenges.

Method: Create a novel dataset of waste in complex environments; develop an in-depth evaluation approach; benchmark VLLMs on this data; provide dataset and code publicly.

Result: Findings show robustness limitations of VLLMs in complex scenes with deformed shapes; insights into where improvements are needed; dataset and code released for the community.

Conclusion: Enhance VLLM robustness for complex, cluttered real-world settings; encourage further research and dataset development; facilitate reproducibility via public release.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have paved the way for
Vision Large Language Models (VLLMs) capable of performing a wide range of
visual understanding tasks. While LLMs have demonstrated impressive performance
on standard natural images, their capabilities have not been thoroughly
explored in cluttered datasets where there is complex environment having
deformed shaped objects. In this work, we introduce a novel dataset
specifically designed for waste classification in real-world scenarios,
characterized by complex environments and deformed shaped objects. Along with
this dataset, we present an in-depth evaluation approach to rigorously assess
the robustness and accuracy of VLLMs. The introduced dataset and comprehensive
analysis provide valuable insights into the performance of VLLMs under
challenging conditions. Our findings highlight the critical need for further
advancements in VLLM's robustness to perform better in complex environments.
The dataset and code for our experiments will be made publicly available.

### [10] [Category-level Text-to-Image Retrieval Improved: Bridging the Domain Gap with Diffusion Models and Vision Encoders](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00177)
*Faizan Farooq Khan,Vladan Stojnić,Zakaria Laskar,Mohamed Elhoseiny,Giorgos Tolias*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A diffusion-based text-to-image query transformation with an aggregation network improves text-to-image retrieval over text-only queries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bridge the modality gap in open-vocabulary text-to-image retrieval where text-only queries (e.g., via CLIP) map to distant regions in representation space, limiting performance; leverage generative and vision models to better align queries with images.

Method: A two-step approach: (1) transform the text query into a visual query using a diffusion generative model; (2) estimate image-to-image similarity with a vision model. An aggregation network combines multiple generated images into a single vector and fuses similarity scores across both the original text and generated visual modalities.

Result: Extensive evaluations show the proposed method consistently outperforms retrieval methods that rely solely on text queries (text-only baselines).

Conclusion: Transforming text into visual representations via diffusion and fusing with generated visuals improves open-vocabulary text-to-image retrieval, demonstrating the benefit of cross-modal query construction and aggregation; code is provided.

Abstract: This work explores text-to-image retrieval for queries that specify or
describe a semantic category. While vision-and-language models (VLMs) like CLIP
offer a straightforward open-vocabulary solution, they map text and images to
distant regions in the representation space, limiting retrieval performance. To
bridge this modality gap, we propose a two-step approach. First, we transform
the text query into a visual query using a generative diffusion model. Then, we
estimate image-to-image similarity with a vision model. Additionally, we
introduce an aggregation network that combines multiple generated images into a
single vector representation and fuses similarity scores across both query
modalities. Our approach leverages advancements in vision encoders, VLMs, and
text-to-image generation models. Extensive evaluations show that it
consistently outperforms retrieval methods relying solely on text queries.

### [11] [Safe-LLaVA: A Privacy-Preserving Vision-Language Dataset and Benchmark for Biometric Safety](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00192)
*Younggun Kim,Sirnam Swetha,Fazil Kagdi,Mubarak Shah*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PRISM benchmarks biometric leakage in multimodal LLMs; Safe-LLaVA dataset removes biometric info; results show leakage present and reduction after training on safe data; provides privacy-aware evaluation and training standards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Growing concerns that multimodal LLMs reveal sensitive biometric attributes (race, gender, age, body weight, eye color) even when not requested; no public benchmarks exist to evaluate or mitigate this leakage.

Method: Introduce PRISM for two evaluation axes: (i) refusing biometric-related queries and (ii) detecting implicit biometric leakage in general responses while preserving semantic fidelity. Audit LLaVA datasets to reveal leakage; construct Safe-LLaVA by systematically removing explicit and implicit biometric information from LLaVA data; evaluate MLLMs on PRISM; fine-tune a model on Safe-LLaVA to reduce leakage.

Result: Audits reveal extensive biometric leakage across pretraining/instruction data. PRISM exposes biometric leakage across multiple attributes in MLLMs. Fine-tuning on Safe-LLaVA substantially reduces leakage. Safe-LLaVA and PRISM together set a privacy-aligned standard for MLLM development and evaluation.

Conclusion: PRISM and Safe-LLaVA provide a privacy-aware framework for evaluating and training MLLMs. Public datasets and code are released to enable widespread adoption and benchmarking.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in vision-language tasks. However, these models often infer and
reveal sensitive biometric attributes - such as race, gender, age, body weight,
and eye color - even when such information is not explicitly requested. This
raises critical concerns, particularly in real-world applications and
socially-sensitive domains. Despite increasing awareness, no publicly available
dataset or benchmark exists to comprehensively evaluate or mitigate biometric
leakage in MLLMs. To address this gap, we introduce PRISM (Privacy-aware
Evaluation of Responses in Sensitive Modalities), a new benchmark designed to
assess MLLMs on two fronts: (1) refuse biometric-related queries and (2)
implicit biometric leakage in general responses while maintaining semantic
faithfulness. Further, we conduct a detailed audit of the widely used LLaVA
datasets and uncover extensive biometric leakage across pretraining and
instruction data. To address this, we present Safe-LLaVA dataset, the first
privacy-preserving MLLM training dataset constructed by systematically removing
explicit and implicit biometric information from LLaVA dataset. Our evaluations
on PRISM reveal biometric leakages across MLLMs for different attributes,
highlighting the detailed privacy-violations. We also fine-tune a model on
Safe-LLaVA dataset and show that it substantially reduces the biometric
leakages. Together, Safe-LLaVA & PRISM set a new standard for privacy-aligned
development and evaluation of MLLMs. The Safe-LLaVA dataset & PRISM benchmark
are publicly available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/kyh9191/Safe-LLaVA,
and the source code is available at
https://github.com/Kimyounggun99/Safe-LLaVA.git.

### [12] [Beyond Pixels: Introducing Geometric-Semantic World Priors for Video-based Embodied Models via Spatio-temporal Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00210)
*Jinzhou Tang,Jusheng zhang,Sidi Liu,Waikit Xiu,Qinhan Lv,Xiying Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VEME introduces a cross-modal, ego-centric world model for embodied AI that enhances VLM reasoning and planning in dynamic, unseen environments, achieving modest gains on VSI-Bench and VLN-CE.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current vision-language models excel at static scenes but struggle with spatio-temporal reasoning and adaptation to open-ended embodied tasks; a geometry-aware, episodic, ego-centric world model is needed.

Method: Three-part framework: (1) cross-modal alignment across objects, spatial reps, and visual semantics with spatio-temporal cues; (2) a dynamic implicit cognitive map activated by world embedding for memory recall; (3) instruction-based navigation/reasoning leveraging embodied priors for long-term planning and exploration; plus encoding geometry-aware spatio-temporal episodic experiences.

Result: Empirical improvements of 1-3% in accuracy and exploration efficiency on VSI-Bench and VLN-CE compared with traditional approaches.

Conclusion: Embedding geometry-aware spatio-temporal experiences into an ego-centric world model enhances generalization and reasoning/planning for embodied tasks in dynamic environments.

Abstract: Achieving human-like reasoning in deep learning models for complex tasks in
unknown environments remains a critical challenge in embodied intelligence.
While advanced vision-language models (VLMs) excel in static scene
understanding, their limitations in spatio-temporal reasoning and adaptation to
dynamic, open-set tasks like task-oriented navigation and embodied question
answering (EQA) persist due to inadequate modeling of fine-grained
spatio-temporal cues and physical world comprehension. To address this, we
propose VEME, a novel cross-modal alignment method that enhances generalization
in unseen scenes by learning an ego-centric, experience-centered world model.
Our framework integrates three key components: (1) a cross-modal alignment
framework bridging objects, spatial representations, and visual semantics with
spatio-temporal cues to enhance VLM in-context learning; (2) a dynamic,
implicit cognitive map activated by world embedding to enable task-relevant
geometric-semantic memory recall; and (3) an instruction-based navigation and
reasoning framework leveraging embodied priors for long-term planning and
efficient exploration. By embedding geometry-aware spatio-temporal episodic
experiences, our method significantly improves reasoning and planning in
dynamic environments. Experimental results on VSI-Bench and VLN-CE demonstrate
1%-3% accuracy and exploration efficiency improvement compared to traditional
approaches.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Multimodal deep learning using ultrasound images and clinical data improves classification of breast phyllodes tumors vs benign/probable malignant, outperforming unimodal baselines; ConvNeXt and ResNet18 best in multimodal setup.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address preoperative misclassification of phyllodes tumors due to radiologic similarity to benign lesions, leading to unnecessary surgeries, by combining imaging and structured clinical data.

Method: Dual-branch neural network fusing features from breast ultrasound images and patient metadata; class-aware sampling; subject-stratified 5-fold cross-validation on 81 confirmed PT cases; evaluated across six image encoders (ConvNeXt, ResNet18 among others).

Result: Multimodal model outperforms unimodal baselines in benign vs borderline/malignant PT classification. Best performers in multimodal setting: ConvNeXt (AUC-ROC 0.9427, F1 0.6720) and ResNet18 (AUC-ROC 0.9349, F1 0.7294).

Conclusion: Demonstrates the potential of multimodal AI as a non-invasive diagnostic tool to reduce unnecessary biopsies and support clinical decision-making in breast tumor management.

Abstract: Phyllodes tumors (PTs) are rare fibroepithelial breast lesions that are
difficult to classify preoperatively due to their radiological similarity to
benign fibroadenomas. This often leads to unnecessary surgical excisions. To
address this, we propose a multimodal deep learning framework that integrates
breast ultrasound (BUS) images with structured clinical data to improve
diagnostic accuracy. We developed a dual-branch neural network that extracts
and fuses features from ultrasound images and patient metadata from 81 subjects
with confirmed PTs. Class-aware sampling and subject-stratified 5-fold
cross-validation were applied to prevent class imbalance and data leakage. The
results show that our proposed multimodal method outperforms unimodal baselines
in classifying benign versus borderline/malignant PTs. Among six image
encoders, ConvNeXt and ResNet18 achieved the best performance in the multimodal
setting, with AUC-ROC scores of 0.9427 and 0.9349, and F1-scores of 0.6720 and
0.7294, respectively. This study demonstrates the potential of multimodal AI to
serve as a non-invasive diagnostic tool, reducing unnecessary biopsies and
improving clinical decision-making in breast tumor management.

Conclusion: GraViT demonstrates that extensive pretraining and careful training/ensemble strategies enable effective automated lens detection for LSST-scale data, offering practical guidance on architecture choice, data requirements, and computation costs.

Abstract: Gravitational lensing offers a powerful probe into the properties of dark
matter and is crucial to infer cosmological parameters. The Legacy Survey of
Space and Time (LSST) is predicted to find O(10^5) gravitational lenses over
the next decade, demanding automated classifiers. In this work, we introduce
GraViT, a PyTorch pipeline for gravitational lens detection that leverages
extensive pretraining of state-of-the-art Vision Transformer (ViT) models and
MLP-Mixer. We assess the impact of transfer learning on classification
performance by examining data quality (source and sample size), model
architecture (selection and fine-tuning), training strategies (augmentation,
normalization, and optimization), and ensemble predictions. This study
reproduces the experiments in a previous systematic comparison of neural
networks and provides insights into the detectability of strong gravitational
lenses on that common test sample. We fine-tune ten architectures using
datasets from HOLISMOKES VI and SuGOHI X, and benchmark them against
convolutional baselines, discussing complexity and inference-time analysis.

### [15] [A High-Accuracy Fast Hough Transform with Linear-Log-Cubed Computational Complexity for Arbitrary-Shaped Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00231)
*Danil Kazimirov,Dmitry Nikolaev*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes FHT2SP, a fast and highly accurate Hough transform for arbitrary-shaped images by extending Brady’s superpixel idea into FHT2DT, achieving near-optimal O(wh log^3 w) time with a size-independent constant error bound, tunable by a meta-parameter.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The classic HT requires a balance between speed and accuracy. While fast HTs like FHT2DT work for power-of-two images, accuracy degrades for arbitrary sizes; exact HTs are too slow. There is a need for an algorithm that is both fast for arbitrary shapes and maintains bounded, controllable accuracy.

Method: Extend Brady’s superpixel concept to arbitrary shapes and integrate it into the FHT2DT framework to create FHT2SP. The approach selects a superpixel size to balance complexity and error, achieving O(wh log^3 w) time with a constant, size-independent error bound, and provides theoretical and experimental analyses.

Result: FHT2SP achieves near-optimal computational complexity O(wh log^3 w) for an image of size w×h while keeping the approximation error bounded by a constant independent of image size, controllable via a meta-parameter. The paper provides theoretical and experimental validation of both complexity and accuracy.

Conclusion: FHT2SP delivers a fast, highly accurate HT for arbitrary-shaped images by unifying the superpixel extension with FHT2DT; the meta-parameter enables a tunable trade-off between speed and precision, with proven guarantees and empirical support.

Abstract: The Hough transform (HT) is a fundamental tool across various domains, from
classical image analysis to neural networks and tomography. Two key aspects of
the algorithms for computing the HT are their computational complexity and
accuracy - the latter often defined as the error of approximation of continuous
lines by discrete ones within the image region. The fast HT (FHT) algorithms
with optimal linearithmic complexity - such as the Brady-Yong algorithm for
power-of-two-sized images - are well established. Generalizations like $FHT2DT$
extend this efficiency to arbitrary image sizes, but with reduced accuracy that
worsens with scale. Conversely, accurate HT algorithms achieve constant-bounded
error but require near-cubic computational cost. This paper introduces $FHT2SP$
algorithm - a fast and highly accurate HT algorithm. It builds on our
development of Brady's superpixel concept, extending it to arbitrary shapes
beyond the original power-of-two square constraint, and integrates it into the
$FHT2DT$ algorithm. With an appropriate choice of the superpixel's size, for an
image of shape $w \times h$, the $FHT2SP$ algorithm achieves near-optimal
computational complexity $\mathcal{O}(wh \ln^3 w)$, while keeping the
approximation error bounded by a constant independent of image size, and
controllable via a meta-parameter. We provide theoretical and experimental
analyses of the algorithm's complexity and accuracy.

*Liang Gong,Tommy,Wang,Sara Chaker,Yanchen Dong,Fouad Bousetouane,Brenden Morton,Mark Mendez*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A language-guided generative vision pipeline combining a conditional GAN contour generator with vision-language model refinement achieves CAD-like contour precision in manufacturing, outperforming Gemini 2.0 Flash and other baselines on FabTrack data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Industrial computer vision is hampered by noise, material variability, and uncontrolled imaging, making classical edge detectors and handcrafted pipelines fail to deliver CAD-level contour accuracy; a flexible, language-guided generative approach may bridge this gap.

Method: A three-stage pipeline: (1) data acquisition and preprocessing; (2) contour generation using a conditional GAN; (3) multimodal contour refinement via vision-language modeling with standardized prompts crafted in a human-in-the-loop process, applied through image-text guided synthesis. Evaluation on proprietary FabTrack datasets with comparisons across VLMs (Gemini 2.0 Flash, GPT-image-1 integrated within a VLM-guided workflow, and open-source baselines).

Result: Increased contour fidelity, with improved edge continuity and geometric alignment; reduced need for manual tracing. GPT-image-1 consistently outperformed Gemini 2.0 Flash in structural accuracy and perceptual quality under standardized conditions.

Conclusion: Vision-language-model-guided generative workflows hold strong promise for advancing industrial computer vision beyond classical pipelines, enabling CAD-level precision in remnant contour detection, though practical considerations like data access and prompt design remain important.

Abstract: Industrial computer vision systems often struggle with noise, material
variability, and uncontrolled imaging conditions, limiting the effectiveness of
classical edge detectors and handcrafted pipelines. In this work, we present a
language-guided generative vision system for remnant contour detection in
manufacturing, designed to achieve CAD-level precision. The system is organized
into three stages: data acquisition and preprocessing, contour generation using
a conditional GAN, and multimodal contour refinement through vision-language
modeling, where standardized prompts are crafted in a human-in-the-loop process
and applied through image-text guided synthesis. On proprietary FabTrack
datasets, the proposed system improved contour fidelity, enhancing edge
continuity and geometric alignment while reducing manual tracing. For the
refinement stage, we benchmarked several vision-language models, including
Google's Gemini 2.0 Flash, OpenAI's GPT-image-1 integrated within a VLM-guided
workflow, and open-source baselines. Under standardized conditions, GPT-image-1
consistently outperformed Gemini 2.0 Flash in both structural accuracy and
perceptual quality. These findings demonstrate the promise of VLM-guided
generative workflows for advancing industrial computer vision beyond the
limitations of classical pipelines.

### [17] [Language-Aware Information Maximization for Transductive Few-Shot CLIP](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00305)
*Ghassen Baklouti,Maxime Zanella,Ismail Ben Ayed*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A language-aware information-maximization approach (LIMO) for transductive few-shot CLIP that uses mutual information, a KL penalty toward text-driven zero-shot predictions, and cross-entropy with labeled shots, combined with parameter-efficient fine-tuning; yields large gains over recent transductive CLIP methods and strong inductive baselines; code released.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transductive few-shot learning in vision-language models is underexplored and potentially ripe for gains by marrying information-theoretic objectives with efficient fine-tuning, enabling data-efficient adaptation of VLMs like CLIP.

Method: Introduce LIMO loss that combines (i) mutual information between visual inputs and textual class descriptions, (ii) KL divergence penalizing deviation from text-driven zero-shot predictions, and (iii) standard cross-entropy on labeled shots; explore parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) strategies rather than full fine-tuning in the transductive few-shot setting.

Result: LIMO outperforms recent transductive few-shot CLIP methods by a large margin and provides significant gains over the best inductive methods, according to comprehensive evaluations; code is publicly available.

Conclusion: Demonstrates the potential of transductive few-shot learning for vision-language models when combined with information-theoretic objectives and PEFT; suggests further exploration of PEFT approaches in transductive VLM fine-tuning and release of open-source implementation.

Abstract: Transductive few-shot learning has triggered an abundant literature focusing
on vision-only models, but is still at a nascent stage within the recent
context of foundational vision-language models (VLMs). Only a few recent
methods addressed the problem, pointing to the potential of tranduction in VLMs
and to the need for VLM-tailored methods. Building on this momentum, we
leverage information-theoretic concepts and recent progress in
parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT), developing a highly competitive
transductive few-shot CLIP method. Specifically, we introduce a novel
Language-aware Information MaximizatiOn (LIMO) loss integrating three
complementary terms: (i) the mutual information between the vision inputs and
the textual class descriptions; (ii) a Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence
penalizing deviation of the network's probabilistic outputs from the
text-driven zero-shot predictions; and (iii) a standard cross-entropy loss
based on the labeled shots. Furthermore, we challenge the commonly followed
fine-tuning practices in the context of transductive few-shot learning, and
explore PEFT strategies, completely overlooked in this context. Surprisingly,
we observe substantial boosts in performances, which points to the potential of
adapting a subset of the model's parameters in the transductive few-shot
setting. We report comprehensive evaluations, which show that LIMO outperforms
the very recent transductive few-shot CLIP methods by a large margin and yields
significant gains over the best-performing inductive methods. Our code is

### [18] [MorphGen: Morphology-Guided Representation Learning for Robust Single-Domain Generalization in Histopathological Cancer Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00311)
*Hikmat Khan,Syed Farhan Alam Zaidi,Pir Masoom Shah,Kiruthika Balakrishnan,Rabia Khan,Muhammad Waqas,Jia Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MorphGen is a morphology-guided, contrastive learning framework for domain-generalization in histopathology that aligns image representations with nuclear segmentation masks, uses augmentations and SWA, and relies on nuclear morphology and spatial organization to achieve robust OOD performance, including resistance to staining artifacts and adversarial attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Domain shifts across institutions (staining, preparation, imaging) cause generalization failure in WSI analysis. Pathologists rely on invariant nuclear and morphological cues, suggesting that encoding these priors could improve robustness to domain variability.

Method: MorphGen integrates histology images, augmentations, and nuclear segmentation masks into a supervised contrastive learning setup. It aligns latent representations of images and nuclear masks, uses stochastic weight averaging to favor flatter minima, and analyzes attention maps to verify reliance on nuclear morphology and spatial organization.

Result: The learned representations emphasize nuclear morphology, cellular composition, and tumor/normal spatial organization. MorphGen shows resilience to image corruption (e.g., staining artifacts) and adversarial attacks, indicating improved out-of-distribution generalization.

Conclusion: Incorporating biology-driven priors—nuclear morphology and tissue organization—enables robust domain-generalizable representations in computational histopathology, with accessible code/models/datasets on the project page.

Abstract: Domain generalization in computational histopathology is hindered by
heterogeneity in whole slide images (WSIs), caused by variations in tissue
preparation, staining, and imaging conditions across institutions. Unlike
machine learning systems, pathologists rely on domain-invariant morphological
cues such as nuclear atypia (enlargement, irregular contours, hyperchromasia,
chromatin texture, spatial disorganization), structural atypia (abnormal
architecture and gland formation), and overall morphological atypia that remain
diagnostic across diverse settings. Motivated by this, we hypothesize that
explicitly modeling biologically robust nuclear morphology and spatial
organization will enable the learning of cancer representations that are
resilient to domain shifts. We propose MorphGen (Morphology-Guided
Generalization), a method that integrates histopathology images, augmentations,
and nuclear segmentation masks within a supervised contrastive learning
framework. By aligning latent representations of images and nuclear masks,
MorphGen prioritizes diagnostic features such as nuclear and morphological
atypia and spatial organization over staining artifacts and domain-specific
features. To further enhance out-of-distribution robustness, we incorporate
stochastic weight averaging (SWA), steering optimization toward flatter minima.
Attention map analyses revealed that MorphGen primarily relies on nuclear
morphology, cellular composition, and spatial cell organization within tumors
or normal regions for final classification. Finally, we demonstrate resilience
of the learned representations to image corruptions (such as staining
artifacts) and adversarial attacks, showcasing not only OOD generalization but
also addressing critical vulnerabilities in current deep learning systems for
digital pathology. Code, datasets, and trained models are available at:

### [19] [Towards Adaptive Visual Token Pruning for Large Multimodal Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00320)
*Hao Zhang,Mengsi Lyu,Chenrui He,Yulong Ao,Yonghua Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes visual-token pruning for large multimodal models (LMMs) to reduce inference cost by pruning only visual tokens. The approach uses a mutual information-based strategy to preserve cross-modal alignment and a diversity-based greedy pruning to maximize embedding-space dispersion, achieving 88.9% token reduction and 56.7% speedup on LLaVA-1.5-7B and LLaVA-NEXT-7B while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reduce computational and memory burden of LMMs without sacrificing cross-modal alignment. Visual tokens contribute disproportionately to token counts; pruning them selectively aims to cut cost while preserving textual information and cross-modal fidelity.

Method: 1) Mutual information-based pruning to remove visual tokens semantically misaligned with textual tokens, preserving cross-modal alignment. 2) Greedy pruning to maximize expected pairwise distances among retained visual tokens in embedding space, enhancing intra-modal representational diversity. 3) Pruning is restricted to visual tokens; textual tokens are kept intact. 4) Efficient algorithm to enable scalable pruning during inference.

Result: Significant token reduction (88.9%) with substantial speedup (56.7%) on specific LMMs (LLaVA-1.5-7B and LLaVA-NEXT-7B) while preserving strong performance.

Conclusion: Focusing pruning on visual tokens and optimizing for both cross-modal alignment and intra-modal diversity yields efficient LMM inference. The proposed MI-based alignment pruning plus diversity-driven pruning effectively reduces tokens and accelerates inference without major performance losses.

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have achieved significant success across
various tasks. These models usually encode visual inputs into dense token
sequences, which are then concatenated with textual tokens and jointly
processed by a language model. However, the increased token count substantially
raises computational and memory costs during inference. Token pruning has
emerged as a promising approach to address this issue. Existing token pruning
methods often rely on costly calibration or suboptimal importance metrics,
leading to redundant retained tokens. In this paper, we analyze the redundancy
differences between visual and textual tokens and propose pruning exclusively
on visual tokens. Based on this, we propose a visual token pruning strategy
that explicitly preserves both cross-modal alignment and intra-modal
informational diversity. We introduce a mutual information-based token pruning
strategy that removes visual tokens semantically misaligned with textual
tokens, effectively preserving the alignment between the visual and textual
modalities. To further improve the representational quality of the retained
tokens, we additionally prune redundant visual tokens by maximizing the
expected pairwise distances in the embedding space, which is solved efficiently
with a greedy algorithm. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method
maintains strong performance while reducing tokens by 88.9% on models such as
LLaVA-1.5-7B and LLaVA-NEXT-7B, resulting in a 56.7% improvement in inference
speed.

TL;DR: End-to-end encrypted face recognition using Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) called CryptoFace; uses patch-based shallow CNNs to enable secure feature extraction, storage, and matching with reduced multiplicative depth and near-latency; outperforms existing FHE-based face recognition methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Biometric privacy risks: unauthorized access to raw face data; need secure processing across all stages of face recognition without exposing sensitive information.

Method: Proposes a mixture of shallow patch convolutional networks to handle high-dimensional tensors via patch-based processing; reduces multiplicative depth and inference latency; employs parallel FHE evaluation for near-resolution-independent latency.

Result: On standard face recognition benchmarks, CryptoFace accelerates inference and improves verification accuracy compared to state-of-the-art FHE neural networks adapted for face recognition.

Conclusion: CryptoFace enables secure, provable-privacy face recognition; code released, paving the way for robust privacy-preserving biometric systems.

Abstract: Face recognition is central to many authentication, security, and
personalized applications. Yet, it suffers from significant privacy risks,
particularly arising from unauthorized access to sensitive biometric data. This
paper introduces CryptoFace, the first end-to-end encrypted face recognition
system with fully homomorphic encryption (FHE). It enables secure processing of
facial data across all stages of a face-recognition process--feature
extraction, storage, and matching--without exposing raw images or features. We
introduce a mixture of shallow patch convolutional networks to support
higher-dimensional tensors via patch-based processing while reducing the
multiplicative depth and, thus, inference latency. Parallel FHE evaluation of
these networks ensures near-resolution-independent latency. On standard face
recognition benchmarks, CryptoFace significantly accelerates inference and
increases verification accuracy compared to the state-of-the-art FHE neural
networks adapted for face recognition. CryptoFace will facilitate secure face
recognition systems requiring robust and provable security. The code is

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LUT-Fuse introduces a fast, learnable lookup-table based approach for multi-modal image fusion, using low-order encoding and high-level contextual features, enhanced by a distillation strategy to transfer MM-Net performance. It delivers real-time speeds (≈1/10th the time of lightweight SOTA) on low-power devices with robust results and released code.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-time applicability of infrared/visible image fusion is limited by heavy models and lack of ground-truth data. There is a need for extremely fast, reliable fusion methods that can run on low-power devices without sacrificing accuracy.

Method: Develop a LUT-based fusion module (MM-LUT) that uses low-order approximation encoding plus high-level joint contextual scene encoding for multi-modal fusion. Introduce an efficient LUT distillation strategy to transfer knowledge from the multi-modal fusion network (MM-Net) to the LUT-based model, avoiding traditional quantization LUT methods. Integrate MM-Net performance into MM-LUT and optimize for speed and stability.

Result: The proposed LUT-Fuse achieves significantly faster performance (less than one-tenth of the time of current lightweight SOTA fusion algorithms) while maintaining high fusion quality across scenarios; validated by extensive experiments showing superior reliability and stability. Code is available at the referenced repository.

Conclusion: LUT-Fuse provides an effective, real-time-capable fusion framework for multi-modal imagery by combining learnable LUTs with distillation from a strong fusion network, enabling fast, robust infrared/visible image fusion on diverse devices.

Abstract: Current advanced research on infrared and visible image fusion primarily
focuses on improving fusion performance, often neglecting the applicability on
real-time fusion devices. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that
towards extremely fast fusion via distillation to learnable lookup tables
specifically designed for image fusion, termed as LUT-Fuse. Firstly, we develop
a look-up table structure that utilizing low-order approximation encoding and
high-level joint contextual scene encoding, which is well-suited for
multi-modal fusion. Moreover, given the lack of ground truth in multi-modal
image fusion, we naturally proposed the efficient LUT distillation strategy
instead of traditional quantization LUT methods. By integrating the performance
of the multi-modal fusion network (MM-Net) into the MM-LUT model, our method
achieves significant breakthroughs in efficiency and performance. It typically
requires less than one-tenth of the time compared to the current lightweight
SOTA fusion algorithms, ensuring high operational speed across various
scenarios, even in low-power mobile devices. Extensive experiments validate the
superiority, reliability, and stability of our fusion approach. The code is

### [22] [Target-Oriented Single Domain Generalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00351)
*Marzi Heidari,Yuhong Guo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes TO-SDG: using textual target descriptions to guide single-domain generalization; introduces STAR to inject target semantics via VLMs, recenter features, and apply spectral projection, distillation, and Mixup for robust generalization; shows improved results on classification and detection with minimal text metadata.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Single Domain Generalization (SDG) models fail under distribution shifts. Textual descriptions of the target deployment environment are an available, untapped resource that could guide models without needing target data.

Method: 1) Define Target-Oriented SDG (TO-SDG). 2) Introduce Spectral TARget Alignment (STAR) module that: a) creates a target-anchored subspace from the target text embedding, b) recenters image features toward the deployment domain, c) applies spectral projection to keep target-aligned directions and suppress source noise. 3) Use vision-language distillation to align backbone features with the semantic geometry of a VLM (e.g., CLIP). 4) Employ feature-space Mixup to smooth transitions between source and target representations.

Result: Empirical results on image classification and object detection benchmarks show STAR outperforms baselines, demonstrating that minimal textual metadata can substantially improve generalization under severe data constraints.

Conclusion: Minimal textual metadata about the target domain can substantially enhance generalization under distribution shifts; TO-SDG with STAR opens new avenues for deploying robust models in unseen target environments.

Abstract: Deep models trained on a single source domain often fail catastrophically
under distribution shifts, a critical challenge in Single Domain Generalization
(SDG). While existing methods focus on augmenting source data or learning
invariant features, they neglect a readily available resource: textual
descriptions of the target deployment environment. We propose Target-Oriented
Single Domain Generalization (TO-SDG), a novel problem setup that leverages the
textual description of the target domain, without requiring any target data, to
guide model generalization. To address TO-SDG, we introduce Spectral TARget
Alignment (STAR), a lightweight module that injects target semantics into
source features by exploiting visual-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP. STAR
uses a target-anchored subspace derived from the text embedding of the target
description to recenter image features toward the deployment domain, then
utilizes spectral projection to retain directions aligned with target cues
while discarding source-specific noise. Moreover, we use a vision-language
distillation to align backbone features with VLM's semantic geometry. STAR
further employs feature-space Mixup to ensure smooth transitions between source
and target-oriented representations. Experiments across various image
classification and object detection benchmarks demonstrate STAR's superiority.
This work establishes that minimal textual metadata, which is a practical and
often overlooked resource, significantly enhances generalization under severe
data constraints, opening new avenues for deploying robust models in target
environments with unseen data.

### [24] [Iterative Low-rank Network for Hyperspectral Image Denoising](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00356)
*Jin Ye,Fengchao Xiong,Jun Zhou,Yuntao Qian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ILRNet introduces an iterative, score-based low-rank denoising architecture for hyperspectral images by embedding a rank-minimization module into a U-Net, applying SVT in the wavelet domain with adaptive thresholds and iterative refinement to fuse denoised outputs and noisy inputs, achieving state-of-the-art results on synthetic and real noise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hyperspectral images live in a low-dimensional subspace due to physical priors. Effective denoising should leverage low-rankness and sparsity while preserving details, which is challenging with purely data-driven or purely model-driven methods.

Method: Incorporates a rank-minimization module (RMM) into a U-Net. The RMM transforms feature maps to the wavelet domain and applies singular value thresholding to low-frequency components during the forward pass, leveraging spectral low-rankness in the feature domain. The threshold parameter is learned adaptively from data. The network also includes an iterative refinement process that progressively combines intermediate denoised HSIs with the original noisy input.

Result: Experimental results show ILRNet achieves state-of-the-art performance in denoising for both synthetic and real-world noise scenarios.

Conclusion: Combining a model-driven rank-minimization module with a data-driven UNet backbone and adaptive threshold learning yields effective exploitation of low-rank structure in HSIs, leading to improved denoising and detail preservation.

Abstract: Hyperspectral image (HSI) denoising is a crucial preprocessing step for
subsequent tasks. The clean HSI usually reside in a low-dimensional subspace,
which can be captured by low-rank and sparse representation, known as the
physical prior of HSI. It is generally challenging to adequately use such
physical properties for effective denoising while preserving image details.
This paper introduces a novel iterative low-rank network (ILRNet) to address
these challenges. ILRNet integrates the strengths of model-driven and
data-driven approaches by embedding a rank minimization module (RMM) within a
U-Net architecture. This module transforms feature maps into the wavelet domain
and applies singular value thresholding (SVT) to the low-frequency components
during the forward pass, leveraging the spectral low-rankness of HSIs in the
feature domain. The parameter, closely related to the hyperparameter of the
singular vector thresholding algorithm, is adaptively learned from the data,
allowing for flexible and effective capture of low-rankness across different
scenarios. Additionally, ILRNet features an iterative refinement process that
adaptively combines intermediate denoised HSIs with noisy inputs. This manner
ensures progressive enhancement and superior preservation of image details.
Experimental results demonstrate that ILRNet achieves state-of-the-art
performance in both synthetic and real-world noise removal tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes SurgLLM, a large multimodal model for versatile surgical video understanding that addresses both spatial perception and temporal awareness. It introduces Surg-Pretrain (instrument-centric MV-Recon + multimodal alignment) for spatial focus, TM-Tuning for temporal reasoning with interleaved multimodal embeddings, and Surgical Task Dynamic Ensemble to adaptively triage parameters per query. Demonstrates state-of-the-art improvements on captioning, general VQA, and temporal VQA across diverse surgical tasks; code released.

Motivation: Current surgical video understanding struggles with limited visual content perception and insufficient temporal awareness, hindering versatile computer-assisted surgery solutions.

Method: SurgLLM comprises: (1) Surg-Pretrain with instrument-centric masked video reconstruction (MV-Recon) and multimodal alignment to sharpen spatial features; (2) Temporal-aware Multimodal Tuning (TM-Tuning) to infuse temporal knowledge via interleaved multimodal embeddings; (3) Surgical Task Dynamic Ensemble to dynamically select learnable parameters for different tasks/queries.

Result: Extensive experiments across captioning, general VQA, and temporal VQA show significant improvements over state-of-the-art approaches on diverse surgical video understanding tasks.

Conclusion: SurgLLM is effective for versatile surgical video understanding and can be deployed with the provided source code; it advances both spatial and temporal understanding in surgical videos.

Abstract: Surgical video understanding is crucial for facilitating Computer-Assisted
Surgery (CAS) systems. Despite significant progress in existing studies, two
major limitations persist, including inadequate visual content perception and
insufficient temporal awareness in surgical videos, and hinder the development
of versatile CAS solutions. In this work, we propose the SurgLLM framework, an
effective large multimodal model tailored for versatile surgical video
understanding tasks with enhanced spatial focus and temporal awareness.
Specifically, to empower the spatial focus of surgical videos, we first devise
Surgical Context-aware Multimodal Pretraining (Surg-Pretrain) for the video
encoder of SurgLLM, by performing instrument-centric Masked Video
Reconstruction (MV-Recon) and subsequent multimodal alignment. To incorporate
surgical temporal knowledge into SurgLLM, we further propose Temporal-aware
Multimodal Tuning (TM-Tuning) to enhance temporal reasoning with interleaved
multimodal embeddings. Moreover, to accommodate various understanding tasks of
surgical videos without conflicts, we devise a Surgical Task Dynamic Ensemble
to efficiently triage a query with optimal learnable parameters in our SurgLLM.
Extensive experiments performed on diverse surgical video understanding tasks,
including captioning, general VQA, and temporal VQA, demonstrate significant

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A large, publicly available multimodal PET/CT dataset for head and neck cancer (1123 studies, 10 centers) with expert-annotated GTVp/GTVn, dose maps for a subset, and rich clinical metadata; enables benchmarking of automated segmentation, survival prediction, and HPV classification using state-of-the-art models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a diverse, richly annotated, real-world imaging resource that supports development, benchmarking, and reproducible validation of AI methods for tumor segmentation, prognosis, and HPV status in head and neck cancer.

Method: Data collection across 10 international centers with co-registered PET/CT scans acquired under varied protocols; manual delineation of primary and nodal tumor volumes by experienced clinicians per standardized guidelines; anonymization and provision of NIfTI files, segmentation masks, dose distributions (subset), and comprehensive clinical metadata (TNM, HPV status, demographics, follow-up, survival, treatment). Benchmarking demonstrated for three tasks using deep learning models (UNet, SegResNet) and multimodal prognostic frameworks.

Result: The dataset is released with expert-annotated segmentations and metadata; the abstract demonstrates benchmarking for three clinical tasks—automated tumor segmentation, recurrence-free survival prediction, and HPV status classification—using state-of-the-art models. Specific numeric metrics are not provided in the abstract, but the work establishes baseline benchmarks.

Conclusion: This public resource supports reproducible AI research for head and neck cancer, enabling cross-institutional validation and potentially improving segmentation accuracy and prognostic assessment across diverse clinical settings.

Abstract: We describe a publicly available multimodal dataset of annotated Positron
Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography (PET/CT) studies for head and neck
cancer research. The dataset includes 1123 FDG-PET/CT studies from patients
with histologically confirmed head and neck cancer, acquired from 10
international medical centers. All examinations consisted of co-registered
PET/CT scans with varying acquisition protocols, reflecting real-world clinical
diversity across institutions. Primary gross tumor volumes (GTVp) and involved
lymph nodes (GTVn) were manually segmented by experienced radiation oncologists
and radiologists following standardized guidelines and quality control
measures. We provide anonymized NifTi files of all studies, along with
expert-annotated segmentation masks, radiotherapy dose distribution for a
subset of patients, and comprehensive clinical metadata. This metadata includes
TNM staging, HPV status, demographics (age and gender), long-term follow-up
outcomes, survival times, censoring indicators, and treatment information. We
demonstrate how this dataset can be used for three key clinical tasks:
automated tumor segmentation, recurrence-free survival prediction, and HPV
status classification, providing benchmark results using state-of-the-art deep
learning models, including UNet, SegResNet, and multimodal prognostic
frameworks.

### [27] [Two Causes, Not One: Rethinking Omission and Fabrication Hallucinations in MLLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00371)
*Guangzong Si,Hao Yin,Xianfei Li,Qing Ding,Wenlong Liao,Tao He,Pai Peng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper separates omission and fabrication object hallucinations in multimodal LLMs, proposing Visual-Semantic Attention Potential Field (VSAPF) and Visual Potential Field Calibration (VPFC) to calibrate visual-to-language mappings and reduce omissions without triggering extra fabrications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Object hallucination in multimodal LLMs has been treated as a single problem; however omissions and fabrications stem from distinct causes, necessitating targeted mitigation.

Method: Propose VSAPF as a conceptual framework to analyze how visual evidence is constructed for linguistic inference, and introduce VPFC as a plug‑in technique to calibrate the visual-to-language mapping to suppress omissions without increasing fabrications.

Result: Claims that VPFC reduces omission hallucinations while not introducing additional fabrication hallucinations, backed by visual attention intervention experiments.

Conclusion: Calls for separating the distinct causes of hallucinations in MLLMs and suggests new avenues for robust, balanced hallucination mitigation.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved impressive advances,
yet object hallucination remains a persistent challenge. Existing methods,
based on the flawed assumption that omission and fabrication hallucinations
share a common cause, often reduce omissions only to trigger more fabrications.
In this work, we overturn this view by demonstrating that omission
hallucinations arise from insufficient confidence when mapping perceived visual
features to linguistic expressions, whereas fabrication hallucinations result
from spurious associations within the cross-modal representation space due to
statistical biases in the training corpus. Building on findings from visual
attention intervention experiments, we propose the Visual-Semantic Attention
Potential Field, a conceptual framework that reveals how the model constructs
visual evidence to infer the presence or absence of objects. Leveraging this
insight, we introduce Visual Potential Field Calibration (VPFC), a
plug-and-play hallucination mitigation method that effectively reduces omission
hallucinations without introducing additional fabrication hallucinations. Our
findings reveal a critical oversight in current object hallucination research
and chart new directions for developing more robust and balanced hallucination
mitigation strategies.

### [28] [Activation Steering Meets Preference Optimization: Defense Against Jailbreaks in Vision Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00373)
*Sihao Wu,Gaojie Jin,Wei Huang,Jianhong Wang,Xiaowei Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SPO-VLM introduces a two-stage defense for Vision-Language Models by combining activation-level steering with sequence-level preference optimization to improve robustness to adversarial/ toxic prompts while preserving visual grounding and benign task performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-Language Models are vulnerable to adversarial inputs and toxic prompts. Activation steering methods exist but rely on task-specific prompts, suffer suboptimal performance and can hurt visual grounding. A general, efficient defense that maintains performance is needed.

Method: Stage I computes adaptive, layer-specific steering vectors from diverse data sources to suppress harmful behaviors during inference. Stage II refines these vectors with sequence-level preference optimization, incorporating automated toxicity assessments and visual-consistency rewards based on caption-image alignment.

Result: The approach improves safety against attacks that use activation steering and preference optimization, while maintaining strong performance on benign tasks and preserving visual understanding capabilities. A two-stage design balances efficiency with deeper policy refinement; code and models are to be released for reproducibility.

Conclusion: A two-stage SPO-VLM framework effectively merges lightweight mitigation with policy refinement to achieve robust, safe VLM behavior without sacrificing performance; the work advocates for reproducibility through released resources.

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in
integrating visual and textual information for understanding and reasoning, but
remain highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks. While activation steering has
emerged as a promising defence, existing approaches often rely on task-specific
contrastive prompts to extract harmful directions, which exhibit suboptimal
performance and can degrade visual grounding performance. To address these
limitations, we propose \textit{Sequence-Level Preference Optimization} for VLM
(\textit{SPO-VLM}), a novel two-stage defense framework that combines
activation-level intervention with policy-level optimization to enhance model
robustness. In \textit{Stage I}, we compute adaptive layer-specific steering
vectors from diverse data sources, enabling generalized suppression of harmful
behaviors during inference. In \textit{Stage II}, we refine these steering
vectors through a sequence-level preference optimization process. This stage
integrates automated toxicity assessment, as well as visual-consistency rewards
based on caption-image alignment, to achieve safe and semantically grounded
text generation. The two-stage structure of SPO-VLM balances efficiency and
effectiveness by combining a lightweight mitigation foundation in Stage I with
deeper policy refinement in Stage II. Extensive experiments shown SPO-VLM
enhances safety against attacks via activation steering and preference
optimization, while maintaining strong performance on benign tasks without
compromising visual understanding capabilities. We will release our code, model
weights, and evaluation toolkit to support reproducibility and future research.

### [29] [Adaptive Point-Prompt Tuning: Fine-Tuning Heterogeneous Foundation Models for 3D Point Cloud Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00374)
*Mengke Li,Lihao Chen,Peng Zhang,Yiu-ming Cheung,Hui Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Adaptive Point-Prompt Tuning (APPT) enables parameter-efficient adaptation of frozen foundation models to 3D point clouds by converting points to embeddings, using permutation-invariant features, and a shared-weight prompt generator to inject dynamic point-prompts into the model, avoiding explicit cross-modal mappings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D pre-training data are scarce and simple high-to-low mappings from 2D/3D data often destroy geometric structure. A general, modality-agnostic, and parameter-efficient method is needed to adapt any foundation model to 3D point clouds without heavy fine-tuning or bespoke cross-modal architectures.

Method: Transform raw point clouds into point embeddings by aggregating local geometry, followed by linear layers. Use permutation-invariant features to handle unordered points and enrich tokens with location information. Introduce a prompt generator that shares weights with the embedding module to produce dynamic point-prompts with no extra parameters. Concatenate these prompts into a frozen foundation model to guide self-attention, enabling cross-domain calibration with reduced computation.

Result: The paper proposes a viable workflow that preserves spatial geometry and minimizes trainable parameters, enabling direct point-cloud processing with frozen foundation models. While specific quantitative results are not provided in the abstract, the approach is designed to achieve competitive performance with much smaller fine-tuning cost compared to full model adaptation.

Conclusion: APPT presents a general, scalable, and parameter-efficient framework for adapting any modality to 3D point clouds by leveraging point embeddings and a weight-sharing prompt generator to inject structural cues into frozen foundation models, reducing reliance on heterogeneous cross-modal mappings.

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategies for foundation models in 1D
textual and 2D visual analysis have demonstrated remarkable efficacy. However,
due to the scarcity of point cloud data, pre-training large 3D models remains a
challenging task. While many efforts have been made to apply pre-trained visual
models to 3D domains through "high-to-low" mapping, these approaches often lead
to the loss of spatial geometries and lack a generalizable framework for
adapting any modality to 3D. This paper, therefore, attempts to directly
leverage point features to calibrate the heterogeneous foundation model of any
modality for 3D point cloud analysis. Specifically, we propose the Adaptive
Point-Prompt Tuning (APPT) method, which fine-tunes pre-trained models with a
modest number of parameters, enabling direct point cloud processing without
heterogeneous mappings. We convert raw point clouds into point embeddings by
aggregating local geometry to capture spatial features followed by linear
layers to ensure seamless utilization of frozen pre-trained models. Given the
inherent disorder of point clouds, in contrast to the structured nature of
images and language, we employ a permutation-invariant feature to capture the
relative positions of point embeddings, thereby obtaining point tokens enriched
with location information to optimize self-attention mechanisms. To calibrate
self-attention across source domains of any modality to 3D and reduce
computational overhead, we introduce a prompt generator that shares weights
with the point embedding module, dynamically producing point-prompts without
adding additional parameters. These prompts are then concatenated into a frozen
foundation model, providing rich global structural information and compensating
for the lack of structural context in the heterogeneous data.

### [30] [NoiseCutMix: A Novel Data Augmentation Approach by Mixing Estimated Noise in Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00378)
*Shumpei Takezaki,Ryoma Bise,Shinnosuke Matsuo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NoiseCutMix introduces diffusion-based data augmentation that fuses features from two classes by partially mixing their estimated noise, yielding natural, high-resolution multi-class images and improving classification performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address boundary artifacts and limited diversity in conventional multi-class augmentation (e.g., CutMix) by leveraging diffusion models' high-quality synthesis to fuse class features more naturally.

Method: Integrate partial mixing of estimated noise from two classes during the diffusion denoising process to generate images that combine characteristics of both classes. Compare against conventional multi-class augmentation, random image generation with Stable Diffusion, and combinations of these methods; provide code.

Result: Classification experiments show NoiseCutMix is effective relative to baselines and existing augmentation strategies, demonstrating improved diversity and performance; qualitative and quantitative assessments are reported; code available at the provided GitHub repository.

Conclusion: NoiseCutMix expands augmentation capabilities by integrating multi-class feature fusion within diffusion-based generation, enabling high-resolution natural fused images; future work may explore broader class merges and more extensive ablations.

Abstract: In this study, we propose a novel data augmentation method that introduces
the concept of CutMix into the generation process of diffusion models, thereby
exploiting both the ability of diffusion models to generate natural and
high-resolution images and the characteristic of CutMix, which combines
features from two classes to create diverse augmented data. Representative data
augmentation methods for combining images from multiple classes include CutMix
and MixUp. However, techniques like CutMix often result in unnatural boundaries
between the two images due to contextual differences. Therefore, in this study,
we propose a method, called NoiseCutMix, to achieve natural, high-resolution
image generation featuring the fused characteristics of two classes by
partially combining the estimated noise corresponding to two different classes
in a diffusion model. In the classification experiments, we verified the
effectiveness of the proposed method by comparing it with conventional data
augmentation techniques that combine multiple classes, random image generation
using Stable Diffusion, and combinations of these methods. Our codes are

### [31] [Domain Adaptation-Based Crossmodal Knowledge Distillation for 3D Semantic Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00379)
*Jialiang Kang,Jiawen Wang,Dingsheng Luo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Cross-modal knowledge distillation from labeled 2D images to unlabeled 3D LiDAR data to perform 3D semantic segmentation without 3D annotations, using two methods (UDAKD and FSKD) with self-calibrated convolutions to preserve modality-general information and align 3D outputs with 2D counterparts, achieving superior results to state-of-the-art.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High annotation cost for 3D LiDAR segmentation contrasts with abundant scalable 2D image datasets. A cross-modal knowledge transfer framework can leverage existing 2D models to label 3D data without dense 3D annotations.

Method: Two cross-modal distillation approaches (UDAKD and FSKD) that use spatio-temporally synchronized camera-LiDAR data. A pretrained 2D image model is applied to unlabeled 2D data; with known 2D-3D correspondences, the 3D network is guided to align its outputs with the 2D network. The approach emphasizes preserving modality-general information while filtering modality-specific cues. Self-calibrated convolution on 3D point clouds forms the backbone of the domain adaptation module.

Result: Rigorous experiments demonstrate that the proposed cross-modal distillation methods consistently outperform state-of-the-art approaches in 3D LiDAR semantic segmentation.

Conclusion: Cross-modal knowledge distillation, leveraging synchronized multi-modal data and self-calibrated 3D convolutions, enables effective 3D segmentation without 3D annotations and yields superior performance compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Semantic segmentation of 3D LiDAR data plays a pivotal role in autonomous
driving. Traditional approaches rely on extensive annotated data for point
cloud analysis, incurring high costs and time investments. In contrast,
realworld image datasets offer abundant availability and substantial scale. To
mitigate the burden of annotating 3D LiDAR point clouds, we propose two
crossmodal knowledge distillation methods: Unsupervised Domain Adaptation
Knowledge Distillation (UDAKD) and Feature and Semantic-based Knowledge
Distillation (FSKD). Leveraging readily available spatio-temporally
synchronized data from cameras and LiDARs in autonomous driving scenarios, we
directly apply a pretrained 2D image model to unlabeled 2D data. Through
crossmodal knowledge distillation with known 2D-3D correspondence, we actively
align the output of the 3D network with the corresponding points of the 2D
network, thereby obviating the necessity for 3D annotations. Our focus is on
preserving modality-general information while filtering out modality-specific
details during crossmodal distillation. To achieve this, we deploy
self-calibrated convolution on 3D point clouds as the foundation of our domain
adaptation module. Rigorous experimentation validates the effectiveness of our
proposed methods, consistently surpassing the performance of state-of-the-art
approaches in the field.

### [32] [Visually Grounded Narratives: Reducing Cognitive Burden in Researcher-Participant Interaction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00381)
*Runtong Wu,Jiayao Song,Fei Teng,Xianhao Ren,Yuyan Gao,Kailun Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NAME introduces a narrative-inquiry paradigm that converts research documents into coherent story images to ease member checking, supported by an actor location and shape module, and evaluated with three-dimensional metrics; it achieves state-of-the-art performance with far less data than baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Narrative inquiry involves heavy data-to-narrative transformation and burdens for researchers and participants during member checking; a more efficient, participant-friendly approach is needed.

Method: Proposes NAME; transforms documents into story images; includes an actor location and shape module for plausible image generation; develops a three-dimension evaluation metric; experiments across data partitions show data efficiency and quality improvements.

Result: State-of-the-art performance; with 0.96% data, FID improved from 195 to 152; 70:30 FID 152; 95:5 FID 49; new metric score 3.62 vs 2.66 baseline.

Conclusion: NAME reduces cognitive burden in narrative inquiry while improving narrative quality and robustness under varying data availability; demonstrates potential for broader adoption in narrative data analysis.

Abstract: Narrative inquiry has been one of the prominent application domains for the
analysis of human experience, aiming to know more about the complexity of human
society. However, researchers are often required to transform various forms of
data into coherent hand-drafted narratives in storied form throughout narrative
analysis, which brings an immense burden of data analysis. Participants, too,
are expected to engage in member checking and presentation of these narrative
products, which involves reviewing and responding to large volumes of
documents. Given the dual burden and the need for more efficient and
participant-friendly approaches to narrative making and representation, we made
a first attempt: (i) a new paradigm is proposed, NAME, as the initial attempt
to push the field of narrative inquiry. Name is able to transfer research
documents into coherent story images, alleviating the cognitive burden of
interpreting extensive text-based materials during member checking for both
researchers and participants. (ii) We develop an actor location and shape
module to facilitate plausible image generation. (iii) We have designed a set
of robust evaluation metrics comprising three key dimensions to objectively
measure the perceptual quality and narrative consistency of generated
characters. Our approach consistently demonstrates state-of-the-art performance
across different data partitioning schemes. Remarkably, while the baseline
relies on the full 100% of the available data, our method requires only 0.96%
yet still reduces the FID score from 195 to 152. Under identical data volumes,
our method delivers substantial improvements: for the 70:30 split, the FID
score decreases from 175 to 152, and for the 95:5 split, it is nearly halved
from 96 to 49. Furthermore, the proposed model achieves a score of 3.62 on the
newly introduced metric, surpassing the baseline score of 2.66.

### [33] [HERO-VQL: Hierarchical, Egocentric and Robust Visual Query Localization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00385)
*Joohyun Chang,Soyeon Hong,Hyogun Lee,Seong Jong Ha,Dongho Lee,Seong Tae Kim,Jinwoo Choi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HERO-VQL introduces a hierarchical egocentric visual query localization method with Top-down Attention Guidance and EgoACT, plus EgoAug diversity strategies and a consistency loss, achieving strong robustness and state-of-the-art results on the VQ2D dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Egocentric videos exhibit frequent abrupt viewpoint changes, drastic object appearance variations, and partial occlusions, making precise localizations hard for existing methods. The work aims to mimic human cognitive object recognition to improve VQL robustness.

Method: Proposes Top-down Attention Guidance (TAG) that uses the class token for high-level context and principal component score maps for fine-grained localization. Introduces EgoACT (Egocentric Augmentation based Consistency Training) to augment data by replacing queries with randomly selected groundtruth counterparts and simulating viewpoint changes by reordering frames. Also applies CT loss to enforce stable localization across augmentations, and utilizes EgoAug to enrich query diversity.

Result: Extensive experiments on the VQ2D dataset show HERO-VQL effectively handles egocentric challenges and significantly outperforms baselines.

Conclusion: HERO-VQL demonstrates robust, human-inspired localization in egocentric VQL tasks, offering improved accuracy under viewpoint variations and occlusions and setting a new benchmark on VQ2D.

Abstract: In this work, we tackle the egocentric visual query localization (VQL), where
a model should localize the query object in a long-form egocentric video.
Frequent and abrupt viewpoint changes in egocentric videos cause significant
object appearance variations and partial occlusions, making it difficult for
existing methods to achieve accurate localization. To tackle these challenges,
we introduce Hierarchical, Egocentric and RObust Visual Query Localization
(HERO-VQL), a novel method inspired by human cognitive process in object
recognition. We propose i) Top-down Attention Guidance (TAG) and ii) Egocentric
Augmentation based Consistency Training (EgoACT). Top-down Attention Guidance
refines the attention mechanism by leveraging the class token for high-level
context and principal component score maps for fine-grained localization. To
enhance learning in diverse and challenging matching scenarios, EgoAug enhances
query diversity by replacing the query with a randomly selected corresponding
object from groundtruth annotations and simulates extreme viewpoint changes by
reordering video frames. Additionally, CT loss enforces stable object
localization across different augmentation scenarios. Extensive experiments on
VQ2D dataset validate that HERO-VQL effectively handles egocentric challenges,
significantly outperforming baselines.

### [34] [Double-Constraint Diffusion Model with Nuclear Regularization for Ultra-low-dose PET Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00395)
*Mengxiao Geng,Ran Hong,Bingxuan Li,Qiegen Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A parameter-efficient diffusion-based framework (DCDM) for ultra-low-dose PET reconstruction that freezes a pre-trained diffusion model and introduces two trainable constraints (NTC and ENC) to adapt to varying dose levels without full retraining, achieving state-of-the-art results and strong generalization even at 1% dose.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ultra-low-dose PET reduces radiation and scan time but increases noise and degrades image quality. Traditional fine-tuning for each dose level is costly and brittle. A lightweight, adaptable approach is needed to maintain image quality across unknown dose reductions.

Method: Freeze the weights of a pre-trained diffusion model and insert a trainable double-constraint controller into the encoding path. The Nuclear Transformer Constraint (NTC) imposes a nuclear-norm-based low-rank constraint within a Transformer to extract compressed latent features from low-dose inputs; the Encoding Nexus Constraint (ENC) uses these compressed features to encode and control the diffusion process, producing pixel-space reconstructions. For unknown dose reductions, select the most suitable ENC to reconstruct efficiently. The approach dramatically reduces trainable parameters compared to full fine-tuning.

Result: On UDPET and Clinical datasets, DCDM outperforms state-of-the-art methods at known dose reduction factors and generalizes well to unknown DRFs, including ultra-low doses such as 1% of the full dose.

Conclusion: DCDM provides a flexible, parameter-efficient solution for ultra-low-dose PET reconstruction. By freezing diffusion weights and leveraging NTC and ENC constraints, it adapts to varying dose levels with strong reconstruction quality and robust generalization, facilitating clinical applicability without full model retraining.

Abstract: Ultra-low-dose positron emission tomography (PET) reconstruction holds
significant potential for reducing patient radiation exposure and shortening
examination times. However, it may also lead to increased noise and reduced
imaging detail, which could decrease the image quality. In this study, we
present a Double-Constraint Diffusion Model (DCDM), which freezes the weights
of a pre-trained diffusion model and injects a trainable double-constraint
controller into the encoding architecture, greatly reducing the number of
trainable parameters for ultra-low-dose PET reconstruction. Unlike full
fine-tuning models, DCDM can adapt to different dose levels without retraining
all model parameters, thereby improving reconstruction flexibility.
Specifically, the two constraint modules, named the Nuclear Transformer
Constraint (NTC) and the Encoding Nexus Constraint (ENC), serve to refine the
pre-trained diffusion model. The NTC leverages the nuclear norm as an
approximation for matrix rank minimization, integrates the low-rank property
into the Transformer architecture, and enables efficient information extraction
from low-dose images and conversion into compressed feature representations in
the latent space. Subsequently, the ENC utilizes these compressed feature
representations to encode and control the pre-trained diffusion model,
ultimately obtaining reconstructed PET images in the pixel space. In clinical
reconstruction, the compressed feature representations from NTC help select the
most suitable ENC for efficient unknown low-dose PET reconstruction.
Experiments conducted on the UDPET public dataset and the Clinical dataset
demonstrated that DCDM outperforms state-of-the-art methods on known dose
reduction factors (DRF) and generalizes well to unknown DRF scenarios, proving
valuable even at ultra-low dose levels, such as 1% of the full dose.

### [35] [DAOVI: Distortion-Aware Omnidirectional Video Inpainting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00396)
*Ryosuke Seshimo,Mariko Isogawa*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes DAOVI, a distortion-aware deep model for omnidirectional video inpainting that uses geodesic-motion evaluation and depth-aware feature propagation, achieving superior spatial-temporal consistency and quality over prior methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Omnidirectional (360°) videos have equirectangular distortion and wide FoV, causing unintended objects to appear and challenging inpainting with existing narrow-FoV methods that fail to preserve spatial/temporal consistency.

Method: A deep learning architecture named DAOVI with (1) a temporal motion evaluation module in image space using geodesic distance, and (2) a depth-aware feature propagation module in feature space to compensate for projection distortion in omnidirectional videos.

Result: Experiments show that DAOVI outperforms existing methods both quantitatively and qualitatively in inpainting omnidirectional videos.

Conclusion: DAOVI effectively addresses distortion and temporal consistency challenges in omnidirectional video inpainting, improving quality for VR, AR, and remote sensing applications.

Abstract: Omnidirectional videos that capture the entire surroundings are employed in a
variety of fields such as VR applications and remote sensing. However, their
wide field of view often causes unwanted objects to appear in the videos. This
problem can be addressed by video inpainting, which enables the natural removal
of such objects while preserving both spatial and temporal consistency.
Nevertheless, most existing methods assume processing ordinary videos with a
narrow field of view and do not tackle the distortion in equirectangular
projection of omnidirectional videos. To address this issue, this paper
proposes a novel deep learning model for omnidirectional video inpainting,
called Distortion-Aware Omnidirectional Video Inpainting (DAOVI). DAOVI
introduces a module that evaluates temporal motion information in the image
space considering geodesic distance, as well as a depth-aware feature
propagation module in the feature space that is designed to address the
geometric distortion inherent to omnidirectional videos. The experimental
results demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms existing methods both
quantitatively and qualitatively.

*Yushuo Chen,Ruizhi Shao,Youxin Pang,Hongwen Zhang,Xinyi Wu,Rihui Wu,Yebin Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Monocular-avatar reconstruction using Human4DiT-based multi-view supervision, plus video identity fine-tuning and patch-based denoising to boost detail, consistency, and high-resolution outputs, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing monocular-avatar methods struggle to capture fine-grained dynamics and plausible novel-view details due to limited representational capacity and insufficient observational data. Leveraging an advanced video-generation model to provide alternative-view supervision can enrich unseen regions and regularize the avatar model.

Method: The framework uses Human4DiT to generate human motions from alternative viewpoints as additional supervision signals. To enhance motion consistency and detail, two strategies are employed: (1) inject physical identity into the model via video fine-tuning, and (2) apply a patch-based denoising algorithm for high-resolution outputs.

Result: Experimental results show the proposed method outperforms recent state-of-the-art approaches and validate the effectiveness of the proposed strategies.

Conclusion: The approach improves reconstruction quality and robustness, enriching details in previously unseen regions and ensuring consistent motion, with the potential for higher-resolution, artifact-reduced avatar reconstructions.

Abstract: We present a novel framework to reconstruct human avatars from monocular
videos. Recent approaches have struggled either to capture the fine-grained
dynamic details from the input or to generate plausible details at novel
viewpoints, which mainly stem from the limited representational capacity of the
avatar model and insufficient observational data. To overcome these challenges,
we propose to leverage the advanced video generative model, Human4DiT, to
generate the human motions from alternative perspective as an additional
supervision signal. This approach not only enriches the details in previously
unseen regions but also effectively regularizes the avatar representation to
mitigate artifacts. Furthermore, we introduce two complementary strategies to
enhance video generation: To ensure consistent reproduction of human motion, we
inject the physical identity into the model through video fine-tuning. For
higher-resolution outputs with finer details, a patch-based denoising algorithm
is employed. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms
recent state-of-the-art approaches and validate the effectiveness of our
proposed strategies.

*Lianyu Hu,Fanhua Shang,Wei Feng,Liang Wan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LightVLM accelerates Vision-Language Models by hierarchical encoding token merging and KV-cache compression during decoding, achieving substantial speedups with minimal accuracy loss, enabling faster inference for large VLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce inference latency and improve throughput of large vision-language models without retraining, addressing bottlenecks in both encoding and decoding stages.

Method: A two-stage plug-in approach: (1) encoding uses pyramid token merging across LLM layers to retain a small set of dominant tokens; (2) decoding uses KV-cache compression to remove unnecessary caches, all training-free and compatible with existing VLMs.

Result: Maintains 100% performance when preserving 35% of image tokens and ~98% when keeping 3% tokens; achieves 2.02x network throughput and 3.65x prefilling time reduction; enables large models to infer faster than smaller ones; 3.21x faster for 4,096-token generation.

Conclusion: LightVLM is an effective, deployment-friendly method to accelerate VLM inference without retraining, delivering substantial speedups while preserving accuracy, and enabling efficient use of large Vision-Language Models in real-world deployment.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce LightVLM, a simple but effective method that can
be seamlessly deployed upon existing Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to greatly
accelerate the inference process in a training-free manner. We divide the
inference procedure of VLMs into two stages, i.e., encoding and decoding, and
propose to simultaneously accelerate VLMs in both stages to largely improve
model efficiency. During encoding, we propose pyramid token merging to reduce
tokens of different LLM layers in a hierarchical manner by finally only keeping
a few dominant tokens to achieve high efficiency. During decoding, aimed at
reducing the high latency of outputting long sequences, we propose KV Cache
compression to remove unnecessary caches to increase the network throughput.
Experimental results show that LightVLM successfully retains 100% performance
when only preserving 35% image tokens, and maintains around 98% performance
when keeping only 3% image tokens. LightVLM could 2.02$\times$ the network
throughput and reduce the prefilling time by 3.65$\times$. LightVLM also makes
large VLMs faster again by enabling a heavy model (e.g., InternVL2.5 26B) to
infer faster than significantly smaller models (e.g., InternVL2.5 8B),
hopefully facilitating the real-world deployment. When generating long text
sequences (e.g., 4096 tokens), LightVLM could reduce the inference time by
3.21$\times$, largely outperforming existing methods.

*Xuechao Zou,Shun Zhang,Xing Fu,Yue Li,Kai Li,Yushe Cao,Congyan Lang,Pin Tao,Junliang Xing*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Face-MoGLE enables controllable face generation via semantic-decoupled latent space, global/local mixture-of-experts, and a dynamic diffusion-gating mechanism for fine-grained control and zero-shot generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the trade-off between semantic controllability and photorealism in face generation by rethinking architectural roles with diffusion transformers and expert specialization.

Method: Mask-conditioned space factorization for semantic-decoupled latent modeling; a mixture of global and local experts to capture holistic structure and region-level semantics; a dynamic gating network producing time-step and location-dependent coefficients.

Result: Shows effectiveness in both multimodal and monomodal face generation and robust zero-shot generalization, with a project page for implementation.

Conclusion: Face-MoGLE offers a powerful, flexible framework for high-quality, controllable face generation with potential applications in generative modeling and security, supported by extensive experiments and a public codebase.

Abstract: Controllable face generation poses critical challenges in generative modeling
due to the intricate balance required between semantic controllability and
photorealism. While existing approaches struggle with disentangling semantic
controls from generation pipelines, we revisit the architectural potential of
Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) through the lens of expert specialization. This
paper introduces Face-MoGLE, a novel framework featuring: (1)
Semantic-decoupled latent modeling through mask-conditioned space
factorization, enabling precise attribute manipulation; (2) A mixture of global
and local experts that captures holistic structure and region-level semantics
for fine-grained controllability; (3) A dynamic gating network producing
time-dependent coefficients that evolve with diffusion steps and spatial
locations. Face-MoGLE provides a powerful and flexible solution for
high-quality, controllable face generation, with strong potential in generative
modeling and security applications. Extensive experiments demonstrate its
effectiveness in multimodal and monomodal face generation settings and its
robust zero-shot generalization capability. Project page is available at

### [39] [SemaMIL: Semantic Reordering with Retrieval-Guided State Space Modeling for Whole Slide Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00442)
*Lubin Gan,Xiaoman Wu,Jing Zhang,Zhifeng Wang,Linhao Qu,Siying Wu,Xiaoyan Sun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SemaMIL blends Semantic Reordering (SR) with a Semantic-guided Retrieval State Space Module (SRSM) to improve multiple instance learning on whole-slide images, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy with lower FLOPs and fewer parameters by preserving semantic patch relationships and enabling efficient global modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MIL on whole-slide images must capture broad histopathological context. Attention-based MIL identifies key patches but neglects relationships; transformers offer global modeling but are costly and prone to overfitting; state-space models are efficient but shuffling patch order degrades interpretability. A method that preserves semantic order while enabling scalable global reasoning is needed.

Method: Semantic Reordering (SR) clusters semantically similar patches and arranges them in a reversible permutation to create semantically meaningful sequences. Semantic-guided Retrieval State Space Module (SRSM) selects a representative subset of queries to adapt the state-space parameters, enabling global interactions with linear complexity.

Result: Evaluation on four WSI subtype datasets shows SemaMIL achieving state-of-the-art accuracy with fewer FLOPs and parameters compared to strong baselines.

Conclusion: SemaMIL effectively integrates semantic ordering with retrieval-based state-space modeling to enhance MIL on WSIs, delivering strong performance gains while maintaining efficiency and interpretability.

Abstract: Multiple instance learning (MIL) has become the leading approach for
extracting discriminative features from whole slide images (WSIs) in
computational pathology. Attention-based MIL methods can identify key patches
but tend to overlook contextual relationships. Transformer models are able to
model interactions but require quadratic computational cost and are prone to
overfitting. State space models (SSMs) offer linear complexity, yet shuffling
patch order disrupts histological meaning and reduces interpretability. In this
work, we introduce SemaMIL, which integrates Semantic Reordering (SR), an
adaptive method that clusters and arranges semantically similar patches in
sequence through a reversible permutation, with a Semantic-guided Retrieval
State Space Module (SRSM) that chooses a representative subset of queries to
adjust state space parameters for improved global modeling. Evaluation on four
WSI subtype datasets shows that, compared to strong baselines, SemaMIL achieves
state-of-the-art accuracy with fewer FLOPs and parameters.

### [40] [Stage-wise Adaptive Label Distribution for Facial Age Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00450)
*Bo Wu,Zhiqi Ai,Jun Jiang,Congcong Zhu,Shugong Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Stage-wise Adaptive Label Distribution Learning (SA-LDL) for age estimation that models stage-specific label ambiguity via adaptive variance and weighted losses, leveraging embedding similarities to reveal stage-wise ambiguity; achieves MAE of 1.74 on MORPH-II and 2.15 on FG-NET.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Label ambiguity in age estimation is not uniform across ages; existing label-distribution methods model only adjacent-age correlations and overlook varying ambiguity across age stages. A stage-aware approach could better capture structured ambiguity.

Method: Proposes SA-LDL with stage-wise adaptive variance modeling and a weighted loss within a label-distribution learning framework. Uses anchor-age embedding similarities to uncover stage-wise ambiguity patterns and jointly optimizes variance-aware distributions and weighted loss for robust age estimation.

Result: Demonstrates competitive performance with MAE values of 1.74 on MORPH-II and 2.15 on FG-NET, indicating improved robustness and accuracy.

Conclusion: Stage-wise adaptive modeling of label ambiguity captures its structured nature and improves age estimation robustness; SA-LDL offers a viable approach for datasets with stage-dependent ambiguity and may generalize to similar problems.

Abstract: Label ambiguity poses a significant challenge in age estimation tasks. Most
existing methods address this issue by modeling correlations between adjacent
age groups through label distribution learning. However, they often overlook
the varying degrees of ambiguity present across different age stages. In this
paper, we propose a Stage-wise Adaptive Label Distribution Learning (SA-LDL)
algorithm, which leverages the observation -- revealed through our analysis of
embedding similarities between an anchor and all other ages -- that label
ambiguity exhibits clear stage-wise patterns. By jointly employing stage-wise
adaptive variance modeling and weighted loss function, SA-LDL effectively
captures the complex and structured nature of label ambiguity, leading to more
accurate and robust age estimation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
SA-LDL achieves competitive performance, with MAE of 1.74 and 2.15 on the
MORPH-II and FG-NET datasets.

*Xiang Chen,Renjiu Hu,Jinwei Zhang,Yuxi Zhang,Xinyao Yue,Min Liu,Yaonan Wang,Hang Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Encoder-Only Image Registration (EOIR): an encoder-based feature extractor plus lightweight 3-layer flow estimators to build a Laplacian feature pyramid, enabling accurate, efficient, and smooth large-deformation registration while preserving diffeomorphism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address high computational cost and difficulty handling large deformations in learning-based deformable image registration. The paper posits that ConvNets help by linearizing local intensities and harmonizing global contrast, and leverages these insights via an encoder-only design to improve accuracy-efficiency trade-offs.

Method: EOIR uses a 3-layer ConvNet for feature extraction (encoder-only) and a set of 3-layer flow estimators to construct a Laplacian feature pyramid. It progressively composes diffeomorphic deformations under a large-deformation model, guided by analysis of the Horn–Schunck optical flow equation.

Result: Evaluated on five datasets across modalities and anatomical regions; EOIR achieves superior accuracy–efficiency and accuracy–smoothness trade-offs. With comparable accuracy, EOIR is more efficient and smoother; when prioritizing accuracy, EOIR yields smoother results.

Conclusion: EOIR demonstrates an effective balance between accuracy, efficiency, and deformation smoothness in deformable image registration; the approach separates feature learning from flow estimation and will release source code at the stated repository.

Abstract: Learning-based techniques have significantly improved the accuracy and speed
of deformable image registration. However, challenges such as reducing
computational complexity and handling large deformations persist. To address
these challenges, we analyze how convolutional neural networks (ConvNets)
influence registration performance using the Horn-Schunck optical flow
equation. Supported by prior studies and our empirical experiments, we observe
that ConvNets play two key roles in registration: linearizing local intensities
and harmonizing global contrast variations. Based on these insights, we propose
the Encoder-Only Image Registration (EOIR) framework, designed to achieve a
better accuracy-efficiency trade-off. EOIR separates feature learning from flow
estimation, employing only a 3-layer ConvNet for feature extraction and a set
of 3-layer flow estimators to construct a Laplacian feature pyramid,
progressively composing diffeomorphic deformations under a large-deformation
model. Results on five datasets across different modalities and anatomical
regions demonstrate EOIR's effectiveness, achieving superior
accuracy-efficiency and accuracy-smoothness trade-offs. With comparable
accuracy, EOIR provides better efficiency and smoothness, and vice versa. The
source code of EOIR will be publicly available on
https://github.com/XiangChen1994/EOIR.

TL;DR: The Jump-Jump game is proposed as a testbed to study LLM decision-making in a physics-based control task requiring spatial reasoning, physics modeling, and planning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess whether large language models can reason about dynamics and plan actions in a game-like environment, bridging cognitive tasks and AI control.

Method: Use a 'Jump-Jump' scenario where a red circle must select jumping force based on current position and distance to the next platform. The mechanics illustrate basic gameplay; the setup emphasizes interpreting state, predicting outcomes, and choosing force to maximize score.

Result: The abstract does not report empirical results; it frames the game as a basic demonstration and potential evaluation platform rather than presenting findings.

Conclusion: The Jump-Jump game offers a compact, cognitively relevant testbed for evaluating LLM decision-making across spatial reasoning, physical modeling, and strategic planning in dynamic tasks.

Abstract: The Jump-Jump game, as a simple yet challenging casual game, provides an
ideal testing environment for studying LLM decision-making capabilities. The
game requires players to precisely control jumping force based on current
position and target platform distance, involving multiple cognitive aspects
including spatial reasoning, physical modeling, and strategic planning. It
illustrates the basic gameplay mechanics of the Jump-Jump game, where the
player character (red circle) must jump across platforms with appropriate force
to maximize score.

### [43] [VideoRewardBench: Comprehensive Evaluation of Multimodal Reward Models for Video Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00484)
*Zhihong Zhang,Xiaojian Huang,Jin Xu,Zhuodong Luo,Xinzhi Wang,Jiansheng Wei,Xuejin Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A comprehensive benchmark (VideoRewardBench) for multimodal reward models in video understanding, with a large curated dataset and broad model evaluation; reveals RL does not guarantee cross-modal generalization and scaling effects are model-type dependent.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations in existing video MRMs benchmarks: small size, limited diversity, insufficient evaluation dimensions across perception, knowledge, reasoning, safety, and MRM types.

Method: AI-assisted data pipeline creates 1,563 samples (1,482 videos, 1,559 questions); each sample is a video-text triplet with a chosen and rejected response; evaluate 28 MRMs across generative, discriminative, and semi-scalar categories.

Result: Top performers (GPT-4o: 57.0% accuracy; Qwen2.5-VL-72B: 53.3%) show substantial room for improvement; key insights: RL-trained MRMs do not always improve generalization; non-discriminative MRMs benefit from inference-time scaling; frame-count effects vary by MRM type.

Conclusion: VideoRewardBench offers a challenging, valuable benchmark to advance evaluation and development of MRMs in the video domain, guiding future model and dataset design.

Abstract: Multimodal reward models (MRMs) play a crucial role in the training,
inference, and evaluation of Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) by assessing
response quality. However, existing benchmarks for evaluating MRMs in the video
domain suffer from a limited number and diversity of questions, a lack of
comprehensive evaluation dimensions, and inadequate evaluation of diverse types
of MRMs. To address these gaps, we introduce VideoRewardBench, the first
comprehensive benchmark covering four core aspects of video understanding:
perception, knowledge, reasoning, and safety. Through our AI-assisted data
pipeline, we curate a high-quality preference dataset of 1,563 annotated
samples, including 1,482 unique videos and 1,559 distinct questions--15 times
the number found in the most question-rich prior benchmark. Each sample is a
triplet consisting of a video-text prompt, a chosen response, and a rejected
response. We also conduct a comprehensive evaluation across 28 multimodal
reward models spanning three categories: generative, discriminative, and
semi-scalar. Results show that even the top-performing model GPT-4o achieves
only 57.0% overall accuracy, and the state-of-the-art open-source model
Qwen2.5-VL-72B reaches merely 53.3%. Our analysis further reveals three key
insights: (i) MRMs trained with reinforcement learning (RL) do not necessarily
exhibit stronger cross-modal generalization than those trained without RL; (ii)
except for discriminative MRMs, other types of MRMs across varying model
capacities can benefit from inference-time scaling; and (iii) variations in
input video frame count have different effects on different types of MRMs. We
believe VideoRewardBench offers a challenging and valuable benchmark for
advancing the evaluation and development of MRMs in the video domain.

*Zhongmiao Qi,Yan Jiang,Bolin Zhang,Lijun Guo,Chong Wang,Qiangbo Qian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduces STVH and its enhanced version M-STVH for fast spatiotemporal video retrieval, focusing on group activities and multi-focused feature representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the explosion of video data and the need to retrieve videos at activity granularity, not just entire videos, including both activity semantics and object-level visual features.

Method: STVH builds a unified framework modeling individual object dynamics and group interactions, capturing spatiotemporal evolution on group visual and positional features; M-STVH adds hierarchical multi-focused representation learning to jointly optimize activity semantics and object visuals.

Result: On publicly available datasets, STVH and M-STVH achieve excellent retrieval performance, demonstrating effectiveness in capturing both activity and object features.

Conclusion: STVH and M-STVH offer effective solutions for activity-focused video retrieval with a scalable, multi-feature approach; M-STVH's multi-focused design potentially provides greater flexibility for different retrieval scenarios.

Abstract: With the explosive growth of video data in various complex scenarios, quickly
retrieving group activities has become an urgent problem. However, many tasks
can only retrieve videos focusing on an entire video, not the activity
granularity. To solve this problem, we propose a new STVH (spatiotemporal
interleaved video hashing) technique for the first time. Through a unified
framework, the STVH simultaneously models individual object dynamics and group
interactions, capturing the spatiotemporal evolution on both group visual
features and positional features. Moreover, in real-life video retrieval
scenarios, it may sometimes require activity features, while at other times, it
may require visual features of objects. We then further propose a novel M-STVH
(multi-focused spatiotemporal video hashing) as an enhanced version to handle
this difficult task. The advanced method incorporates hierarchical feature
integration through multi-focused representation learning, allowing the model
to jointly focus on activity semantics features and object visual features. We
conducted comparative experiments on publicly available datasets, and both STVH
and M-STVH can achieve excellent results.

### [45] [TRUST: Token-dRiven Ultrasound Style Transfer for Cross-Device Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00508)
*Nhat-Tuong Do-Tran,Ngoc-Hoang-Lam Le,Ian Chiu,Po-Tsun Paul Kuo,Ching-Chun Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TRUST is a token-driven dual-stream UI2I framework for ultrasound that preserves content while adopting common target styles, using a Token-dRiven module to select suitable target tokens for each source token and a behavior mirror loss to align with downstream models, plus auxiliary prompts. It improves both visual quality and downstream task performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ultrasound images from different devices exhibit varied styles, causing degradation in downstream task performance. Existing UI2I methods do not explicitly filter style features relevant to the downstream task, leading to misalignment between translated images and task needs.

Method: A token-driven dual-stream framework (TRUST) with two token-based perspectives. The Token-dRiven (TR) module selects suitable/optimal target tokens for each source token from data and model viewpoints, guided by a behavior mirror loss. Auxiliary prompts are injected into the source encoder to align content representations with downstream behavior.

Result: Experimental results on ultrasound datasets show TRUST outperforms existing UI2I methods in both visual quality and downstream task performance.

Conclusion: TRUST effectively preserves source content while transferring the common target style, mitigating the style gap for ultrasound UI2I and aligning translations with downstream task requirements through token-level filtering and behavior guidance.

Abstract: Ultrasound images acquired from different devices exhibit diverse styles,
resulting in decreased performance of downstream tasks. To mitigate the style
gap, unpaired image-to-image (UI2I) translation methods aim to transfer images
from a source domain, corresponding to new device acquisitions, to a target
domain where a frozen task model has been trained for downstream applications.
However, existing UI2I methods have not explicitly considered filtering the
most relevant style features, which may result in translated images misaligned
with the needs of downstream tasks. In this work, we propose TRUST, a
token-driven dual-stream framework that preserves source content while
transferring the common style of the target domain, ensuring that content and
style remain unblended. Given multiple styles in the target domain, we
introduce a Token-dRiven (TR) module that operates from two perspectives: (1) a
data view--selecting "suitable" target tokens corresponding to each source
token, and (2) a model view--identifying ``optimal" target tokens for the
downstream model, guided by a behavior mirror loss. Additionally, we inject
auxiliary prompts into the source encoder to match content representation with
downstream behavior. Experimental results on ultrasound datasets demonstrate
that TRUST outperforms existing UI2I methods in both visual quality and
downstream task performance.

*Yasser Benigmim,Subhankar Roy,Khalid Oublal,Imad Eddine Marouf,Slim Essid,Vicky Kalogeiton,Stéphane Lathuilière*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduces Black-Box Distillation (B2D) for adapting local models using only one-hot API predictions from open-vocabulary, large-scale models; proposes ATGC, which leverages DINOv2 attention to select optimal input scales, improving pseudo-labeling and distillation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With AI-as-a-Service, users must train local models using black-box APIs that provide only predictions, not weights, data, or logits. Traditional domain adaptation fails under these constraints. The paper identifies a 'curse of resolution' where open-vocabulary models perform best at different scales, hindering effective distillation.

Method: ATtention-Guided sCaler (ATGC) uses DINOv2 attention maps to dynamically pick informative scales for black-box inference. Attention maps are scored with entropy to identify the most informative scales for pseudo-labeling, enabling effective distillation from one-hot API predictions.

Result: Experiments show substantial improvements under black-box supervision across multiple datasets, despite only one-hot API outputs; code is provided at the authors' repository.

Conclusion: Demonstrates the feasibility of Black-Box Distillation with attention-guided scale selection, enabling practical local model adaptation using AIaaS APIs while avoiding access to weights, data, or logits.

Abstract: The rise of Artificial Intelligence as a Service (AIaaS) democratizes access
to pre-trained models via Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), but also
raises a fundamental question: how can local models be effectively trained
using black-box models that do not expose their weights, training data, or
logits, a constraint in which current domain adaptation paradigms are
impractical ? To address this challenge, we introduce the Black-Box
Distillation (B2D) setting, which enables local model adaptation under
realistic constraints: (1) the API model is open-vocabulary and trained on
large-scale general-purpose data, and (2) access is limited to one-hot
predictions only. We identify that open-vocabulary models exhibit significant
sensitivity to input resolution, with different object classes being segmented
optimally at different scales, a limitation termed the "curse of resolution".
Our method, ATtention-Guided sCaler (ATGC), addresses this challenge by
leveraging DINOv2 attention maps to dynamically select optimal scales for
black-box model inference. ATGC scores the attention maps with entropy to
identify informative scales for pseudo-labelling, enabling effective
distillation. Experiments demonstrate substantial improvements under black-box
supervision across multiple datasets while requiring only one-hot API
predictions. Our code is available at https://github.com/yasserben/ATGC.

*Ruitao Wu,Yifan Zhao,Jia Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A Language-guided Bootstrapped Disentanglement (LBD) framework for Class-Incremental Semantic Segmentation (CISS) that leverages CLIP-based language semantics to disentangle prototypes and backgrounds, addressing catastrophic semantic entanglement and achieving state-of-the-art results on VOC and ADE20k in multi-step increments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CISS methods relying solely on visual feature learning suffer from catastrophic semantic entanglement (Prototype-Feature Entanglement) and Background-Increment Entanglement due to semantic misalignment and evolving data; a language-informed approach using pretrained vision-language models is proposed to restore semantic fidelity across increments.

Method: Propose Language-guided Prototypical Disentanglement that uses handcrafted text features as topological templates to guide prototype disentanglement; and Manifold Mutual Background Disentanglement that uses multiple learnable prototypes and mask-pooling-based supervision to disentangle background-increment classes. The framework incorporates soft prompt tuning and encoder adaptation to bridge CLIP performance between dense and sparse tasks.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on Pascal VOC and ADE20k, with notable gains in multi-step incremental scenarios.

Conclusion: Demonstrates that leveraging CLIP-style language semantics through targeted disentanglement strategies can mitigate catastrophic semantic entanglement in CISS and improve scalability across incremental steps, bridging dense and sparse segmentation tasks.

Abstract: Class-Incremental Semantic Segmentation (CISS) requires continuous learning
of newly introduced classes while retaining knowledge of past classes. By
abstracting mainstream methods into two stages (visual feature extraction and
prototype-feature matching), we identify a more fundamental challenge termed
catastrophic semantic entanglement. This phenomenon involves Prototype-Feature
Entanglement caused by semantic misalignment during the incremental process,
and Background-Increment Entanglement due to dynamic data evolution. Existing
techniques, which rely on visual feature learning without sufficient cues to
distinguish targets, introduce significant noise and errors. To address these
issues, we introduce a Language-inspired Bootstrapped Disentanglement framework
(LBD). We leverage the prior class semantics of pre-trained visual-language
models (e.g., CLIP) to guide the model in autonomously disentangling features
through Language-guided Prototypical Disentanglement and Manifold Mutual
Background Disentanglement. The former guides the disentangling of new
prototypes by treating hand-crafted text features as topological templates,
while the latter employs multiple learnable prototypes and mask-pooling-based
supervision for background-incremental class disentanglement. By incorporating
soft prompt tuning and encoder adaptation modifications, we further bridge the
capability gap of CLIP between dense and sparse tasks, achieving
state-of-the-art performance on both Pascal VOC and ADE20k, particularly in
multi-step scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BrainFM is a modality-agnostic, multi-task brain-imaging foundation model that uses mild-to-severe intra-subject generation and real-synth mix-up training to achieve robust performance across CT and MR tasks (synthesis, segmentation, distance, bias field, registration) across 11 datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Learning-based methods in calibrated imaging generalize poorly to uncalibrated modalities like MR, where performance is sensitive to contrast, resolution, and orientation, hindering clinical deployment across diverse protocols.

Method: Introduce BrainFM, a modality-agnostic multi-task vision foundation model trained with (i) mild-to-severe intra-subject generation and (ii) real-synth mix-up training to produce robust representations. Supports five tasks: CT and T1w/T2w/FLAIR MRI synthesis, anatomy segmentation, scalp-to-cortical distance, bias field estimation, and registration. Evaluated on eleven public datasets.

Result: BrainFM demonstrates robustness and effectiveness across all tasks and input modalities, enabling direct application to the five tasks across diverse data sources; code available at GitHub.

Conclusion: BrainFM provides a resilient, modality-agnostic brain-imaging foundation model that generalizes across modalities and tasks, addressing the generalization gap in uncalibrated imaging and supporting five core brain imaging tasks with demonstrated efficacy on multiple datasets.

Abstract: Recent learning-based approaches have made astonishing advances in calibrated
medical imaging like computerized tomography (CT), yet they struggle to
generalize in uncalibrated modalities -- notably magnetic resonance (MR)
imaging, where performance is highly sensitive to the differences in MR
contrast, resolution, and orientation. This prevents broad applicability to
diverse real-world clinical protocols. Here we introduce BrainFM, a
modality-agnostic, multi-task vision foundation model for human brain imaging.
With the proposed "mild-to-severe" intra-subject generation and "real-synth"
mix-up training strategy, BrainFM is resilient to the appearance of acquired
images (e.g., modality, contrast, deformation, resolution, artifacts), and can
be directly applied to five fundamental brain imaging tasks, including image
synthesis for CT and T1w/T2w/FLAIR MRI, anatomy segmentation, scalp-to-cortical
distance, bias field estimation, and registration. We evaluate the efficacy of
BrainFM on eleven public datasets, and demonstrate its robustness and
effectiveness across all tasks and input modalities. Code is available at

TL;DR: A cross-attention based Context-Aware Fusion (CAF) integrates global scene context with local object proposals to improve fine-grained detection, outperforming prior diffusion-based methods on CarDD.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need to overcome the limitation of local feature conditioning in diffusion-based detectors for fine-grained, context-dependent tasks; challenging domains like vehicle damage require scene-level information for reliable assessments.

Method: Introduce Context-Aware Fusion (CAF) that uses cross-attention to fuse a separate global scene encoder with local proposal features, allowing each object proposal to attend to scene-level context.

Result: Empirical results show improved performance over state-of-the-art on the CarDD benchmark, establishing new benchmarks for context-aware detection in fine-grained domains.

Conclusion: Context-aware global-to-local fusion via CAF enhances generative detection by enabling proposals to attend to environmental information, improving reliability in challenging fine-grained domains.

Abstract: Fine-grained object detection in challenging visual domains, such as vehicle
damage assessment, presents a formidable challenge even for human experts to
resolve reliably. While DiffusionDet has advanced the state-of-the-art through
conditional denoising diffusion, its performance remains limited by local
feature conditioning in context-dependent scenarios. We address this
fundamental limitation by introducing Context-Aware Fusion (CAF), which
leverages cross-attention mechanisms to integrate global scene context with
local proposal features directly. The global context is generated using a
separate dedicated encoder that captures comprehensive environmental
information, enabling each object proposal to attend to scene-level
understanding. Our framework significantly enhances the generative detection
paradigm by enabling each object proposal to attend to comprehensive
environmental information. Experimental results demonstrate an improvement over
state-of-the-art models on the CarDD benchmark, establishing new performance
benchmarks for context-aware object detection in fine-grained domains

### [50] [DGL-RSIS: Decoupling Global Spatial Context and Local Class Semantics for Training-Free Remote Sensing Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00598)
*Boyi Li,Ce Zhang,Richard M. Timmerman,Wenxuan Bao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A training-free framework (DGL-RSIS) enables open-vocabulary RS segmentation by decoupling visual/text inputs and aligning at local and global scales, using local mask proposals and a context-aware cropping strategy, plus Cross-Scale Grad-CAM to refine global context for RES.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RS semantic segmentation suffers from limited category diversity and a domain gap when transferring vision-language models from natural images to remote sensing. A training-free, open-vocabulary solution is sought to leverage VLMs without costly RS-specific fine-tuning.

Method: 1) Global-local decoupling (GLD): split text into local class nouns and global modifiers; partition images into class-agnostic mask proposals via unsupervised networks. 2) Local alignment: context-aware cropping to obtain image patches with proper boundaries; enrich text with RS-specific knowledge; match enhanced text features with mask-guided visual features for ovoss. 3) Global alignment: Cross-Scale Grad-CAM refines Grad-CAM maps using global modifiers; mask selection module fuses pixel-level Grad-CAM activations into mask-level outputs for RES.

Result: Proposes a training-free framework that enables open-vocabulary RS semantic segmentation and referring expression segmentation by combining local (mask-level) and global (Grad-CAM) alignment strategies. The approach aims to provide accurate and interpretable segmentation without RS-specific fine-tuning.

Conclusion: DGL-RSIS decouples modalities and aligns features at multiple scales, achieving interpretable RS segmentation in OVSS and RES without retraining, addressing domain shift and category diversity challenges in remote sensing.

Abstract: The emergence of vision language models (VLMs) has bridged vision and
language, enabling joint multimodal understanding beyond traditional
visual-only deep learning models. However, transferring VLMs from the natural
image domain to remote sensing (RS) segmentation remains challenging due to the
limited category diversity in RS datasets and the domain gap between natural
and RS imagery. Here, we propose a training-free framework, DGL-RSIS, that
decouples visual and textual inputs, performing visual-language alignment at
both the local semantic and global contextual levels through tailored
strategies. Specifically, we first introduce a global-local decoupling (GLD)
module, where text inputs are divided into local class nouns and global
modifiers using natural language processing (NLP) techniques; image inputs are
partitioned into a set of class-agnostic mask proposals via unsupervised mask
proposal networks. Second, visual and textual features are aligned at local
scale, through a novel context-aware cropping strategy for extracting image
patches with proper boundaries and introducing RS-specific knowledge to enrich
the text inputs. By matching the enhanced text features with mask-guided visual
features, we enable the mask classification, supporting open-vocabulary
semantic segmentation (OVSS). Third, at the global scale, we propose a
Cross-Scale Grad-CAM module to refine Grad-CAM maps using contextual
information from global modifiers. A subsequent mask selection module
integrates pixel-level Grad-CAM activations into the mask-level segmentation
output, such that accurate and interpretable alignment can be realized across
global and local dimensions for referring expression segmentation (RES).

### [51] [Towards Methane Detection Onboard Satellites](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00626)
*Maggie Chen,Hala Lambdouar,Luca Marini,Laura Martínez-Ferrer,Chris Bridges,Giacomo Acciarini*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ML-based methane plume detection using unorthorectified hyperspectral data (UnorthoDOS) matches the performance of orthorectified ML models and can outperform traditional matched-filter baselines; datasets and code are released for onboard deployment research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable timely, onboard methane detection with reduced data processing. Conventional approaches rely on orthorectification and matched filters, which add latency and downlink costs. By using unortho data, the pipeline can be simplified while maintaining accuracy.

Method: Train ML models on the UnorthoDOS dataset (unorthorectified hyperspectral images) and compare to models trained on an orthorectified dataset. Benchmark against a traditional matched-filter baseline (mag1c). Use EMIT sensor imagery. Release model checkpoints and two ML-ready datasets via Hugging Face and provide code.

Result: ML models trained on unorthoDOS achieve performance comparable to those trained on orthorectified data. Orthorectified-models can outperform the mag1c matched-filter baseline. The authors release checkpoints and two datasets (orthorectified and unorthorectified) plus code.

Conclusion: UnorthoDOS demonstrates the viability of using unorthorectified data for onboard ML methane detection, potentially reducing preprocessing steps while maintaining accuracy. Open datasets and code will foster further development and adoption.

Abstract: Methane is a potent greenhouse gas and a major driver of climate change,
making its timely detection critical for effective mitigation. Machine learning
(ML) deployed onboard satellites can enable rapid detection while reducing
downlink costs, supporting faster response systems. Conventional methane
detection methods often rely on image processing techniques, such as
orthorectification to correct geometric distortions and matched filters to
enhance plume signals. We introduce a novel approach that bypasses these
preprocessing steps by using \textit{unorthorectified} data (UnorthoDOS). We
find that ML models trained on this dataset achieve performance comparable to
those trained on orthorectified data. Moreover, we also train models on an
orthorectified dataset, showing that they can outperform the matched filter
baseline (mag1c). We release model checkpoints and two ML-ready datasets
comprising orthorectified and unorthorectified hyperspectral images from the
Earth Surface Mineral Dust Source Investigation (EMIT) sensor at
https://huggingface.co/datasets/SpaceML/UnorthoDOS , along with code at

### [52] [MV-SSM: Multi-View State Space Modeling for 3D Human Pose Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00649)
*Aviral Chharia,Wenbo Gou,Haoye Dong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MV-SSM presents a Multi-View State Space Modeling framework with a Projective State Space (PSS) block and Grid Token-guided Bidirectional Scanning (GTBS) to robustly estimate 3D human poses across varying camera configurations, achieving strong generalization and cross-dataset gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multi-view 3D pose estimation methods struggle to generalize to new camera configurations and occluded scenarios. Attention-based transformers often fail to model joint spatial arrangements and tend to overfit camera setups and scenes from training data, leading to performance drops in new settings.

Method: Propose MV-SSM that models joint spatial sequences at two levels: (1) feature level from multi-view images and (2) person keypoint level. Introduce a Projective State Space (PSS) block to learn generalized joint spatial representations via state-space modeling. Replace traditional scanning with a Grid Token-guided Bidirectional Scanning (GTBS) integrated into the PSS block. Demonstrate strong generalization across camera configurations.

Result: Experiments show strong generalization and outperformance of state-of-the-art methods: +10.8 on AP25 (+24%) on the three-camera CMU Panoptic setting; +7.0 on AP25 (+13%) with varying camera arrangements; +15.3 PCP (+38%) on Campus A1 in cross-dataset evaluation.

Conclusion: MV-SSM provides robust multi-view 3D pose estimation with improved generalization to unseen camera configurations, achieved through explicit state-space modeling of joint spatial relationships and the Grid Token-guided Bidirectional Scanning within the PSS block.

Abstract: While significant progress has been made in single-view 3D human pose
estimation, multi-view 3D human pose estimation remains challenging,
particularly in terms of generalizing to new camera configurations. Existing
attention-based transformers often struggle to accurately model the spatial
arrangement of keypoints, especially in occluded scenarios. Additionally, they
tend to overfit specific camera arrangements and visual scenes from training
data, resulting in substantial performance drops in new settings. In this
study, we introduce a novel Multi-View State Space Modeling framework, named
MV-SSM, for robustly estimating 3D human keypoints. We explicitly model the
joint spatial sequence at two distinct levels: the feature level from
multi-view images and the person keypoint level. We propose a Projective State
Space (PSS) block to learn a generalized representation of joint spatial
arrangements using state space modeling. Moreover, we modify Mamba's
traditional scanning into an effective Grid Token-guided Bidirectional Scanning
(GTBS), which is integral to the PSS block. Multiple experiments demonstrate
that MV-SSM achieves strong generalization, outperforming state-of-the-art
methods: +10.8 on AP25 (+24%) on the challenging three-camera setting in CMU
Panoptic, +7.0 on AP25 (+13%) on varying camera arrangements, and +15.3 PCP
(+38%) on Campus A1 in cross-dataset evaluations. Project Website:

*Jose Manuel Alcalde-Llergo,Aurora Ruiz-Mezcua,Rocio Avila-Ramirez,Andrea Zingoni,Juri Taborri,Enrique Yeguas-Bolivar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A neural-network-based system automatically identifies and describes jewelry at three descriptive levels using image captioning; achieves >90% captioning accuracy on a curated jewelry image dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To help translators/interpreters and non-experts access precise, hierarchical descriptions of jewelry, bridging the gap between industry expert terminology and general understanding.

Method: A three-level description framework leveraging computer vision and image captioning with encoder–decoder architectures; generates natural language descriptions at varying levels of detail; evaluates multiple captioning architectures on a curated jewelry image database; selects the encoder–decoder model for final description generation.

Result: The final model achieves captioning accuracy exceeding 90%, demonstrating effective recognition and detailed description across diverse jewelry types.

Conclusion: Proves feasibility of automatic, hierarchical jewelry description for non-expert users and translators; highlights utility of captioning-based approaches; suggests future work on broader datasets and fine-grained analyses.

Abstract: Identifying jewelry pieces presents a significant challenge due to the wide
range of styles and designs. Currently, precise descriptions are typically
limited to industry experts. However, translators and interpreters often
require a comprehensive understanding of these items. In this study, we
introduce an innovative approach to automatically identify and describe jewelry
using neural networks. This method enables translators and interpreters to
quickly access accurate information, aiding in resolving queries and gaining
essential knowledge about jewelry. Our model operates at three distinct levels
of description, employing computer vision techniques and image captioning to
emulate expert analysis of accessories. The key innovation involves generating
natural language descriptions of jewelry across three hierarchical levels,
capturing nuanced details of each piece. Different image captioning
architectures are utilized to detect jewels in images and generate descriptions
with varying levels of detail. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach
in recognizing diverse types of jewelry, we assembled a comprehensive database
of accessory images. The evaluation process involved comparing various image
captioning architectures, focusing particularly on the encoder decoder model,
crucial for generating descriptive captions. After thorough evaluation, our
final model achieved a captioning accuracy exceeding 90 per cent.

*Yifei She,Huangxuan Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FtZ (Fusion to Enhance) introduces a dual-encoder vision tower for Multimodal LLMs, combining a semantically powerful anchor encoder with a perception-rich augmenting encoder via lightweight Multi-Head Cross-Attention to improve fine-grained visual understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Single-encoder MLLMs optimize for high-level semantic alignment and often miss fine-grained visual details, creating a bottleneck between perception and reasoning.

Method: Propose a two-encoder architecture: a semantic anchor encoder plus a perception-rich augmenting encoder, connected through a lightweight Multi-Head Cross-Attention mechanism; evaluate on fine-grained vision tasks.

Result: On benchmarks requiring detailed visual understanding (TextVQA, POPE, MMMU, MME, MM-Vet), FtZ outperforms single-encoder baselines and existing fusion methods, demonstrating improved perceptual capabilities.

Conclusion: Composing heterogeneous expert encoders is an efficient and effective path to overcome visual perception bottlenecks in current MLLMs and suggests a new design paradigm for next-generation AI systems with stronger perceptual abilities.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have made significant progress in
bridging visual perception with high-level textual reasoning. However, they
face a fundamental contradiction: while excelling at complex semantic
understanding, these models often fail at basic visual tasks that require
precise detail perception. This deficiency primarily stems from the prevalent
architectural reliance on a single vision encoder optimized for high-level
semantic alignment, which inherently sacrifices the ability to capture
fine-grained visual information. To address this issue, we introduce Fusion to
Enhance (FtZ), a novel vision tower framework. FtZ moves beyond the
single-encoder design by innovatively composing a semantically powerful anchor
encoder with a perception-rich augmenting encoder via a lightweight Multi-Head
Cross-Attention mechanism. Experimental results demonstrate that on several
challenging benchmarks demanding fine-grained visual understanding, such as
TextVQA, POPE, MMMU, MME and MM-Vet, our FtZ model significantly outperforms
baselines that use only a single encoder or existing feature fusion methods.
This work proves that composing heterogeneous expert encoders is an efficient
and effective path to overcoming the visual perception bottleneck in current
MLLMs, offering a new design paradigm for building next-generation AI systems
with stronger perceptual capabilities.

### [56] [ER-LoRA: Effective-Rank Guided Adaptation for Weather-Generalized Depth Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00665)
*Weilong Yan,Xin Zhang,Robby T. Tan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Select-Tune-Maintain (STM) enables weather-generalized monocular depth estimation by rank-based PEFT of Vision Foundation Models (VFMs), achieving state-of-the-art performance with minimal high-visibility data across adverse weather conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Monocular depth estimation under adverse weather is unreliable due to lack of ground truth, domain gaps from synthetic data, and photometric violations in self-supervised learning. A parameter-efficient, knowledge-preserving adaptation method using limited normal-weather data is needed to generalize depth estimation to diverse adverse conditions.

Method: Apply parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) to Vision Foundation Models. Decompose pretrained weights into two effective ranks: entropy-rank and stable-rank. In the tuning phase, adaptively select the proper rank number and task-aware singular directions based on entropy-rank and full-tuned weights. In the maintaining phase, enforce a principal direction regularization based on stable-rank to preserve pretrained knowledge while enabling task adaptation. Evaluate on four real-world benchmarks across rain, fog, snow, and nighttime.

Result: STM outperforms existing PEFT methods and full fine-tuning, and even surpasses methods trained with adverse synthetic data and depth foundation models. Demonstrated across four real-world benchmarks under diverse weather conditions, highlighting robust weather-generalized depth estimation with limited high-visibility data.

Conclusion: Rank-aware, selective adaptation with STM provides flexible task adaptation for depth estimation while preserving pretrained generalization. This approach shows promise for geometry-centric tasks under adverse conditions and suggests broader applicability of rank-based PEFT of VFMs.

Abstract: Monocular depth estimation under adverse weather conditions (e.g.\ rain, fog,
snow, and nighttime) remains highly challenging due to the lack of reliable
ground truth and the difficulty of learning from unlabeled real-world data.
Existing methods often rely on synthetic adverse data with pseudo-labels, which
suffer from domain gaps, or employ self-supervised learning, which violates
photometric assumptions in adverse scenarios. In this work, we propose to
achieve weather--generalized depth estimation by Parameter--Efficient
Fine--Tuning (PEFT) of Vision Foundation Models (VFMs), using only a small
amount of high--visibility (normal) data. While PEFT has shown strong
performance in semantic tasks such as segmentation, it remains underexplored
for geometry--centric tasks like depth estimation -- especially in terms of
balancing effective adaptation with the preservation of pretrained knowledge.
To this end, we introduce the Selecting--Tuning--Maintaining (STM) strategy,
which structurally decomposes the pretrained weights of VFMs based on two kinds
of effective ranks (entropy--rank and stable--rank). In the tuning phase, we
adaptively select the proper rank number as well as the task--aware singular
directions for initialization, based on the entropy--rank and full--tuned
weight; while in the maintaining stage, we enforce a principal direction
regularization based on the stable--rank. This design guarantees flexible task
adaptation while preserving the strong generalization capability of the
pretrained VFM. Extensive experiments on four real--world benchmarks across
diverse weather conditions demonstrate that STM not only outperforms existing
PEFT methods and full fine--tuning but also surpasses methods trained with
adverse synthetic data, and even the depth foundation model

### [57] [LLaVA-Critic-R1: Your Critic Model is Secretly a Strong Policy Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00676)
*Xiyao Wang,Chunyuan Li,Jianwei Yang,Kai Zhang,Bo Liu,Tianyi Xiong,Furong Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Reframes critic datasets as actionable RL signals to train a base generative model, yielding a unified model (LLaVA-Critic-R1) that excels as both critic and policy in multimodal tasks, with strong benchmark gains and self-critique capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Chronic separation of evaluation critics from policy generators in vision-language models limits performance and scalability. The work investigates whether critic data can directly train a generation-capable agent that both evaluates and responds, enabling self-improvement and unified deployment.

Method: Transform preference-labeled critic data into verifiable training signals, perform reinforcement learning on a base generative model to optimize those preferences, producing LLaVA-Critic-R1 which retains full generation ability. Extend to LLaVA-Critic-R1+ by adapting stronger reasoning VLMs. Evaluate on 26 visual reasoning/understanding benchmarks and MMMU, and test self-critique at inference time.

Result: LLaVA-Critic-R1 becomes a top-performing critic and a competitive policy, outperforming base models and strong baselines (+5.7% over Qwen-2.5-VL-7B; SoTA MMMU 71.9 at 7B with LLaVA-Critic-R1+). The critic’s abilities transfer to policy performance across 26 benchmarks. Self-critique during inference yields ~13.8% gains on five reasoning tasks without new training.

Conclusion: RL training on critic data can yield a unified model that excels at both evaluation and generation, enabling scalable, self-improving multimodal systems, and offering a simple path to leverage critic data for policy optimization.

Abstract: In vision-language modeling, critic models are typically trained to evaluate
outputs -- assigning scalar scores or pairwise preferences -- rather than to
generate responses. This separation from policy models, which produce the
responses, is so entrenched that critics are rarely considered for direct
policy use. In this work, we challenge this convention. We propose to
reorganize preference-labeled critic datasets into verifiable training signals
and perform reinforcement learning directly on a base generative model,
producing LLaVA-Critic-R1, a multimodal critic trained to optimize preference
judgments while retaining full generation ability. Surprisingly,
LLaVA-Critic-R1 emerges not only as a top-performing critic but also as a
competitive policy model -- matching or surpassing specialized reasoning VLMs
trained with in-domain data across 26 visual reasoning and understanding
benchmarks, with an average gain of +5.7% over its base model (Qwen-2.5-VL-7B).
Extending this approach to existing strong reasoning VLMs yields
LLaVA-Critic-R1+, which further advances policy performance without sacrificing
critic quality, achieving a SoTA performance of 71.9 on MMMU at the 7B scale.
Finally, we show that the enhanced critic ability benefits inference: applying
self-critique at test time yields an average +13.8% improvement on five
representative reasoning tasks without additional training. Our results reveal
that RL training on critic data can produce a unified model excelling at both
evaluation and generation, offering a simple path toward scalable,
self-improving multimodal systems.

*Qingyu Wang,Xue Jiang,Guozheng Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A Cross State Fusion Mamba Network (CSFMamba) fuses HSI and LiDAR using a Mamba-based cross-state module and CNN backbone to achieve higher accuracy with lower training burden than Transformers on MUUFL and Houston2018.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: State Space Models suffer from quadratic complexity when modeling long-range spatial–spectral dependencies; while Mamba reduces computation, it cannot directly fuse multimodal features. The work aims to combine Mamba’s efficiency with effective multimodal fusion.

Method: Preprocess remote sensing data for Mamba, use CNN to extract multi-layer features, introduce a cross-state fusion module based on the Mamba operator to fuse HSI and LiDAR modalities, and integrate these into a stronger backbone.

Result: The CSFMamba network achieves superior performance compared to Transformer baselines on MUUFL and Houston2018 while reducing the network training burden.

Conclusion: Combining Mamba’s efficient time-varying-parameter state-space modeling with a cross-state fusion design enables effective multimodal fusion in remote sensing, yielding better accuracy with lower computation and training cost.

Abstract: Multimodal fusion has made great progress in the field of remote sensing
image classification due to its ability to exploit the complementary
spatial-spectral information. Deep learning methods such as CNN and Transformer
have been widely used in these domains. State Space Models recently highlighted
that prior methods suffer from quadratic computational complexity. As a result,
modeling longer-range dependencies of spatial-spectral features imposes an
overwhelming burden on the network. Mamba solves this problem by incorporating
time-varying parameters into ordinary SSM and performing hardware optimization,
but it cannot perform feature fusion directly. In order to make full use of
Mamba's low computational burden and explore the potential of internal
structure in multimodal feature fusion, we propose Cross State Fusion Mamba
(CSFMamba) Network. Specifically, we first design the preprocessing module of
remote sensing image information for the needs of Mamba structure, and combine
it with CNN to extract multi-layer features. Secondly, a cross-state module
based on Mamba operator is creatively designed to fully fuse the feature of the
two modalities. The advantages of Mamba and CNN are combined by designing a
more powerful backbone. We capture the fusion relationship between HSI and
LiDAR modalities with stronger full-image understanding. The experimental
results on two datasets of MUUFL and Houston2018 show that the proposed method
outperforms the experimental results of Transformer under the premise of
reducing the network training burden.

TL;DR: CascadeFormer introduces a two-stage cascade transformer framework for skeleton-based action recognition, combining masked pretraining with cascading fine-tuning to learn transferable representations and improve discriminative classification, achieving competitive results on Penn Action, N-UCLA, and NTU RGB+D 60; code and checkpoints are released.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To surpass GCN-centric approaches in skeleton action recognition by leveraging transformer-based masked pretraining for generalizable representations and cascading fine-tuning for discriminative action classification.

Method: A two-stage cascade of transformers: (1) masked pretraining on skeleton sequences to learn general representations; (2) cascading fine-tuning tailored for action discrimination. Evaluated on Penn Action, N-UCLA, NTU RGB+D 60; code and model checkpoints released.

Result: Competitive performance across the benchmark datasets, demonstrating the viability of cascade transformers for skeleton-based action recognition.

Conclusion: Masked pretraining plus cascading fine-tuning is effective for skeleton action recognition, and the authors provide code and checkpoints to facilitate reproducibility.

Abstract: Skeleton-based human action recognition leverages sequences of human joint
coordinates to identify actions performed in videos. Owing to the intrinsic
spatiotemporal structure of skeleton data, Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs)
have been the dominant architecture in this field. However, recent advances in
transformer models and masked pretraining frameworks open new avenues for
representation learning. In this work, we propose CascadeFormer, a family of
two-stage cascading transformers for skeleton-based human action recognition.
Our framework consists of a masked pretraining stage to learn generalizable
skeleton representations, followed by a cascading fine-tuning stage tailored
for discriminative action classification. We evaluate CascadeFormer across
three benchmark datasets (Penn Action N-UCLA, and NTU RGB+D 60), achieving
competitive performance on all tasks. To promote reproducibility, we release
our code and model checkpoints.

### [60] [Prompt the Unseen: Evaluating Visual-Language Alignment Beyond Supervision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00700)
*Raehyuk Jung,Seungjun Yu,Hyunjung Shim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A benchmark is proposed to test how well the projection layer in Vision-Language Models generalizes to unseen visual concepts. The study finds substantial unseen-effect generalization (about 79–88% of seen performance), and reveals the projection layer behaves like a key-value memory, supporting data-efficient alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Projection layers map visual features to the LLM space, but their ability to generalize to unseen concepts isn’t well understood. Evaluating this is crucial for data-efficient VLM training.

Method: Adapt rich, fine-grained object-detection datasets into a prompting format with train/test splits that have disjoint label sets. Cross-validate seen vs unseen performance and perform a mechanistic interpretability analysis of the projection layer, treating its FFN as a potential key-value memory.

Result: Projection layers retain about 79–88% of the performance on unseen classes compared to seen ones across settings, indicating non-trivial generalization. Mechanistic analysis suggests the FFN behaves similarly for seen and unseen tokens.

Conclusion: The work provides a new evaluation framework for alignment/generalization in VLMs and supports the possibility of efficient training with limited aligned data.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) combine a vision encoder and a large language
model (LLM) through alignment training, showing strong performance on
multimodal tasks. A central component in this architecture is the projection
layer, which maps visual features into the LLM's embedding space. Despite its
importance, its ability to generalize to unseen visual concepts has not been
systematically evaluated. To address this, we propose a benchmark for
evaluating projection-layer generalization. We adapt object detection datasets
(rich in fine-grained annotations) into a prompting format and design
train/test splits with disjoint label sets, enabling precise control over seen
and unseen concept separation. Experimental results show that the projection
layer retains about 79 to 88 percent of the performance on unseen classes
compared to seen ones across various settings, suggesting a non-trivial level
of generalization even without explicit alignment supervision on those
concepts. We further analyze this behavior through a mechanistic
interpretability lens. Our findings indicate that the feed-forward network in
the projection layer functions like a key-value memory, processing seen and
unseen tokens in similar ways. This study introduces a new evaluation framework
for alignment generalization and highlights the potential for efficient VLM
training with limited aligned data.

*Kuniko Paxton,Koorosh Aslansefat,Dhavalkumar Thakker,Yiannis Papadopoulos,Tanaya Maslekar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a fairness algorithm for skin lesion classification that reduces skin-tone bias by measuring skewness in CNN feature maps (VGG) and ViT patches/heads to suppress skin-tone related channels, lowering compute and potentially shrinking model size while maintaining fairness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address diagnostic bias across skin tones in deep learning skin lesion classifiers; existing fairness verification is challenging due to skin-tone classification, high compute, and verification complexity.

Method: Compute skewness of feature maps in CNN conv layers and ViT patches/heads; identify and suppress channels associated with skin tone; focus on lesion area; avoid traditional statistical fairness methods; reduce computation and model size; applied to skin-lesion classification networks (VGG and ViT).

Result: Claims to reduce unnecessary channels related to skin tone, lower computational costs, mitigate bias, no reliance on classical statistics; potential reduction in model size while maintaining fairness; practical for real-world deployment.

Conclusion: A practical fairness solution for skin lesion classification across varying skin tones; improves fairness and efficiency, enabling real-world use.

Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning have significantly improved the accuracy of
skin lesion classification models, supporting medical diagnoses and promoting
equitable healthcare. However, concerns remain about potential biases related
to skin color, which can impact diagnostic outcomes. Ensuring fairness is
challenging due to difficulties in classifying skin tones, high computational
demands, and the complexity of objectively verifying fairness. To address these
challenges, we propose a fairness algorithm for skin lesion classification that
overcomes the challenges associated with achieving diagnostic fairness across
varying skin tones. By calculating the skewness of the feature map in the
convolution layer of the VGG (Visual Geometry Group) network and the patches
and the heads of the Vision Transformer, our method reduces unnecessary
channels related to skin tone, focusing instead on the lesion area. This
approach lowers computational costs and mitigates bias without relying on
conventional statistical methods. It potentially reduces model size while
maintaining fairness, making it more practical for real-world applications.

### [62] [Causal Interpretation of Sparse Autoencoder Features in Vision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00749)
*Sangyu Han,Yearim Kim,Nojun Kwak*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CaFE is a causal explanation framework for vision transformers with sparse auto-encoder features. It uses Effective Receptive Field (ERF) to identify image patches that causally drive each feature activation, revealing that naive activation maps can be misleading due to cross-patch dependencies in self-attention. Patch-insertion tests show CaFE yields more faithful, semantically precise explanations than activation-ranked patches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Self-attention in vision transformers mixes information across the image, so activation locations of SAE features may not causally drive activations. There is a need for causal, context-aware explanations that reveal which patches actually drive a feature.

Method: Introduce CaFE. For each activation of an SAE feature, treat it as a target and apply input-attribution methods guided by the Effective Receptive Field (ERF) to identify patches that causally drive that activation. Analyze ERF maps across CLIP-ViT features and validate with patch-insertion tests to compare with activation-based explanations.

Result: ERF maps often diverge from naive activation maps, exposing hidden context dependencies (e.g., a roaring face feature depends on co-occurring eyes and nose). Patch-insertion tests show CaFE more reliably recovers or suppresses feature activations than using activation-ranked patches.

Conclusion: CaFE provides more faithful and semantically precise explanations of vision-SAE features and cautions against relying solely on activation locations due to potential misinterpretations from self-attention.

Abstract: Understanding what sparse auto-encoder (SAE) features in vision transformers
truly represent is usually done by inspecting the patches where a feature's
activation is highest. However, self-attention mixes information across the
entire image, so an activated patch often co-occurs with-but does not cause-the
feature's firing. We propose Causal Feature Explanation (CaFE), which leverages
Effective Receptive Field (ERF). We consider each activation of an SAE feature
to be a target and apply input-attribution methods to identify the image
patches that causally drive that activation. Across CLIP-ViT features, ERF maps
frequently diverge from naive activation maps, revealing hidden context
dependencies (e.g., a "roaring face" feature that requires the co-occurrence of
eyes and nose, rather than merely an open mouth). Patch insertion tests confirm
that CaFE more effectively recovers or suppresses feature activations than
activation-ranked patches. Our results show that CaFE yields more faithful and
semantically precise explanations of vision-SAE features, highlighting the risk
of misinterpretation when relying solely on activation location.

Motivation: Captions often describe abstract events, causality, and long narratives requiring world knowledge; existing vision-language retrieval struggles with these cases; need to integrate language reasoning with multimodal retrieval.

Method: Multi-stage pipeline: 1) dense article retrieval; 2) event-aware language model reranking for contextual alignment; 3) efficient image collection; 4) caption-guided semantic matching; 5) rank-aware selection; fusion via Reciprocal Rank Fusion across configurations; utilizes Qwen3 for article search, Qwen3-Reranker for alignment, Qwen2-VL for image scoring; code at GitHub.

Result: Top-1 on private Track 2 test set in EVENTA 2025 Grand Challenge; demonstrates effectiveness of combining language-based reasoning with multimodal retrieval for complex tasks; showcases robustness via ensemble.

Conclusion: Shows that integrating language models with multimodal retrieval improves event-based image understanding; the approach is effective for real-world, complex narratives and can be extended with additional configurations.

Abstract: Event-based image retrieval from free-form captions presents a significant
challenge: models must understand not only visual features but also latent
event semantics, context, and real-world knowledge. Conventional
vision-language retrieval approaches often fall short when captions describe
abstract events, implicit causality, temporal context, or contain long, complex
narratives. To tackle these issues, we introduce a multi-stage retrieval
framework combining dense article retrieval, event-aware language model
reranking, and efficient image collection, followed by caption-guided semantic
matching and rank-aware selection. We leverage Qwen3 for article search,
Qwen3-Reranker for contextual alignment, and Qwen2-VL for precise image
scoring. To further enhance performance and robustness, we fuse outputs from
multiple configurations using Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF). Our system achieves
the top-1 score on the private test set of Track 2 in the EVENTA 2025 Grand
Challenge, demonstrating the effectiveness of combining language-based
reasoning and multimodal retrieval for complex, real-world image understanding.

*Y Hop Nguyen,Doan Anh Phan Huu,Trung Thai Tran,Nhat Nam Mai,Van Toi Giap,Thao Thi Phuong Dao,Trung-Nghia Le*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A unified multimodal framework for ENT endoscopy using a CLIP ViT-B/16 backbone enhanced with Low-Rank Adaptation, multi-level CLS token aggregation, and spherical feature interpolation, guided by class-specific prompts; achieves strong classification and retrieval performance in a low-resource clinical setting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional CNN-based pipelines struggle to capture cross-modal semantics and perform well with limited medical data. There's a need to align visual ENT endoscopy findings with textual diagnostic context to support classification and retrieval tasks.

Method: Fine-tune a CLIP ViT-B/16 backbone with Low-Rank Adaptation, incorporate multi-level CLS token aggregation and spherical feature interpolation. Employ class-specific natural language prompts to guide the image encoder and train with a joint objective combining supervised classification and contrastive learning, enabling image classification, image-to-image retrieval, and text-to-image retrieval.

Result: Classification achieves 95% accuracy and F1-score; image-to-image Recall@1 = 0.93; text-to-image Recall@1 = 0.92; MRR scores 0.97 (image-to-image) and 0.96 (text-to-image). Ablation studies show incremental gains from each component.

Conclusion: The proposed architecture provides robust multimodal medical understanding in low-resource ENT settings, and its components synergistically improve cross-modal semantic alignment for classification and retrieval tasks.

Abstract: We present a unified vision-language framework tailored for ENT endoscopy
image analysis that simultaneously tackles three clinically-relevant tasks:
image classification, image-to-image retrieval, and text-to-image retrieval.
Unlike conventional CNN-based pipelines that struggle to capture cross-modal
semantics, our approach leverages the CLIP ViT-B/16 backbone and enhances it
through Low-Rank Adaptation, multi-level CLS token aggregation, and spherical
feature interpolation. These components collectively enable efficient
fine-tuning on limited medical data while improving representation diversity
and semantic alignment across modalities. To bridge the gap between visual
inputs and textual diagnostic context, we introduce class-specific natural
language prompts that guide the image encoder through a joint training
objective combining supervised classification with contrastive learning. We
validated our framework through participation in the ACM MM'25 ENTRep Grand
Challenge, achieving 95% accuracy and F1-score in classification, Recall@1 of
0.93 and 0.92 for image-to-image and text-to-image retrieval respectively, and
MRR scores of 0.97 and 0.96. Ablation studies demonstrated the incremental
benefits of each architectural component, validating the effectiveness of our
design for robust multimodal medical understanding in low-resource clinical
settings.

*Xiufeng Huang,Ziyuan Luo,Qi Song,Ruofei Wang,Renjie Wan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A generalizable, single-pass watermarking framework for Splatter Image-based 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) that enables efficient protection, robust extraction, and high imperceptibility via GaussianBridge, perceptual heatmaps, and dense segmentation-based retrieval.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiency of existing 3DGS watermarking methods that require expensive fine-tuning for each message, and to provide a generalizable, efficient, and robust protection mechanism for 3DGS models.

Method: Introduce GaussianBridge to convert unstructured 3D Gaussians into Splatter Image format suitable for neural processing; embed arbitrary messages in a single forward pass; use a Gaussian-Uncertainty-Perceptual heatmap to preserve visual quality; implement dense segmentation-based extraction to reliably recover messages even when watermarked content occupies small screen regions.

Result: The framework enables efficient, one-pass watermark embedding and robust extraction while maintaining visual fidelity; demonstrated feasibility through the proposed pipeline and mechanisms, with reliable recovery under challenging rendering scenarios.

Conclusion: A novel, generalizable watermarking framework for Splatter Image-based 3DGS models that achieves efficient protection and robust message extraction, with careful imperceptibility control via uncertainty-aware perceptual heatmaps and a dense segmentation-based decoder.

Abstract: The growing popularity of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has intensified the
need for effective copyright protection. Current 3DGS watermarking methods rely
on computationally expensive fine-tuning procedures for each predefined
message. We propose the first generalizable watermarking framework that enables
efficient protection of Splatter Image-based 3DGS models through a single
forward pass. We introduce GaussianBridge that transforms unstructured 3D
Gaussians into Splatter Image format, enabling direct neural processing for
arbitrary message embedding. To ensure imperceptibility, we design a
Gaussian-Uncertainty-Perceptual heatmap prediction strategy for preserving
visual quality. For robust message recovery, we develop a dense
segmentation-based extraction mechanism that maintains reliable extraction even
when watermarked objects occupy minimal regions in rendered views. Project

### [66] [No More Sibling Rivalry: Debiasing Human-Object Interaction Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00760)
*Bin Yang,Yulin Zhang,Hong-Yu Zhou,Sibei Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes debiasing methods to mitigate Toxic Siblings bias in detection transformers for HOI; introduces contrastive-then-calibration and merge-then-split objectives to improve input and output learning, achieving significant mAP gains on HICO-Det.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High confusion among similar HOI triplets (sibling categories) causes interference and degraded precision; existing models struggle due to bias across input and output sides of interaction decoder.

Method: Two objectives: (1) contrastive-then-calibration: sample sibling-like incorrect HOI triplets and reconstruct correct ones using positional priors; (2) merge-then-split: learn shared features among sibling categories, then refine intra-group differentiation to preserve uniqueness.

Result: Significant improvements: +9.18% mAP on HICO-Det over baseline, +3.59% mAP over SOTA across settings.

Conclusion: Debiasing objectives effectively address Toxic Siblings bias, enabling better HOI detection with transformers.

Abstract: Detection transformers have been applied to human-object interaction (HOI)
detection, enhancing the localization and recognition of human-action-object
triplets in images. Despite remarkable progress, this study identifies a
critical issue-"Toxic Siblings" bias-which hinders the interaction decoder's
learning, as numerous similar yet distinct HOI triplets interfere with and even
compete against each other both input side and output side to the interaction
decoder. This bias arises from high confusion among sibling
triplets/categories, where increased similarity paradoxically reduces
precision, as one's gain comes at the expense of its toxic sibling's decline.
To address this, we propose two novel debiasing learning
objectives-"contrastive-then-calibration" and "merge-then-split"-targeting the
input and output perspectives, respectively. The former samples sibling-like
incorrect HOI triplets and reconstructs them into correct ones, guided by
strong positional priors. The latter first learns shared features among sibling
categories to distinguish them from other groups, then explicitly refines
intra-group differentiation to preserve uniqueness. Experiments show that we
significantly outperform both the baseline (+9.18% mAP on HICO-Det) and the
state-of-the-art (+3.59% mAP) across various settings.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A new dataset InterPose with 73.8k sequences of 3D human motions and text captions is automatically extracted from 45.8k videos featuring human-object interactions to enable versatile high-fidelity motion generation and zero-shot animation with an LLM-based agent.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a lack of large-scale, diverse datasets of human-object interactions for training and evaluating 3D motion generation models, hindering realistic animation in complex scenes.

Method: An automatic motion extraction pipeline is used to collect interaction-rich human motions and captions from videos, constructing the InterPose dataset; extensive experiments show improvements to state-of-the-art motion generation; an LLM-based agent enables zero-shot animation of people interacting with diverse objects/scenes.

Result: InterPose significantly improves state-of-the-art motion generation methods; enables zero-shot animation capabilities via an LLM-based agent for varied objects and scenes.

Conclusion: The dataset fills a critical data gap for human-object interactions, enabling scalable, high-fidelity motion generation and interactive animation in diverse environments, with practical use in graphics and robotics.

Abstract: Human motion generation has shown great advances thanks to the recent
diffusion models trained on large-scale motion capture data. Most of existing
works, however, currently target animation of isolated people in empty scenes.
Meanwhile, synthesizing realistic human-object interactions in complex 3D
scenes remains a critical challenge in computer graphics and robotics. One
obstacle towards generating versatile high-fidelity human-object interactions
is the lack of large-scale datasets with diverse object manipulations. Indeed,
existing motion capture data is typically restricted to single people and
manipulations of limited sets of objects. To address this issue, we propose an
automatic motion extraction pipeline and use it to collect interaction-rich
human motions. Our new dataset InterPose contains 73.8K sequences of 3D human
motions and corresponding text captions automatically obtained from 45.8K
videos with human-object interactions. We perform extensive experiments and
demonstrate InterPose to bring significant improvements to state-of-the-art
methods for human motion generation. Moreover, using InterPose we develop an
LLM-based agent enabling zero-shot animation of people interacting with diverse
objects and scenes.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes Cancelable Product Quantization (CPQ), a two-stage secure face retrieval framework that combines fast, cancelable PQ indexing with a fine-grained cipher-space ranking to balance privacy, efficiency, and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Outsourcing face retrieval raises portrait privacy risks. Homomorphic encryption (HE) offers security but is too slow for real-time use; there is a need for efficient, secure retrieval approaches.

Method: A hierarchical two-stage framework: (i) a high-throughput cancelable PQ indexing module for fast candidate filtering; (ii) a fine-grained cipher-space retrieval module for precise ranking. Includes a tailored protection mechanism to secure the indexing module for cancelable biometric authentication while maintaining efficiency.

Result: Experiments on benchmark datasets show a decent balance between effectiveness, efficiency, and security, indicating practical viability.

Conclusion: The CPQ framework provides an efficient, privacy-preserving solution for face retrieval, achieving favorable trade-offs and potential applicability in real-world systems.

Abstract: Despite the ubiquity of modern face retrieval systems, their retrieval stage
is often outsourced to third-party entities, posing significant risks to user
portrait privacy. Although homomorphic encryption (HE) offers strong security
guarantees by enabling arithmetic computations in the cipher space, its high
computational inefficiency makes it unsuitable for real-time, real-world
applications. To address this issue, we propose Cancelable Product
Quantization, a highly efficient framework for secure face representation
retrieval. Our hierarchical two-stage framework comprises: (i) a
high-throughput cancelable PQ indexing module for fast candidate filtering, and
(ii) a fine-grained cipher-space retrieval module for final precise face
ranking. A tailored protection mechanism is designed to secure the indexing
module for cancelable biometric authentication while ensuring efficiency.
Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method achieves an
decent balance between effectiveness, efficiency and security.

*Zeyu Li,Annan Shu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AAGLSD is a hierarchical line segment detector that uses aligned anchor groups to progressively link anchors into complete line segments with simple validation and merging, achieving high precision and completeness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing line segment detectors often struggle to recover complete line segments with high accuracy; a detector that leverages hierarchical saliency and aligned anchor groups can improve completeness and precision without heavy refinement.

Method: Extract candidate pixels through a hierarchical process with regular anchors and aligned anchor groups; begin from aligned groups, sequentially link anchors while updating the current predicted line segment; finalize by validating and merging adjacent segments, avoiding complex refinement.

Result: Evaluations on multiple datasets show that AAGLSD effectively extracts complete line segments and outperforms or matches state-of-the-art LSD methods; code is available at the provided GitHub URL.

Conclusion: AAGLSD provides an efficient, accurate line segment detection framework that achieves high completeness with simple post-processing and without heavy refinement, supported by public code.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel line segment detector, the Aligned Anchor
Groups guided Line Segment Detector (AAGLSD), designed to detect line segments
from images with high precision and completeness. The algorithm employs a
hierarchical approach to extract candidate pixels with different saliency
levels, including regular anchors and aligned anchor groups. AAGLSD initiates
from these aligned anchor groups, sequentially linking anchors and updating the
currently predicted line segment simultaneously. The final predictions are
derived through straightforward validation and merging of adjacent line
segments, avoiding complex refinement strategies. AAGLSD is evaluated on
various datasets and quantitative experiments demonstrate that the proposed
method can effectively extract complete line segments from input images
compared to other advanced line segment detectors. The implementation is
available at https://github.com/LLiDaBao/AAGLSD.

*Ganxi Xu,Jinyi Long,Jia Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A diffusion-based image-to-brain framework with cross-attention, conditioning a DDPM using CLIP-derived visual features to generate biologically plausible brain signals, evaluated on THINGS-EEG2 and THINGS-MEG with subject-wise topography analyses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite advances in visual prostheses, brain encoding often yields brain signals lacking biological plausibility; there's a need for supervised signals from real brain responses to validate and improve stimulus generation.

Method: Two-stage architecture: a pre-trained CLIP visual encoder extracts semantic features from input images; a cross-attention enhanced U-Net diffusion model learns to reconstruct brain signals through iterative denoising, with cross-attention enabling dynamic interaction between visual features and brain representations; training on two multimodal datasets (THINGS-EEG2, THINGS-MEG).

Result: The approach yields biologically plausible brain signals and captures intra- and inter-subject variability, with visualizations of training/test M/EEG topographies demonstrating alignment with expected patterns.

Conclusion: Cross-attention diffusion with CLIP conditioning improves brain encoding for visual prostheses by producing more biologically plausible brain signals and enabling interpretable, subject-aware topographical analyses; it addresses supervised signal limitations and shows promise for enhancing brain-initiated prosthetic decoding.

Abstract: Visual prostheses have shown great potential in restoring vision for blind
individuals. On the one hand, researchers have been continuously improving the
brain decoding framework of visual prostheses by leveraging the powerful image
generation capabilities of diffusion models. On the other hand, the brain
encoding stage of visual prostheses struggles to generate brain signals with
sufficient biological similarity. Although existing works have recognized this
problem, the quality of predicted stimuli still remains a critical issue, as
existing approaches typically lack supervised signals from real brain responses
to validate the biological plausibility of predicted stimuli. To address this
issue, we propose a novel image-to-brain framework based on denoising diffusion
probabilistic models (DDPMs) enhanced with cross-attention mechanisms. Our
framework consists of two key architectural components: a pre-trained CLIP
visual encoder that extracts rich semantic representations from input images,
and a cross-attention enhanced U-Net diffusion model that learns to reconstruct
biologically plausible brain signals through iterative denoising. Unlike
conventional generative models that rely on simple concatenation for
conditioning, our cross-attention modules enable dynamic interaction between
visual features and brain signal representations, facilitating fine-grained
alignment during the generation process. We evaluate our framework on two
multimodal datasets (THINGS-EEG2 and THINGS-MEG) to demonstrate its
effectiveness in generating biologically plausible brain signals. Moreover, we
visualize the training and test M/EEG topographies for all subjects on both
datasets to intuitively demonstrate the intra-subject variations and
inter-subject variations in M/EEG signals.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OmniReason introduces spatiotemporal reasoning for vision-language models in autonomous driving via OmniReason-Data and OmniReason-Agent, achieving state-of-the-art planning and VQA with interpretable, temporally coherent explanations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLMs excel at static scene understanding but neglect the temporal dynamics essential for real-world driving, limiting robust decision-making and interpretability in dynamic environments.

Method: Two large-scale VLA datasets (OmniReason-Data) with dense spatiotemporal annotations and explanations, created via a hallucination-mitigated auto-labeling pipeline. An OmniReason-Agent architecture with a sparse temporal memory for persistent scene context, an explanation generator for human-interpretable rationales, and spatiotemporal knowledge distillation to capture causal patterns.

Result: State-of-the-art performance on open-loop planning tasks and VQA benchmarks in dynamic driving scenarios, with enhanced interpretability and temporally-aware decision reasoning.

Conclusion: The framework advances robust spatiotemporal reasoning for autonomous vehicles, enabling better planning and explainable decisions in dynamic environments, while establishing a scalable data-and-model approach that could extend to broader spatiotemporal AI tasks.

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated impressive
spatial reasoning capabilities for autonomous driving, yet existing methods
predominantly focus on static scene understanding while neglecting the
essential temporal dimension of real-world driving scenarios. To address this
critical limitation, we propose the OmniReason framework, which establishes
robust spatiotemporal reasoning by jointly modeling dynamic 3D environments and
their underlying decision-making processes. Our work makes two fundamental
advances: (1) We introduce OmniReason-Data, two large-scale
vision-language-action (VLA) datasets with dense spatiotemporal annotations and
natural language explanations, generated through a novel
hallucination-mitigated auto-labeling pipeline that ensures both physical
plausibility and temporal coherence; (2) We develop the OmniReason-Agent
architecture, which integrates a sparse temporal memory module for persistent
scene context modeling and an explanation generator that produces
human-interpretable decision rationales, facilitated by our spatiotemporal
knowledge distillation approach that effectively captures spatiotemporal causal
reasoning patterns. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art
performance, where OmniReason-Agent achieves significant improvements in both
open-loop planning tasks and visual question answering (VQA) benchmarks, while
establishing new capabilities for interpretable, temporally-aware autonomous
vehicles operating in complex, dynamic environments.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MI-RAG introduces an iterative, reasoning-guided multimodal RAG that formulates multi-queries from an accumulated reasoning record and searches across visually-grounded and textual KBs, progressively refining knowledge for knowledge-intensive VQA, achieving better retrieval and accuracy on Encyclopedic VQA, InfoSeek, and OK-VQA.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Single-pass RAG often struggles to gather enough external knowledge for complex, knowledge-heavy visual questions. An iterative, reasoning-driven, multimodal retrieval approach is needed to improve knowledge gathering and integration over multiple steps.

Method: At each iteration, MI-RAG uses an accumulated reasoning record to dynamically formulate a multi-query that drives a joint search across heterogeneous knowledge bases containing both visually-grounded and textual knowledge. Newly retrieved knowledge is synthesized into the reasoning record, updating and refining understanding across iterations.

Result: The approach yields significant improvements in both retrieval recall and answer accuracy on challenging benchmarks (Encyclopedic VQA, InfoSeek, OK-VQA), demonstrating a scalable path for compositional reasoning in knowledge-intensive VQA.

Conclusion: MI-RAG provides a scalable, iterative multimodal retrieval-and-reasoning framework that enhances knowledge-intensive VQA by progressively incorporating diverse knowledge sources and refining reasoning across iterations.

Abstract: While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have significantly advanced
multimodal understanding, their performance remains limited on
knowledge-intensive visual questions that require external knowledge beyond the
image. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has become a promising solution for
providing models with external knowledge, its conventional single-pass
framework often fails to gather sufficient knowledge. To overcome this
limitation, we propose MI-RAG, a Multimodal Iterative RAG framework that
leverages reasoning to enhance retrieval and update reasoning over newly
retrieved knowledge across modalities. At each iteration, MI-RAG leverages an
accumulated reasoning record to dynamically formulate a multi-query. These
queries then drive a joint search across heterogeneous knowledge bases
containing both visually-grounded and textual knowledge. The newly acquired
knowledge is synthesized into the reasoning record, progressively refining
understanding across iterations. Experiments on challenging benchmarks,
including Encyclopedic VQA, InfoSeek, and OK-VQA, show that MI-RAG
significantly improves both retrieval recall and answer accuracy, establishing
a scalable approach for compositional reasoning in knowledge-intensive VQA.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes semantic-guided 3D Gaussian Splatting for underwater scene reconstruction by integrating language-driven semantics (via CLIP) into Gaussian primitives, with a semantic consistency loss and stage-wise coarse-to-fine training, achieving state-of-the-art PSNR gains on underwater datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Underwater 3D reconstruction is challenged by light distortion, turbidity, and limited visibility, and current AI methods do not fully exploit semantic information or language-vision synergy to guide geometry and texture in reconstruction.

Method: A multimodal cross-knowledge framework that embeds semantic features into each Gaussian primitive and uses CLIP-derived semantics for supervision. Introduces a semantic consistency loss to align reconstruction with high-level scene understanding, and employs a stage-wise training strategy combining coarse-to-fine learning with late-stage parameter refinement.

Result: The approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods on SeaThru-NeRF and Submerged3D datasets across three metrics, with an average PSNR improvement of up to 3.09 dB.

Conclusion: Semantic-guided 3D Gaussian Splatting offers robust, high-fidelity deep-sea reconstructions and holds promise for advancing underwater exploration and marine perception.

Abstract: Accurate 3D reconstruction in underwater environments remains a complex
challenge due to issues such as light distortion, turbidity, and limited
visibility. AI-based techniques have been applied to address these issues,
however, existing methods have yet to fully exploit the potential of AI,
particularly in integrating language models with visual processing. In this
paper, we propose a novel framework that leverages multimodal cross-knowledge
to create semantic-guided 3D Gaussian Splatting for robust and high-fidelity
deep-sea scene reconstruction. By embedding an extra semantic feature into each
Gaussian primitive and supervised by the CLIP extracted semantic feature, our
method enforces semantic and structural awareness throughout the training. The
dedicated semantic consistency loss ensures alignment with high-level scene
understanding. Besides, we propose a novel stage-wise training strategy,
combining coarse-to-fine learning with late-stage parameter refinement, to
further enhance both stability and reconstruction quality. Extensive results
show that our approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods on
SeaThru-NeRF and Submerged3D datasets across three metrics, with an improvement
of up to 3.09 dB on average in terms of PSNR, making it a strong candidate for
applications in underwater exploration and marine perception.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A plug-and-play adaptive contrast adjustment module (ACAM) for fetal ultrasound plane classification improves model accuracy across models by learning contrast parameters via a shallow network to create multiple contrast-enhanced views for robust, physics-informed, multi-view fusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ultrasound images suffer from low tissue contrast, boundary ambiguity, and operator-dependent variability. There is a need for a content-aware, robust preprocessing step that bridges low-level features to high-level semantic classification.

Method: Introduce ACAM, a plug-and-play module with a shallow texture-sensitive network predicting contrast parameters. It generates multiple contrast-enhanced views through differentiable mappings and fuses them within downstream classifiers. The approach mirrors clinical contrast adjustment and uses physics-informed transformations for robustness across imaging heterogeneity.

Result: Validated on 12,400 images across six anatomical categories, ACAM improves accuracy: lightweight models +2.02%, traditional models +1.29%, state-of-the-art models +1.15%.

Conclusion: ACAM provides content-aware, physics-informed adaptive contrast adjustments that align with sonographer workflows, improving robustness to image quality variations and bridging low-level features with high-level semantics, suggesting a new paradigm for medical image analysis.

Abstract: Fetal ultrasound standard plane classification is essential for reliable
prenatal diagnosis but faces inherent challenges, including low tissue
contrast, boundary ambiguity, and operator-dependent image quality variations.
To overcome these limitations, we propose a plug-and-play adaptive contrast
adjustment module (ACAM), whose core design is inspired by the clinical
practice of doctors adjusting image contrast to obtain clearer and more
discriminative structural information. The module employs a shallow
texture-sensitive network to predict clinically plausible contrast parameters,
transforms input images into multiple contrast-enhanced views through
differentiable mapping, and fuses them within downstream classifiers. Validated
on a multi-center dataset of 12,400 images across six anatomical categories,
the module consistently improves performance across diverse models, with
accuracy of lightweight models increasing by 2.02 percent, accuracy of
traditional models increasing by 1.29 percent, and accuracy of state-of-the-art
models increasing by 1.15 percent. The innovation of the module lies in its
content-aware adaptation capability, replacing random preprocessing with
physics-informed transformations that align with sonographer workflows while
improving robustness to imaging heterogeneity through multi-view fusion. This
approach effectively bridges low-level image features with high-level
semantics, establishing a new paradigm for medical image analysis under
real-world image quality variations.

*Xinlei Liu,Tao Hu,Peng Yi,Weitao Han,Jichao Xie,Baolin Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A gradient-based adversarial attack (SDM) reframes the objective as maximizing the gap between the non-true labels' probability upper bound and the true label's probability, using a three-layer cycle-stage-step framework with stage-specific losses to progressively worsen the model's predictions. It achieves stronger, more cost-effective attacks and can bolster defenses when combined with adversarial training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the effectiveness and efficiency of adversarial attacks for evaluating CV model robustness, addressing limitations of prior methods in how the objective is optimized and how attack progress is structured.

Method: Introduce Sequential Difference Maximization (SDM) with a cycle-stage-step optimization: cycles and steps are structurally identical, but loss functions differ by stage. Stage 1 minimizes the true-label probability (negative true probability) to compress the solution space. Stages 2+ deploy the Directional Probability Difference Ratio (DPDR) loss to gradually raise the upper bound of non-true label probabilities by shrinking irrelevant labels, thereby increasing the difference between non-true upper bound and true probability. This is a gradient-based attack that can be combined with adversarial training.

Result: Empirical evaluations show SDM achieves stronger attack performance than state-of-the-art methods and higher attack cost-effectiveness. The approach also complements adversarial training, enhancing defensive effects. Code is available at the provided GitHub repository.

Conclusion: SDM provides a new, effective optimization objective and practical attack framework that yields stronger, more efficient adversarial examples and can contribute to improving defenses when used with adversarial training.

Abstract: Efficient adversarial attack methods are critical for assessing the
robustness of computer vision models. In this paper, we reconstruct the
optimization objective for generating adversarial examples as "maximizing the
difference between the non-true labels' probability upper bound and the true
label's probability," and propose a gradient-based attack method termed
Sequential Difference Maximization (SDM). SDM establishes a three-layer
optimization framework of "cycle-stage-step." The processes between cycles and
between iterative steps are respectively identical, while optimization stages
differ in terms of loss functions: in the initial stage, the negative
probability of the true label is used as the loss function to compress the
solution space; in subsequent stages, we introduce the Directional Probability
Difference Ratio (DPDR) loss function to gradually increase the non-true
labels' probability upper bound by compressing the irrelevant labels'
probabilities. Experiments demonstrate that compared with previous SOTA
methods, SDM not only exhibits stronger attack performance but also achieves
higher attack cost-effectiveness. Additionally, SDM can be combined with
adversarial training methods to enhance their defensive effects. The code is
available at https://github.com/X-L-Liu/SDM.

Result: Average AUC of 0.939 across datasets; ablation confirms optimal filter size and noise probability are key contributors to performance.

Conclusion: The approach yields robust defect detection across textures by integrating local and global features with targeted noise suppression and orientation/frequency emphasis, with parameter tuning driving gains across datasets.

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel approach to enhance the accuracy and reliability
of texture-based surface defect detection using Gabor filters and a blurring
U-Net-ViT model. By combining the local feature training of U-Net with the
global processing of the Vision Transformer(ViT), the model effectively detects
defects across various textures. A Gaussian filter-based loss function removes
background noise and highlights defect patterns, while Salt-and-Pepper(SP)
masking in the training process reinforces texture-defect boundaries, ensuring
robust performance in noisy environments. Gabor filters are applied in
post-processing to emphasize defect orientation and frequency characteristics.
Parameter optimization, including filter size, sigma, wavelength, gamma, and
orientation, maximizes performance across datasets like MVTec-AD, Surface Crack
Detection, and Marble Surface Anomaly Dataset, achieving an average Area Under
the Curve(AUC) of 0.939. The ablation studies validate that the optimal filter
size and noise probability significantly enhance defect detection performance.

*Zhijing Wu,Longguang Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: End-to-end optimization that jointly learns camera poses and a 3D Gaussian-based scene representation for dynamic scenes from monocular video, boosting reconstruction and pose accuracy under motion blur.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Motion blur contaminates pose estimation and degrades dynamic scene reconstruction; a unified optimization can mitigate error accumulation by coupling pose and scene representation.

Method: Model dynamic scenes as per-primitive SE(3) affine transformations on 3D Gaussians (3DGS); formulate a unified objective; three-stage training: train Gaussians with fixed poses, optimize poses with fixed Gaussians, then joint optimization.

Result: Significant gains in reconstruction quality and pose estimation accuracy on Stereo Blur dataset and real-world sequences compared to prior dynamic deblurring methods.

Conclusion: Unified pose-and-scene optimization improves robustness to motion blur and yields better reconstruction and pose estimates; demonstrates effectiveness of end-to-end coupling of camera Poses and 3D Gaussian scene representation.

Abstract: Reconstructing dynamic 3D scenes from monocular video has broad applications
in AR/VR, robotics, and autonomous navigation, but often fails due to severe
motion blur caused by camera and object motion. Existing methods commonly
follow a two-step pipeline, where camera poses are first estimated and then 3D
Gaussians are optimized. Since blurring artifacts usually undermine pose
estimation, pose errors could be accumulated to produce inferior reconstruction
results. To address this issue, we introduce a unified optimization framework
by incorporating camera poses as learnable parameters complementary to 3DGS
attributes for end-to-end optimization. Specifically, we recast camera and
object motion as per-primitive SE(3) affine transformations on 3D Gaussians and
formulate a unified optimization objective. For stable optimization, we
introduce a three-stage training schedule that optimizes camera poses and
Gaussians alternatively. Particularly, 3D Gaussians are first trained with
poses being fixed, and then poses are optimized with 3D Gaussians being
untouched. Finally, all learnable parameters are optimized together. Extensive
experiments on the Stereo Blur dataset and challenging real-world sequences
demonstrate that our method achieves significant gains in reconstruction
quality and pose estimation accuracy over prior dynamic deblurring methods.

*Sicheng Yang,Hongqiu Wang,Zhaohu Xing,Sixiang Chen,Lei Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SegDINO presents an efficient segmentation method by freezing a DINOv3 backbone and using a lightweight MLP decoder to produce segmentation masks from multi-level features, achieving state-of-the-art results across six benchmarks (three medical, three natural) with reduced parameter count.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Segmentation with self-supervised DINO features is hindered by heavy decoders and high computational costs. There is a need for an efficient approach that preserves the power of foundation features while minimizing trainable parameters.

Method: Freeze the pretrained DINOv3 encoder to extract multi-level features. Align features to a common resolution and channel width. Apply a lightweight MLP head to directly predict segmentation masks, avoiding heavy decoders or complex upsampling. Trainable parameters are minimized while leveraging strong foundation features.

Result: Segmentations achieve state-of-the-art performance consistently across six benchmarks, including three medical datasets (TN3K, Kvasir-SEG, ISIC) and three natural-image datasets (MSD, VMD-D, ViSha). Code is available at the provided URL.

Conclusion: Efficiently leveraging frozen foundation representations with a compact decoder can deliver strong segmentation performance with reduced parameter overhead, making SegDINO a practical, high-performance segmentation framework.

Abstract: The DINO family of self-supervised vision models has shown remarkable
transferability, yet effectively adapting their representations for
segmentation remains challenging. Existing approaches often rely on heavy
decoders with multi-scale fusion or complex upsampling, which introduce
substantial parameter overhead and computational cost. In this work, we propose
SegDINO, an efficient segmentation framework that couples a frozen DINOv3
backbone with a lightweight decoder. SegDINO extracts multi-level features from
the pretrained encoder, aligns them to a common resolution and channel width,
and utilizes a lightweight MLP head to directly predict segmentation masks.
This design minimizes trainable parameters while preserving the
representational power of foundation features. Extensive experiments across six
benchmarks, including three medical datasets (TN3K, Kvasir-SEG, ISIC) and three
natural image datasets (MSD, VMD-D, ViSha), demonstrate that SegDINO
consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to existing
methods. Code is available at https://github.com/script-Yang/SegDINO.

*Jongwook Si,Sungyoung Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Hybrid SUFERNOBWA dehazing framework combining Swin Transformer and U-Net with SwinRRDB blocks and a watershed-guided loss, achieving state-of-the-art PSNR/SSIM on RICE and SateHaze1K.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Atmospheric haze degrades satellite imagery, reducing information extraction accuracy. A model that balances global context with local detail while preserving structural integrity is needed.

Method: Proposes SUFERNOBWA, a hybrid architecture that uses SwinRRDB blocks in both encoder and decoder to capture global context and fine spatial details. It employs a composite loss combining L2, guided loss, and a novel watershed loss to enhance boundary preservation and pixel-level accuracy.

Result: Outperforms existing methods on RICE and SateHaze1K datasets. On RICE, achieves PSNR 33.24 dB and SSIM 0.967, indicating substantial improvement in both fidelity and structural preservation.

Conclusion: The approach provides an effective solution for mitigating atmospheric interference in satellite imagery, delivering robust dehazing with preserved structural consistency, applicable across diverse remote sensing tasks.

Abstract: Satellite imagery plays a crucial role in various fields; however,
atmospheric interference and haze significantly degrade image clarity and
reduce the accuracy of information extraction. To address these challenges,
this paper proposes a hybrid dehazing framework that integrates Swin
Transformer and U-Net to balance global context learning and local detail
restoration, called SUFERNOBWA. The proposed network employs SwinRRDB, a Swin
Transformer-based Residual-in-Residual Dense Block, in both the encoder and
decoder to effectively extract features. This module enables the joint learning
of global contextual information and fine spatial structures, which is crucial
for structural preservation in satellite image. Furthermore, we introduce a
composite loss function that combines L2 loss, guided loss, and a novel
watershed loss, which enhances structural boundary preservation and ensures
pixel-level accuracy. This architecture enables robust dehazing under diverse
atmospheric conditions while maintaining structural consistency across restored
images. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms
state-of-the-art models on both the RICE and SateHaze1K datasets. Specifically,
on the RICE dataset, the proposed approach achieved a PSNR of 33.24 dB and an
SSIM of 0.967, which is a significant improvement over existing method. This
study provides an effective solution for mitigating atmospheric interference in
satellite imagery and highlights its potential applicability across diverse
remote sensing applications.

### [80] [Look Beyond: Two-Stage Scene View Generation via Panorama and Video Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00843)
*Xueyang Kang,Zhengkang Xiang,Zezheng Zhang,Kourosh Khoshelham*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A two-stage NVS method that first extrapolates a 360-degree panorama from a single image and then warps keyframes into a video diffusion model, achieving globally coherent views along arbitrary trajectories, including loop closures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Single-image novel view synthesis is highly ill-posed; existing methods struggle to maintain long-range coherence and handle loop closure. A global scene prior and stable anchors are needed to ensure consistent views across trajectories.

Method: Stage 1: Learn a panorama diffusion model from the input perspective image to capture a 360-degree scene prior; sample and warp perspective keyframes from the panorama to serve as anchors. Stage 2: Use a pre-trained video diffusion model conditioned on these anchors and a spatial noise diffusion process to generate novel views along a user-defined trajectory.

Result: The approach yields globally consistent novel views along long trajectories and loop closures, outperforming existing methods on diverse scene datasets. Code is released by the authors.

Conclusion: A two-stage panorama-to-video diffusion framework provides long-term view and scene consistency, flexible camera control, and robust performance for single-image NVS.

Abstract: Novel view synthesis (NVS) from a single image is highly ill-posed due to
large unobserved regions, especially for views that deviate significantly from
the input. While existing methods focus on consistency between the source and
generated views, they often fail to maintain coherence and correct view
alignment across long-range or looped trajectories. We propose a model that
addresses this by decomposing single-view NVS into a 360-degree scene
extrapolation followed by novel view interpolation. This design ensures
long-term view and scene consistency by conditioning on keyframes extracted and
warped from a generated panoramic representation. In the first stage, a
panorama diffusion model learns the scene prior from the input perspective
image. Perspective keyframes are then sampled and warped from the panorama and
used as anchor frames in a pre-trained video diffusion model, which generates
novel views through a proposed spatial noise diffusion process. Compared to
prior work, our method produces globally consistent novel views -- even in loop
closure scenarios -- while enabling flexible camera control. Experiments on
diverse scene datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing
methods in generating coherent views along user-defined trajectories. Our
implementation is available at https://github.com/YiGuYT/LookBeyond.

### [81] [Quantization Meets OOD: Generalizable Quantization-aware Training from a Flatness Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00859)
*Jiacheng Jiang,Yuan Meng,Chen Tang,Han Yu,Qun Li,Zhi Wang,Wenwu Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: QAT improves ID accuracy but harms OOD generalization; FQAT introduces layer-wise freezing and a disorder-guided adaptive freezing strategy to align optimization with loss flatness, yielding better ID and OOD performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing QAT methods optimize for in-distribution accuracy and often degrade performance on out-of-distribution data. There is a tension between flatness of the loss landscape (often linked to good OOD generalization) and QAT’s tendency to sharpen the landscape.

Method: Propose FQAT: (1) layer-wise freezing to reduce gradient conflicts between vanilla QAT objectives and flatness objectives; (2) a disorder-guided adaptive freezing algorithm that dynamically selects which layers to freeze each step using a gradient disorder metric to identify unstable layers; (3) evaluation on standard OOD benchmarks for image classification showing improved generalization.

Result: Extensive experiments on influential OOD benchmarks show FQAT outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on both ID and OOD image classification tasks, indicating better generalization under distribution shifts.

Conclusion: FQAT offers a practical QAT framework that promotes loss flatness and reduces inter-layer interference, achieving superior generalization for quantized models on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution data.

Abstract: Current quantization-aware training (QAT) methods primarily focus on
enhancing the performance of quantized models on in-distribution (I.D) data,
while overlooking the potential performance degradation on out-of-distribution
(OOD) data. In this paper, we first substantiate this problem through rigorous
experiment, showing that QAT can lead to a significant OOD generalization
performance degradation. Further, we find the contradiction between the
perspective that flatness of loss landscape gives rise to superior OOD
generalization and the phenomenon that QAT lead to a sharp loss landscape, can
cause the above problem. Therefore, we propose a flatness-oriented QAT method,
FQAT, to achieve generalizable QAT. Specifically, i) FQAT introduces a
layer-wise freezing mechanism to mitigate the gradient conflict issue between
dual optimization objectives (i.e., vanilla QAT and flatness). ii) FQAT
proposes an disorder-guided adaptive freezing algorithm to dynamically
determines which layers to freeze at each training step, effectively addressing
the challenges caused by interference between layers. A gradient disorder
metric is designed to help the algorithm identify unstable layers during
training. Extensive experiments on influential OOD benchmark demonstrate the
superiority of our method over state-of-the-art baselines under both I.D and
OOD image classification tasks.

*Zirui Zhou,Zizhao Peng,Dongyang Jin,Chao Fan,Fengwei An,Shiqi Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A pose-based scoliosis screening framework (DRF) using the extended Scoliosis1K-Pose dataset achieves state-of-the-art results by fusing a continuous skeleton map with a discrete Postural Asymmetry Vector (PAV), guided by a PAV-Guided Attention module; dataset and code are released.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address (1) scarcity of large-scale, annotated pose datasets for scoliosis screening and (2) the noise and discreteness of pose coordinates that hamper modeling subtle asymmetries, while enhancing clinical interpretability of pose-based methods.

Method: Extend Scoliosis1K to Scoliosis1K-Pose with 447,900 frames of 2D keypoints from 1,050 adolescents. Propose a Dual Representation Framework (DRF) that combines a continuous skeleton map to preserve spatial structure with a discrete Postural Asymmetry Vector (PAV) encoding clinically relevant asymmetry descriptors. Introduce a PAV-Guided Attention (PGA) module that uses PAV as a clinical prior to guide feature extraction from the skeleton map, focusing on meaningful asymmetries.

Result: Extensive experiments show DRF achieves state-of-the-art performance. Visualizations indicate the model leverages clinical asymmetry cues to guide feature extraction and reveals synergy between the dual representations.

Conclusion: DRF demonstrates the effectiveness of dual representations and the PGA module in clinically meaningful pose-based scoliosis screening; the dataset and code are publicly available for further research.

Abstract: Recent AI-based scoliosis screening methods primarily rely on large-scale
silhouette datasets, often neglecting clinically relevant postural
asymmetries-key indicators in traditional screening. In contrast, pose data
provide an intuitive skeletal representation, enhancing clinical
interpretability across various medical applications. However, pose-based
scoliosis screening remains underexplored due to two main challenges: (1) the
scarcity of large-scale, annotated pose datasets; and (2) the discrete and
noise-sensitive nature of raw pose coordinates, which hinders the modeling of
subtle asymmetries. To address these limitations, we introduce
Scoliosis1K-Pose, a 2D human pose annotation set that extends the original
Scoliosis1K dataset, comprising 447,900 frames of 2D keypoints from 1,050
adolescents. Building on this dataset, we introduce the Dual Representation
Framework (DRF), which integrates a continuous skeleton map to preserve spatial
structure with a discrete Postural Asymmetry Vector (PAV) that encodes
clinically relevant asymmetry descriptors. A novel PAV-Guided Attention (PGA)
module further uses the PAV as clinical prior to direct feature extraction from
the skeleton map, focusing on clinically meaningful asymmetries. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that DRF achieves state-of-the-art performance.
Visualizations further confirm that the model leverages clinical asymmetry cues
to guide feature extraction and promote synergy between its dual
representations. The dataset and code are publicly available at

*Yutong Gao,Maoyuan Shao,Xinyang Huang,Chuang Zhu,Lijuan Sun,Yu Weng,Xuan Liu,Guoshun Nan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Spotlighter is a lightweight token-selection framework for prompt tuning in CLIP that jointly uses sample-wise and semantic-wise token activations, a class-specific semantic memory bank, and a two-level ranking to select the most informative visual tokens, improving accuracy and efficiency with minimal parameter overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Redundant or weakly relevant visual features introduce noise and increase computation in prompt tuning for cross-modal alignment. A compact, effective token selection mechanism is needed to boost accuracy while reducing cost.

Method: Spotlighter evaluates each visual token's activation from both sample-wise and semantic-wise perspectives and retains the top-scoring tokens. It uses a class-specific semantic memory bank of learned prototypes to refine selection and compensate for discarded features. A two-level ranking mechanism dynamically weights token–prototype interactions to prioritize informative signals.

Result: Empirical evaluation on 11 few-shot benchmarks shows Spotlighter outperforms CLIP by up to 11.19 percentage points in harmonic mean accuracy and delivers up to ~0.8K additional FPS, with only 21 extra parameters.

Conclusion: Spotlighter provides an effective and scalable baseline for prompt tuning by reducing noise and computation while maintaining or improving accuracy, with minimal parameter overhead.

Abstract: CLIP's success has demonstrated that prompt tuning can achieve robust
cross-modal semantic alignment for tasks ranging from open-domain recognition
to fine-grained classification. However, redundant or weakly relevant feature
components introduce noise and incur unnecessary computational costs. In this
work, we propose Spotlighter, a lightweight token-selection framework that
simultaneously enhances accuracy and efficiency in prompt tuning. Spotlighter
evaluates each visual token's activation from both sample-wise and
semantic-wise perspectives and retains only the top-scoring tokens for
downstream prediction. A class-specific semantic memory bank of learned
prototypes refines this selection, ensuring semantic representativeness and
compensating for discarded features. To further prioritize informative signals,
we introduce a two-level ranking mechanism that dynamically weights
token--prototype interactions. Across 11 few-shot benchmarks, Spotlighter
outperforms CLIP by up to 11.19\% in harmonic mean accuracy and achieves up to
0.8K additional FPS, with only 21 extra parameters. These results establish
Spotlighter as an effective and scalable baseline for prompt tuning. Code for

TL;DR: IPG speeds up adversarial patch generation (up to 11.1x) with comparable attack efficacy, enabling broader vulnerability coverage and potential defensive and real-world applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Adversarial patches disrupt CV systems by attacking targeted image regions, posing robustness challenges. There is a need for more efficient, scalable patch-generation methods to study vulnerabilities and to build defenses across domains.

Method: Introduce Incremental Patch Generation (IPG), an iterative approach that generates patches with improved efficiency. The work includes ablation studies and visualizations (e.g., YOLO feature distributions) and leverages adversarial training to produce patches that generalize across models.

Result: IPG achieves up to 11.1× efficiency gains over existing approaches while maintaining comparable attack performance. The generated patches generalize well to cover broader model vulnerabilities, and IPG-derived datasets can support robust model construction and defense strategies.

Conclusion: IPG holds promise for future use in adversarial patch defense and real-world applications (autonomous vehicles, security, medical imaging), where AI models must remain resilient in dynamic, high-stakes environments.

Abstract: The advent of adversarial patches poses a significant challenge to the
robustness of AI models, particularly in the domain of computer vision tasks
such as object detection. In contradistinction to traditional adversarial
examples, these patches target specific regions of an image, resulting in the
malfunction of AI models. This paper proposes Incremental Patch Generation
(IPG), a method that generates adversarial patches up to 11.1 times more
efficiently than existing approaches while maintaining comparable attack
performance. The efficacy of IPG is demonstrated by experiments and ablation
studies including YOLO's feature distribution visualization and adversarial
training results, which show that it produces well-generalized patches that
effectively cover a broader range of model vulnerabilities. Furthermore,
IPG-generated datasets can serve as a robust knowledge foundation for
constructing a robust model, enabling structured representation, advanced
reasoning, and proactive defenses in AI security ecosystems. The findings of
this study suggest that IPG has considerable potential for future utilization
not only in adversarial patch defense but also in real-world applications such
as autonomous vehicles, security systems, and medical imaging, where AI models
must remain resilient to adversarial attacks in dynamic and high-stakes
environments.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DarkVRAI introduces a conditioning scheme that leverages capture metadata for video denoising, plus a Burst-Order Selective Scan (BOSS) to model long-range temporal dependencies, achieving state-of-the-art results and winning the AIM 2025 Low-light RAW Video Denoising Challenge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Low-light RAW video denoising is severely challenging due to noise amplification from high sensor gain and short exposure times, which are constrained by video frame rates. There is a need to effectively utilize available capture metadata and long-range temporal information to improve denoising performance while maintaining video coherence.

Method: 1) A conditioning scheme that uses capture metadata to guide alignment and denoising in a video denoising pipeline. 2) Burst-Order Selective Scan (BOSS), a mechanism that models long-range temporal dependencies across the noisy frame sequence to improve denoising stability and quality.

Result: DarkVRAI achieved first place in the AIM 2025 Low-light RAW Video Denoising Challenge and demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on a rigorous benchmark dataset.

Conclusion: The combination of metadata-conditioned denoising and long-range temporal modeling via BOSS effectively addresses the challenges of low-light RAW video denoising, setting a new standard and offering a path for further research in leveraging capture metadata and temporal structure.

Abstract: Low-light RAW video denoising is a fundamentally challenging task due to
severe signal degradation caused by high sensor gain and short exposure times,
which are inherently limited by video frame rate requirements. To address this,
we propose DarkVRAI, a novel framework that achieved first place in the AIM
2025 Low-light RAW Video Denoising Challenge. Our method introduces two primary
contributions: (1) a successful application of a conditioning scheme for image
denoising, which explicitly leverages capture metadata, to video denoising to
guide the alignment and denoising processes, and (2) a Burst-Order Selective
Scan (BOSS) mechanism that effectively models long-range temporal dependencies
within the noisy video sequence. By synergistically combining these components,
DarkVRAI demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on a rigorous and realistic
benchmark dataset, setting a new standard for low-light video denoising.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LangDC uses a lightweight language model to convert video clips into soft caption tokens and dynamically adjusts token compression based on semantic density, reducing compute while preserving task performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Video-language models are bottlenecked by processing大量 visual tokens; fixed compression ratios fail to reflect scene richness, leading to under- or over-compression across clips.

Method: A lightweight language model describes video clips into soft tokens as visual representations; semantic density-aware supervision trains the system to preserve key cues; compression ratio is dynamically adjusted by the length/complexity of descriptions; evaluation shows reduced FLOPs with competitive accuracy.

Result: The approach achieves about 49% FLOPs reduction compared to VideoGPT+ while maintaining competitive performance; qualitative results show adaptive token compression aligned with scene richness.

Conclusion: Language-aware dynamic token compression can effectively balance information preservation and compute efficiency by modulating token quantity according to semantic density of scenes.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large video-language models have revolutionized video
understanding tasks. However, their efficiency is significantly constrained by
processing high volumes of visual tokens. Existing token compression strategies
apply a fixed compression ratio, ignoring the variability in semantic density
among different video clips. Consequently, this lead to inadequate
representation of information-rich clips due to insufficient tokens and
unnecessary computation on static or content-poor ones. To address this, we
propose LangDC, a Language-aware Dynamic Token Compressor. LangDC leverages a
lightweight language model to describe video clips, converting them into soft
caption tokens as visual representations. Trained with our proposed semantic
density-aware supervision, LangDC aims to 1) cover key visual cues necessary
for downstream task reasoning and 2) dynamically adjust compression ratios
based on scene richness, reflected by descriptions length. Our design mimics
how humans dynamically express what they see: complex scenes (seeing more)
elicit more detailed language to convey nuances (saying more), whereas simpler
scenes are described with fewer words. Experimental results show that our
method reduces FLOPs by 49% compared to VideoGPT+ while maintaining competitive
performance. Furthermore, qualitative results demonstrate our approach
adaptively adjusts the token compression ratio based on video segment richness.

### [87] [Towards Integrating Multi-Spectral Imaging with Gaussian Splatting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00989)
*Josef Grün,Lukas Meyer,Maximilian Weiherer,Bernhard Egger,Marc Stamminger,Linus Franke*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Joint optimization of RGB and multi-spectral data within 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) outperforms separate or staged strategies, improving spectral fidelity and providing cross-modal benefits to RGB; multi-spectral reflectance is best modeled via spherical-harmonics color components per Gaussian.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Naive per-band optimization of additional spectra in 3DGS leads to inconsistently appearing geometry across spectral domains, despite identical underlying geometry. A robust fusion of multi-spectral data is needed to achieve accurate, coherent 3D reconstructions across modalities.

Method: Compare three strategies on multi-spectral data: (1) separate per-band reconstruction with no shared structure; (2) split optimization by first optimizing RGB geometry, copying it, then fitting each new band with joint geometry and band representation; (3) joint optimization across modalities, optionally after an initial RGB-only phase. Propose integrating multi-spectral data into the spherical-harmonics color components to model each Gaussian’s multi-spectral reflectance.

Result: Quantitative metrics and qualitative novel-view renderings on multi-spectral datasets show the dedicated Joint strategy yields better spectral reconstruction and also enhances RGB results via spectral cross-talk.

Conclusion: Joint, multispectral-aware optimization within 3DGS, with SH-based modeling of multi-spectral reflectance, is advantageous. The work also discusses trade-offs regarding when to introduce spectral bands during optimization and provides practical insights for robust multi-modal 3DGS reconstruction.

Abstract: We present a study of how to integrate color (RGB) and multi-spectral imagery
(red, green, red-edge, and near-infrared) into the 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)
framework, a state-of-the-art explicit radiance-field-based method for fast and
high-fidelity 3D reconstruction from multi-view images. While 3DGS excels on
RGB data, naive per-band optimization of additional spectra yields poor
reconstructions due to inconsistently appearing geometry in the spectral
domain. This problem is prominent, even though the actual geometry is the same,
regardless of spectral modality. To investigate this, we evaluate three
strategies: 1) Separate per-band reconstruction with no shared structure. 2)
Splitting optimization, in which we first optimize RGB geometry, copy it, and
then fit each new band to the model by optimizing both geometry and band
representation. 3) Joint, in which the modalities are jointly optimized,
optionally with an initial RGB-only phase. We showcase through quantitative
metrics and qualitative novel-view renderings on multi-spectral datasets the
effectiveness of our dedicated optimized Joint strategy, increasing overall
spectral reconstruction as well as enhancing RGB results through spectral
cross-talk. We therefore suggest integrating multi-spectral data directly into
the spherical harmonics color components to compactly model each Gaussian's
multi-spectral reflectance. Moreover, our analysis reveals several key
trade-offs in when and how to introduce spectral bands during optimization,
offering practical insights for robust multi-modal 3DGS reconstruction.

Abstract: Coral reefs are on the brink of collapse, with climate change, ocean
acidification, and pollution leading to a projected 70-90% loss of coral

success hinges on introducing automation to upscale efforts. We present
automated deployment of coral re-seeding devices powered by artificial
intelligence, computer vision, and robotics. Specifically, we perform automated
substrate classification, enabling detection of areas of the seafloor suitable
for coral growth, thus significantly reducing reliance on human experts and
increasing the range and efficiency of restoration. Real-world testing of the
algorithms on the Great Barrier Reef leads to deployment accuracy of 77.8%,
sub-image patch classification of 89.1%, and real-time model inference at 5.5

Motivation: Under adverse weather, reduced visibility and traction raise crash risk. Understanding how experienced drivers adapt their gaze can inform robust driver monitoring systems (DMS) and advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS).

Method: A case study analyzing eye gaze of a single driver on the same highway route under clear and rainy conditions. Gaze points clustered within 10-second windows, then cluster centroids aggregated into meta-clusters. Markov transition matrices and metrics (fixation duration, gaze elevation, azimuth) used to compare conditions.

Result: Rainy conditions increase dashboard glances, prolong fixation durations, and elevate gaze, indicating higher cognitive focus, while road-focused attention remains dominant and mirror checks are still present. The two-step clustering and derived metrics reveal meaningful shifts in gaze behavior under rain.

Conclusion: Gaze modeling holds promise for designing more robust ADAS and DMS by capturing condition-dependent visual attention patterns and cognitive load, informing adaptive monitoring and assistance strategies.

Abstract: Rainy weather significantly increases the risk of road accidents due to
reduced visibility and vehicle traction. Understanding how experienced drivers
adapt their visual perception through gaze behavior under such conditions is
critical for designing robust driver monitoring systems (DMS) and for informing
advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS). This case study investigates the eye
gaze behavior of a driver operating the same highway route under both clear and
rainy conditions. To this end, gaze behavior was analyzed by a two-step
clustering approach: first, clustering gaze points within 10-second intervals,
and then aggregating cluster centroids into meta-clusters. This, along with
Markov transition matrices and metrics such as fixation duration, gaze
elevation, and azimuth distributions, reveals meaningful behavioral shifts.
While the overall gaze behavior focused on the road with occasional mirror
checks remains consistent, rainy conditions lead to more frequent dashboard
glances, longer fixation durations, and higher gaze elevation, indicating
increased cognitive focus. These findings offer valuable insight into visual
attention patterns under adverse conditions and highlight the potential of
leveraging gaze modeling to aid in the design of more robust ADAS and DMS.

### [90] [CompSlider: Compositional Slider for Disentangled Multiple-Attribute Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01028)
*Zixin Zhu,Kevin Duarte,Mamshad Nayeem Rizve,Chengyuan Xu,Ratheesh Kalarot,Junsong Yuan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CompSlider introduces a slider-based, disentangled multi-attribute control for text-to-image generation by learning a latent-space conditional prior and novel disentanglement/structure losses, enabling simultaneous attribute edits without retraining the foundation model and extending to video.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fine-grained, simultaneous control of multiple attributes in T2I is hampered by entanglement and interference; existing methods train per-attribute adapters and still struggle with joint edits, incurring high computation.

Method: Develop a conditional prior conditioned on multiple attributes to steer the T2I foundation model in latent space; introduce disentanglement and structure losses to compose multiple attribute changes while preserving image structure; avoid retraining the foundation model to reduce computational burden; extend the approach to video generation.

Result: Empirical evaluation across various attributes demonstrates effective disentanglement and reliable multi-attribute control; shows generality by extending the method to video generation.

Conclusion: CompSlider enables reliable, independent, multi-attribute manipulation in slider-based T2I generation with reduced computational cost, and it generalizes to video, highlighting its practicality for broad attribute control.

Abstract: In text-to-image (T2I) generation, achieving fine-grained control over
attributes - such as age or smile - remains challenging, even with detailed
text prompts. Slider-based methods offer a solution for precise control of
image attributes. Existing approaches typically train individual adapter for
each attribute separately, overlooking the entanglement among multiple
attributes. As a result, interference occurs among different attributes,
preventing precise control of multiple attributes together. To address this
challenge, we aim to disentangle multiple attributes in slider-based generation
to enbale more reliable and independent attribute manipulation. Our approach,
CompSlider, can generate a conditional prior for the T2I foundation model to
control multiple attributes simultaneously. Furthermore, we introduce novel
disentanglement and structure losses to compose multiple attribute changes
while maintaining structural consistency within the image. Since CompSlider
operates in the latent space of the conditional prior and does not require
retraining the foundation model, it reduces the computational burden for both
training and inference. We evaluate our approach on a variety of image
attributes and highlight its generality by extending to video generation.

### [91] [TransForSeg: A Multitask Stereo ViT for Joint Stereo Segmentation and 3D Force Estimation in Catheterization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01605)
*Pedram Fekri,Mehrdad Zadeh,Javad Dargahi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A stereo Vision Transformer for multitask catheter analysis that segments the catheter from two X-ray views and estimates 3D tip force, outperforming prior segmentation and force estimation models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance catheterization procedures by jointly providing accurate catheter localization in X-ray images and 3D force estimation, using stereo inputs to capture spatial information without needing incremental receptive-field growth.

Method: Introduce a novel encoder-decoder Vision Transformer that treats two input X-ray images as separate sequences. It captures long-range dependencies across both views, with shared segmentation heads for both images and a regression head that fuses decoder outputs to estimate the catheter tip force in 3D.

Result: The stereo Vision Transformer achieves state-of-the-art performance in both catheter segmentation and 3D force estimation on synthetic X-ray data across varying noise levels, outperforming pure segmentation models, vision-based force estimation methods, and existing multitask approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed stereo Vision Transformer successfully integrates stereo vision and multitask learning to jointly segment the catheter from two angles and estimate 3D tip force, setting a new benchmark for this task.

Abstract: Recently, the emergence of multitask deep learning models has enhanced
catheterization procedures by providing tactile and visual perception data
through an end-to-end architec- ture. This information is derived from a
segmentation and force estimation head, which localizes the catheter in X-ray
images and estimates the applied pressure based on its deflection within the
image. These stereo vision architectures incorporate a CNN- based
encoder-decoder that captures the dependencies between X-ray images from two
viewpoints, enabling simultaneous 3D force estimation and stereo segmentation
of the catheter. With these tasks in mind, this work approaches the problem
from a new perspective. We propose a novel encoder-decoder Vision Transformer
model that processes two input X-ray images as separate sequences. Given
sequences of X-ray patches from two perspectives, the transformer captures
long-range dependencies without the need to gradually expand the receptive
field for either image. The embeddings generated by both the encoder and
decoder are fed into two shared segmentation heads, while a regression head
employs the fused information from the decoder for 3D force estimation. The
proposed model is a stereo Vision Transformer capable of simultaneously
segmenting the catheter from two angles while estimating the generated forces
at its tip in 3D. This model has undergone extensive experiments on synthetic
X-ray images with various noise levels and has been compared against
state-of-the-art pure segmentation models, vision-based catheter force
estimation methods, and a multitask catheter segmentation and force estimation
approach. It outperforms existing models, setting a new state-of-the-art in
both catheter segmentation and force estimation.

### [92] [Seeing through Unclear Glass: Occlusion Removal with One Shot](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01033)
*Qiang Li,Yuanming Cao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A model that restores photos taken through glass contaminated by a wide range of occluders using real paired data and one-shot test-time self-supervised adaptation, outperforming state-of-the-art on both seen and unseen contaminants.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Glass contamination degrades images via occlusion and stray light; most methods rely on synthetic data; need robust restoration across diverse real contaminants, including muddy water, dirt, and particles; aims to leverage real paired data and test-time adaptation.

Method: An all-in-one restoration model trained with real contaminated/clean pairs; at test time, uses a one-shot self-supervised auxiliary task to adapt to the specific occlusion type of the test image.

Result: Quantitative and qualitative improvements over prior methods, especially on unseen contaminant types.

Conclusion: The approach demonstrates effective restoration across diverse real-world contaminants and benefits from test-time adaptation with minimal extra data.

Abstract: Images taken through window glass are often degraded by contaminants adhered
to the glass surfaces. Such contaminants cause occlusions that attenuate the
incoming light and scatter stray light towards the camera. Most of existing
deep learning methods for neutralizing the effects of contaminated glasses
relied on synthetic training data. Few researchers used real degraded and clean
image pairs, but they only considered removing or alleviating the effects of
rain drops on glasses. This paper is concerned with the more challenging task
of learning the restoration of images taken through glasses contaminated by a
wide range of occluders, including muddy water, dirt and other small foreign
particles found in reality. To facilitate the learning task we have gone to a
great length to acquire real paired images with and without glass contaminants.
More importantly, we propose an all-in-one model to neutralize contaminants of
different types by utilizing the one-shot test-time adaptation mechanism. It
involves a self-supervised auxiliary learning task to update the trained model
for the unique occlusion type of each test image. Experimental results show
that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods
quantitatively and qualitatively in cleaning realistic contaminated images,
especially the unseen ones.

### [93] [A Unified Low-level Foundation Model for Enhancing Pathology Image Quality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01071)
*Ziyi Liu,Zhe Xu,Jiabo Ma,Wenqaing Li,Junlin Hou,Fuxiang Huang,Xi Wang,Ronald Cheong Kin Chan,Terence Tsz Wai Wong,Hao Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes LPFM, a unified diffusion-based framework for low-level pathology image enhancement and virtual staining, using a contrastive encoder pre-trained on 190M unlabeled pathology images; trained on 87,810 WSIs across 34 tissues and 5 stains; achieves broad gains across restoration and translation tasks, with PSNR gains ~10-15% and SSIM gains ~12-18% in a majority of tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the gap where foundation models excel at high-level tasks but struggle with low-level image quality in pathology; degradations from slide prep, staining variability, and imaging constraints introduce noise, blur, and color variability; reliance on physical staining is costly and inconsistent; there is a need for a versatile, unified approach rather than task-specific methods.

Method: Introduces a contrastive pre-trained encoder to learn stain-invariant, transferable features from 190M unlabeled pathology images; employs a unified conditional diffusion process guided by textual prompts to adapt to specific tasks (denoising, super-resolution, deblurring, virtual staining); trained on 87,810 WSIs across 34 tissues and 5 staining protocols.

Result: Statistically significant improvements over state-of-the-art in most tasks (56/66, p<0.01); PSNR gains of 10-15% for restoration; SSIM gains of 12-18% for virtual staining.

Conclusion: LPFM provides a single adaptable framework that unifies low-level restoration and image translation challenges in pathology, enabling better image quality across tasks and potentially reducing costs and variability in pathology workflows.

Abstract: Foundation models have revolutionized computational pathology by achieving
remarkable success in high-level diagnostic tasks, yet the critical challenge
of low-level image enhancement remains largely unaddressed. Real-world
pathology images frequently suffer from degradations such as noise, blur, and
low resolution due to slide preparation artifacts, staining variability, and
imaging constraints, while the reliance on physical staining introduces
significant costs, delays, and inconsistency. Although existing methods target
individual problems like denoising or super-resolution, their task-specific
designs lack the versatility to handle the diverse low-level vision challenges
encountered in practice. To bridge this gap, we propose the first unified
Low-level Pathology Foundation Model (LPFM), capable of enhancing image quality
in restoration tasks, including super-resolution, deblurring, and denoising, as
well as facilitating image translation tasks like virtual staining (H&E and
special stains), all through a single adaptable architecture. Our approach
introduces a contrastive pre-trained encoder that learns transferable,
stain-invariant feature representations from 190 million unlabeled pathology
images, enabling robust identification of degradation patterns. A unified
conditional diffusion process dynamically adapts to specific tasks via textual
prompts, ensuring precise control over output quality. Trained on a curated
dataset of 87,810 whole slied images (WSIs) across 34 tissue types and 5
staining protocols, LPFM demonstrates statistically significant improvements
(p<0.01) over state-of-the-art methods in most tasks (56/66), achieving Peak
Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) gains of 10-15% for image restoration and
Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) improvements of 12-18% for virtual
staining.

*Therese Joseph,Tobias Fischer,Michael Milford*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: An ensemble-based event-camera VPR method that fuses multiple event-to-frame reconstructions, VPR features, and temporal resolutions to improve robustness under challenging lighting; achieves 57% relative Recall@1 improvement across day-night transitions; validated on two long-term driving datasets; analysis of design choices and a modification to sequence matching for longer sequences; code will be released.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Event cameras offer high dynamic range and low latency, but robust visual place recognition under severe illumination changes remains unresolved. A fusion approach leveraging diverse reconstructions, features, and temporal scales can improve robustness to lighting and motion variations.

Method: Proposes ensemble-based VPR using sequence-matched results from multiple event-to-frame reconstructions, multiple VPR feature extractors, and multiple temporal resolutions; broad fusion beyond temporal-resampling; detailed ablations on binning, polarity, reconstruction, feature extractors; modification to the standard sequence matching for longer sequences; evaluation on two driving datasets with no metric subsampling.

Result: 57% relative improvement in Recall@1 across day-night transitions; robust under afternoon, sunset, night; preserved natural speed/stop variation; comprehensive design choices analysis; longer-sequence matching improvement; codebase and benchmarking framework to be released.

Conclusion: Broader fusion across reconstructions, features, and temporal scales yields significant robustness gains for event-based VPR under challenging illumination; provides guidance on key components; enable future research via released code.

Abstract: Compared to conventional cameras, event cameras provide a high dynamic range
and low latency, offering greater robustness to rapid motion and challenging
lighting conditions. Although the potential of event cameras for visual place
recognition (VPR) has been established, developing robust VPR frameworks under
severe illumination changes remains an open research problem. In this paper, we
introduce an ensemble-based approach to event camera place recognition that
combines sequence-matched results from multiple event-to-frame reconstructions,
VPR feature extractors, and temporal resolutions. Unlike previous event-based
ensemble methods, which only utilise temporal resolution, our broader fusion
strategy delivers significantly improved robustness under varied lighting
conditions (e.g., afternoon, sunset, night), achieving a 57% relative
improvement in Recall@1 across day-night transitions. We evaluate our approach
on two long-term driving datasets (with 8 km per traverse) without metric
subsampling, thereby preserving natural variations in speed and stop duration
that influence event density. We also conduct a comprehensive analysis of key
design choices, including binning strategies, polarity handling, reconstruction
methods, and feature extractors, to identify the most critical components for
robust performance. Additionally, we propose a modification to the standard
sequence matching framework that enhances performance at longer sequence
lengths. To facilitate future research, we will release our codebase and
benchmarking framework.

*Yao Wang,Dong Yang,Zhi Qiao,Wenjian Huang,Liuzhi Yang,Zhen Qian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SpectMamba introduces a Mamba-based architecture for medical image detection featuring HSFA, VSSM, and Hilbert Curve Scanning to capture both high- and low-frequency information and long-range dependencies efficiently, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CNNs have limited receptive fields and struggle with broad context; Transformers incur high computational cost on high-resolution medical images. A lightweight, global-context-capable architecture is needed for medical image detection.

Method: Propose SpectMamba, a Mamba-based architecture for medical image detection. It includes the Hybrid Spatial-Frequency Attention (HSFA) block that separately learns high- and low-frequency features and correlates frequency-domain with spatial features; a Visual State-Space Module (VSSM) to improve long-range dependencies; and a novel Hilbert Curve Scanning technique to strengthen spatial correlations and local dependencies. The model is evaluated on multiple medical image detection tasks.

Result: Comprehensive experiments show SpectMamba achieves state-of-the-art performance while being effective and efficient across various medical image detection tasks.

Conclusion: SpectMamba demonstrates that integrating frequency-aware attention, state-space modeling, and Hilbert Curve-inspired scanning within a Mamba-based framework yields superior performance and efficiency for medical image detection, with strong potential for broader application in medical imaging.

Abstract: Abnormality detection in medical imaging is a critical task requiring both
high efficiency and accuracy to support effective diagnosis. While
convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and Transformer-based models are widely
used, both face intrinsic challenges: CNNs have limited receptive fields,
restricting their ability to capture broad contextual information, and
Transformers encounter prohibitive computational costs when processing
high-resolution medical images. Mamba, a recent innovation in natural language
processing, has gained attention for its ability to process long sequences with
linear complexity, offering a promising alternative. Building on this
foundation, we present SpectMamba, the first Mamba-based architecture designed
for medical image detection. A key component of SpectMamba is the Hybrid
Spatial-Frequency Attention (HSFA) block, which separately learns high- and
low-frequency features. This approach effectively mitigates the loss of
high-frequency information caused by frequency bias and correlates
frequency-domain features with spatial features, thereby enhancing the model's
ability to capture global context. To further improve long-range dependencies,
we propose the Visual State-Space Module (VSSM) and introduce a novel Hilbert
Curve Scanning technique to strengthen spatial correlations and local
dependencies, further optimizing the Mamba framework. Comprehensive experiments
show that SpectMamba achieves state-of-the-art performance while being both
effective and efficient across various medical image detection tasks.

### [96] [Bidirectional Sparse Attention for Faster Video Diffusion Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01085)
*Chenlu Zhan,Wen Li,Chuyu Shen,Jun Zhang,Suhui Wu,Hao Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Bidirectional Sparse Attention (BSA) speeds up video diffusion transformers by dynamically sparsifying both Queries and Key-Value blocks in 3D full attention, achieving up to 20x FLOPs reduction and 17.79x faster attention while maintaining or improving generation quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the quadratic complexity and inefficiency of full attention in video diffusion transformers (DiT) for high-resolution, long-duration videos, which stems from redundant computations due to fixed sparse patterns and the inherent sparsity of Queries and KV pairs.

Method: Introduce Bidirectional Sparse Attention (BSA) with two components: (1) query sparsity via selecting the most informative query tokens using semantic similarity and a dynamic spatial-temporal training strategy; (2) KV sparsity via a statistical dynamic threshold to retain only the most salient KV blocks for computation within 3D full attention.

Result: Extensive experiments show substantial training acceleration across long sequences, reducing FLOPs by up to 20x and achieving 17.79x faster attention training, while preserving or surpassing the generative quality of full attention.

Conclusion: BSA effectively accelerates DiT training and inference for long videos by dynamically sparsifying both queries and KV, addressing both efficiency and quality concerns and enabling faster 3D full-attention processing.

Abstract: Video diffusion Transformer (DiT) models excel in generative quality but hit
major computational bottlenecks when producing high-resolution, long-duration
videos. The quadratic complexity of full attention leads to prohibitively high
training and inference costs. Full attention inefficiency stems from two key
challenges: excessive computation due to the inherent sparsity of Queries and
Key-Value pairs, and redundant computation as fixed sparse patterns fail to
leverage DiT's dynamic attention. To overcome this limitation, we propose a
Bidirectional Sparse Attention (BSA) framework for faster video DiT training,
the first to dynamically sparsify both Queries and Key-Value pairs within 3D
full attention, thereby substantially improving training and inference
efficiency. BSA addresses these issues through two key components. Query
sparsity is optimized by selecting the most informative query tokens via
semantic similarity and with a dynamic spatial-time training strategy, while KV
sparsity is achieved by computing a statistical dynamic threshold to retain
only the most salient KV blocks for computation. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that BSA significantly accelerates DiT training across long
sequences, reducing FLOPs by up to 20x and achieving 17.79x faster attention
training, while preserving or even surpassing the generative quality of full
attention.

*Zhihong Wei*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: End-to-end video pose estimation (VEPE) using spatio-temporal Transformers and instance-consistency matching to improve accuracy and efficiency on Posetrack.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Two-stage video pose estimation separates spatial and temporal processing, relies on detectors and post-processing, and struggles with global spatio-temporal context and end-to-end optimization; cross-frame matching can be mismatched.

Method: Introduce VEPE with Spatio-Temporal Pose Encoder (STPE), Spatio-Temporal Deformable Memory Encoder (STDME), and Spatio-Temporal Pose Decoder (STPD); add an instance-consistency mechanism for robust cross-frame pose-query matching; enables end-to-end processing without RoI cropping or NMS.

Result: Outperforms most two-stage models on Posetrack and improves inference efficiency by about 300%.

Conclusion: VEPE offers a simple, flexible end-to-end framework for video pose estimation that leverages temporal context and improves cross-frame matching, reducing reliance on separate detectors and post-processing.

Abstract: Video-based human pose estimation models aim to address scenarios that cannot
be effectively solved by static image models such as motion blur, out-of-focus
and occlusion. Most existing approaches consist of two stages: detecting human
instances in each image frame and then using a temporal model for single-person
pose estimation. This approach separates the spatial and temporal dimensions
and cannot capture the global spatio-temporal context between spatial instances
for end-to-end optimization. In addition, it relies on separate detectors and
complex post-processing such as RoI cropping and NMS, which reduces the
inference efficiency of the video scene. To address the above problems, we
propose VEPE (Video End-to-End Pose Estimation), a simple and flexible
framework for end-to-end pose estimation in video. The framework utilizes three
crucial spatio-temporal Transformer components: the Spatio-Temporal Pose
Encoder (STPE), the Spatio-Temporal Deformable Memory Encoder (STDME), and the
Spatio-Temporal Pose Decoder (STPD). These components are designed to
effectively utilize temporal context for optimizing human body pose estimation.
Furthermore, to reduce the mismatch problem during the cross-frame pose query
matching process, we propose an instance consistency mechanism, which aims to
enhance the consistency and discrepancy of the cross-frame instance query and
realize the instance tracking function, which in turn accurately guides the
pose query to perform cross-frame matching. Extensive experiments on the
Posetrack dataset show that our approach outperforms most two-stage models and
improves inference efficiency by 300%.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes PVINet for point cloud compression by interlacing voxel/global and point/local encoders with conditional sparse conv to enable cross-scale interactions; achieves competitive results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Global structure and local context are both important for high-quality point cloud reconstruction, but existing methods process them sequentially with little information exchange, limiting feature perception efficiency.

Method: A point-voxel interlaced network (PVINet) with a voxel-based encoder Ev for global structural features and a point-based encoder Ep for local context. Introduces a conditional sparse convolution that uses point embeddings to dynamically customize voxel kernels, enabling Ep-to-Ev interactions. A voxel-based decoder uses conditional sparse convolutions guided by point embeddings for reconstruction, with interactions at each scale.

Result: Experiments on benchmark datasets show PVINet delivers competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: PVINet enables parallel processing of global and local information with cross-scale interactions, improving feature perception efficiency and achieving competitive reconstruction quality.

Abstract: In point cloud compression, the quality of a reconstructed point cloud relies
on both the global structure and the local context, with existing methods
usually processing global and local information sequentially and lacking
communication between these two types of information. In this paper, we propose
a point-voxel interlaced network (PVINet), which captures global structural
features and local contextual features in parallel and performs interactions at
each scale to enhance feature perception efficiency. Specifically, PVINet
contains a voxel-based encoder (Ev) for extracting global structural features
and a point-based encoder (Ep) that models local contexts centered at each
voxel. Particularly, a novel conditional sparse convolution is introduced,
which applies point embeddings to dynamically customize kernels for voxel
feature extraction, facilitating feature interactions from Ep to Ev. During
decoding, a voxel-based decoder employs conditional sparse convolutions to
incorporate point embeddings as guidance to reconstruct the point cloud.
Experiments on benchmark datasets show that PVINet delivers competitive
performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

*Wenzhuang Wang,Yifan Zhao,Mingcan Ma,Ming Liu,Zhonglin Jiang,Yong Chen,Jia Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FICGen introduces frequency-aware latent diffusion to improve layout-to-image generation in degraded scenes by transferring frequency knowledge from degraded exemplars into the generation process, using a dual-query frequency resampler, visual-frequency attention, and coherence-guided disentanglement, achieving superior fidelity and alignment on degraded benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In degraded environments (low-light, underwater), L2I suffers from contextual illusion where background frequencies overwhelm foreground layouts, leading to poor fidelity and misalignment. The goal is to leverage frequency information to better render degraded instances and their surroundings.

Method: Two-stage: 1) learnable dual-query with dedicated frequency resamplers to extract contextual frequency prototypes from degraded training exemplars; 2) visual-frequency enhanced attention to inject these prototypes into generation. Additional components: instance coherence map to regulate latent-space disentanglement between instances and surroundings; adaptive spatial-frequency aggregation to reconstruct degraded representations. All in a latent diffusion-based L2I framework.

Result: Experiments on 5 degraded benchmarks (low-light to blur) show FICGen outperforms existing L2I methods in generative fidelity, alignment with layouts, and downstream trainability.

Conclusion: Frequency-aware contextual disentanglement in latent diffusion can effectively transfer degraded image knowledge to improve L2I under challenging conditions, providing robust performance across diverse degradation and guiding future frequency-guided generation in structured generation tasks.

Abstract: Layout-to-image (L2I) generation has exhibited promising results in natural
domains, but suffers from limited generative fidelity and weak alignment with
user-provided layouts when applied to degraded scenes (i.e., low-light,
underwater). We primarily attribute these limitations to the "contextual
illusion dilemma" in degraded conditions, where foreground instances are
overwhelmed by context-dominant frequency distributions. Motivated by this, our
paper proposes a new Frequency-Inspired Contextual Disentanglement Generative
(FICGen) paradigm, which seeks to transfer frequency knowledge of degraded
images into the latent diffusion space, thereby facilitating the rendering of
degraded instances and their surroundings via contextual frequency-aware
guidance. To be specific, FICGen consists of two major steps. Firstly, we
introduce a learnable dual-query mechanism, each paired with a dedicated
frequency resampler, to extract contextual frequency prototypes from
pre-collected degraded exemplars in the training set. Secondly, a
visual-frequency enhanced attention is employed to inject frequency prototypes
into the degraded generation process. To alleviate the contextual illusion and
attribute leakage, an instance coherence map is developed to regulate
latent-space disentanglement between individual instances and their
surroundings, coupled with an adaptive spatial-frequency aggregation module to
reconstruct spatial-frequency mixed degraded representations. Extensive
experiments on 5 benchmarks involving a variety of degraded scenarios-from
severe low-light to mild blur-demonstrate that FICGen consistently surpasses
existing L2I methods in terms of generative fidelity, alignment and downstream
auxiliary trainability.

*Zhengqiang Zhang,Rongyuan Wu,Lingchen Sun,Lei Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Gaussian-parameterized, non-uniform tokenization (GPSToken) to adapt token shapes and positions to image regions, enabling efficient, content-aware image representation and generation; achieves state-of-the-art results with 128 tokens.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Uniform grid tokenization limits flexibility in representing irregular shapes/textures and regional variation; a spatially adaptive tokenization can improve efficiency and fidelity.

Method: Partition the image into texture-homogeneous regions via an entropy-driven algorithm. Parameterize each region as a 2D Gaussian (mean for position, covariance for shape) plus texture features. Train a specialized transformer to optimize Gaussian parameters for continuous position/shape/content adaptation. Decode with a differentiable splatting-based renderer to produce 2D feature maps for standard decoders. A two-stage generation is enabled by disentangling layout (Gaussian parameters) from texture features.

Result: State-of-the-art performance on image reconstruction and generation with 128 tokens: rFID = 0.65 and FID = 1.50.

Conclusion: GPSToken enables non-uniform, content-aware tokenization by separating spatial layout from texture. This supports efficient two-stage generation (layout then texture) and leverages differentiable rendering for end-to-end training. Code and models are publicly available.

Abstract: Effective and efficient tokenization plays an important role in image
representation and generation. Conventional methods, constrained by uniform
2D/1D grid tokenization, are inflexible to represent regions with varying
shapes and textures and at different locations, limiting their efficacy of
feature representation. In this work, we propose $\textbf{GPSToken}$, a novel
$\textbf{G}$aussian $\textbf{P}$arameterized $\textbf{S}$patially-adaptive
$\textbf{Token}$ization framework, to achieve non-uniform image tokenization by
leveraging parametric 2D Gaussians to dynamically model the shape, position,
and textures of different image regions. We first employ an entropy-driven
algorithm to partition the image into texture-homogeneous regions of variable
sizes. Then, we parameterize each region as a 2D Gaussian (mean for position,
covariance for shape) coupled with texture features. A specialized transformer
is trained to optimize the Gaussian parameters, enabling continuous adaptation
of position/shape and content-aware feature extraction. During decoding,
Gaussian parameterized tokens are reconstructed into 2D feature maps through a
differentiable splatting-based renderer, bridging our adaptive tokenization
with standard decoders for end-to-end training. GPSToken disentangles spatial
layout (Gaussian parameters) from texture features to enable efficient
two-stage generation: structural layout synthesis using lightweight networks,
followed by structure-conditioned texture generation. Experiments demonstrate
the state-of-the-art performance of GPSToken, which achieves rFID and FID
scores of 0.65 and 1.50 on image reconstruction and generation tasks using 128
tokens, respectively. Codes and models of GPSToken can be found at

*Weiren Zhao,Lanfeng Zhong,Xin Liao,Wenjun Liao,Sichuan Zhang,Shaoting Zhang,Guotai Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MetaSSL introduces a spatially heterogeneous loss for SSL in medical image segmentation that weights unlabeled (and labeled) pixels based on uncertainty and consistency between two predictions, partitioned into four regions UC, US, DC, DS; it's plug-and-play and improves performance across SSL baselines.


<details>

Motivation: Current SSL methods rely on a single reference prediction and often ignore label noise and per-pixel heterogeneity; leveraging both predictions with spatially varying weights can better exploit information and improve robustness to annotation noise.

Method: Compute predictions on unlabeled data from two sources (reference vs supervised). Evaluate uncertainty and their consistency to split pixels into four groups: UC, US, DC, DS. Use adaptive thresholds to classify 'confident' vs 'suspicious'. Apply a heterogeneous loss with different weights per region to unlabeled and labeled data. The framework is plug-and-play and general across SSL methods.

Result: Empirical results show significant performance gains when MetaSSL is integrated with existing SSL frameworks across multiple datasets; code released.

Conclusion: MetaSSL provides a universal, robust approach to SSL for segmentation by exploiting spatially heterogeneous loss and uncertainty-consistency cues, helping to handle annotation noise and improve generalization.

Abstract: Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL) is important for reducing the annotation cost
for medical image segmentation models. State-of-the-art SSL methods such as
Mean Teacher, FixMatch and Cross Pseudo Supervision (CPS) are mainly based on
consistency regularization or pseudo-label supervision between a reference
prediction and a supervised prediction. Despite the effectiveness, they have
overlooked the potential noise in the labeled data, and mainly focus on
strategies to generate the reference prediction, while ignoring the
heterogeneous values of different unlabeled pixels. We argue that effectively
mining the rich information contained by the two predictions in the loss
function, instead of the specific strategy to obtain a reference prediction, is
more essential for SSL, and propose a universal framework MetaSSL based on a
spatially heterogeneous loss that assigns different weights to pixels by
simultaneously leveraging the uncertainty and consistency information between
the reference and supervised predictions. Specifically, we split the
predictions on unlabeled data into four regions with decreasing weights in the
loss: Unanimous and Confident (UC), Unanimous and Suspicious (US), Discrepant
and Confident (DC), and Discrepant and Suspicious (DS), where an adaptive
threshold is proposed to distinguish confident predictions from suspicious
ones. The heterogeneous loss is also applied to labeled images for robust
learning considering the potential annotation noise. Our method is
plug-and-play and general to most existing SSL methods. The experimental
results showed that it improved the segmentation performance significantly when
integrated with existing SSL frameworks on different datasets. Code is

*Taiga Yamane,Ryo Masumura,Satoshi Suzuki,Shota Orihashi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MVTrajecter extends end-to-end MVPT by leveraging multi-time past trajectory information through trajectory motion and appearance costs and an attention-based temporal relation module, yielding robust multi-view pedestrian tracking and superior performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing end-to-end MVPT methods rely on only current and a single adjacent past timestamp, discarding longer historical trajectories that could aid data association.

Method: Introduce MVTrajecter with trajectory motion cost and trajectory appearance cost to compare current detections with each past timestamp; use attention to model relationships across multiple past timestamps; end-to-end framework for joint detection and association.

Result: Experimental results show each component's contribution and outperform prior state-of-the-art MVPT methods on relevant benchmarks.

Conclusion: Leveraging longer historical trajectories with structured costs and temporal attention improves robustness of multi-view pedestrian tracking in a bird's-eye-view occupancy map.

Abstract: Multi-View Pedestrian Tracking (MVPT) aims to track pedestrians in the form
of a bird's eye view occupancy map from multi-view videos. End-to-end methods
that detect and associate pedestrians within one model have shown great
progress in MVPT. The motion and appearance information of pedestrians is
important for the association, but previous end-to-end MVPT methods rely only
on the current and its single adjacent past timestamp, discarding the past
trajectories before that. This paper proposes a novel end-to-end MVPT method
called Multi-View Trajectory Tracker (MVTrajecter) that utilizes information
from multiple timestamps in past trajectories for robust association.
MVTrajecter introduces trajectory motion cost and trajectory appearance cost to
effectively incorporate motion and appearance information, respectively. These
costs calculate which pedestrians at the current and each past timestamp are
likely identical based on the information between those timestamps. Even if a
current pedestrian could be associated with a false pedestrian at some past
timestamp, these costs enable the model to associate that current pedestrian
with the correct past trajectory based on other past timestamps. In addition,
MVTrajecter effectively captures the relationships between multiple timestamps
leveraging the attention mechanism. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of each component in MVTrajecter and show that it outperforms the
previous state-of-the-art methods.

*Hyunjong Ok,Jaeho Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Keyframe sampling for video MLLMs using vision-language encoders like SigLIP may not reliably pick informative frames; authors provide empirical evidence that encoders struggle to identify where to look for the given text query, highlighting need for better keyframe identification to enable efficient video MLLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reduce computational cost of video understanding by skipping frames, but question whether current encoders can correctly identify informative frames; investigate limitations of vision encoders in guiding MLLMs to relevant video regions.

Method: Empirical analyses across multiple experiments to assess whether vision-language encoders can identify the most informative frames for a given textual query; evaluation of keyframe selection quality and its impact on MLLM performance.

Result: Vision encoders exhibit limited ability to localize the relevant frames within a video for a given query; this undermines the effectiveness of keyframe sampling in MLLMs.

Conclusion: Improved keyframe identification techniques are needed to achieve efficient and accurate video understanding with MLLMs.

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have led to much
progress in video understanding tasks. To avoid the heavy computational cost of
processing all frames, these models typically rely on keyframe sampling methods
guided by vision-language encoders (\textit{e.g.,} SigLIP). However, it remains
unclear whether such encoders can truly identify the most informative frames.
In this work, we provide several empirical pieces of evidence revealing that
popular vision encoders critically suffer from their limited capability to
identify where the MLLM should look inside the video to handle the given
textual query appropriately. Our findings suggest that the development of
better keyframe identification techniques may be necessary for efficient video
MLLMs.

### [104] [DynaMind: Reconstructing Dynamic Visual Scenes from EEG by Aligning Temporal Dynamics and Multimodal Semantics to Guided Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01177)
*Junxiang Liu,Junming Lin,Jiangtong Li,Jie Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DynaMind reconstructs video from EEG by jointly modeling neural dynamics and semantic features via three modules (RSM, TDA, DGVR) to achieve state-of-the-art video reconstruction on SEED-DV with notable gains in accuracy and perceptual quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EEG has limited spatial resolution and temporal misalignment with video dynamics; current methods struggle to capture both dynamic coherence and semantic context of perceived visuals.

Method: Regional-aware Semantic Mapper (RSM) extracts multimodal semantic features across brain regions and forms a unified diffusion prior; Temporal-aware Dynamic Aligner (TDA) generates a dynamic latent blueprint to enforce temporal consistency; Dual-Guidance Video Reconstructor (DGVR) translates the blueprint into a high-fidelity video guided by the semantic prior.

Result: On SEED-DV, achieves state-of-the-art performance: video- and frame-based accuracies up by 12.5 and 10.3 percentage points; SSIM improves by 9.4%; FVMD reduces by 19.7%—indicating improved visual fidelity and temporal coherence.

Conclusion: The work advances EEG-based video reconstruction by effectively integrating neural dynamics with semantic information, bridging the gap between brain activity and high-fidelity visual semantics.

Abstract: Reconstruction dynamic visual scenes from electroencephalography (EEG)
signals remains a primary challenge in brain decoding, limited by the low
spatial resolution of EEG, a temporal mismatch between neural recordings and
video dynamics, and the insufficient use of semantic information within brain
activity. Therefore, existing methods often inadequately resolve both the
dynamic coherence and the complex semantic context of the perceived visual
stimuli. To overcome these limitations, we introduce DynaMind, a novel
framework that reconstructs video by jointly modeling neural dynamics and
semantic features via three core modules: a Regional-aware Semantic Mapper
(RSM), a Temporal-aware Dynamic Aligner (TDA), and a Dual-Guidance Video
Reconstructor (DGVR). The RSM first utilizes a regional-aware encoder to
extract multimodal semantic features from EEG signals across distinct brain
regions, aggregating them into a unified diffusion prior. In the mean time, the
TDA generates a dynamic latent sequence, or blueprint, to enforce temporal
consistency between the feature representations and the original neural
recordings. Together, guided by the semantic diffusion prior, the DGVR
translates the temporal-aware blueprint into a high-fidelity video
reconstruction. On the SEED-DV dataset, DynaMind sets a new state-of-the-art
(SOTA), boosting reconstructed video accuracies (video- and frame-based) by
12.5 and 10.3 percentage points, respectively. It also achieves a leap in
pixel-level quality, showing exceptional visual fidelity and temporal coherence
with a 9.4% SSIM improvement and a 19.7% FVMD reduction. This marks a critical
advancement, bridging the gap between neural dynamics and high-fidelity visual
semantics.

*Qiaoqiao Jin,Siming Fu,Dong She,Weinan Jia,Hualiang Wang,Mu Liu,Jidong Jiang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FocusDPO introduces adaptive focus region selection during diffusion model optimization to improve multi-subject personalized image generation without test-time optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multi-subject personalized generation struggles to preserve subject fidelity and prevent cross-subject leakage due to static attention and lack of robust cross-subject correspondence, especially under varying reference semantic complexities.

Method: The approach dynamically identifies focus regions via semantic correspondence and image complexity, progressively adjusting focal areas across diffusion timesteps. It uses a weighted training strategy that rewards information-rich patches and penalizes low-confidence regions, adapting focus allocation according to reference semantic complexity and strengthening correspondence mappings between generated and reference subjects during DPO.

Result: Empirical evaluation shows state-of-the-art performance on single-subject and multi-subject personalized synthesis benchmarks, with improved subject fidelity and reduced attribute leakage across diverse scenarios.

Conclusion: FocusDPO advances controllable multi-subject image synthesis by enabling adaptive, information-rich focus during diffusion-based personalization, yielding robust cross-subject correspondence and stronger fidelity without test-time optimization.

Abstract: Multi-subject personalized image generation aims to synthesize customized
images containing multiple specified subjects without requiring test-time
optimization. However, achieving fine-grained independent control over multiple
subjects remains challenging due to difficulties in preserving subject fidelity
and preventing cross-subject attribute leakage. We present FocusDPO, a
framework that adaptively identifies focus regions based on dynamic semantic
correspondence and supervision image complexity. During training, our method
progressively adjusts these focal areas across noise timesteps, implementing a
weighted strategy that rewards information-rich patches while penalizing
regions with low prediction confidence. The framework dynamically adjusts focus
allocation during the DPO process according to the semantic complexity of
reference images and establishes robust correspondence mappings between
generated and reference subjects. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
method substantially enhances the performance of existing pre-trained
personalized generation models, achieving state-of-the-art results on both
single-subject and multi-subject personalized image synthesis benchmarks. Our
method effectively mitigates attribute leakage while preserving superior
subject fidelity across diverse generation scenarios, advancing the frontier of
controllable multi-subject image synthesis.

*Bingnan Yang,Mi Zhang,Zhili Zhang,Zhan Zhang,Yuanxin Zhao,Xiangyun Hu,Jianya Gong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduces SegAssess for panoramic, pixel-wise unsupervised SQA by casting it as a four-class segmentation (TP/FP/TN/FN) within a panormap; integrates enhanced SAM with Edge Guided Compaction and Augmented Mixup Sampling to achieve SOTA and strong zero-shot transfer across 32 datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need for fine-grained, transferable segmentation quality assessment in remote sensing where ground truth is unavailable; existing DL-based unsupervised SQA methods suffer from coarse granularity and poor transferability.

Method: Formulates SQA as a four-class pixel-wise segmentation task over the evaluation mask. Uses the input mask as a prompt in an enhanced Segment Anything Model (SAM) to enable cross-attention-based feature integration. Introduces an Edge Guided Compaction (EGC) branch with an Aggregated Semantic Filter (ASF) to refine edge pixels. Employs an Augmented Mixup Sampling (AMS) training strategy that fuses multi-source masks to improve cross-domain robustness and zero-shot transferability.

Result: Demonstrates SOTA performance across 32 datasets sourced from 6 providers and exhibits notable zero-shot transfer to unseen masks, supporting the robustness and transferability of PQM via SegAssess. The authors provide code at the project URL.

Conclusion: PQM via SegAssess offers a robust, transferable, unsupervised SQA framework that yields complete, pixel-level quality maps and strong cross-domain performance.

Abstract: High-quality image segmentation is fundamental to pixel-level geospatial
analysis in remote sensing, necessitating robust segmentation quality
assessment (SQA), particularly in unsupervised settings lacking ground truth.
Although recent deep learning (DL) based unsupervised SQA methods show
potential, they often suffer from coarse evaluation granularity, incomplete
assessments, and poor transferability. To overcome these limitations, this
paper introduces Panoramic Quality Mapping (PQM) as a new paradigm for
comprehensive, pixel-wise SQA, and presents SegAssess, a novel deep learning
framework realizing this approach. SegAssess distinctively formulates SQA as a
fine-grained, four-class panoramic segmentation task, classifying pixels within
a segmentation mask under evaluation into true positive (TP), false positive
(FP), true negative (TN), and false negative (FN) categories, thereby
generating a complete quality map. Leveraging an enhanced Segment Anything
Model (SAM) architecture, SegAssess uniquely employs the input mask as a prompt
for effective feature integration via cross-attention. Key innovations include
an Edge Guided Compaction (EGC) branch with an Aggregated Semantic Filter (ASF)
module to refine predictions near challenging object edges, and an Augmented
Mixup Sampling (AMS) training strategy integrating multi-source masks to
significantly boost cross-domain robustness and zero-shot transferability.
Comprehensive experiments across 32 datasets derived from 6 sources demonstrate
that SegAssess achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance and exhibits
remarkable zero-shot transferability to unseen masks, establishing PQM via
SegAssess as a robust and transferable solution for unsupervised SQA. The code

TL;DR: Introduces PrediTree, a large open-source dataset for sub-meter tree height prediction using 0.5 m LiDAR canopy height maps aligned with multi-temporal multi-spectral imagery; proposes a U-Net encoder-decoder framework; achieves best performance on canopy height prediction; dataset and code publicly available.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fills a critical gap in forest monitoring by providing a high-resolution, multi-temporal, multi-spectral dataset to train deep learning models for predicting tree growth across diverse French forests.

Method: Encoder-decoder framework using multi-temporal multi-spectral imagery and relative time differences; U-Net architecture trained on PrediTree; comparison against ResNet-50; experiments with full-band and RGB-only inputs.

Result: U-Net achieved the lowest masked mean squared error of 11.78%, beating ResNet-50 by ~12%; RGB-only experiments reduced error by ~30% compared with other configurations; dataset publicly available on HuggingFace, code on GitHub.

Conclusion: PrediTree enables training and evaluation of tree height prediction models at sub-meter resolution, advancing forest monitoring; the dataset and code promote open research and ongoing expansion to other countries.

Abstract: We present PrediTree, the first comprehensive open-source dataset designed
for training and evaluating tree height prediction models at sub-meter
resolution. This dataset combines very high-resolution (0.5m) LiDAR-derived
canopy height maps, spatially aligned with multi-temporal and multi-spectral
imagery, across diverse forest ecosystems in France, totaling 3,141,568 images.
PrediTree addresses a critical gap in forest monitoring capabilities by
enabling the training of deep learning methods that can predict tree growth
based on multiple past observations. %\sout{Initially focused on French
forests, PrediTree is designed as an expanding resource with ongoing efforts to
incorporate data from other countries. } To make use of this PrediTree dataset,
we propose an encoder-decoder framework that requires the multi-temporal
multi-spectral imagery and the relative time differences in years between the
canopy height map timestamp (target) and each image acquisition date for which
this framework predicts the canopy height. The conducted experiments
demonstrate that a U-Net architecture trained on the PrediTree dataset provides
the highest masked mean squared error of $11.78\%$, outperforming the next-best
architecture, ResNet-50, by around $12\%$, and cutting the error of the same
experiments but on fewer bands (red, green, blue only), by around $30\%$. This
dataset is publicly available on \href{URL}{HuggingFace}, and both processing
and training codebases are available on \href{URL}{GitHub}.

### [108] [DcMatch: Unsupervised Multi-Shape Matching with Dual-Level Consistency](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01204)
*Tianwei Ye,Yong Ma,Xiaoguang Mei*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DcMatch is an unsupervised non-rigid multi-shape matching framework that builds a shared latent universe via a shape graph attention network, aligns spatial and spectral correspondences with cycle-consistency, and outperforms prior methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Establishing point-to-point correspondences across multiple non-rigid shapes is fundamental; existing methods rely on a single-shape canonical embedding and may fail to capture global manifold structure. There is a need for unsupervised, robust multi-shape matching that leverages the whole shape collection to produce coherent correspondences.

Method: Proposes a shape graph attention network to model the manifold structure of the entire shape collection. It constructs a shared latent universe (universe predictor) to enable more expressive, robust correspondences. Representations exist in both spatial and spectral domains and are aligned in the shared universe via a novel cycle-consistency loss, enforcing dual-level consistency across domains.

Result: Extensive experiments on several challenging benchmarks show that DcMatch consistently outperforms previous state-of-the-art across diverse multi-shape matching scenarios.

Conclusion: DcMatch advances unsupervised multi-shape matching by integrating graph-based manifold learning, a shared latent universe, and cycle-consistency across spatial and spectral representations; demonstrates robustness and generalization; code is available at the provided GitHub URL.

Abstract: Establishing point-to-point correspondences across multiple 3D shapes is a
fundamental problem in computer vision and graphics. In this paper, we
introduce DcMatch, a novel unsupervised learning framework for non-rigid
multi-shape matching. Unlike existing methods that learn a canonical embedding
from a single shape, our approach leverages a shape graph attention network to
capture the underlying manifold structure of the entire shape collection. This
enables the construction of a more expressive and robust shared latent space,
leading to more consistent shape-to-universe correspondences via a universe
predictor. Simultaneously, we represent these correspondences in both the
spatial and spectral domains and enforce their alignment in the shared universe
space through a novel cycle consistency loss. This dual-level consistency
fosters more accurate and coherent mappings. Extensive experiments on several
challenging benchmarks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms
previous state-of-the-art approaches across diverse multi-shape matching
scenarios. Code is available at https://github.com/YeTianwei/DcMatch.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A self-supervised monocular depth estimation method for endoscopy using a block-wise mixture of dynamic low-rank experts to adapt to tissue variability, with a self-supervised training framework addressing brightness/reflectance, achieving state-of-the-art and zero-shot generalization; code/demo forthcoming.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Endoscopic depth estimation faces strong generalization challenges due to varying illumination conditions and diverse tissue features. Efficiently adapting a model with limited trainable parameters is critical for reliable 3D perception in minimally invasive surgery.

Method: Introduce a block-wise mixture of dynamic low-rank experts (BDLRE) that adaptively selects among multiple lightweight experts based on input features and training quality per block; train a foundation model with a self-supervised framework that jointly mitigates brightness and reflectance inconsistencies, enabling robust endoscopic depth estimation.

Result: The method surpasses state-of-the-art methods on both realistic and simulated endoscopic datasets and achieves best zero-shot generalization across diverse endoscopic scenes.

Conclusion: This approach advances accurate endoscopic depth perception for measurement and surgical guidance; code will be released after acceptance, with a demo available online.

Abstract: Self-supervised monocular depth estimation is a significant task for low-cost
and efficient three-dimensional scene perception in endoscopy. The variety of
illumination conditions and scene features is still the primary challenge for
generalizable depth estimation in endoscopic scenes. In this work, a
self-supervised framework is proposed for monocular depth estimation in various
endoscopy. Firstly, due to various features in endoscopic scenes with different
tissues, a novel block-wise mixture of dynamic low-rank experts is proposed to
efficiently finetuning the foundation model for endoscopic depth estimation. In
the proposed module, based on the input feature, different experts with a small
amount of trainable parameters are adaptively selected for weighted inference,
from various mixture of low-rank experts which are allocated based on the
training quality of each block. Moreover, a novel self-supervised training
framework is proposed to jointly cope with the inconsistency of brightness and
reflectance. The proposed method outperform state-of-the-art works on both
realistic and simulated endoscopic datasets. Furthermore, the proposed network
also achieves the best generalization based on zero-shot depth estimation on
diverse endoscopic scenes. The proposed method could contribute to accurate
endoscopic perception for minimally invasive measurement and surgery. The code

*Maëlic Neau,Zoe Falomir,Cédric Buche,Akihiro Sugimoto*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduces a reference-free metric for evaluating open-vocabulary relation prediction in Scene Graph Generation (SGG) and a region-specific prompt-tuning approach to rapidly generate high-quality synthetic data for pretraining. This data improves generalization for open-vocabulary SGG models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current SGG benchmarks have a very limited vocabulary, hindering fair evaluation of open-vocabulary SGG models. Additionally, pretraining relies on weakly supervised data of poor quality. There is a need for a fair evaluation metric and higher-quality synthetic data to improve generalization.

Method: 1) Propose a reference-free metric to assess open-vocabulary relation prediction in SGG, enabling fairer evaluation without a fixed vocabulary. 2) Introduce region-specific prompt tuning of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to quickly generate high-quality synthetic data for pretraining.

Result: Experimental results show that pre-training with the proposed synthetic data split improves generalization of Open-Vocabulary SGG models.

Conclusion: The paper tackles two limitations in Open-Vocabulary SGG: evaluation bias due to vocabulary limits and poor-quality pretraining data. The proposed reference-free metric provides fairer evaluation, while region-specific prompt tuning yields high-quality synthetic data that enhances model generalization.

Abstract: Scene Graph Generation (SGG) encodes visual relationships between objects in
images as graph structures. Thanks to the advances of Vision-Language Models
(VLMs), the task of Open-Vocabulary SGG has been recently proposed where models
are evaluated on their functionality to learn a wide and diverse range of
relations. Current benchmarks in SGG, however, possess a very limited
vocabulary, making the evaluation of open-source models inefficient. In this
paper, we propose a new reference-free metric to fairly evaluate the
open-vocabulary capabilities of VLMs for relation prediction. Another
limitation of Open-Vocabulary SGG is the reliance on weakly supervised data of
poor quality for pre-training. We also propose a new solution for quickly
generating high-quality synthetic data through region-specific prompt tuning of
VLMs. Experimental results show that pre-training with this new data split can
benefit the generalization capabilities of Open-Voc SGG models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PRINTER is a weakly-supervised framework that achieves accurate virtual IHC staining by aligning H&E and IHC through prototype-driven content-style decoupling, a cyclic GapBridge registration-synthesis pipeline with deformable alignment, and deformation-aware adversarial learning, yielding superior fidelity to H&E details and IHC patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Precise correlation between H&E morphology and IHC biomarker expression is essential for accurate tumor spatial heterogeneity analysis, but consecutive-section misalignment impairs in situ interpretation. A robust, scalable method to virtually stain with faithful preservation of morphological details is needed.

Method: 1) Prototype-driven staining pattern transfer with explicit content-style decoupling to separate structural/content from staining style. 2) GapBridge: a cyclic registration-synthesis framework that bridges H&E and IHC domains via deformable structural alignment; registered features guide cross-modal style transfer and synthesized outputs iteratively refine the registration. 3) Deformation-aware adversarial learning: a generator and a deformation-aware registration network jointly train against a style-focused discriminator to optimize virtual staining fidelity while accounting for spatial deformations.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate superior performance in preserving H&E staining details and virtual staining fidelity, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: PRINTER offers a robust and scalable solution for virtual staining in computational pathology, enabling more accurate cross-modal interpretation and potentially improving downstream diagnostic tasks.

Abstract: Tumor spatial heterogeneity analysis requires precise correlation between
Hematoxylin and Eosin H&E morphology and immunohistochemical (IHC) biomarker
expression, yet current methods suffer from spatial misalignment in consecutive
sections, severely compromising in situ pathological interpretation. In order
to obtain a more accurate virtual staining pattern, We propose PRINTER, a
weakly-supervised framework that integrates PRototype-drIven content and
staiNing patTERn decoupling and deformation-aware adversarial learning
strategies designed to accurately learn IHC staining patterns while preserving
H&E staining details. Our approach introduces three key innovations: (1) A
prototype-driven staining pattern transfer with explicit content-style
decoupling; and (2) A cyclic registration-synthesis framework GapBridge that
bridges H&E and IHC domains through deformable structural alignment, where
registered features guide cross-modal style transfer while synthesized outputs
iteratively refine the registration;(3) Deformation-Aware Adversarial Learning:
We propose a training framework where a generator and deformation-aware
registration network jointly adversarially optimize a style-focused
discriminator. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PRINTER effectively
achieves superior performance in preserving H&E staining details and virtual
staining fidelity, outperforming state-of-the-art methods. Our work provides a
robust and scalable solution for virtual staining, advancing the field of
computational pathology.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A fully automated, distillation-free two-stage framework for high-quality document extraction; synthetic data generation plus self-improvement yields POINTS-Reader that outperforms many baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-quality labeled data for complex documents (tables, formulas, multi-column text) is costly and manual labeling is time-consuming; automatic labeling often lacks accuracy; distillation from teachers can limit performance. A fully automated, scalable approach is needed.

Method: Stage 1: generate large-scale, diverse synthetic data to train a model that can extract key elements in a unified format with strong initial performance. Stage 2: self-improvement loop: fine-tune on synthetic data, annotate real documents with the model, apply quality-filtering strategies to verify annotations, retrain on the verified data, and repeat iteratively to improve both data and model. The authors train POINTS-Reader from POINTS-1.5 and release it publicly.

Result: POINTS-Reader surpasses many existing public and proprietary models of comparable or larger size.

Conclusion: A fully automated, distillation-free pipeline for constructing high-quality document extraction datasets and robust models across diverse formats, enabling scalable production-ready document understanding; demonstrated by a competitive POINTS-Reader model and public release.

Abstract: High-quality labeled data is essential for training accurate document
conversion models, particularly in domains with complex formats such as tables,
formulas, and multi-column text. However, manual annotation is both costly and
time-consuming, while automatic labeling using existing models often lacks
accuracy in handling such challenging scenarios. Consequently, training student
models by distilling outputs from teacher models can significantly limit their
performance in real-world applications. In this paper, we propose a fully
automated, distillation-free framework comprising two stages for constructing
high-quality document extraction datasets and models capable of handling
diverse document formats and layouts. In the first stage, we introduce a method
for generating large-scale, diverse synthetic data, which enables a model to
extract key elements in a unified format with strong initial performance. In
the second stage, we present a self-improvement approach that further adapts
the model, initially trained on synthetic data, to real-world documents.
Specifically, we first use the fine-tuned model to annotate real documents,
then apply a suite of filtering strategies to verify annotation quality, and
finally retrain the model on the verified dataset. By iteratively repeating
this process, we progressively enhance both the model's conversion capabilities
and the quality of the generated data. We train a public POINTS-1.5 model to
obtain POINTS-Reader, which surpasses many existing public and proprietary
models of comparable or larger size. Our model is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FantasyHSI introduces a unpaired-data, multi-agent framework for human-scene interaction that models interactions as a dynamic graph and uses a critic loop to maintain long-horizon consistency, with Direct Preference Optimization for realistic motion; it improves generalization and long-horizon task completion on SceneBench.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HSI methods struggle with long-horizon planning and generalization to unseen scenes, especially without paired data. There is a need for data-efficient, robust approaches that ensure temporal coherence and physical realism.

Method: Model the interaction process as a dynamic directed graph and deploy a collaborative multi-agent system: (1) scene navigator for environment perception and high-level planning, (2) planning agent to decompose long-horizon goals into atomic actions, (3) critic agent that evaluates deviation between generated actions and the planned path to correct trajectory drift in a closed loop. Action generator trained with Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to reduce artifacts such as limb distortion and foot-sliding.

Result: On the custom SceneBench benchmark, FantasyHSI significantly outperforms existing methods in generalization, long-horizon task completion, and physical realism, demonstrating effective unpaired-data HSI with improved trajectory consistency.

Conclusion: FantasyHSI shows that a closed-loop, multi-agent planning framework with unpaired data and DPO can achieve robust long-horizon human-scene interaction with better generalization and physical realism; the approach is promising for scalable HSI in complex environments and is showcased on SceneBench.

Abstract: Human-Scene Interaction (HSI) seeks to generate realistic human behaviors
within complex environments, yet it faces significant challenges in handling
long-horizon, high-level tasks and generalizing to unseen scenes. To address
these limitations, we introduce FantasyHSI, a novel HSI framework centered on
video generation and multi-agent systems that operates without paired data. We
model the complex interaction process as a dynamic directed graph, upon which
we build a collaborative multi-agent system. This system comprises a scene
navigator agent for environmental perception and high-level path planning, and
a planning agent that decomposes long-horizon goals into atomic actions.
Critically, we introduce a critic agent that establishes a closed-loop feedback
mechanism by evaluating the deviation between generated actions and the planned
path. This allows for the dynamic correction of trajectory drifts caused by the
stochasticity of the generative model, thereby ensuring long-term logical
consistency. To enhance the physical realism of the generated motions, we
leverage Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to train the action generator,
significantly reducing artifacts such as limb distortion and foot-sliding.
Extensive experiments on our custom SceneBench benchmark demonstrate that
FantasyHSI significantly outperforms existing methods in terms of
generalization, long-horizon task completion, and physical realism. Ours

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Object detection architectures are notoriously hard to understand, and existing diagrams often fail to illuminate how components interconnect. The paper motivates a clearer mental model of RT-DETRv2 to aid researchers and practitioners.

Method: Provide eight carefully designed illustrations, tracing tensor flow and the logic of each module from the overall pipeline down to encoder, decoder, and multi-scale deformable attention, to unpack how RT-DETRv2 operates under the hood.

Conclusion: Visualization-driven explanations can demystify complex architectures; this work offers a concrete, accessible resource for RT-DETRv2 and suggests a generalizable approach for other models.

Abstract: Object detection architectures are notoriously difficult to understand, often
more so than large language models. While RT-DETRv2 represents an important
advance in real-time detection, most existing diagrams do little to clarify how
its components actually work and fit together. In this article, we explain the
architecture of RT-DETRv2 through a series of eight carefully designed
illustrations, moving from the overall pipeline down to critical components
such as the encoder, decoder, and multi-scale deformable attention. Our goal is
to make the existing one genuinely understandable. By visualizing the flow of
tensors and unpacking the logic behind each module, we hope to provide
researchers and practitioners with a clearer mental model of how RT-DETRv2
works under the hood.

### [115] [Learning Correlation-aware Aleatoric Uncertainty for 3D Hand Pose Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01242)
*Lee Chae-Yeon,Nam Hyeon-Woo,Tae-Hyun Oh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduces aleatoric uncertainty modeling for 3D hand pose estimation using a single linear layer to capture joint correlations, implemented as an add-on uncertainty head that can be plugged into existing models; improves uncertainty modeling with competitive accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D hand pose estimation is hindered by data uncertainty, self-similarity, and occlusions, and there is a lack of joint-correlation-aware uncertainty modeling; a lightweight, efficient approach to capture joint correlations is needed.

Method: Proposes a probabilistic hand joint output space where a single linear layer captures intrinsic correlations; this layer serves as a shareable add-on head for existing models, producing a probabilistic distribution over hand joints; the approach emphasizes modeling joint correlations with computational efficiency.

Result: Experiments show improved uncertainty modeling over existing methods and competitive 3D hand pose accuracy when using the added uncertainty head.

Conclusion: A lightweight, add-on parameterization effectively models joint correlations in hand pose with aleatoric uncertainty, offering a favorable accuracy-uncertainty trade-off and easy integration into current models.

Abstract: 3D hand pose estimation is a fundamental task in understanding human hands.
However, accurately estimating 3D hand poses remains challenging due to the
complex movement of hands, self-similarity, and frequent occlusions. In this
work, we address two limitations: the inability of existing 3D hand pose
estimation methods to estimate aleatoric (data) uncertainty, and the lack of
uncertainty modeling that incorporates joint correlation knowledge, which has
not been thoroughly investigated. To this end, we introduce aleatoric
uncertainty modeling into the 3D hand pose estimation framework, aiming to
achieve a better trade-off between modeling joint correlations and
computational efficiency. We propose a novel parameterization that leverages a
single linear layer to capture intrinsic correlations among hand joints. This
is enabled by formulating the hand joint output space as a probabilistic
distribution, allowing the linear layer to capture joint correlations. Our
proposed parameterization is used as a task head layer, and can be applied as
an add-on module on top of the existing models. Our experiments demonstrate
that our parameterization for uncertainty modeling outperforms existing
approaches. Furthermore, the 3D hand pose estimation model equipped with our
uncertainty head achieves favorable accuracy in 3D hand pose estimation while
introducing new uncertainty modeling capability to the model. The project page

### [116] [Towards More Diverse and Challenging Pre-training for Point Cloud Learning: Self-Supervised Cross Reconstruction with Decoupled Views](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01250)
*Xiangdong Zhang,Shaofeng Zhang,Junchi Yan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes Point-PQAE, a two-view cross-reconstruction framework for self-supervised point-cloud learning. It generates two decoupled views via a crop mechanism, encodes 3D spatial relationships between views, and reconstructs one view from the other. This two-view paradigm yields notable gains over single-view self-reconstruction (Point-MAE) on ScanObjectNN, indicating stronger 3D representations from cross-view pre-training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Single-view self-supervised point-cloud methods may underutilize the diversity available in multi-view or cross-view data. Introducing a two-view pre-training regime could increase task-relevant variation, challenging the model and promoting more robust representations for downstream 3D understanding.

Method: Generate two decoupled point-cloud views using a novel crop mechanism. Introduce a 3D relative positional encoding to capture spatial relationships between the two views. Train a cross-reconstruction model that learns to reconstruct one view from the other, hence enforcing cross-view consistency and richer feature extraction.

Result: The cross-reconstruction approach outperforms the single-view self-reconstruction baseline (Point-MAE) by 6.5%, 7.0%, and 6.7% on three variants of ScanObjectNN under the Mlp-Linear evaluation protocol. Code is released at the provided GitHub link.

Conclusion: Two-view cross-reconstruction with crop-based view generation and 3D relative positional encoding enhances self-supervised 3D learning, demonstrating the benefit of cross-view pre-training for robust point-cloud representations and downstream tasks.

Abstract: Point cloud learning, especially in a self-supervised way without manual
labels, has gained growing attention in both vision and learning communities
due to its potential utility in a wide range of applications. Most existing
generative approaches for point cloud self-supervised learning focus on
recovering masked points from visible ones within a single view. Recognizing
that a two-view pre-training paradigm inherently introduces greater diversity
and variance, it may thus enable more challenging and informative pre-training.
Inspired by this, we explore the potential of two-view learning in this domain.
In this paper, we propose Point-PQAE, a cross-reconstruction generative
paradigm that first generates two decoupled point clouds/views and then
reconstructs one from the other. To achieve this goal, we develop a crop
mechanism for point cloud view generation for the first time and further
propose a novel positional encoding to represent the 3D relative position
between the two decoupled views. The cross-reconstruction significantly
increases the difficulty of pre-training compared to self-reconstruction, which
enables our method to surpass previous single-modal self-reconstruction methods
in 3D self-supervised learning. Specifically, it outperforms the
self-reconstruction baseline (Point-MAE) by 6.5%, 7.0%, and 6.7% in three
variants of ScanObjectNN with the Mlp-Linear evaluation protocol. The code is
available at https://github.com/aHapBean/Point-PQAE.

### [117] [ReCap: Event-Aware Image Captioning with Article Retrieval and Semantic Gaussian Normalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01259)
*Thinh-Phuc Nguyen,Thanh-Hai Nguyen,Gia-Huy Dinh,Lam-Huy Nguyen,Minh-Triet Tran,Trung-Nghia Le*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ReCap is a three-stage pipeline that enriches image captions with event-level context by retrieving relevant articles, extracting contextual info, and generating grounded captions with an LLM; it shows strong performance on EVENTA 2025.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard captioning models describe only visible content and miss temporal/social/historical context essential for news reporting and archiving; there is a need to ground captions in real-world knowledge.

Method: 1) Two-stage article retrieval using DINOv2 embeddings for global similarity, followed by patch-level mutual nearest neighbor re-ranking; 2) Context extraction synthesizing summaries, generic captions, and metadata; 3) LLM-based caption generation with Semantic Gaussian Normalization to improve fluency and relevance.

Result: On OpenEvents V1 / EVENTA 2025 Track 1, achieved overall score 0.54666 and ranked 2nd on the private test set.

Conclusion: ReCap effectively bridges visual perception and real-world knowledge, offering a practical solution for context-aware image understanding in high-stakes domains; code released at GitHub.

Abstract: Image captioning systems often produce generic descriptions that fail to
capture event-level semantics which are crucial for applications like news
reporting and digital archiving. We present ReCap, a novel pipeline for
event-enriched image retrieval and captioning that incorporates broader
contextual information from relevant articles to generate narrative-rich,
factually grounded captions. Our approach addresses the limitations of standard
vision-language models that typically focus on visible content while missing
temporal, social, and historical contexts. ReCap comprises three integrated
components: (1) a robust two-stage article retrieval system using DINOv2
embeddings with global feature similarity for initial candidate selection
followed by patch-level mutual nearest neighbor similarity re-ranking; (2) a
context extraction framework that synthesizes information from article
summaries, generic captions, and original source metadata; and (3) a large
language model-based caption generation system with Semantic Gaussian
Normalization to enhance fluency and relevance. Evaluated on the OpenEvents V1
dataset as part of Track 1 in the EVENTA 2025 Grand Challenge, ReCap achieved a
strong overall score of 0.54666, ranking 2nd on the private test set. These
results highlight ReCap's effectiveness in bridging visual perception with
real-world knowledge, offering a practical solution for context-aware image
understanding in high-stakes domains. The code is available at

### [118] [Novel Category Discovery with X-Agent Attention for Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01275)
*Jiahao Li Yang Lu,Yachao Zhang,Fangyong Wang,Yuan Xie,Yanyun Qu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes X-Agent, a latent-semantic–aware OVSS framework that probes latent semantics in VLMs and uses an agent to orchestrate cross-modal attention; achieves state-of-the-art results and enhances latent semantic saliency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: OVSS struggles with domain shift between base categories and open vocabulary, and latent semantic comprehension in VLMs remains underexplored. A probing study can reveal how latent semantics behave under inductive learning and guide better modeling.

Method: Conduct a probing analysis of latent semantics in vision-language models under inductive learning to understand distribution and dynamics; design X-Agent, a latent semantic–aware agent that orchestrates cross-modal attention and jointly optimizes latent semantic dynamics and perceptibility.

Result: Extensive benchmarks show state-of-the-art OVSS performance and a notable improvement in latent semantic saliency, demonstrating the efficacy of latent-semantic–aware control in cross-modal reasoning.

Conclusion: Latent semantics can be effectively leveraged in OVSS via an agent-driven cross-modal attention mechanism; the proposed X-Agent framework advances OVSS by improving both performance and the visibility of latent categories, with implications for broader open-world recognition.

Abstract: Open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVSS) conducts pixel-level
classification via text-driven alignment, where the domain discrepancy between
base category training and open-vocabulary inference poses challenges in
discriminative modeling of latent unseen category. To address this challenge,
existing vision-language model (VLM)-based approaches demonstrate commendable
performance through pre-trained multi-modal representations. However, the
fundamental mechanisms of latent semantic comprehension remain underexplored,
making the bottleneck for OVSS. In this work, we initiate a probing experiment
to explore distribution patterns and dynamics of latent semantics in VLMs under
inductive learning paradigms. Building on these insights, we propose X-Agent,
an innovative OVSS framework employing latent semantic-aware ``agent'' to
orchestrate cross-modal attention mechanisms, simultaneously optimizing latent
semantic dynamic and amplifying its perceptibility. Extensive benchmark
evaluations demonstrate that X-Agent achieves state-of-the-art performance
while effectively enhancing the latent semantic saliency.

*Xinyi Yu,Zhiwei Lin,Yongtao Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NAS-driven backbone search enhances a lightweight SAR detector (YOLOv10) for SAR object detection, achieving higher accuracy with lower compute on SARDet-100K.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAR imagery suffers from speckle noise, small target ambiguities, and on-board compute constraints. Existing SAR-specific architectural tweaks are limited; applying NAS could balance accuracy and efficiency for SAR detection.

Method: Construct a large search space for backbone architectures within a YOLOv10 framework tailored to SAR, apply evolutionary search to discover efficient architectures, and evaluate on the SARDet-100K dataset.

Result: Found an optimized backbone that yields superior detection accuracy with lower computational overhead compared to existing SAR detectors on SARDet-100K; this work marks the first NAS application to SAR object detection.

Conclusion: Demonstrates that NAS can effectively optimize SAR detectors, offering a favorable accuracy/efficiency trade-off and opening new avenues for NAS-guided real-world SAR detection.

Abstract: Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) object detection faces significant challenges
from speckle noise, small target ambiguities, and on-board computational
constraints. While existing approaches predominantly focus on SAR-specific
architectural modifications, this paper explores the application of the
existing lightweight object detector, i.e., YOLOv10, for SAR object detection
and enhances its performance through Neural Architecture Search (NAS).
Specifically, we employ NAS to systematically optimize the network structure,
especially focusing on the backbone architecture search. By constructing an
extensive search space and leveraging evolutionary search, our method
identifies a favorable architecture that balances accuracy, parameter
efficiency, and computational cost. Notably, this work introduces NAS to SAR
object detection for the first time. The experimental results on the
large-scale SARDet-100K dataset demonstrate that our optimized model
outperforms existing SAR detection methods, achieving superior detection
accuracy while maintaining lower computational overhead. We hope this work
offers a novel perspective on leveraging NAS for real-world applications.

### [120] [Multi-Representation Adapter with Neural Architecture Search for Efficient Range-Doppler Radar Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01280)
*Zhiwei Lin,Weicheng Zheng,Yongtao Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: An efficient radar object detector that fuses multi-representation RD radar maps via novel Adapter/Exchanger/Fusion modules and NAS-optimized architecture, achieving SOTA on RADDet and CARRADA.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Radar sensors are robust to adverse lighting and weather; Range-Doppler maps are rich but require effective feature extraction and efficient architectures. Multi-representation inputs can capture both high-level semantics and textures, and architecture search can optimize performance-efficiency trade-offs.

Method: Represent RD radar maps with multi-representation (heatmaps and grayscale images). Introduce an Adapter branch, an Exchanger Module with two modes, and a Primary-Auxiliary Fusion Module to extract, exchange, and fuse features from multi-representations. Build a supernet with varying widths and fusion operations in the Adapter branch and apply One-Shot Neural Architecture Search to find efficient architectures.

Result: The model achieves favorable accuracy-efficiency trade-offs and sets new state-of-the-art on RADDet and CARRADA with mAP@50 of 71.9 and 57.1, respectively.

Conclusion: Multi-representation RD radar inputs combined with specialized exchange/fusion modules and NAS-optimized architecture can significantly boost radar-based object detection performance and efficiency across challenging datasets.

Abstract: Detecting objects efficiently from radar sensors has recently become a
popular trend due to their robustness against adverse lighting and weather
conditions compared with cameras. This paper presents an efficient object
detection model for Range-Doppler (RD) radar maps. Specifically, we first
represent RD radar maps with multi-representation, i.e., heatmaps and grayscale
images, to gather high-level object and fine-grained texture features. Then, we
design an additional Adapter branch, an Exchanger Module with two modes, and a
Primary-Auxiliary Fusion Module to effectively extract, exchange, and fuse
features from the multi-representation inputs, respectively. Furthermore, we
construct a supernet with various width and fusion operations in the Adapter
branch for the proposed model and employ a One-Shot Neural Architecture Search
method to further improve the model's efficiency while maintaining high
performance. Experimental results demonstrate that our model obtains favorable
accuracy and efficiency trade-off. Moreover, we achieve new state-of-the-art
performance on RADDet and CARRADA datasets with mAP@50 of 71.9 and 57.1,
respectively.

### [121] [Cross-Domain Few-Shot Segmentation via Ordinary Differential Equations over Time Intervals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01299)
*Huan Ni,Qingshan Liu,Xiaonan Niu,Danfeng Hong,Lingli Zhao,Haiyan Guan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: An all-in-one ODE-Fourier module (FSS-TIs) for cross-domain few-shot segmentation; transforms domain-specific to domain-agnostic features via spectra evolution over time intervals with randomized affine perturbations; optimized ODE parameters and careful support sampling for real-world few-shot tasks; validated across five diverse datasets and two CD-FSS task settings, outperforming prior methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome fragmentation and limited knowledge flow in existing cross-domain few-shot segmentation (CD-FSS) methods by proposing a unified, principled module that can generalize across domains.

Method: Formulate feature spectra (amplitude and phase) as linked by an ordinary differential equation (ODE) that evolves over a sequence of time intervals. At each interval, perform affine transformations with randomized perturbations on the spectra to explore domain-agnostic representations. Treat the optimization of the ODE's intrinsic parameters as the learning objective, and constrain support-sample selection to mirror real-world few-shot settings.

Result: Outperforms existing CD-FSS methods across evaluated tasks. Ablation studies confirm the cross-domain adaptability and the effectiveness of the unified ODE-Fourier approach.

Conclusion: An all-in-one, concise framework (FSS-TIs) successfully unifies spectral-domain transformations via ODE dynamics to enhance cross-domain generalization in few-shot segmentation.

Abstract: Cross-domain few-shot segmentation (CD-FSS) not only enables the segmentation
of unseen categories with very limited samples, but also improves cross-domain
generalization ability within the few-shot segmentation framework. Currently,
existing CD-FSS studies typically design multiple independent modules to
enhance the cross-domain generalization ability of feature representations.
However, the independence among these modules hinders the effective flow of
knowledge, making it difficult to fully leverage their collective potential. In
contrast, this paper proposes an all-in-one module based on ordinary
differential equations and Fourier transform, resulting in a structurally
concise method--Few-Shot Segmentation over Time Intervals (FSS-TIs). FSS-TIs
assumes the existence of an ODE relationship between the spectra (including
amplitude and phase spectra) of domain-specific features and domain-agnostic
features. This ODE formulation yields an iterative transformation process along
a sequence of time intervals, while simultaneously applying affine
transformations with randomized perturbations to the spectra. In doing so, the
exploration of domain-agnostic feature representation spaces and the simulation
of diverse potential target-domain distributions are reformulated as an
optimization process over the intrinsic parameters of the ODE. Moreover, we
strictly constrain the support-sample selection during target-domain
fine-tuning so that it is consistent with the requirements of real-world
few-shot segmentation tasks. For evaluation, we introduce five datasets from
substantially different domains and define two sets of cross-domain few-shot
segmentation tasks to comprehensively analyze the performance of FSS-TIs.
Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of FSS-TIs over existing
CD-FSS methods, and in-depth ablation studies further validate the cross-domain
adaptability of FSS-TIs.

### [122] [Guided Model-based LiDAR Super-Resolution for Resource-Efficient Automotive scene Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01317)
*Alexandros Gkillas,Nikos Piperigkos,Aris S. Lalos*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: End-to-end LiDAR super-resolution (SR) + semantic segmentation framework that jointly optimizes SR with segmentation, using a lightweight SR model and a ROI-focused loss to improve performance on sparse 16-channel LiDAR, achieving segmentation comparable to 64-channel high-resolution data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Low-cost 16-channel LiDAR yields sparse points; high-resolution 64-channel sensors are expensive; need a method to boost segmentation accuracy without expensive hardware.

Method: Joint training of an SR module and a segmentation network; SR module incorporates semantic cues; novel SR loss directs focus to regions of interest; lightweight, model-based SR architecture compatible with existing segmentation networks.

Result: Experiments show segmentation performance comparable to models operating on high-resolution 64-channel LiDAR data, despite starting from low-resolution input.

Conclusion: End-to-end SR-guided segmentation can compensate for low-cost sensor sparsity, enabling effective 3D semantic segmentation with cheaper hardware; the SR module is lightweight and easily integrated with segmentation networks.

Abstract: High-resolution LiDAR data plays a critical role in 3D semantic segmentation
for autonomous driving, but the high cost of advanced sensors limits
large-scale deployment. In contrast, low-cost sensors such as 16-channel LiDAR
produce sparse point clouds that degrade segmentation accuracy. To overcome
this, we introduce the first end-to-end framework that jointly addresses LiDAR
super-resolution (SR) and semantic segmentation. The framework employs joint
optimization during training, allowing the SR module to incorporate semantic
cues and preserve fine details, particularly for smaller object classes. A new
SR loss function further directs the network to focus on regions of interest.
The proposed lightweight, model-based SR architecture uses significantly fewer
parameters than existing LiDAR SR approaches, while remaining easily compatible
with segmentation networks. Experiments show that our method achieves
segmentation performance comparable to models operating on high-resolution and
costly 64-channel LiDAR data.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A diffusion-based medical image segmentation method (PGRD) that learns voxel-wise distributions via prior-guided residual diffusion, improving calibration and efficiency and outperforming baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical image segmentation ambiguity necessitates modeling full conditional distributions with calibrated probabilities; aim to improve uncertainty quantification and sampling efficiency.

Method: PGRD framework: embed discrete labels as one-hot targets in continuous diffusion space; coarse prior predictor provides step-wise guidance; diffusion network learns residual to the prior; deep diffusion supervision across intermediate time steps.

Result: On MRI and CT datasets, PGRD achieves higher Dice scores and lower NLL/ECE than Bayesian methods, ensembles, Probabilistic U-Net, and vanilla diffusion baselines; requires fewer sampling steps for strong performance.

Conclusion: PGRD delivers better calibrated segmentation distributions with efficient sampling, highlighting the value of prior-guided diffusion for medical image segmentation and uncertainty quantification.

Abstract: Ambiguity in medical image segmentation calls for models that capture full
conditional distributions rather than a single point estimate. We present
Prior-Guided Residual Diffusion (PGRD), a diffusion-based framework that learns
voxel-wise distributions while maintaining strong calibration and practical
sampling efficiency. PGRD embeds discrete labels as one-hot targets in a
continuous space to align segmentation with diffusion modeling. A coarse prior
predictor provides step-wise guidance; the diffusion network then learns the
residual to the prior, accelerating convergence and improving calibration. A
deep diffusion supervision scheme further stabilizes training by supervising
intermediate time steps. Evaluated on representative MRI and CT datasets, PGRD
achieves higher Dice scores and lower NLL/ECE values than Bayesian, ensemble,
Probabilistic U-Net, and vanilla diffusion baselines, while requiring fewer
sampling steps to reach strong performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Industrial inspection requires accurate detection of tiny, densely packed, and overlapping objects and robust image quality under noise. Current supervised DL methods face challenges in these industrial settings.

Method: Compile a new dataset (>10,000 images with ~120,000 instances); perform comprehensive evaluation of supervised deep learning detectors focusing on small, dense, and overlapping objects; assess performance and computational efficiency; develop a lightweight fully connected convolutional network (FCN) to improve image quality in noisy industrial environments; provide repository links to data and model.

Result: The study identifies which detectors are most reliable in industrial scenarios and highlights key challenges (e.g., handling small/overlapping objects, noise robustness) while quantifying performance-efficiency tradeoffs; introduces a lightweight FCN-based model for image quality enhancement; provides public datasets and model implementations.

Conclusion: Future work should aim to further improve the FCN-based model’s effectiveness and robustness in diverse industrial conditions; the work is accompanied by public datasets and model/code releases to support reproducibility and further research.

Abstract: This paper tackles two key challenges: detecting small, dense, and
overlapping objects (a major hurdle in computer vision) and improving the
quality of noisy images, especially those encountered in industrial
environments. [1, 2]. Our focus is on evaluating methods built on supervised
deep learning. We perform an analysis of these methods, using a newly de-
veloped dataset comprising over 10k images and 120k in- stances. By evaluating
their performance, accuracy, and com- putational efficiency, we identify the
most reliable detection systems and highlight the specific challenges they
address in industrial applications. This paper also examines the use of deep
learning models to improve image quality in noisy industrial environments. We
introduce a lightweight model based on a fully connected convolutional network.

*Yunus Serhat Bicakci,Joseph Shingleton,Anahid Basiri*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Retrieval-augmented multimodal LLMs with a SigLIP-based vector database achieve SOTA street-level geolocation on EMP-16/OSV-5M, outperforming IM2GPS, IM2GPS3k, and YFCC4k without fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Geolocalization from street-level images is valuable for navigation, recommendations, and urban planning. Traditional CV approaches require heavy retraining and may not scale well; retrieval-augmented, open-weight LLMs offer a scalable alternative.

Method: Construct a vector database using the SigLIP encoder on EMP-16 and OSV-5M datasets. Augment query images with prompts containing retrieved similar and dissimilar geolocation information from this database, then process with open-weight multimodal LLMs using retrieval-augmented generation.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on three benchmarks (IM2GPS, IM2GPS3k, YFCC4k) and does not require fine-tuning, enabling easy addition of new data sources.

Conclusion: Retrieval-augmented generation with multimodal LLMs provides a scalable, accessible alternative to training models from scratch for geo-localization, enabling seamless incorporation of new data sources in GeoAI.

Abstract: Street-level geolocalization from images is crucial for a wide range of
essential applications and services, such as navigation, location-based
recommendations, and urban planning. With the growing popularity of social
media data and cameras embedded in smartphones, applying traditional computer
vision techniques to localize images has become increasingly challenging, yet
highly valuable. This paper introduces a novel approach that integrates
open-weight and publicly accessible multimodal large language models with
retrieval-augmented generation. The method constructs a vector database using
the SigLIP encoder on two large-scale datasets (EMP-16 and OSV-5M). Query
images are augmented with prompts containing both similar and dissimilar
geolocation information retrieved from this database before being processed by
the multimodal large language models. Our approach has demonstrated
state-of-the-art performance, achieving higher accuracy compared against three
widely used benchmark datasets (IM2GPS, IM2GPS3k, and YFCC4k). Importantly, our
solution eliminates the need for expensive fine-tuning or retraining and scales
seamlessly to incorporate new data sources. The effectiveness of
retrieval-augmented generation-based multimodal large language models in
geolocation estimation demonstrated by this paper suggests an alternative path
to the traditional methods which rely on the training models from scratch,
opening new possibilities for more accessible and scalable solutions in GeoAI.

Result: The fused model achieves 98.0% accuracy, precision 97.8%, recall 97.7%, F1-score 96.75%. RMSE 0.32 and MAE 0.27. Ablation studies show multimodal coupling is critical; statistical tests (t-tests, ANOVA) confirm significance of improvements.

Conclusion: AgroSense offers a practical, scalable, real-time decision-support solution for precision agriculture and sets the stage for lightweight multimodal AI systems suitable for resource-constrained environments.

Abstract: Meeting the increasing global demand for food security and sustainable
farming requires intelligent crop recommendation systems that operate in real
time. Traditional soil analysis techniques are often slow, labor-intensive, and
not suitable for on-field decision-making. To address these limitations, we
introduce AgroSense, a deep-learning framework that integrates soil image
classification and nutrient profiling to produce accurate and contextually
relevant crop recommendations. AgroSense comprises two main components: a Soil
Classification Module, which leverages ResNet-18, EfficientNet-B0, and Vision
Transformer architectures to categorize soil types from images; and a Crop
Recommendation Module, which employs a Multi-Layer Perceptron, XGBoost,
LightGBM, and TabNet to analyze structured soil data, including nutrient
levels, pH, and rainfall. We curated a multimodal dataset of 10,000 paired
samples drawn from publicly available Kaggle repositories, approximately 50,000
soil images across seven classes, and 25,000 nutrient profiles for experimental
evaluation. The fused model achieves 98.0% accuracy, with a precision of 97.8%,
a recall of 97.7%, and an F1-score of 96.75%, while RMSE and MAE drop to 0.32
and 0.27, respectively. Ablation studies underscore the critical role of
multimodal coupling, and statistical validation via t-tests and ANOVA confirms
the significance of our improvements. AgroSense offers a practical, scalable
solution for real-time decision support in precision agriculture and paves the
way for future lightweight multimodal AI systems in resource-constrained
environments.

### [127] [M3Ret: Unleashing Zero-shot Multimodal Medical Image Retrieval via Self-Supervision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01360)
*Che Liu,Zheng Jiang,Chengyu Fang,Heng Guo,Yan-Jie Zhou,Jiaqi Qu,Le Lu,Minfeng Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: M3Ret introduces a unified visual encoder trained on a large-scale hybrid-modality medical dataset, using self-supervised learning (MAE and SimDINO) to achieve state-of-the-art zero-shot image-to-image retrieval across 2D, 3D, and video modalities, with cross-modal alignment emerging without paired data and good generalization to unseen MRI tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current medical image retrieval methods rely on modality-specific architectures and training strategies, hindering scalability and the development of unified representations. A single, modality-agnostic model could enable efficient cross-modal retrieval and generalization to unseen modalities.

Method: Curate a large-scale hybrid-modality dataset with 867,653 samples (2D X-rays and ultrasounds, RGB endoscopy videos, 3D CT scans). Train M3Ret, a unified visual encoder with no modality-specific customization, using self-supervised learning via MAE (generative) and SimDINO (contrastive). Evaluate zero-shot image-to-image retrieval across modalities, analyze cross-modal alignment without paired data, and test generalization to unseen MRI tasks. Conduct scalability analyses across model and data sizes.

Result: Achieves new state-of-the-art in zero-shot image-to-image retrieval across all modalities, outperforming baselines such as DINOv3 and text-supervised BMC-CLIP. Cross-modal alignment emerges without paired data, and the model generalizes to unseen MRI tasks despite no MRI during pretraining. Analyses demonstrate scalability of the framework with varying model and data sizes.

Conclusion: Purely visual self-supervision can yield transferable, cross-modally aligned representations on a unified multimodal medical dataset, advancing toward foundation models for visual SSL in multimodal medical image understanding.

Abstract: Medical image retrieval is essential for clinical decision-making and
translational research, relying on discriminative visual representations. Yet,
current methods remain fragmented, relying on separate architectures and
training strategies for 2D, 3D, and video-based medical data. This
modality-specific design hampers scalability and inhibits the development of
unified representations. To enable unified learning, we curate a large-scale
hybrid-modality dataset comprising 867,653 medical imaging samples, including
2D X-rays and ultrasounds, RGB endoscopy videos, and 3D CT scans. Leveraging
this dataset, we train M3Ret, a unified visual encoder without any
modality-specific customization. It successfully learns transferable
representations using both generative (MAE) and contrastive (SimDINO)
self-supervised learning (SSL) paradigms. Our approach sets a new
state-of-the-art in zero-shot image-to-image retrieval across all individual
modalities, surpassing strong baselines such as DINOv3 and the text-supervised
BMC-CLIP. More remarkably, strong cross-modal alignment emerges without paired
data, and the model generalizes to unseen MRI tasks, despite never observing
MRI during pretraining, demonstrating the generalizability of purely visual
self-supervision to unseen modalities. Comprehensive analyses further validate
the scalability of our framework across model and data sizes. These findings
deliver a promising signal to the medical imaging community, positioning M3Ret
as a step toward foundation models for visual SSL in multimodal medical image
understanding.

### [128] [Identity-Preserving Text-to-Video Generation via Training-Free Prompt, Image, and Guidance Enhancement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01362)
*Jiayi Gao,Changcheng Hua,Qingchao Chen,Yuxin Peng,Yang Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A training-free IPT2V framework (TPIGE) improves identity preservation and video quality by jointly refining prompts, reference images, and guidance, achieving state-of-the-art results on IPT2V with minimal cost; demonstrated on a 1000-video test set and winning ACM Multimedia 2025.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Data scarcity and high tuning costs hinder identity-preserving text-to-video generation. There is a need for training-free methods to bridge semantic gaps between a reference image and a text prompt, while maintaining video quality and identity fidelity.

Method: TPIGE consists of three mutually reinforcing components: (1) Face Aware Prompt Enhancement uses GPT-4o to enrich the text prompt with facial details from the reference image; (2) Prompt Aware Reference Image Enhancement uses an identity-preserving image generator to refine the reference image to align better with the text prompt; (3) ID-Aware Spatiotemporal Guidance Enhancement employs unified gradients to jointly optimize identity preservation and video quality during generation.

Result: Outperforms prior work on IPT2V, validated by automatic and human evaluations on a 1000-video test set; achieved first place in the ACM Multimedia 2025 Identity-Preserving Video Generation Challenge; code released at the provided GitHub link, indicating good generality.

Conclusion: A training-free framework with mutual prompt/image refinement and unified guidance can achieve state-of-the-art IPT2V performance with low cost and strong generality. It reduces dependence on large-scale ID-tuned models, though it relies on external models (GPT-4o and an identity-preserving image generator) and may raise considerations regarding latency and resource use.

Abstract: Identity-preserving text-to-video (IPT2V) generation creates videos faithful
to both a reference subject image and a text prompt. While fine-tuning large
pretrained video diffusion models on ID-matched data achieves state-of-the-art
results on IPT2V, data scarcity and high tuning costs hinder broader
improvement. We thus introduce a Training-Free Prompt, Image, and Guidance
Enhancement (TPIGE) framework that bridges the semantic gap between the video
description and the reference image and design sampling guidance that enhances
identity preservation and video quality, achieving performance gains at minimal
cost.Specifically, we first propose Face Aware Prompt Enhancement, using GPT-4o
to enhance the text prompt with facial details derived from the reference
image. We then propose Prompt Aware Reference Image Enhancement, leveraging an
identity-preserving image generator to refine the reference image, rectifying
conflicts with the text prompt. The above mutual refinement significantly
improves input quality before video generation. Finally, we propose ID-Aware
Spatiotemporal Guidance Enhancement, utilizing unified gradients to optimize
identity preservation and video quality jointly during generation.Our method
outperforms prior work and is validated by automatic and human evaluations on a
1000 video test set, winning first place in the ACM Multimedia 2025
Identity-Preserving Video Generation Challenge, demonstrating state-of-the-art
performance and strong generality. The code is available at

*Guilherme H. Apostolo,Pablo Bauszat,Vinod Nigade,Henri E. Bal,Lin Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Uiarapuru: an actuation-aware, edge-based real-time analytics framework for high-res steerable cameras that uses per-frame adaptive tiling to handle PTZ movements, achieving higher accuracy or faster inference than static-camera baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Camera actuation (PTZ) introduces dynamic viewpoints that invalidate static tiling assumptions and complicate real-time analytics; a system design that factors actuation is needed to maintain latency and accuracy.

Method: Integrates camera actuation model into the analytics pipeline and develops fast per-frame adaptive tiling that responds to PTZ state; evaluates on a high-res dataset with simulated PTZ movements and on a real PTZ camera; measures accuracy under latency budgets and inference speed.

Result: Up to 1.45x accuracy improvement within latency budgets; or up to 4.53x faster inference with comparable accuracy relative to state-of-the-art static-camera methods.

Conclusion: Actuation-aware adaptive tiling significantly improves real-time high-res video analytics on steerable cameras, enabling robust performance under dynamic viewpoints and practical deployment.

Abstract: Real-time video analytics on high-resolution cameras has become a popular
technology for various intelligent services like traffic control and crowd
monitoring. While extensive work has been done on improving analytics accuracy
with timing guarantees, virtually all of them target static viewpoint cameras.
In this paper, we present Uirapuru, a novel framework for real-time, edge-based
video analytics on high-resolution steerable cameras. The actuation performed
by those cameras brings significant dynamism to the scene, presenting a
critical challenge to existing popular approaches such as frame tiling. To
address this problem, Uirapuru incorporates a comprehensive understanding of
camera actuation into the system design paired with fast adaptive tiling at a
per-frame level. We evaluate Uirapuru on a high-resolution video dataset,
augmented by pan-tilt-zoom (PTZ) movements typical for steerable cameras and on
real-world videos collected from an actual PTZ camera. Our experimental results
show that Uirapuru provides up to 1.45x improvement in accuracy while
respecting specified latency budgets or reaches up to 4.53x inference speedup
with on-par accuracy compared to state-of-the-art static camera approaches.

*Wei Lu,Lingyu Zhu,Si-Bao Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes U3D dataset, Edge Efficiency Index (EEI), and U3LIE framework to enable unsupervised LIE for ultra-high-res UAV imagery with real-time on-board performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Low-light UAV imagery faces severe challenges: lack of paired data, severe non-uniform illumination, ultra-high resolution (UHR), and deployment constraints. Existing LIE methods underperform for aerial data and real-time on-board processing is desired.

Method: 1) U3D – first unsupervised UHR UAV Low-Light Image Enhancement dataset with a unified evaluation toolkit; 2) EEI – Edge Efficiency Index, a metric balancing perceptual quality with deployment factors (speed, resolution, model complexity, memory); 3) U3LIE – a light-weight framework with APA (Adaptive Pre-enhancement Augmentation) for input normalization and L_int (Luminance Interval Loss) for exposure control; optimized for 4K at 23.8 FPS on a single GPU.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results and real-time (4K at 23.8 FPS on a single GPU) performance; demonstrates effectiveness of the dataset, metric, and method; code and datasets are released.

Conclusion: Provides a holistic solution (dataset, metric, and method) for advancing robust 24/7 UAV vision and enabling real-time low-light perception on UAVs; facilitates future research and practical deployment.

Abstract: Low light conditions significantly degrade Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs)
performance in critical applications. Existing Low-light Image Enhancement
(LIE) methods struggle with the unique challenges of aerial imagery, including
Ultra-High Resolution (UHR), lack of paired data, severe non-uniform
illumination, and deployment constraints. To address these issues, we propose
three key contributions. First, we present U3D, the first unsupervised UHR UAV
dataset for LIE, with a unified evaluation toolkit. Second, we introduce the
Edge Efficiency Index (EEI), a novel metric balancing perceptual quality with
key deployment factors: speed, resolution, model complexity, and memory
footprint. Third, we develop U3LIE, an efficient framework with two
training-only designs-Adaptive Pre-enhancement Augmentation (APA) for input
normalization and a Luminance Interval Loss (L_int) for exposure control. U3LIE
achieves SOTA results, processing 4K images at 23.8 FPS on a single GPU, making
it ideal for real-time on-board deployment. In summary, these contributions
provide a holistic solution (dataset, metric, and method) for advancing robust
24/7 UAV vision. The code and datasets are available at

### [131] [Enhancing Partially Relevant Video Retrieval with Robust Alignment Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01383)
*Long Zhang,Peipei Song,Jianfeng Dong,Kun Li,Xun Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes Robust Alignment Learning (RAL) for Partially Relevant Video Retrieval by modeling data uncertainty with Gaussian video/query representations and learnable confidence gates; a plug-and-play framework that improves cross-modal alignment and robustness against distractors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PRVR is hindered by data uncertainty: query ambiguity and partial relevance cause spurious correlations and noisy cross-modal alignment; existing methods focusing on multi-scale clips struggle with distractor videos.

Method: Encode videos and queries as multivariate Gaussian distributions to capture uncertainty, use proxy-level matching to handle cross-modal variability, and introduce learnable confidence gates to weight word informativeness; designed as a plug-and-play module that can be integrated into existing architectures.

Result: Extensive experiments across diverse retrieval backbones demonstrate effectiveness, showing improved robustness and alignment over strong baselines in PRVR tasks.

Conclusion: RAL pioneers probabilistic modeling for PRVR, enabling uncertainty quantification and dynamic alignment weighting; it can be integrated into current architectures to improve performance under data noise.

Abstract: Partially Relevant Video Retrieval (PRVR) aims to retrieve untrimmed videos
partially relevant to a given query. The core challenge lies in learning robust
query-video alignment against spurious semantic correlations arising from
inherent data uncertainty: 1) query ambiguity, where the query incompletely
characterizes the target video and often contains uninformative tokens, and 2)
partial video relevance, where abundant query-irrelevant segments introduce
contextual noise in cross-modal alignment. Existing methods often focus on
enhancing multi-scale clip representations and retrieving the most relevant
clip. However, the inherent data uncertainty in PRVR renders them vulnerable to
distractor videos with spurious similarities, leading to suboptimal
performance. To fill this research gap, we propose Robust Alignment Learning
(RAL) framework, which explicitly models the uncertainty in data. Key
innovations include: 1) we pioneer probabilistic modeling for PRVR by encoding
videos and queries as multivariate Gaussian distributions. This not only
quantifies data uncertainty but also enables proxy-level matching to capture
the variability in cross-modal correspondences; 2) we consider the
heterogeneous informativeness of query words and introduce learnable confidence
gates to dynamically weight similarity. As a plug-and-play solution, RAL can be
seamlessly integrated into the existing architectures. Extensive experiments
across diverse retrieval backbones demonstrate its effectiveness.

### [132] [RibPull: Implicit Occupancy Fields and Medial Axis Extraction for CT Ribcage Scans](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01402)
*Emmanouil Nikolakakis,Amine Ouasfi,Julie Digne,Razvan Marinescu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RibPull uses neural occupancy fields (implicit 3D representations) to model ribcages from CT scans, enabling a continuous geometric representation and Laplacian-based medial-axis extraction; evaluated on RibSeg data; code to be released.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Implicit, coordinate-based 3D representations overcome voxel grid limitations (resolution, topological information loss, sparsity) and support robust geometric processing and neural scene encoding for medical imaging.

Method: Train neural occupancy fields to predict inside/outside for 3D points to represent CT ribcages; apply Laplacian-based contraction to extract the ribcage's medial axis; evaluate on 20 scans from the RibSeg dataset; plan to release code.

Result: Demonstrates that implicit coordinate-based representations can compensate for sparse signals and enable geometric operations such as medial-axis extraction in ribcage models; study evaluated on 20 RibSeg scans; code to be released.

Conclusion: Implicit representations offer advantages for sparse medical data by preserving geometry with continuous functions and enabling downstream geometry processing, with the ability to encode 3D scenes within model weights and support morphologic operations.

Abstract: We present RibPull, a methodology that utilizes implicit occupancy fields to
bridge computational geometry and medical imaging. Implicit 3D representations
use continuous functions that handle sparse and noisy data more effectively
than discrete methods. While voxel grids are standard for medical imaging, they
suffer from resolution limitations, topological information loss, and
inefficient handling of sparsity. Coordinate functions preserve complex
geometrical information and represent a better solution for sparse data
representation, while allowing for further morphological operations. Implicit
scene representations enable neural networks to encode entire 3D scenes within
their weights. The result is a continuous function that can implicitly
compesate for sparse signals and infer further information about the 3D scene
by passing any combination of 3D coordinates as input to the model. In this
work, we use neural occupancy fields that predict whether a 3D point lies
inside or outside an object to represent CT-scanned ribcages. We also apply a
Laplacian-based contraction to extract the medial axis of the ribcage, thus
demonstrating a geometrical operation that benefits greatly from continuous
coordinate-based 3D scene representations versus voxel-based representations.
We evaluate our methodology on 20 medical scans from the RibSeg dataset, which
is itself an extension of the RibFrac dataset. We will release our code upon
publication.

*Jianman Lin,Tianshui Chen,Chunmei Qing,Zhijing Yang,Shuangping Huang,Yuheng Ren,Liang Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NSD enables photo-realistic region editing with semantic control and stylistic consistency using dual cross-attention and a Progressive Self-style Representational Learning (PSRL) module, backed by a standardized benchmark for fair evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Maintaining stylistic consistency during image editing is essential for cohesion and realism; existing methods focus on semantic control but neglect style coherence across edited and surrounding regions.

Method: NSD employs a diffusion model with two parallel cross-attention streams for text and style information. It introduces PSRL, a style-contrastive learning module that enforces high intra-image style similarity and low inter-image similarity. A new benchmark with style-related metrics and diverse datasets is proposed for fair comparison.

Result: Extensive experiments on the proposed benchmark show that NSD effectively achieves semantic alignment and style consistency, validating the utility of the PSRL module and the dual-attention design.

Conclusion: The framework advances controllable, photo-realistic image editing by jointly ensuring semantic relevance and stylistic coherence, supported by a standardized evaluation protocol and demonstrated effectiveness.

Abstract: Maintaining stylistic consistency is crucial for the cohesion and aesthetic
appeal of images, a fundamental requirement in effective image editing and
inpainting. However, existing methods primarily focus on the semantic control
of generated content, often neglecting the critical task of preserving this
consistency. In this work, we introduce the Neural Scene Designer (NSD), a
novel framework that enables photo-realistic manipulation of user-specified
scene regions while ensuring both semantic alignment with user intent and
stylistic consistency with the surrounding environment. NSD leverages an
advanced diffusion model, incorporating two parallel cross-attention mechanisms
that separately process text and style information to achieve the dual
objectives of semantic control and style consistency. To capture fine-grained
style representations, we propose the Progressive Self-style Representational
Learning (PSRL) module. This module is predicated on the intuitive premise that
different regions within a single image share a consistent style, whereas
regions from different images exhibit distinct styles. The PSRL module employs
a style contrastive loss that encourages high similarity between
representations from the same image while enforcing dissimilarity between those
from different images. Furthermore, to address the lack of standardized
evaluation protocols for this task, we establish a comprehensive benchmark.
This benchmark includes competing algorithms, dedicated style-related metrics,
and diverse datasets and settings to facilitate fair comparisons. Extensive
experiments conducted on our benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of the
proposed framework.

### [134] [MILO: A Lightweight Perceptual Quality Metric for Image and Latent-Space Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01411)
*Uğur Çoğalan,Mojtaba Bemana,Karol Myszkowski,Hans-Peter Seidel,Colin Groth*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MILO is a compact, multiscale FR-IQA metric trained with pseudo-MOS that achieves state-of-the-art performance and doubles as a perceptual loss for image and latent-space optimization, including Stable Diffusion with curriculum masking to improve denoising, super-resolution, and face restoration while reducing compute.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need for accurate, fast image quality assessment with limited access to large human-annotated MOS datasets, and for effective perceptual losses in generative pipelines that account for masking effects.

Method: MILO is a lightweight, multiscale perceptual metric trained with pseudo-MOS supervision. Distortions are applied to diverse images and scored via an ensemble of recent quality metrics that model visual masking. MILO also serves as a perceptual loss in both image and latent domains. In Stable Diffusion, MILO's spatial masking is applied to latent representations from a VAE encoder, enabling perceptually aligned optimization. A curriculum learning strategy processes perceptually less relevant regions first, then shifts to more distorted areas to improve denoising, super-resolution, and face restoration while reducing computational overhead.

Result: MILO outperforms existing FR-IQA metrics on standard benchmarks and offers fast inference suitable for real-time applications. As a perceptual loss, it yields improved optimization in image and latent spaces, particularly in diffusion-based pipelines, with notable gains in denoising, super-resolution, and face restoration and reduced computational cost.

Conclusion: MILO is a state-of-the-art image quality metric and a practical perceptual optimization tool for generative pipelines. Its combination of spatial masking and curriculum learning enhances perceptual alignment and efficiency, including when applied to latent spaces in diffusion models.

Abstract: We present MILO (Metric for Image- and Latent-space Optimization), a
lightweight, multiscale, perceptual metric for full-reference image quality
assessment (FR-IQA). MILO is trained using pseudo-MOS (Mean Opinion Score)
supervision, in which reproducible distortions are applied to diverse images
and scored via an ensemble of recent quality metrics that account for visual
masking effects. This approach enables accurate learning without requiring
large-scale human-labeled datasets. Despite its compact architecture, MILO
outperforms existing metrics across standard FR-IQA benchmarks and offers fast
inference suitable for real-time applications. Beyond quality prediction, we
demonstrate the utility of MILO as a perceptual loss in both image and latent
domains. In particular, we show that spatial masking modeled by MILO, when
applied to latent representations from a VAE encoder within Stable Diffusion,
enables efficient and perceptually aligned optimization. By combining spatial
masking with a curriculum learning strategy, we first process perceptually less
relevant regions before progressively shifting the optimization to more
visually distorted areas. This strategy leads to significantly improved
performance in tasks like denoising, super-resolution, and face restoration,
while also reducing computational overhead. MILO thus functions as both a
state-of-the-art image quality metric and as a practical tool for perceptual
optimization in generative pipelines.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A tailored Bangladeshi street food calorie estimation system using a modified YOLOv8 with a regression model, achieving high accuracy (MAE 6.94, RMSE 11.03, R^2 96.0) for calorie estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Rising obesity and demand for automated calorie tracking, with limitations in existing methods: constant caloric output, weak multi-food recognition, scale/normalization issues, and Western-centric datasets. This work focuses on Bangladeshi street foods to improve relevance and accuracy.

Method: Construct a diverse dataset of Bangladeshi street foods; modify YOLOv8 for improved classification and segmentation; integrate a machine learning regression model to estimate calories from detected food items; evaluate performance.

Result: Modified YOLOv8 achieves superior classification/segmentation with only a slight computational cost; overall calorie estimation yields MAE 6.94, RMSE 11.03, and R^2 96.0% on real-world Bangladeshi street foods.

Conclusion: A targeted, accurate calorie estimation framework for Bangladeshi street foods, demonstrating practical viability for automated diet tracking in non-Western cuisines.

Abstract: As obesity rates continue to increase, automated calorie tracking has become
a vital tool for people seeking to maintain a healthy lifestyle or adhere to a
diet plan. Although numerous research efforts have addressed this issue,
existing approaches often face key limitations, such as providing only constant
caloric output, struggling with multiple food recognition challenges,
challenges in image scaling and normalization, and a predominant focus on
Western cuisines. In this paper, we propose a tailored solution that
specifically targets Bangladeshi street food. We first construct a diverse
dataset of popular street foods found across Bangladesh. Then, we develop a
refined calorie estimation system by modifying the state-of-the-art vision
model YOLOv8. Our modified model achieves superior classification and
segmentation results, with only a slight increase in computational complexity
compared to the base variant. Coupled with a machine learning regression model,
our system achieves an impressive 6.94 mean absolute error (MAE), 11.03 root
mean squared error (RMSE), and a 96.0% R^2 score in calorie estimation, making
it both highly effective and accurate for real-world food calorie calculations.

*Guohui Zhang,Jiangtong Tan,Linjiang Huang,Zhonghang Yuan,Naishan Zheng,Jie Huang,Feng Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: InfoScale tackles variability in diffusion models across scales by addressing three information bottlenecks (dilated conv loss, inflexible attention, misaligned noise). It proposes plug-and-play modules to compensate high-frequency info, adaptively aggregate information, and re-distribute noise for variable-scale generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DMs struggle when tested on resolutions away from training scale; variable-scale generation requires adapting information content across resolutions; unify analysis of three components.

Method: Propose InfoScale framework with: Progressive Frequency Compensation (PFC) to recover high-frequency lost by dilated conv at high res; Adaptive Information Aggregation (AIA) to flexibly balance local/global info across scales; Noise Adaptation (NA) to re-distribute initial noise info for variable scales; plug-and-play for existing DMs; extensive experiments.

Result: Extensive experiments show effectiveness of InfoScale in variable-scaled image generation (improved quality/consistency across scales).

Conclusion: InfoScale provides a unified, information-centric approach to variable-scaled DM generation, with three modular components that can be integrated into current diffusion models to mitigate scale-variance issues.

Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) have become dominant in visual generation but suffer
performance drop when tested on resolutions that differ from the training
scale, whether lower or higher. In fact, the key challenge in generating
variable-scale images lies in the differing amounts of information across
resolutions, which requires information conversion procedures to be varied for
generating variable-scaled images. In this paper, we investigate the issues of
three critical aspects in DMs for a unified analysis in variable-scaled
generation: dilated convolution, attention mechanisms, and initial noise.
Specifically, 1) dilated convolution in DMs for the higher-resolution
generation loses high-frequency information. 2) Attention for variable-scaled
image generation struggles to adjust the information aggregation adaptively. 3)
The spatial distribution of information in the initial noise is misaligned with
variable-scaled image. To solve the above problems, we propose
\textbf{InfoScale}, an information-centric framework for variable-scaled image
generation by effectively utilizing information from three aspects
correspondingly. For information loss in 1), we introduce Progressive Frequency
Compensation module to compensate for high-frequency information lost by
dilated convolution in higher-resolution generation. For information
aggregation inflexibility in 2), we introduce Adaptive Information Aggregation
module to adaptively aggregate information in lower-resolution generation and
achieve an effective balance between local and global information in
higher-resolution generation. For information distribution misalignment in 3),
we design Noise Adaptation module to re-distribute information in initial noise
for variable-scaled generation. Our method is plug-and-play for DMs and
extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness in variable-scaled image
generation.

### [137] [Mamba-CNN: A Hybrid Architecture for Efficient and Accurate Facial Beauty Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01431)
*Djamel Eddine Boukhari*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A hybrid CNN-SSM architecture (Mamba-CNN) combines a lightweight Mamba-inspired State Space Model gating mechanism with a hierarchical CNN backbone to model long-range facial relationships for attractiveness estimation, achieving state-of-the-art on SCUT-FBP5500 (PC 0.9187, MAE 0.2022, RMSE 0.2610).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Facial attractiveness estimation is subjective and regression-based; CNNs are efficient but have limited receptive fields, while Vision Transformers capture global context with high computational cost. A hybrid approach aims to balance efficiency with global context for nuanced perception.

Method: Embed a lightweight Mamba-inspired SSM gating module into a hierarchical CNN backbone to dynamically modulate feature maps, emphasizing salient facial features and long-range spatial relationships, enabling selective holistic perception while preserving efficiency.

Result: On SCUT-FBP5500, Mamba-CNN achieves Pearson Correlation 0.9187, MAE 0.2022, RMSE 0.2610, setting a new state-of-the-art for this task.

Conclusion: The combination of CNN efficiency with selective SSM-based long-range modeling offers a powerful architectural paradigm for nuanced visual understanding tasks, potentially extending to other structured perception problems.

Abstract: The computational assessment of facial attractiveness, a challenging
subjective regression task, is dominated by architectures with a critical
trade-off: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) offer efficiency but have
limited receptive fields, while Vision Transformers (ViTs) model global context
at a quadratic computational cost. To address this, we propose Mamba-CNN, a
novel and efficient hybrid architecture. Mamba-CNN integrates a lightweight,
Mamba-inspired State Space Model (SSM) gating mechanism into a hierarchical
convolutional backbone. This core innovation allows the network to dynamically
modulate feature maps and selectively emphasize salient facial features and
their long-range spatial relationships, mirroring human holistic perception
while maintaining computational efficiency. We conducted extensive experiments
on the widely-used SCUT-FBP5500 benchmark, where our model sets a new
state-of-the-art. Mamba-CNN achieves a Pearson Correlation (PC) of 0.9187, a
Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 0.2022, and a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of
0.2610. Our findings validate the synergistic potential of combining CNNs with
selective SSMs and present a powerful new architectural paradigm for nuanced

TL;DR: Introduces SoccerHigh dataset for soccer video summarization (237 matches across Spanish, French, Italian leagues) and a baseline model achieving F1=0.3956, plus a length-constrained evaluation metric; dataset and code released to benchmark sports highlight generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses lack of publicly available datasets for sports highlight generation, enabling robust model development and benchmarking.

Method: Curates shot boundaries for 237 matches using SoccerNet broadcast footage; proposes a task-specific baseline model; introduces a length-constrained evaluation metric.

Result: Baseline model achieves F1 score of 0.3956 on the test set; dataset and code are released; new evaluation metric proposed.

Conclusion: The SoccerHigh dataset fills a public data gap and provides a baseline and a more objective metric for evaluating sports highlight generation, enabling benchmarking and further research.

Abstract: Video summarization aims to extract key shots from longer videos to produce
concise and informative summaries. One of its most common applications is in
sports, where highlight reels capture the most important moments of a game,
along with notable reactions and specific contextual events. Automatic summary
generation can support video editors in the sports media industry by reducing
the time and effort required to identify key segments. However, the lack of
publicly available datasets poses a challenge in developing robust models for
sports highlight generation. In this paper, we address this gap by introducing
a curated dataset for soccer video summarization, designed to serve as a
benchmark for the task. The dataset includes shot boundaries for 237 matches
from the Spanish, French, and Italian leagues, using broadcast footage sourced
from the SoccerNet dataset. Alongside the dataset, we propose a baseline model
specifically designed for this task, which achieves an F1 score of 0.3956 in
the test set. Furthermore, we propose a new metric constrained by the length of
each target summary, enabling a more objective evaluation of the generated
content. The dataset and code are available at

*Ece Takmaz,Albert Gatt,Jakub Dotlacil*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Internal representations in pretrained vision encoders (activations, attention, patch uniformity) partially predict image memorability; sparse autoencoder loss on vision transformers can outperform CNN-based memorability proxies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand which model-internal features align with human memorability, bridging cognitive science findings with pretrained vision encoders.

Method: Analyze latent activations, attention distributions, and patch uniformity in pretrained vision encoders; additionally apply a sparse autoencoder loss over vision transformer representations as a proxy for memorability.

Result: Certain internal features correlate with memorability to some extent; sparse autoencoder loss on vision transformers yields better memorability proxy performance than methods based on CNN representations.

Conclusion: Model-internal features can be informative predictors of human memorability, highlighting a relationship between encoder representations and memorability.

Abstract: Images vary in how memorable they are to humans. Inspired by findings from
cognitive science and computer vision, this paper explores the correlates of
image memorability in pretrained vision encoders, focusing on latent
activations, attention distributions, and the uniformity of image patches. We
find that these features correlate with memorability to some extent.
Additionally, we explore sparse autoencoder loss over the representations of
vision transformers as a proxy for memorability, which yields results
outperforming past methods using convolutional neural network representations.
Our results shed light on the relationship between model-internal features and
memorability. They show that some features are informative predictors of what
makes images memorable to humans.

### [140] [Im2Haircut: Single-view Strand-based Hair Reconstruction for Human Avatars](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01469)
*Vanessa Sklyarova,Egor Zakharov,Malte Prinzler,Giorgio Becherini,Michael J. Black,Justus Thies*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A transformer-based hair prior learned from synthetic data, augmented with real data, guides a Gaussian-splatting reconstruction to recover 3D hair from single/multiple images, outperforming prior pipelines in orientation, silhouette, and backside consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reconstructing 3D strand-based hair from a single photograph is difficult due to diverse geometry and lack of ground-truth data; traditional MVS misses inner structure; priors trained only on synthetic data are limited; a hybrid training regime leveraging both synthetic (for internal geometry) and real data (for outer structure) can improve realism and fidelity.

Method: Train a transformer-based prior on synthetic data to capture internal hair geometry and use real data to inform outer structure. Use this prior to drive a Gaussian-splatting-based reconstruction from one or more images, with a local optimization step to fit visible strands while preserving 3D hairstyle structure.

Result: Qualitative and quantitative comparisons show superior performance in capturing hair orientation, overall silhouette, and backside consistency compared with existing reconstruction pipelines.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively leverages mixed data to learn a robust hairstyle prior and improves 3D hair reconstruction from single/multi-view images, advancing realism in hair generation and simulation.

Abstract: We present a novel approach for 3D hair reconstruction from single
photographs based on a global hair prior combined with local optimization.
Capturing strand-based hair geometry from single photographs is challenging due
to the variety and geometric complexity of hairstyles and the lack of ground
truth training data. Classical reconstruction methods like multi-view stereo
only reconstruct the visible hair strands, missing the inner structure of
hairstyles and hampering realistic hair simulation. To address this, existing
methods leverage hairstyle priors trained on synthetic data. Such data,
however, is limited in both quantity and quality since it requires manual work
from skilled artists to model the 3D hairstyles and create near-photorealistic
renderings. To address this, we propose a novel approach that uses both, real
and synthetic data to learn an effective hairstyle prior. Specifically, we
train a transformer-based prior model on synthetic data to obtain knowledge of
the internal hairstyle geometry and introduce real data in the learning process
to model the outer structure. This training scheme is able to model the visible
hair strands depicted in an input image, while preserving the general 3D
structure of hairstyles. We exploit this prior to create a
Gaussian-splatting-based reconstruction method that creates hairstyles from one
or more images. Qualitative and quantitative comparisons with existing
reconstruction pipelines demonstrate the effectiveness and superior performance
of our method for capturing detailed hair orientation, overall silhouette, and
backside consistency. For additional results and code, please refer to

### [141] [PointSlice: Accurate and Efficient Slice-Based Representation for 3D Object Detection from Point Clouds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01487)
*Liu Qifeng,Zhao Dawei,Dong Yabo,Xiao Liang,Wang Juan,Min Chen,Li Fuyang,Jiang Weizhong,Lu Dongming,Nie Yiming*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PointSlice slices 3D point clouds into multiple 2D x-y data slices, learning 2D distributions with a Slice Interaction Network to preserve vertical relationships, yielding faster inference with competitive accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Voxel-based methods offer high accuracy but are slow; pillar-based methods are faster but less accurate. There is a need for fast 3D detection with accuracy close to voxel-based methods.

Method: Convert 3D point clouds into multiple 2D (x-y) slices and train the model on 2D distributions as separate batches. Introduce a Slice Interaction Network (SIN) into the 2D backbone to capture vertical relationships across slices.

Result: On Waymo, PointSlice is 1.13x faster and has 0.79x fewer parameters than the state-of-the-art voxel-based SAFDNet, with only a 1.2 mAPH drop. On nuScenes, it achieves 66.74 mAP (state-of-the-art). On Argoverse 2, it is 1.10x faster, with 0.66x fewer parameters and a 1.0 mAP drop.

Conclusion: PointSlice demonstrates that converting 3D point clouds into 2D slices with an integrated Slice Interaction Network can deliver fast inference while maintaining competitive detection accuracy across multiple datasets.

Abstract: 3D object detection from point clouds plays a critical role in autonomous
driving. Currently, the primary methods for point cloud processing are
voxel-based and pillarbased approaches. Voxel-based methods offer high accuracy
through fine-grained spatial segmentation but suffer from slower inference
speeds. Pillar-based methods enhance inference speed but still fall short of
voxel-based methods in accuracy. To address these issues, we propose a novel
point cloud processing method, PointSlice, which slices point clouds along the
horizontal plane and includes a dedicated detection network. The main
contributions of PointSlice are: (1) A new point cloud processing technique
that converts 3D point clouds into multiple sets of 2D (x-y) data slices. The
model only learns 2D data distributions, treating the 3D point cloud as
separate batches of 2D data, which reduces the number of model parameters and
enhances inference speed; (2) The introduction of a Slice Interaction Network
(SIN). To maintain vertical relationships across slices, we incorporate SIN
into the 2D backbone network, which improves the model's 3D object perception
capability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PointSlice achieves high
detection accuracy and inference speed. On the Waymo dataset, PointSlice is
1.13x faster and has 0.79x fewer parameters than the state-of-the-art
voxel-based method (SAFDNet), with only a 1.2 mAPH accuracy reduction. On the
nuScenes dataset, we achieve a state-of-the-art detection result of 66.74 mAP.
On the Argoverse 2 dataset, PointSlice is 1.10x faster, with 0.66x fewer
parameters and a 1.0 mAP accuracy reduction. The code will be available at
https://github.com/qifeng22/PointSlice2.

*Sebastian Eilermann,René Heesch,Oliver Niggemann*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A continuous-time, point-space 3D shape generator (ConTiCoM-3D) eliminates discrete diffusion steps, latent encodings, and teacher models, using a TrigFlow-inspired noise schedule and Chamfer loss for fast, high-fidelity shape synthesis with 1–2 inference steps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable fast, accurate 3D shape generation directly from point clouds without diffusion steps, latent decoders, or costly Jacobian-vector products, addressing inefficiencies in existing diffusion/latent methods.

Method: A time-conditioned, continuous-time neural network operates directly in point space. It employs a TrigFlow-inspired continuous noise schedule and a Chamfer-distance-based geometric loss to train stably on high-dimensional point sets and avoid Jacobian-vector products. It forgoes discretized diffusion steps and latent encodings, enabling efficient 1–2 step inference.

Result: On ShapeNet, ConTiCoM-3D matches or surpasses state-of-the-art diffusion and latent consistency models in both shape quality and computational efficiency, demonstrating faster generation with high geometric fidelity.

Conclusion: ConTiCoM-3D is a practical, scalable framework for 3D shape generation from point clouds, delivering fast, accurate results without diffusion steps or latent decoders.

Abstract: Fast and accurate 3D shape generation from point clouds is essential for
applications in robotics, AR/VR, and digital content creation. We introduce
ConTiCoM-3D, a continuous-time consistency model that synthesizes 3D shapes
directly in point space, without discretized diffusion steps, pre-trained
teacher models, or latent-space encodings. The method integrates a
TrigFlow-inspired continuous noise schedule with a Chamfer Distance-based
geometric loss, enabling stable training on high-dimensional point sets while
avoiding expensive Jacobian-vector products. This design supports efficient
one- to two-step inference with high geometric fidelity. In contrast to
previous approaches that rely on iterative denoising or latent decoders,
ConTiCoM-3D employs a time-conditioned neural network operating entirely in
continuous time, thereby achieving fast generation. Experiments on the ShapeNet
benchmark show that ConTiCoM-3D matches or outperforms state-of-the-art
diffusion and latent consistency models in both quality and efficiency,
establishing it as a practical framework for scalable 3D shape generation.

*Chao Deng,Xiaosen Li,Xiao Qin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduces a Self-Adaptive Convolution Module for MSA2-Net that tunes internal kernel sizes by dataset fingerprints, improving multiscale feature fusion and achieving strong Dice scores across multiple medical segmentation datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: nnUNet's automatic hyperparameter tuning doesn't adjust internal convolutional hyperparameters, limiting generalization. A dataset-aware adaptive kernel mechanism can better capture global and local features.

Method: Proposes Self-Adaptive Convolution Module; dynamically adjusts kernel size; integrates into MSConvBridge and MSADecoder of MSA2-Net; leverages CSWin Transformer skip connections to refine multi-stage features; aims to improve detailed organ segmentation.

Result: Dice: 86.49% (Synapse), 92.56% (ACDC), 93.37% (Kvasir), 92.98% (ISIC2017).

Conclusion: Dynamic kernel adaptation enhances both global and local feature representation and decoder detail, yielding robust, precise medical segmentation across diverse datasets.

Abstract: The nnUNet segmentation framework adeptly adjusts most hyperparameters in
training scripts automatically, but it overlooks the tuning of internal
hyperparameters within the segmentation network itself, which constrains the
model's ability to generalize. Addressing this limitation, this study presents
a novel Self-Adaptive Convolution Module that dynamically adjusts the size of
the convolution kernels depending on the unique fingerprints of different
datasets. This adjustment enables the MSA2-Net, when equipped with this module,
to proficiently capture both global and local features within the feature maps.
Self-Adaptive Convolution Module is strategically integrated into two key
components of the MSA2-Net: the Multi-Scale Convolution Bridge and the
Multi-Scale Amalgamation Decoder. In the MSConvBridge, the module enhances the
ability to refine outputs from various stages of the CSWin Transformer during
the skip connections, effectively eliminating redundant data that could
potentially impair the decoder's performance. Simultaneously, the MSADecoder,
utilizing the module, excels in capturing detailed information of organs
varying in size during the decoding phase. This capability ensures that the
decoder's output closely reproduces the intricate details within the feature
maps, thus yielding highly accurate segmentation images. MSA2-Net, bolstered by
this advanced architecture, has demonstrated exceptional performance, achieving
Dice coefficient scores of 86.49\%, 92.56\%, 93.37\%, and 92.98\% on the
Synapse, ACDC, Kvasir, and Skin Lesion Segmentation (ISIC2017) datasets,
respectively. This underscores MSA2-Net's robustness and precision in medical
image segmentation tasks across various datasets.

### [144] [Variation-aware Vision Token Dropping for Faster Large Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01552)
*Junjie Chen,Xuyang Liu,Zichen Wen,Yiyu Wang,Siteng Huang,Honggang Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A token-variation based LVLM acceleration method, V^2Drop, drops low-variation visual tokens during inference to cut computation, achieving near-original performance (image 94.0%, video 98.6%) and substantial latency reductions (image 31.5%, video 74.2%), with memory benefits when combined with efficient operators.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing inner-LLM token compression suffers from positional bias and incompatibility with efficient operators. Token variation is task-agnostic; need a method that leverages token-level variation to reduce computation without harming performance.

Method: Propose Variation-aware Vision Token Dropping (V^2Drop): progressively drop tokens with minimal variation during LVLM inference; analyze variation profiles across modalities and tasks; designed to be compatible with efficient operators to speed up inference and reduce memory.

Result: Extensive experiments across multiple models and benchmarks show the method maintains 94.0% image and 98.6% video performance; reduces generation latency by 31.5% (image) and 74.2% (video); combined with efficient operators reduces GPU peak memory usage.

Conclusion: Token variation perspective reveals low-variation tokens are task-agnostic; V^2Drop provides practical acceleration for LVLMs with minimal accuracy loss and memory efficiency, enabling deployment with efficient operators.

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in multimodal understanding tasks. However, the increasing demand
for high-resolution image and long-video understanding results in substantial
token counts, leading to reduced inference efficiency. Token compression offers
a direct solution by reducing the number of tokens to be processed, thereby
improving computational efficiency. Through extensive analysis, we identify two
critical limitations in existing inner-LLM token compression methods:
positional bias and incompatibility with efficient operators, which hinder
their practical deployment for LVLM acceleration. This paper presents the first
approach from a token variation perspective, revealing that visual token
variations within LLMs exhibit task-agnostic properties. We propose
Variation-aware Vision Token Dropping (\textit{i.e.}, \textbf{V$^2$Drop}),
which progressively removes visual tokens with minimal variation during LVLM
inference, thereby enhancing computational efficiency. Extensive experiments
across multiple models and benchmarks demonstrate that our V$^2$Drop is able to
maintain \textbf{94.0\%} and \textbf{98.6\%} of the original model performance
for image and video understanding tasks respectively, while reducing LLM
generation latency by \textbf{31.5\%} and \textbf{74.2\%}. When combined with
efficient operators, V$^2$Drop further reduces GPU peak memory usage.

TL;DR: Uniferum unifies heterogeneous 3D CT annotations into a single training framework, boosting AUROC on CT-RATE by 7% and showing zero-shot potential.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Public volumetric CT datasets vary in annotation formats; radiology VLMs often lack discriminative precision. There is a need for data-efficient, robust models that can leverage heterogeneous supervision signals for 3D medical imaging.

Method: Train a volumetric vision-language model (Uniferum) that harmonizes three public 3D CT datasets with distinct annotations, incorporating both classification labels and segmentation masks, including body segmentation, into a unified training objective.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art AUROC on the CT-RATE benchmark, with a 7% improvement over CLIP-based and conventional multi-label CNN baselines; exhibits robust out-of-distribution generalization and evidence of unexpected zero-shot performance on RAD-CHEST and INSPECT datasets.

Conclusion: Integrating heterogeneous annotations and body segmentation enhances performance and supports a data-efficient, clinically reliable pathway for 3D VLMs in radiology.

Abstract: General-purpose vision-language models (VLMs) have emerged as promising tools
in radiology, offering zero-shot capabilities that mitigate the need for large
labeled datasets. However, in high-stakes domains like diagnostic radiology,
these models often lack the discriminative precision required for reliable
clinical use. This challenge is compounded by the scarcity and heterogeneity of
publicly available volumetric CT datasets, which vary widely in annotation
formats and granularity. To address these limitations, we introduce Uniferum, a
volumetric VLM that unifies diverse supervision signals, encoded in
classification labels and segmentation masks, into a single training framework.
By harmonizing three public 3D CT datasets with distinct annotations, Uniferum
achieves state-of-the-art performance, improving AUROC on the CT-RATE benchmark
by 7% compared to CLIP-based and conventional multi-label convolutional models.
The model demonstrates robust out-of-distribution generalization, with observed
evidence of unexpected zero-shot performance on the RAD-CHEST and INSPECT
datasets. Our results highlight the effectiveness of integrating heterogeneous
annotations and body segmentation to enhance model performance, setting a new
direction for clinically reliable, data-efficient VLMs in 3D medical imaging.

*Dejia Cai,Yao Ran,Kun Yang,Xinwang Shi,Yingying Zhou,Kexian Wu,Yang Xu,Yi Hu,Xiaowei Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A deep-learning method (HIFU-ILDiff) uses VQ-VAE and latent diffusion to remove HIFU-induced interference from ultrasound images, enabling real-time, higher-quality guidance during HIFU therapy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-time ultrasound-guided HIFU is hindered by interference that can compromise treatment safety and precision; a robust denoising method is needed to improve monitoring.

Method: Encode noisy ultrasound images with a Vector Quantized VAE into a latent space, then apply a latent diffusion model to iteratively remove interference, and decode to high-quality, interference-free images. Training used 18,872 image pairs from in vitro phantoms, ex vivo tissues, and in vivo animals across modalities and HIFU power levels.

Result: Significantly outperforms Notch Filter: SSIM 0.796 and PSNR 23.780 vs Notch Filter's SSIM 0.443 and PSNR 14.420 in vitro. Real-time processing at 15 frames per second vs Notch Filter at 5 seconds per frame.

Conclusion: Demonstrates effective denoising of HIFU interference in guiding ultrasound, enabling real-time monitoring and likely improving treatment precision in clinical HIFU applications.

Abstract: High-Intensity Focused Ultrasound (HIFU) is a non-invasive therapeutic
technique widely used for treating various diseases. However, the success and
safety of HIFU treatments depend on real-time monitoring, which is often
hindered by interference when using ultrasound to guide HIFU treatment. To
address these challenges, we developed HIFU-ILDiff, a novel deep learning-based
approach leveraging latent diffusion models to suppress HIFU-induced
interference in ultrasound images. The HIFU-ILDiff model employs a Vector
Quantized Variational Autoencoder (VQ-VAE) to encode noisy ultrasound images
into a lower-dimensional latent space, followed by a latent diffusion model
that iteratively removes interference. The denoised latent vectors are then
decoded to reconstruct high-resolution, interference-free ultrasound images. We
constructed a comprehensive dataset comprising 18,872 image pairs from in vitro
phantoms, ex vivo tissues, and in vivo animal data across multiple imaging
modalities and HIFU power levels to train and evaluate the model. Experimental
results demonstrate that HIFU-ILDiff significantly outperforms the commonly
used Notch Filter method, achieving a Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) of
0.796 and Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) of 23.780 compared to SSIM of 0.443
and PSNR of 14.420 for the Notch Filter under in vitro scenarios. Additionally,
HIFU-ILDiff achieves real-time processing at 15 frames per second, markedly
faster than the Notch Filter's 5 seconds per frame. These findings indicate
that HIFU-ILDiff is able to denoise HIFU interference in ultrasound guiding
images for real-time monitoring during HIFU therapy, which will greatly improve
the treatment precision in current clinical applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Keye-VL-1.5 introduces a Slow-Fast video encoding strategy, progressive long-context pre-training from 8K to 128K tokens, and a post-training alignment pipeline to boost video understanding in Multimodal LLMs, achieving state-of-the-art results on video tasks while staying competitive on general multimodal benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Video understanding is inherently challenging due to dynamic, information-dense content. Existing models struggle to balance spatial resolution and temporal coverage and to process long sequences with robust reasoning and human-aligned outputs. There is a need for efficient per-frame computation, longer context handling, and improved alignment with human preferences.

Method: Three innovations: 1) Slow-Fast video encoding that allocates computation based on inter-frame similarity, using a high-resolution Slow pathway for frames with significant changes and a low-resolution Fast pathway for relatively static frames to increase temporal coverage. 2) Progressive four-stage pre-training to extend context length from 8K to 128K tokens, enabling processing of longer videos and more complex visual content. 3) Post-training pipeline focusing on reasoning and alignment: a 5-step chain-of-thought data construction process, iterative GSPO-based reinforcement learning with progressive prompt hinting for difficult cases, and alignment training.

Result: Comprehensive evaluation on public benchmarks and rigorous internal human assessment show Keye-VL-1.5 delivers significant improvements over existing models on video understanding tasks, while maintaining competitive performance on general multimodal benchmarks.

Conclusion: The combination of dynamic Slow-Fast encoding, long-context pre-training, and dedicated post-training alignment yields a robust Multimodal LLM capable of enhanced video understanding and longer-context reasoning, with promising implications for future video-centric AI systems.

Abstract: In recent years, the development of Large Language Models (LLMs) has
significantly advanced, extending their capabilities to multimodal tasks
through Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). However, video understanding
remains a challenging area due to the dynamic and information-dense nature of
videos. Existing models struggle with the trade-off between spatial resolution
and temporal coverage when processing video content. We present Keye-VL-1.5,
which addresses fundamental challenges in video comprehension through three key
innovations. First, we introduce a novel Slow-Fast video encoding strategy that
dynamically allocates computational resources based on inter-frame similarity,
processing key frames with significant visual changes at higher resolution
(Slow pathway) while handling relatively static frames with increased temporal
coverage at lower resolution (Fast pathway). Second, we implement a progressive
four-stage pre-training methodology that systematically extends the model's
context length from 8K to 128K tokens, enabling processing of longer videos and
more complex visual content. Third, we develop a comprehensive post-training
pipeline focusing on reasoning enhancement and human preference alignment,
incorporating a 5-step chain-of-thought data construction process, iterative
GSPO-based reinforcement learning with progressive prompt hinting for difficult
cases, and alignment training. Through extensive evaluation on public
benchmarks and rigorous internal human assessment, Keye-VL-1.5 demonstrates
significant improvements over existing models, particularly excelling in video
understanding tasks while maintaining competitive performance on general
multimodal benchmarks.

Motivation: To enable robust monocular SLAM across diverse camera rigs without requiring known intrinsics, while reducing frontend complexity and maintaining high-quality two-view constraints and drift mitigation through loop closures.

Method: A lightweight symmetric two-view association (STA) frontend that jointly estimates relative poses and regresses local pointmaps from two RGB images (no intrinsics required). The backend builds a Sim(3) pose graph with loop closures to mitigate accumulated drift and improve global consistency. The system emphasizes real-time performance and compact frontend size (35% of state-of-the-art).

Conclusion: ViSTA-SLAM provides a practical, intrinsic-free monocular SLAM solution with a compact frontend and a loop-closure–enhanced backend, delivering high-quality tracking and dense reconstructions across diverse camera setups; the authors release the code at the provided GitHub repository.

Abstract: We present ViSTA-SLAM as a real-time monocular visual SLAM system that
operates without requiring camera intrinsics, making it broadly applicable
across diverse camera setups. At its core, the system employs a lightweight
symmetric two-view association (STA) model as the frontend, which
simultaneously estimates relative camera poses and regresses local pointmaps
from only two RGB images. This design reduces model complexity significantly,
the size of our frontend is only 35\% that of comparable state-of-the-art
methods, while enhancing the quality of two-view constraints used in the
pipeline. In the backend, we construct a specially designed Sim(3) pose graph
that incorporates loop closures to address accumulated drift. Extensive

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: O-DisCo-Edit introduces a unified object distortion control for video editing using a random/adaptive-noise-based signal, paired with a copy-form preservation module, enabling efficient, high-fidelity editing and outperforming specialized and multitask state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Controllable video editing with diffusion models is hampered by the need for diverse control signals to manipulate different object properties, leading to complex model design and high training costs.

Method: Proposes O-DisCo-Edit, a unified framework that uses object distortion control (O-DisCo) signals derived from random/adaptive noise to encode diverse editing cues into a single representation, plus a copy-form preservation module to protect non-edited regions, enabling an effective training paradigm.

Result: Extensive experiments and human evaluations show that O-DisCo-Edit surpasses both specialized and multitask state-of-the-art methods across various video editing tasks.

Conclusion: O-DisCo-Edit offers a flexible, efficient, and high-fidelity solution for unified video editing control, reducing design complexity and training resources while delivering superior performance.

Abstract: Diffusion models have recently advanced video editing, yet controllable
editing remains challenging due to the need for precise manipulation of diverse
object properties. Current methods require different control signal for diverse
editing tasks, which complicates model design and demands significant training
resources. To address this, we propose O-DisCo-Edit, a unified framework that
incorporates a novel object distortion control (O-DisCo). This signal, based on
random and adaptive noise, flexibly encapsulates a wide range of editing cues
within a single representation. Paired with a "copy-form" preservation module
for preserving non-edited regions, O-DisCo-Edit enables efficient,
high-fidelity editing through an effective training paradigm. Extensive
experiments and comprehensive human evaluations consistently demonstrate that
O-DisCo-Edit surpasses both specialized and multitask state-of-the-art methods
across various video editing tasks.

### [150] [Improving Large Vision and Language Models by Learning from a Panel of Peers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01610)
*Jefferson Hernandez,Jing Shi,Simon Jenni,Vicente Ordonez,Kushal Kafle*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Panel-of-Peers learning uses a panel of LVLMs to mutually evaluate and refine outputs in an iterative classroom-like setting, reducing reliance on labeled data and improving performance across benchmarks (48% to 57%).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional LVLM alignment relies on costly or limited-quality human data and self-supervised data often causes hallucinations. A scalable, model-driven peer-review process could provide richer supervisory signals without extensive human labeling.

Method: A panel of LVLMs collaboratively evaluates, critiques, and refines outputs in response to prompts through an iterative self-improvement loop, simulating a peer-review classroom. They generate, assess, and improve outputs, using curated prompts and repeated rounds to align behaviors.

Result: Experiments show significant performance gains across multiple benchmarks, with the average score rising from 48% to 57% across fifteen benchmarks, indicating peer evaluations as a scalable alternative to traditional self-supervised alignment.

Conclusion: Panel-of-Peers demonstrates a scalable approach to alignment for LVLMs, potentially reducing dependence on human-labeled data while achieving notable performance gains; it introduces a collaborative learning paradigm that leverages model-to-model feedback.

Abstract: Traditional alignment methods for Large Vision and Language Models (LVLMs)
primarily rely on human-curated preference data. Human-generated preference
data is costly; machine-generated preference data is limited in quality; and
self-supervised preference data often introduces hallucinations. To overcome
these limitations, we propose a novel Panel-of-Peers learning framework
inspired by collaborative learning among humans. This approach leverages a
panel of LVLMs, each evaluating and learning from their collective outputs
through an iterative self-improvement process. By simulating a peer review
system, our models generate, assess, and refine outputs in response to a
curated set of prompts, mimicking a classroom learning environment. We
demonstrate that this methodology enhances model performance without requiring
extensive human-labeled datasets. Our experiments show significant improvement
across multiple benchmarks, demonstrating the potential of peer evaluations as
a scalable alternative to self-supervised alignment. Notably, we show that
Panel-of-Peers increases the average score on fifteen benchmarks from 48% to
57%

### [151] [Q-Sched: Pushing the Boundaries of Few-Step Diffusion Models with Quantization-Aware Scheduling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01624)
*Natalia Frumkin,Diana Marculescu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Post-training quantization of diffusion models by modifying the sampling scheduler (Q-Sched) rather than weights, achieving full-precision accuracy with ~4x smaller model size. It learns quantization-aware pre-conditioning (JAQ) via a reference-free loss using few calibration prompts, delivering notable FID gains over FP16 baselines and validated by a large user study on FLUX.1[schnell] and SDXL-Turbo.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models are extremely compute- and memory-intensive, with high-dimensional backbones and long sampling trajectories. Current post-training quantization methods typically require full-precision calibration and still rely on large networks, limiting practical deployment. A scheduler-based quantization offers a lightweight path to substantial size and compute reductions without sacrificing fidelity.

Method: Introduce Q-Sched, which alters the diffusion sampling trajectory (scheduler) instead of quantizing weights. Learn quantization-aware pre-conditioning coefficients using JAQ loss, which couples text-image compatibility with an image quality metric in a reference-free fashion and only requires a small set of calibration prompts, avoiding full-precision inference during calibration.

Result: Q-Sched achieves around a 4x reduction in model size while maintaining full-precision accuracy. It yields 15.5% FID improvement over FP16 4-step Latent Consistency Model and 16.6% improvement over FP16 8-step Phased Consistency Model. A large-scale user study (~80k annotations) confirms effectiveness on FLUX.1[schnell] and SDXL-Turbo.

Conclusion: Quantization-aware scheduler optimization is complementary to few-step distillation, enabling high-fidelity generation with substantially reduced model size and compute. Q-Sched offers a practical, calibration-efficient path to deploy high-quality diffusion models in resource-constrained settings.

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models are computationally intensive, often requiring
dozens of forward passes through large transformer backbones. For instance,
Stable Diffusion XL generates high-quality images with 50 evaluations of a
2.6B-parameter model, an expensive process even for a single batch. Few-step
diffusion models reduce this cost to 2-8 denoising steps but still depend on
large, uncompressed U-Net or diffusion transformer backbones, which are often
too costly for full-precision inference without datacenter GPUs. These
requirements also limit existing post-training quantization methods that rely
on full-precision calibration. We introduce Q-Sched, a new paradigm for
post-training quantization that modifies the diffusion model scheduler rather
than model weights. By adjusting the few-step sampling trajectory, Q-Sched
achieves full-precision accuracy with a 4x reduction in model size. To learn
quantization-aware pre-conditioning coefficients, we propose the JAQ loss,
which combines text-image compatibility with an image quality metric for
fine-grained optimization. JAQ is reference-free and requires only a handful of
calibration prompts, avoiding full-precision inference during calibration.
Q-Sched delivers substantial gains: a 15.5% FID improvement over the FP16
4-step Latent Consistency Model and a 16.6% improvement over the FP16 8-step
Phased Consistency Model, showing that quantization and few-step distillation
are complementary for high-fidelity generation. A large-scale user study with
more than 80,000 annotations further confirms Q-Sched's effectiveness on both
FLUX.1[schnell] and SDXL-Turbo.

### [152] [OpenVision 2: A Family of Generative Pretrained Visual Encoders for Multimodal Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01644)
*Yanqing Liu,Xianhang Li,Letian Zhang,Zirui Wang,Zeyu Zheng,Yuyin Zhou,Cihang Xie*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OpenVision 2 is a lightweight, generative-only rewrite that removes the text encoder and contrastive loss, achieving similar multimodal performance while significantly boosting training efficiency and scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve training efficiency, reduce memory, and simplify multimodal training by discarding the text encoder and contrastive objectives, building on CapPa, AIMv2, and LLaVA.

Method: Replace the original architecture with a purely generative objective: keep only captioning loss, remove text encoder and contrastive loss, train with ViT-L/14 base, evaluate on multimodal benchmarks, and scale to larger parameters.

Result: Despite simplification, OpenVision 2 matches original performance on multimodal tasks, while cutting training time ~1.5x (83h -> 57h) and memory ~1.8x (24.5GB -> 13.8GB); batch size increases from 2k to 8k, enabling models >1B parameters.

Conclusion: A lightweight, generative-only framework is a promising direction for future vision-language foundation models, balancing efficiency and capability.

Abstract: This paper provides a simplification on OpenVision's architecture and loss
design for enhancing its training efficiency. Following the prior
vision-language pretraining works CapPa and AIMv2, as well as modern multimodal
designs like LLaVA, our changes are straightforward: we remove the text encoder
(and therefore the contrastive loss), retaining only the captioning loss as a
purely generative training signal. We name this new version OpenVision 2. The
initial results are promising: despite this simplification, OpenVision 2
competitively matches the original model's performance on a broad set of
multimodal benchmarks while substantially cutting both training time and memory
consumption. For example, with ViT-L/14, it reduces training time by about 1.5x
(from 83h to 57h), and memory usage by about 1.8x (from 24.5GB to 13.8GB,
equivalently allowing the maximum batch size to grow from 2k to 8k). This
superior training efficiency also allows us to scale far beyond the largest
vision encoder used in OpenVision, reaching more than 1 billion parameters. We
hold a strong belief that this lightweight, generative-only paradigm is
compelling for future vision encoder development in multimodal foundation
models.

*Zetong Zhou,Dongping Chen,Zixian Ma,Zhihan Hu,Mingyang Fu,Sinan Wang,Yao Wan,Zhou Zhao,Ranjay Krishna*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ReVPT uses a GRPO-based RL approach to teach multi-modal LLMs to reason with four visual tools, achieving state-of-the-art on several perception-heavy benchmarks, with 3B and 7B variants notably surpassing instruction-tuned baselines on CV-Bench (~9 point gains).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Visual reasoning remains challenging: supervised finetuning of vision-enhanced LLMs requires expensive data, careful filtering, and often poor generalization. An RL-based approach aims to improve robustness and generalization by learning from task feedback and enabling richer tool usage.

Method: Introduce ReVPT, an RL framework that uses a novel GRPO-based algorithm to train multi-modal LLMs to reason with four visual tools. Trains with iterative policy optimization to improve tool-usage reasoning across perception-heavy tasks.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on SAT, CV-Bench, BLINK, and MMStar. ReVPT-3B and ReVPT-7B outperform instruct models by 9.03% and 9.44% on CV-Bench. Outperforms supervised fine-tuning and text-based RL finetuning baselines. Ablations provide insights into RL-based visual tool usage.

Conclusion: Demonstrates the effectiveness of RL-based visual tool usage for multi-modal LLMs, offering new insights via extensive ablations and releasing code to foster community adoption.

Abstract: Visual reasoning, a cornerstone of human intelligence, encompasses complex
perceptual and logical processes essential for solving diverse visual problems.
While advances in computer vision have produced powerful models for various
perceptual tasks, leveraging these for general visual reasoning remains
challenging. Prior work demonstrates that augmenting LLMs with vision models
via supervised finetuning improves performance, but faces key limitations such
as expensive data generation, reliance on careful data filtering, and poor
generalization. To address these issues, we propose ReVPT to enhance
multi-modal LLMs' abilities to reason about and use visual tools through
reinforcement learning. We introduce a novel RL algorithm based on GRPO,
designed to train models to reason with a suite of four visual tools. Through
extensive experiments, we show that our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance on several perception-heavy benchmarks, including SAT, CV-Bench,
BLINK and MMStar, significantly outperforming the supervised and text-based RL
finetuning baselines. Notably, Our ReVPT-3B and ReVPT-7B outperform the
instruct models by 9.03% and 9.44% on CV-Bench. Finally, we bring to the
community new insights on RL-based visual tool-usage through extensive
ablations. Our code is available at https://github.com/ls-kelvin/REVPT.

### [154] [GaussianGAN: Real-Time Photorealistic controllable Human Avatars](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01681)
*Mohamed Ilyes Lakhal,Richard Bowden*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GaussianGAN enables real-time photorealistic animatable avatars by densifying surfaces into Gaussian splats around skeletal limbs, using view segmentation and a UNet to fuse features for high-fidelity rendering at 79 FPS, achieving state-of-the-art PSNR on ZJU Mocap (32.94 dB) and Thuman4 (33.39 dB).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current neural rendering methods for avatars often produce noticeable blurring and lack real-time, controllable photorealism. This work aims to reduce blur and enable real-time, high-fidelity avatar rendering.

Method: Construct Gaussian points via a Gaussian splatting densification strategy around cylindrical limb surfaces derived from estimated skeletons. Render a segmentation map using camera calibration with a novel view segmentation module. Use a UNet to fuse rendered Gaussian features and segmentation maps to synthesize photorealistic avatars in real time (79 FPS).

Result: Real-time rendering at 79 FPS. Outperforms prior methods in visual perception and quality, achieving pixel fidelity of 32.94 dB on ZJU Mocap and 33.39 dB on Thuman4 datasets.

Conclusion: GaussianGAN presents a practical path to blurring-free, photorealistic, controllable avatars suitable for real-time applications by combining Gaussian splatting of limb-surrounding surfaces, view-aware segmentation, and a neural synthesis network.

Abstract: Photorealistic and controllable human avatars have gained popularity in the
research community thanks to rapid advances in neural rendering, providing fast
and realistic synthesis tools. However, a limitation of current solutions is
the presence of noticeable blurring. To solve this problem, we propose
GaussianGAN, an animatable avatar approach developed for photorealistic
rendering of people in real-time. We introduce a novel Gaussian splatting
densification strategy to build Gaussian points from the surface of cylindrical
structures around estimated skeletal limbs. Given the camera calibration, we
render an accurate semantic segmentation with our novel view segmentation
module. Finally, a UNet generator uses the rendered Gaussian splatting features
and the segmentation maps to create photorealistic digital avatars. Our method
runs in real-time with a rendering speed of 79 FPS. It outperforms previous
methods regarding visual perception and quality, achieving a state-of-the-art
results in terms of a pixel fidelity of 32.94db on the ZJU Mocap dataset and
33.39db on the Thuman4 dataset.

### [155] [Examination of PCA Utilisation for Multilabel Classifier of Multispectral Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01691)
*Filip Karpowicz,Wiktor Kępiński,Bartosz Staszyński,Grzegorz Sarwas*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PCA's utility for multi-label multispectral classification with ResNet50/DINOv2 is highly dependent on architecture and training strategy; reducing data to three dimensions with PCA yields conditional benefits when followed by a three-layer classifier; future work should explore self-supervised pretraining and other dimensionality reduction methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multispectral data are high-dimensional and multi-label annotation adds complexity; this study assesses whether PCA can ease the learning task and improve classification across deep learning architectures.

Method: An optional PCA step reduces inputs to 3 dimensions, then a three-layer classifier operates on these features. Experiments are conducted with ResNet50 and DINOv2 architectures under varying training strategies to evaluate PCA's impact on multi-label multispectral classification.

Result: PCA's effectiveness is strongly dependent on the chosen architecture and training strategy, indicating no universal benefit; the impact of PCA varies with model and training setup.

Conclusion: PCA can be useful in a context-dependent way for multi-label multispectral classification; optimal gains require careful selection of architecture and training strategy. The work suggests future research into self-supervised pretraining and alternative dimensionality reduction approaches.

Abstract: This paper investigates the utility of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for
multi-label classification of multispectral images using ResNet50 and DINOv2,
acknowledging the high dimensionality of such data and the associated
processing challenges. Multi-label classification, where each image may belong
to multiple classes, adds further complexity to feature extraction. Our
pipeline includes an optional PCA step that reduces the data to three
dimensions before feeding it into a three-layer classifier. The findings
demonstrate that the effectiveness of PCA for multi-label multispectral image
classification depends strongly on the chosen deep learning architecture and
training strategy, opening avenues for future research into self-supervised
pre-training and alternative dimensionality reduction approaches.

### [156] [Deep Learning-Based Rock Particulate Classification Using Attention-Enhanced ConvNeXt](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01704)
*Anthony Amankwah,Chris Aldrich*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: An enhanced ConvNeXt-based model (CNSCA) with self-attention and channel attention for rock-size classification, achieving improved accuracy and robustness over baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate rock-size classification is critical for geotechnical engineering, mining, and resource management; existing methods struggle with fine-grained textures and varying contexts, motivating a more expressive CNN architecture with attention.

Method: Extend ConvNeXt by integrating self-attention to capture long-range spatial dependencies and channel attention to weight informative feature maps; train on a rock-size dataset and compare against three strong baselines.

Result: The attention-enhanced CNSCA model yields significant accuracy and robustness gains on rock imagery compared with the baselines, validating the effectiveness of the attention modules for fine-grained natural-texture classification.

Conclusion: Attention mechanisms (self- and channel) improve fine-grained rock-texture classification; CNSCA is a viable approach for accurate rock-size classification in geotechnical applications.

Abstract: Accurate classification of rock sizes is a vital component in geotechnical
engineering, mining, and resource management, where precise estimation
influences operational efficiency and safety. In this paper, we propose an
enhanced deep learning model based on the ConvNeXt architecture, augmented with
both self-attention and channel attention mechanisms. Building upon the
foundation of ConvNext, our proposed model, termed CNSCA, introduces
self-attention to capture long-range spatial dependencies and channel attention
to emphasize informative feature channels. This hybrid design enables the model
to effectively capture both fine-grained local patterns and broader contextual
relationships within rock imagery, leading to improved classification accuracy
and robustness. We evaluate our model on a rock size classification dataset and
compare it against three strong baseline. The results demonstrate that the
incorporation of attention mechanisms significantly enhances the models
capability for fine-grained classification tasks involving natural textures
like rocks.

### [157] [Clinical Metadata Guided Limited-Angle CT Image Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01752)
*Yu Shi,Shuyi Fan,Changsheng Fang,Shuo Han,Haodong Li,Li Zhou,Bahareh Morovati,Dayang Wang,Hengyong Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A two-stage diffusion framework guides limited-angle CT reconstruction with structured clinical metadata. A transformer-based diffusion model, conditioned on metadata, first generates coarse priors; a second stage refines them using both priors and metadata. Physics-based consistency is enforced at each sampling step via ADMM. The approach yields state-of-the-art metrics under severe truncation on synthetic and real cardiac CT data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Limited-angle CT for cardiac imaging suffers from severe truncation artifacts due to ill-posed reconstruction. Incorporating structured clinical metadata (acquisition parameters, demographics, diagnostic impressions) can provide priors that improve fidelity and efficiency.

Method: Stage 1: A transformer-based diffusion model conditioned exclusively on metadata generates coarse anatomical priors from noise. Stage 2: A refinement stage integrates the coarse prior and metadata to produce high-fidelity images. At every sampling step, a physics-based data-consistency constraint is enforced via an ADMM module to align with measured projections. Evaluated on synthetic and real cardiac CT datasets; ablations show different metadata types contribute complementarily.

Result: The use of metadata significantly improves reconstruction fidelity under severe angular truncation. The method outperforms metadata-free baselines across SSIM, PSNR, nMI, and PCC. Ablation studies show diagnostic and demographic priors provide complementary benefits, and metadata types contribute to both quality and efficiency.

Conclusion: Metadata-guided diffusion with physics-based data consistency improves LACT reconstructions and highlights the dual role of clinical metadata in enhancing image quality and efficiency, supporting their integration into future metadata-informed imaging frameworks.

Abstract: Limited-angle computed tomography (LACT) offers improved temporal resolution
and reduced radiation dose for cardiac imaging, but suffers from severe
artifacts due to truncated projections. To address the ill-posedness of LACT
reconstruction, we propose a two-stage diffusion framework guided by structured
clinical metadata. In the first stage, a transformer-based diffusion model
conditioned exclusively on metadata, including acquisition parameters, patient
demographics, and diagnostic impressions, generates coarse anatomical priors
from noise. The second stage further refines the images by integrating both the
coarse prior and metadata to produce high-fidelity results. Physics-based data
consistency is enforced at each sampling step in both stages using an
Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers module, ensuring alignment with the
measured projections. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real cardiac
CT datasets demonstrate that incorporating metadata significantly improves
reconstruction fidelity, particularly under severe angular truncation. Compared
to existing metadata-free baselines, our method achieves superior performance
in SSIM, PSNR, nMI, and PCC. Ablation studies confirm that different types of
metadata contribute complementary benefits, particularly diagnostic and
demographic priors under limited-angle conditions. These findings highlight the
dual role of clinical metadata in improving both reconstruction quality and
efficiency, supporting their integration into future metadata-guided medical
imaging frameworks.

Motivation: There is a scarcity of labeled AM defect data, which hinders robust defect detection. Existing meta-learning approaches have limitations in leveraging unlabeled data and adapting to novel-defect classes.

Method: A hybrid framework that uses transfer learning to provide a strong feature backbone and semi-supervised few-shot learning to adapt to novel defect classes with minimal labels, leveraging both labeled and unlabeled images to train robust detectors.

Result: On a Surface Defects dataset with 8,284 images, TransMatch achieves 98.91% accuracy with minimal loss and strong precision, recall, and F1-scores across defect classes (cracks, pinholes, holes, spatter).

Conclusion: TransMatch offers a scalable, practical solution for AM defect detection that can improve QA and reliability across diverse industrial applications by effectively leveraging limited labeled data and unlabeled samples.

Abstract: Surface defects in Laser Powder Bed Fusion (LPBF) pose significant risks to
the structural integrity of additively manufactured components. This paper
introduces TransMatch, a novel framework that merges transfer learning and
semi-supervised few-shot learning to address the scarcity of labeled AM defect
data. By effectively leveraging both labeled and unlabeled novel-class images,
TransMatch circumvents the limitations of previous meta-learning approaches.
Experimental evaluations on a Surface Defects dataset of 8,284 images
demonstrate the efficacy of TransMatch, achieving 98.91% accuracy with minimal
loss, alongside high precision, recall, and F1-scores for multiple defect
classes. These findings underscore its robustness in accurately identifying
diverse defects, such as cracks, pinholes, holes, and spatter. TransMatch thus
represents a significant leap forward in additive manufacturing defect
detection, offering a practical and scalable solution for quality assurance and
reliability across a wide range of industrial applications.

### [159] [Mixture of Balanced Information Bottlenecks for Long-Tailed Visual Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01804)
*Yifan Lan,Xin Cai,Jun Cheng,Shan Tan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduces Balanced Information Bottleneck (BIB) and its extension MBIB for long-tailed visual recognition, integrating loss re-balancing and self-distillation into the information bottleneck framework; achieves state-of-the-art results on standard long-tailed datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world visual data are often long-tailed, causing biased learning with conventional DNNs. The Information Bottleneck (IB) framework offers principled representation learning, but it needs adjustments to preserve class-relevant information across imbalanced data and across network depths.

Method: Proposes BIB by incorporating loss re-balancing and self-distillation into the IB objective to retain label-related information while compressing representations. Extends to MBIB, a mixture of multiple BIBs across different layers that jointly learns representations and classification in an end-to-end, information-theoretic framework.

Result: On long-tailed benchmarks CIFAR100-LT, ImageNet-LT, and iNaturalist 2018, both BIB and MBIB achieve state-of-the-art performance for long-tailed visual recognition.

Conclusion: BIB provides a principled, effective mechanism to learn balanced, information-rich representations under long-tailed conditions; MBIB further enhances this by aggregating layer-wise information through multiple BIBs, enabling superior end-to-end learning.

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved significant success in various
applications with large-scale and balanced data. However, data in real-world
visual recognition are usually long-tailed, bringing challenges to efficient
training and deployment of DNNs. Information bottleneck (IB) is an elegant
approach for representation learning. In this paper, we propose a balanced
information bottleneck (BIB) approach, in which loss function re-balancing and
self-distillation techniques are integrated into the original IB network. BIB
is thus capable of learning a sufficient representation with essential
label-related information fully preserved for long-tailed visual recognition.
To further enhance the representation learning capability, we also propose a
novel structure of mixture of multiple balanced information bottlenecks (MBIB),
where different BIBs are responsible for combining knowledge from different
network layers. MBIB facilitates an end-to-end learning strategy that trains
representation and classification simultaneously from an information theory
perspective. We conduct experiments on commonly used long-tailed datasets,
including CIFAR100-LT, ImageNet-LT, and iNaturalist 2018. Both BIB and MBIB
reach state-of-the-art performance for long-tailed visual recognition.

### [160] [PractiLight: Practical Light Control Using Foundational Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01837)
*Yotam Erel,Rishabh Dabral,Vladislav Golyanik,Amit H. Bermano,Christian Theobalt*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PractiLight introduces a lightweight LoRA regressor that predicts an irradiance map for image lighting control, treating lighting relations as token interactions in self-attention, enabling general, data-efficient relighting via Classifier Guidance in diffusion models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Lighting control in generated images is difficult and generalization is hampered by domain-specific datasets; there is a need to leverage foundational model knowledge to enable practical, general relighting.

Method: Train a lightweight LoRA regressor to produce a direct irradiance map from a given image using a small training set; align lighting relationships with self-attention token interactions; use the regressor to guide the generation to incorporate desired lighting via Classifier Guidance, noting the importance of early diffusion iterations.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art quality and controllability with data- and parameter-efficient requirements across diverse scene types.

Conclusion: Demonstrates that image lighting control can be achieved by tapping into foundational knowledge of diffusion models and attention, enabling practical and general relighting.

Abstract: Light control in generated images is a difficult task, posing specific
challenges, spanning over the entire image and frequency spectrum. Most
approaches tackle this problem by training on extensive yet domain-specific
datasets, limiting the inherent generalization and applicability of the
foundational backbones used. Instead, PractiLight is a practical approach,
effectively leveraging foundational understanding of recent generative models
for the task. Our key insight is that lighting relationships in an image are
similar in nature to token interaction in self-attention layers, and hence are
best represented there. Based on this and other analyses regarding the
importance of early diffusion iterations, PractiLight trains a lightweight LoRA
regressor to produce the direct irradiance map for a given image, using a small
set of training images. We then employ this regressor to incorporate the
desired lighting into the generation process of another image using Classifier
Guidance. This careful design generalizes well to diverse conditions and image
domains. We demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in terms of quality and
control with proven parameter and data efficiency compared to leading works
over a wide variety of scenes types. We hope this work affirms that image
lighting can feasibly be controlled by tapping into foundational knowledge,
enabling practical and general relighting.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LGDiST is a reference-free latent gene diffusion model for Spatial Transcriptomics dropout that surpasses prior methods, achieving 18% lower MSE on 26 datasets for gene expression completion and improving downstream prediction by up to 10% MSE across six methods; it builds a biologically meaningful latent space using context genes and neighbor conditioning, and ablations show the full architecture is essential.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses limitations of dropout and reliance on single-cell RNA-seq references, batch effects, and inherited dropout by providing a reference-free approach to impute/complete ST data.

Method: Introduces LGDiST, a latent diffusion model operating on ST data; uses a latent space built from context genes previously deemed uninformative; includes ST latent space, neighbor conditioning; ablation studies remove context genes, space, neighbor conditioning.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art in gene expression completion with 18% lower mean squared error across 26 datasets; improves six leading methods' downstream gene expression prediction by up to 10% MSE; ablation results highlight importance of full architecture.

Conclusion: LGDiST demonstrates the viability and advantages of a reference-free diffusion-based approach for ST data dropout; the full model, including context genes and neighbor conditioning, is crucial for performance.

Abstract: Computer Vision has proven to be a powerful tool for analyzing Spatial
Transcriptomics (ST) data. However, current models that predict spatially
resolved gene expression from histopathology images suffer from significant
limitations due to data dropout. Most existing approaches rely on single-cell
RNA sequencing references, making them dependent on alignment quality and
external datasets while also risking batch effects and inherited dropout. In
this paper, we address these limitations by introducing LGDiST, the first
reference-free latent gene diffusion model for ST data dropout. We show that
LGDiST outperforms the previous state-of-the-art in gene expression completion,
with an average Mean Squared Error that is 18% lower across 26 datasets.
Furthermore, we demonstrate that completing ST data with LGDiST improves gene
expression prediction performance on six state-of-the-art methods up to 10% in
MSE. A key innovation of LGDiST is using context genes previously considered
uninformative to build a rich and biologically meaningful genetic latent space.
Our experiments show that removing key components of LGDiST, such as the
context genes, the ST latent space, and the neighbor conditioning, leads to
considerable drops in performance. These findings underscore that the full
architecture of LGDiST achieves substantially better performance than any of
its isolated components.

*Komala Subramanyam Cherukuri,Kewei Sha,Zhenhua Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Holistic deployment-oriented evaluation of FL-based object detection in CAVs, linking accuracy with system resource usage and environmental robustness across multiple detectors and datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Centralized training offers accuracy but lacks scalability, adaptability, and privacy. Federated learning (FL) enables privacy-preserving, collaborative training across distributed CAV fleets, but real-world deployment faces heavy compute, hardware constraints, non-IID data, and environmental variability. A deployment-focused evaluation is needed to guide robust FL deployment in CAVs.

Method: Evaluate state-of-the-art detectors (YOLOv5, YOLOv8, YOLOv11, Deformable DETR) on KITTI, BDD100K, and nuScenes. Analyze trade-offs between detection accuracy, computational cost, and resource usage under varying resolutions, batch sizes, weather/lighting, and dynamic client participation; combine model performance with system-level resource profiling and environmental robustness.

Result: Provides a holistic view of the accuracy-resource trade-offs and robustness of FL-based object detection in CAVs. Demonstrates feasibility under diverse conditions and identifies bottlenecks and design choices (e.g., model selection, scheduling, compression) necessary for deployment.

Conclusion: This work lays groundwork for deploying FL-based object detection in CAVs by integrating performance, system profiling, and environmental robustness, and point to future work to address non-IID data, hardware constraints, and environmental variability.

Abstract: Object detection is crucial for Connected Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) to
perceive their surroundings and make safe driving decisions. Centralized
training of object detection models often achieves promising accuracy, fast
convergence, and simplified training process, but it falls short in
scalability, adaptability, and privacy-preservation. Federated learning (FL),
by contrast, enables collaborative, privacy-preserving, and continuous training
across naturally distributed CAV fleets. However, deploying FL in real-world
CAVs remains challenging due to the substantial computational demands of
training and inference, coupled with highly diverse operating conditions.
Practical deployment must address three critical factors: (i) heterogeneity
from non-IID data distributions, (ii) constrained onboard computing hardware,
and (iii) environmental variability such as lighting and weather, alongside
systematic evaluation to ensure reliable performance. This work introduces the
first holistic deployment-oriented evaluation of FL-based object detection in
CAVs, integrating model performance, system-level resource profiling, and
environmental robustness. Using state-of-the-art detectors, YOLOv5, YOLOv8,
YOLOv11, and Deformable DETR, evaluated on the KITTI, BDD100K, and nuScenes
datasets, we analyze trade-offs between detection accuracy, computational cost,
and resource usage under diverse resolutions, batch sizes, weather and lighting
conditions, and dynamic client participation, paving the way for robust FL
deployment in CAVs.

### [163] [Doctoral Thesis: Geometric Deep Learning For Camera Pose Prediction, Registration, Depth Estimation, and 3D Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01873)
*Xueyang Kang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Geometric deep learning for 3D vision that combines traditional geometry with learning; develops methods for camera pose estimation, point cloud registration, depth prediction, and 3D reconstruction, using geometric priors; validated in cultural heritage and VR/AR contexts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D data are high-dimensional and scarce in labeled data, making DL training difficult. SfM/SLAM work well indoors but struggle in unstructured environments and with detailed geometry for downstream tasks. There is a need for 3D representations that fuse geometry with learning for robust, geometry-aware models.

Method: Develop geometric deep learning methods tailored to core 3D vision tasks (camera pose estimation, point cloud registration, depth prediction, 3D reconstruction) by integrating geometric priors and constraints (depth, surface normals, equivariance) and by combining traditional geometric techniques with deep learning.

Result: Demonstrates effectiveness and improved robustness/accuracy of geometry-aware representations across real-world applications, including digital cultural heritage preservation and immersive VR/AR environments.

Conclusion: Integrating geometric priors with deep learning is essential for robust, accurate 3D vision. This approach bridges traditional geometry and learning to advance 3D mapping, reconstruction, and downstream tasks, with broad applications and future research directions.

Abstract: Modern deep learning developments create new opportunities for 3D mapping
technology, scene reconstruction pipelines, and virtual reality development.
Despite advances in 3D deep learning technology, direct training of deep
learning models on 3D data faces challenges due to the high dimensionality
inherent in 3D data and the scarcity of labeled datasets. Structure-from-motion
(SfM) and Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) exhibit robust
performance when applied to structured indoor environments but often struggle
with ambiguous features in unstructured environments. These techniques often
struggle to generate detailed geometric representations effective for
downstream tasks such as rendering and semantic analysis. Current limitations
require the development of 3D representation methods that combine traditional
geometric techniques with deep learning capabilities to generate robust
geometry-aware deep learning models.
  The dissertation provides solutions to the fundamental challenges in 3D
vision by developing geometric deep learning methods tailored for essential
tasks such as camera pose estimation, point cloud registration, depth
prediction, and 3D reconstruction. The integration of geometric priors or
constraints, such as including depth information, surface normals, and
equivariance into deep learning models, enhances both the accuracy and
robustness of geometric representations. This study systematically investigates
key components of 3D vision, including camera pose estimation, point cloud
registration, depth estimation, and high-fidelity 3D reconstruction,
demonstrating their effectiveness across real-world applications such as
digital cultural heritage preservation and immersive VR/AR environments.

*Shubham Laxmikant Deshmukh,Matthew Wilchek,Feras A. Batarseh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HydroVision uses RGB imagery and deep learning to estimate multiple water-quality parameters; DenseNet121 best with R^2 = 0.89 for CDOM; trained on 500k+ USGS images (2022–2024); scalable non-contact monitoring with robust performance in well-lit conditions; future work needed for low-light/obstructed scenes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Provide a scalable, non-contact, cost-effective method for monitoring water quality to support environmental monitoring, disaster response, and public health protection, and to aid regulatory agencies during environmental stressors.

Method: Transfer learning evaluation of five CNN backbones (VGG-16, ResNet50, MobileNetV2, DenseNet121, Vision Transformer) on RGB surface-water images (over 500,000 images) from USGS HIVIS (2022–2024) to regress optically active water-quality parameters: Chlorophyll-Alpha, Chlorophylls, CDOM, Phycocyanins, Suspended Sediments, and Turbidity.

Result: DenseNet121 achieved the highest validation performance with an R^2 of 0.89 predicting CDOM; demonstrates feasibility of RGB-based estimation with potential for real-world water-quality monitoring across diverse conditions; model trained on a large, seasonally varied dataset.

Conclusion: RGB-based HydroVision shows promise as a scalable approach to water-quality monitoring, potentially reducing reliance on multispectral/hyperspectral data; however robustness under low-light and obstructed conditions needs improvement in future work.

Abstract: Ongoing advancements in computer vision, particularly in pattern recognition
and scene classification, have enabled new applications in environmental
monitoring. Deep learning now offers non-contact methods for assessing water
quality and detecting contamination, both critical for disaster response and
public health protection. This work introduces HydroVision, a deep
learning-based scene classification framework that estimates optically active
water quality parameters including Chlorophyll-Alpha, Chlorophylls, Colored
Dissolved Organic Matter (CDOM), Phycocyanins, Suspended Sediments, and
Turbidity from standard Red-Green-Blue (RGB) images of surface water.
HydroVision supports early detection of contamination trends and strengthens
monitoring by regulatory agencies during external environmental stressors,
industrial activities, and force majeure events. The model is trained on more
than 500,000 seasonally varied images collected from the United States
Geological Survey Hydrologic Imagery Visualization and Information System
between 2022 and 2024. This approach leverages widely available RGB imagery as
a scalable, cost-effective alternative to traditional multispectral and
hyperspectral remote sensing. Four state-of-the-art convolutional neural
networks (VGG-16, ResNet50, MobileNetV2, DenseNet121) and a Vision Transformer
are evaluated through transfer learning to identify the best-performing
architecture. DenseNet121 achieves the highest validation performance, with an
R2 score of 0.89 in predicting CDOM, demonstrating the framework's promise for
real-world water quality monitoring across diverse conditions. While the
current model is optimized for well-lit imagery, future work will focus on
improving robustness under low-light and obstructed scenarios to expand its
operational utility.

### [165] [Automated Wildfire Damage Assessment from Multi view Ground level Imagery Via Vision Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01895)
*Miguel Esparza,Archit Gupta,Ali Mostafavi,Kai Yin,Yiming Xiao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Zero-shot wildfire damage assessment from ground-level imagery using pre-trained vision-language models, with two pipelines (VLM alone and VLM+LLM). Multi-view analysis greatly improves F1 scores (0.857–0.947) vs single-view (0.225–0.511); adding an LLM did not yield statistically significant gains over VLM alone. No supervised training required; deployable, interpretable triage workflow.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Rapid, accurate post-disaster damage assessment is needed due to escalating wildfires. Traditional methods are slow and supervised CV approaches require labeled data, hindering immediate deployment.

Method: Two pipelines applied to 2025 Eaton and Palisades fires: Pipeline A uses a pre-trained vision-language model (VLM) alone; Pipeline B combines VLM with a large language model (LLM). Prompts are structured around specific wildfire damage indicators. Evaluations compare single-view vs multi-view assessments and use McNemar tests to assess statistical significance.

Result: Single-view F1 scores range 0.225–0.511; multi-view F1 scores improve dramatically to 0.857–0.947. McNemar test shows multi-view approaches yield statistically significant improvements; improvements from Pipeline A to Pipeline B are not statistically significant.

Conclusion: VLMs can synthesize information from multiple perspectives for nuanced damage detection, addressing a key limitation in the literature. A multi-view, zero-shot framework provides an immediately deployable, flexible, and interpretable damage assessment workflow without supervised training, accelerating disaster triage. Future work should further explore LLM prompting and multi-view fusion strategies.

Abstract: The escalating intensity and frequency of wildfires demand innovative
computational methods for rapid and accurate property damage assessment.
Traditional methods are often time consuming, while modern computer vision
approaches typically require extensive labeled datasets, hindering immediate
post-disaster deployment. This research introduces a novel, zero-shot framework
leveraging pre-trained vision language models (VLMs) to classify damage from
ground-level imagery. We propose and evaluate two pipelines applied to the 2025
Eaton and Palisades fires in California, a VLM (Pipeline A) and a VLM + large
language model (LLM) approach (Pipeline B), that integrate structured prompts
based on specific wildfire damage indicators. A primary scientific contribution
of this study is demonstrating the VLMs efficacy in synthesizing information
from multiple perspectives to identify nuanced damage, a critical limitation in
existing literature. Our findings reveal that while single view assessments
struggled to classify affected structures (F1 scores ranging from 0.225 to
0.511), the multi-view analysis yielded dramatic improvements (F1 scores
ranging from 0.857 to 0.947). Moreover, the McNemar test confirmed that
pipelines with a multi-view image assessment yields statistically significant
classification improvements; however, the improvements this research observed
between Pipeline A and B were not statistically significant. Thus, future
research can explore the potential of LLM prompting in damage assessment. The
practical contribution is an immediately deployable, flexible, and
interpretable workflow that bypasses the need for supervised training,
significantly accelerating triage and prioritization for disaster response
practitioners.

*Zhipeng Weng,Xiaopeng Liu,Ce Liu,Xingyuan Guo,Yukai Shi,Liang Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A Gaussian quantization representation learning approach for diffusion-based super-resolution is proposed to mitigate overfitting with few-shot drone infrared data, complemented by a training-monitoring mechanism; validated on a new multi-source DroneSR dataset; shows superior performance and robustness with code released.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large-scale diffusion-based SR models overfit when trained on scarce, diverse drone infrared data. There is a need for robust representation learning and monitoring to preserve generalization and reliability in practical drone imaging tasks.

Method: Introduce Gaussian quantization representation learning (GQR) tailored for diffusion models in SR, aiming to reduce overfitting by discretizing representations via Gaussian quantization. Also incorporate an effective monitoring mechanism to detect signs of overfitting during training. Construct a multi-source drone-based infrared image benchmark (DroneSR) to evaluate overfitting in few-shot, diverse scenarios.

Result: The method reduces overfitting while preserving architecture complexity and improves SR performance. On the DroneSR benchmark, it outperforms existing SR approaches and demonstrates robustness under complex conditions.

Conclusion: Gaussian quantization representation learning, together with the monitoring mechanism, provides a practical tool to mitigate overfitting in large-scale diffusion SR models for drone infrared data. The DroneSR dataset offers a benchmarking resource for evaluating overfitting and generalization in few-shot, real-world conditions. Code will be released at the mentioned repository.

Abstract: Although large scale models achieve significant improvements in performance,
the overfitting challenge still frequently undermines their generalization
ability. In super resolution tasks on images, diffusion models as
representatives of generative models typically adopt large scale architectures.
However, few-shot drone-captured infrared training data frequently induces
severe overfitting in large-scale architectures. To address this key challenge,
our method proposes a new Gaussian quantization representation learning method
oriented to diffusion models that alleviates overfitting and enhances
robustness. At the same time, an effective monitoring mechanism tracks large
scale architectures during training to detect signs of overfitting. By
introducing Gaussian quantization representation learning, our method
effectively reduces overfitting while maintaining architecture complexity. On
this basis, we construct a multi source drone-based infrared image benchmark
dataset for detection and use it to emphasize overfitting issues of large scale
architectures in few sample, drone-based diverse drone-based image
reconstruction scenarios. To verify the efficacy of the method in mitigating
overfitting, experiments are conducted on the constructed benchmark.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing super
resolution approaches and significantly mitigates overfitting of large scale
architectures under complex conditions. The code and DroneSR dataset will be
available at: https://github.com/wengzp1/GARLSR.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RS datasets lack temporal image pairs and detailed textual annotations, hindering disaster-aware understanding of dynamic impacts over time.

Method: Assemble a large-scale RS dataset (RSCC) comprising pre- and post-disaster image pairs from earthquakes, floods, wildfires, and more, and annotate them with rich, human-like change captions to enable robust training and evaluation of vision-language models for bi-temporal disaster understanding.

Result: RSCC provides a resource to facilitate detailed disaster-related analysis and to train/evaluate vision-language models that reason over temporal changes in remote sensing data.

Conclusion: RSCC bridges the temporal and semantic gap in remote sensing data, enabling more accurate, interpretable, and scalable vision-language applications for disaster monitoring; code and dataset are publicly available.

Abstract: Remote sensing is critical for disaster monitoring, yet existing datasets
lack temporal image pairs and detailed textual annotations. While
single-snapshot imagery dominates current resources, it fails to capture
dynamic disaster impacts over time. To address this gap, we introduce the
Remote Sensing Change Caption (RSCC) dataset, a large-scale benchmark
comprising 62,315 pre-/post-disaster image pairs (spanning earthquakes, floods,
wildfires, and more) paired with rich, human-like change captions. By bridging
the temporal and semantic divide in remote sensing data, RSCC enables robust
training and evaluation of vision-language models for disaster-aware
bi-temporal understanding. Our results highlight RSCC's ability to facilitate
detailed disaster-related analysis, paving the way for more accurate,
interpretable, and scalable vision-language applications in remote sensing.

*Furong Jia,Lanxin Liu,Ce Hou,Fan Zhang,Xinyan Liu,Yu Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a Concept-Aware Alignment Module to fuse geo-localization with concept bottlenecks, improving accuracy and interpretability over GeoCLIP.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The interpretability of geo-localization models like GeoCLIP is limited, and existing concept-based methods do not align well with geo-alignment objectives, hindering both interpretability and performance.

Method: Introduce a Concept-Aware Alignment Module that jointly projects image and location embeddings onto a shared bank of geographic concepts (e.g., tropical climate, mountain, cathedral) and minimizes a concept-level loss, creating a concept-specific subspace for robust interpretability.

Result: The approach surpasses GeoCLIP in geo-localization accuracy and improves performance across diverse geospatial prediction tasks, while revealing richer semantic insights into geographic decision-making processes.

Conclusion: This work is the first to integrate interpretability into geo-localization, offering a framework that yields interpretable, better-aligned image-location embeddings and potential benefits for broader geospatial tasks.

Abstract: Worldwide geo-localization involves determining the exact geographic location
of images captured globally, typically guided by geographic cues such as
climate, landmarks, and architectural styles. Despite advancements in
geo-localization models like GeoCLIP, which leverages images and location
alignment via contrastive learning for accurate predictions, the
interpretability of these models remains insufficiently explored. Current
concept-based interpretability methods fail to align effectively with
Geo-alignment image-location embedding objectives, resulting in suboptimal
interpretability and performance. To address this gap, we propose a novel
framework integrating global geo-localization with concept bottlenecks. Our
method inserts a Concept-Aware Alignment Module that jointly projects image and
location embeddings onto a shared bank of geographic concepts (e.g., tropical
climate, mountain, cathedral) and minimizes a concept-level loss, enhancing
alignment in a concept-specific subspace and enabling robust interpretability.
To our knowledge, this is the first work to introduce interpretability into
geo-localization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach surpasses
GeoCLIP in geo-localization accuracy and boosts performance across diverse
geospatial prediction tasks, revealing richer semantic insights into geographic
decision-making processes.

### [170] [Structure-aware Contrastive Learning for Diagram Understanding of Multimodal Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01959)
*Hiroshi Sasaki*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A specialized contrastive training paradigm with two diagram-aware loss functions improves diagrammatic understanding in vision-language models, outperforming standard CLIP on flowchart tasks for image-text matching and VQA.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP-like models struggle with diagrams that encode structured, symbolic information; there is a need for training strategies tailored to diagrammatic content to enable better cross-modal understanding.

Method: Introduce hard samples and two specialized, diagram-aware loss functions that exploit inherent structural properties of diagrams; integrate these objectives into the training of a vision-language model to produce more structured, semantically coherent diagram representations.

Result: Empirical evaluation on a flowchart benchmark shows substantial improvements over standard CLIP and traditional hard-negative CLIP approaches for both image-text matching and VQA tasks.

Conclusion: Tailored training strategies for specialised visual domains like diagrams are crucial for advancing diagrammatic understanding within vision-language models.

Abstract: Multimodal models, such as the Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP)
model, have demonstrated remarkable success in aligning visual and linguistic
representations. However, these models exhibit limitations when applied to
specialised visual domains, such as diagrams, which encode structured, symbolic
information distinct from that of natural imagery.
  In this paper, we introduce a novel training paradigm explicitly designed to
enhance the comprehension of diagrammatic images within vision-language models.
Our approach uses ``hard'' samples for our proposed contrastive learning that
incorporates two specialised loss functions that leverage the inherent
structural properties of diagrams. By integrating these objectives into model
training, our method enables models to develop a more structured and
semantically coherent understanding of diagrammatic content.
  We empirically validate our approach on a benchmark dataset of flowcharts, as
a representative class of diagrammatic imagery, demonstrating substantial
improvements over standard CLIP and conventional hard negative CLIP learning
paradigms for both image-text matching and visual question answering tasks. Our
findings underscore the significance of tailored training strategies for
specialised tasks and contribute to advancing diagrammatic understanding within
the broader landscape of vision-language integration.

*Hongyu Li,Chaofeng Chen,Xiaoming Li,Guangming Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduces a 2D Gaussian Splatting (GS) based image inpainting framework with differentiable rasterization, plus patch-wise rendering and DINO-based semantic guidance, achieving competitive results and enabling a new direction for 2D GS applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address image inpainting's need for both local pixel coherence and global semantic consistency, by leveraging Gaussian Splatting's continuous representation and differentiable rendering, while improving efficiency and semantic alignment.

Method: Encode incomplete images into a continuous field of 2D Gaussian splat coefficients and reconstruct via differentiable rasterization. Employ patch-wise rasterization to reduce memory and speed up inference. Use pretrained DINO features to provide global semantic guidance, adapting to large missing regions to maintain contextual consistency.

Result: Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks show competitive quantitative metrics and perceptual quality, validating the feasibility of applying Gaussian Splatting to 2D image processing and establishing a new direction in the field.

Conclusion: Gaussian Splatting is a viable framework for 2D image inpainting, offering local pixel coherence with a differentiable renderer, scalable via patch-wise rendering, and improved global consistency through semantic guidance from pretrained features.

Abstract: Gaussian Splatting (GS), a recent technique for converting discrete points
into continuous spatial representations, has shown promising results in 3D
scene modeling and 2D image super-resolution. In this paper, we explore its
untapped potential for image inpainting, which demands both locally coherent
pixel synthesis and globally consistent semantic restoration. We propose the
first image inpainting framework based on 2D Gaussian Splatting, which encodes
incomplete images into a continuous field of 2D Gaussian splat coefficients and
reconstructs the final image via a differentiable rasterization process. The
continuous rendering paradigm of GS inherently promotes pixel-level coherence
in the inpainted results. To improve efficiency and scalability, we introduce a
patch-wise rasterization strategy that reduces memory overhead and accelerates
inference. For global semantic consistency, we incorporate features from a
pretrained DINO model. We observe that DINO's global features are naturally
robust to small missing regions and can be effectively adapted to guide
semantic alignment in large-mask scenarios, ensuring that the inpainted content
remains contextually consistent with the surrounding scene. Extensive
experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves
competitive performance in both quantitative metrics and perceptual quality,
establishing a new direction for applying Gaussian Splatting to 2D image
processing.

*Dong She,Siming Fu,Mushui Liu,Qiaoqiao Jin,Hualiang Wang,Mu Liu,Jidong Jiang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MOSAIC introduces a representation-centric framework for multi-subject image generation that preserves identity fidelity and semantic coherence by aligning representations and disentangling features; it leverages SemAlign-MS with explicit semantic correspondences, and specialized losses to enable 4+ reference subjects with state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multi-subject generation suffers from identity blending and attribute leakage due to insufficient modeling of how multiple references interact in shared representation spaces; there is a need for precise region-level semantic alignment across references.

Method: Propose MOSAIC, including SemAlign-MS dataset for fine-grained semantic correspondences; semantic correspondence attention loss to enforce point-to-point alignment; multi-reference disentanglement loss to push different subjects into orthogonal attention subspaces; a representation-centric architecture that explicitly controls cross-subject interactions.

Result: Demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks; sustains high identity fidelity with 4+ reference subjects, surpassing baselines that degrade beyond 3 subjects.

Conclusion: A representation-centric, alignment-driven approach with explicit disentanglement enables scalable and reliable multi-subject generation; the SemAlign-MS dataset provides essential supervision, opening possibilities for complex multi-subject synthesis applications.

Abstract: Multi-subject personalized generation presents unique challenges in
maintaining identity fidelity and semantic coherence when synthesizing images
conditioned on multiple reference subjects. Existing methods often suffer from
identity blending and attribute leakage due to inadequate modeling of how
different subjects should interact within shared representation spaces. We
present MOSAIC, a representation-centric framework that rethinks multi-subject
generation through explicit semantic correspondence and orthogonal feature
disentanglement. Our key insight is that multi-subject generation requires
precise semantic alignment at the representation level - knowing exactly which
regions in the generated image should attend to which parts of each reference.
To enable this, we introduce SemAlign-MS, a meticulously annotated dataset
providing fine-grained semantic correspondences between multiple reference
subjects and target images, previously unavailable in this domain. Building on
this foundation, we propose the semantic correspondence attention loss to
enforce precise point-to-point semantic alignment, ensuring high consistency
from each reference to its designated regions. Furthermore, we develop the
multi-reference disentanglement loss to push different subjects into orthogonal
attention subspaces, preventing feature interference while preserving
individual identity characteristics. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
MOSAIC achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks. Notably,
while existing methods typically degrade beyond 3 subjects, MOSAIC maintains
high fidelity with 4+ reference subjects, opening new possibilities for complex
multi-subject synthesis applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: First noise-inversion editing method for Visual AutoRegressive Models (VAR), VARIN, using Location-aware Argmax Inversion (LAI) to generate inverse Gumbel noises for content-preserving, prompt-guided edits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need for efficient, training-free prompt-guided image editing for VARs to enable practical real-world applications without retraining.

Method: Introduce VARIN, a noise inversion-based editing technique for VAR. Use LAI (Location-aware Argmax Inversion) to produce inverse Gumbel noises via a pseudo-inverse function for argmax sampling, enabling reconstruction of the source image and targeted edits guided by textual prompts.

Result: Experiments show VARIN can modify source images according to prompts while significantly preserving background and structural details, demonstrating practical effectiveness.

Conclusion: VARIN provides a practical, training-free editing approach for VAR models with precise, content-preserving, prompt-guided edits.

Abstract: Visual autoregressive models (VAR) have recently emerged as a promising class
of generative models, achieving performance comparable to diffusion models in
text-to-image generation tasks. While conditional generation has been widely
explored, the ability to perform prompt-guided image editing without additional
training is equally critical, as it supports numerous practical real-world
applications. This paper investigates the text-to-image editing capabilities of
VAR by introducing Visual AutoRegressive Inverse Noise (VARIN), the first noise
inversion-based editing technique designed explicitly for VAR models. VARIN
leverages a novel pseudo-inverse function for argmax sampling, named
Location-aware Argmax Inversion (LAI), to generate inverse Gumbel noises. These
inverse noises enable precise reconstruction of the source image and facilitate
targeted, controllable edits aligned with textual prompts. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that VARIN effectively modifies source images according
to specified prompts while significantly preserving the original background and
structural details, thus validating its efficacy as a practical editing
approach.

### [174] [Draw-In-Mind: Learning Precise Image Editing via Chain-of-Thought Imagination](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01986)
*Ziyun Zeng,Junhao Zhang,Wei Li,Mike Zheng Shou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DIM enables better image editing by balancing understanding and generation in multimodal models via two datasets (DIM-T2I and DIM-Edit) and a two-model setup, achieving strong results with fewer parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In multimodal T2I editing, the understanding module encodes instructions while the generation module edits; this creates an imbalance as the understanding module is trained on more data. DIM aims to rebalance by giving the understanding module explicit design responsibilities through data.

Method: Construct two subsets: DIM-T2I (14M long-context image-text pairs) to enhance instruction comprehension; DIM-Edit (233K chain-of-thought imaginations from GPT-4o) as explicit design blueprints. Freeze Qwen2.5-VL-3B and train a SANA1.5-1.6B model via a two-layer MLP on DIM to form DIM-4.6B-T2I/Edit.

Result: DIM-4.6B-Edit achieves SOTA or competitive results on ImgEdit and GEdit-Bench, outperforming larger models like UniWorld-V1 and Step1X-Edit.

Conclusion: Assigning editing design responsibilities to the understanding module is beneficial for image editing; DIM demonstrates that moderate-size models trained with designed data can achieve strong edits; dataset and model will be released.

Abstract: In recent years, integrating multimodal understanding and generation into a
single unified model has emerged as a promising paradigm. While this approach
achieves strong results in text-to-image (T2I) generation, it still struggles
with precise image editing. We attribute this limitation to an imbalanced
division of responsibilities. The understanding module primarily functions as a
translator that encodes user instructions into semantic conditions, while the
generation module must simultaneously act as designer and painter, inferring
the original layout, identifying the target editing region, and rendering the
new content. This imbalance is counterintuitive because the understanding
module is typically trained with several times more data on complex reasoning
tasks than the generation module. To address this issue, we introduce
Draw-In-Mind (DIM), a dataset comprising two complementary subsets: (i)
DIM-T2I, containing 14M long-context image-text pairs to enhance complex
instruction comprehension; and (ii) DIM-Edit, consisting of 233K
chain-of-thought imaginations generated by GPT-4o, serving as explicit design
blueprints for image edits. We connect a frozen Qwen2.5-VL-3B with a trainable
SANA1.5-1.6B via a lightweight two-layer MLP, and train it on the proposed DIM
dataset, resulting in DIM-4.6B-T2I/Edit. Despite its modest parameter scale,
DIM-4.6B-Edit achieves SOTA or competitive performance on the ImgEdit and
GEdit-Bench benchmarks, outperforming much larger models such as UniWorld-V1
and Step1X-Edit. These findings demonstrate that explicitly assigning the
design responsibility to the understanding module provides significant benefits
for image editing. Our dataset and models will be available at

Abstract: In recent years, deep learning has achieved unprecedented success in various
computer vision tasks, particularly in object detection. However, the black-box
nature and high complexity of deep neural networks pose significant challenges
for interpretability, especially in critical domains such as autonomous
driving, medical imaging, and security systems. Explainable Artificial
Intelligence (XAI) aims to address this challenge by providing tools and
methods to make model decisions more transparent, interpretable, and
trust-worthy for humans. This review provides a comprehensive analysis of
state-of-the-art explain-ability methods specifically applied to object
detection models. The paper be-gins by categorizing existing XAI techniques
based on their underlying mechanisms-perturbation-based, gradient-based,
backpropagation-based, and graph-based methods. Notable methods such as D-RISE,
BODEM, D-CLOSE, and FSOD are discussed in detail. Furthermore, the paper
investigates their applicability to various object detection architectures,
including YOLO, SSD, Faster R-CNN, and EfficientDet. Statistical analysis of
publication trends from 2022 to mid-2025 shows an accelerating interest in
explainable object detection, indicating its increasing importance. The study
also explores common datasets and evaluation metrics, and highlights the major
challenges associated with model interpretability. By providing a structured
taxonomy and a critical assessment of existing methods, this review aims to
guide researchers and practitioners in selecting suitable explainability
techniques for object detection applications and to foster the development of
more interpretable AI systems.

### [176] [Palette Aligned Image Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02000)
*Elad Aharoni,Noy Porat,Dani Lischinski,Ariel Shamir*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Palette-Adapter enables conditioning diffusion models on color palettes by modeling palettes as sparse histograms with entropy and histogram-distance controls, plus a negative-histogram mechanism; trained on a balanced color dataset; achieves strong palette adherence and image quality, outperforming prior methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Palettes are intuitive but cause ambiguity and instability when conditioning generative models; need controllable, generalizable methods to enforce palette constraints without sacrificing quality.

Method: Represent palettes as sparse histograms. Introduce two scalar controls: histogram entropy and palette-to-histogram distance; add negative histogram to suppress undesired hues; integrate with classifier-free guidance; train on a balanced color dataset to cover rare and common colors.

Result: Produces stable, semantically coherent images across diverse palettes; quantitative and qualitative metrics plus a user study show improved palette adherence and image quality relative to baselines.

Conclusion: Palette-Adapter provides robust, generalizable palette-conditioned generation with flexible adherence control and suppression of undesired hues; suitable for practical creative workflows.

Abstract: We introduce the Palette-Adapter, a novel method for conditioning
text-to-image diffusion models on a user-specified color palette. While
palettes are a compact and intuitive tool widely used in creative workflows,
they introduce significant ambiguity and instability when used for conditioning
image generation. Our approach addresses this challenge by interpreting
palettes as sparse histograms and introducing two scalar control parameters:
histogram entropy and palette-to-histogram distance, which allow flexible
control over the degree of palette adherence and color variation. We further
introduce a negative histogram mechanism that allows users to suppress specific
undesired hues, improving adherence to the intended palette under the standard
classifier-free guidance mechanism. To ensure broad generalization across the
color space, we train on a carefully curated dataset with balanced coverage of
rare and common colors. Our method enables stable, semantically coherent
generation across a wide range of palettes and prompts. We evaluate our method
qualitatively, quantitatively, and through a user study, and show that it
consistently outperforms existing approaches in achieving both strong palette
adherence and high image quality.

### [177] [Vision-Based Embedded System for Noncontact Monitoring of Preterm Infant Behavior in Low-Resource Care Settings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02018)
*Stanley Mugisha,Rashid Kisitu,Francis Komakech,Excellence Favor*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A lightweight, edge-deployed vision system for NICU monitoring using a quantized MobileNet on Raspberry Pi to detect infant sleep/awake and crying states, achieving high accuracy with low latency and enabling scalable care in resource-limited settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Preterm birth is a leading cause of neonatal mortality, especially in low-resource settings where NICUs are limited. There is a need for continuous, noninvasive, automated monitoring to reduce manual observation errors and skin damage from sensors.

Method: An embedded, vision-based framework using a quantized MobileNet model deployed on Raspberry Pi for real-time behavioral state detection. Training/evaluation on public neonatal image datasets. Three innovations: (1) model quantization (≈68% size reduction) for memory-efficient inference, (2) Raspberry Pi-optimized vision pipelines, and (3) secure IoT alerts for clinical use. Comparative benchmarking against larger architectures (e.g., ResNet152, VGG19).

Result: The system achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on public datasets: 91.8% sleep detection and 97.7% crying/normal classification, with inference suitable for edge deployment. Larger models offer marginal accuracy gains at high computational cost; quantized MobileNet provides better trade-offs.

Conclusion: Lightweight, optimized models such as MobileNet are the most viable foundation for scalable, low-cost, and clinically actionable NICU monitoring in resource-constrained environments, enabling improved preterm care.

Abstract: Preterm birth remains a leading cause of neonatal mortality,
disproportionately affecting low-resource settings with limited access to
advanced neonatal intensive care units (NICUs).Continuous monitoring of infant
behavior, such as sleep/awake states and crying episodes, is critical but
relies on manual observation or invasive sensors, which are prone to error,
impractical, and can cause skin damage. This paper presents a novel,
noninvasive, and automated vision-based framework to address this gap. We
introduce an embedded monitoring system that utilizes a quantized MobileNet
model deployed on a Raspberry Pi for real-time behavioral state detection. When
trained and evaluated on public neonatal image datasets, our system achieves
state-of-the-art accuracy (91.8% for sleep detection and 97.7% for
crying/normal classification) while maintaining computational efficiency
suitable for edge deployment. Through comparative benchmarking, we provide a
critical analysis of the trade-offs between model size, inference latency, and
diagnostic accuracy. Our findings demonstrate that while larger architectures
(e.g., ResNet152, VGG19) offer marginal gains in accuracy, their computational
cost is prohibitive for real-time edge use. The proposed framework integrates
three key innovations: model quantization for memory-efficient inference (68%
reduction in size), Raspberry Pi-optimized vision pipelines, and secure IoT
communication for clinical alerts. This work conclusively shows that
lightweight, optimized models such as the MobileNet offer the most viable
foundation for scalable, low-cost, and clinically actionable NICU monitoring
systems, paving the way for improved preterm care in resource-constrained
environments.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A study on integrating synthetic hard negatives into self-supervised learning for vision transformers, showing improved representations without proposing a new core method; demonstrated on DeiT-S and Swin-T.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hard negative samples in self-supervised learning have been underexplored, especially for vision transformers; previous work used synthetic hard negatives but not in ViTs.

Method: Apply synthetic hard negatives within a self-supervised training setup for ViTs (DeiT-S and Swin-T) to enhance representation learning.

Result: Notable improvements in the discriminative power of learned representations; empirical gains on DeiT-S and Swin-T architectures.

Conclusion: A simple yet effective technique for ViTs; highlights the value of hard negatives in self-supervised learning and potential for broader applicability.

Abstract: This paper does not introduce a novel method per se. Instead, we address the
neglected potential of hard negative samples in self-supervised learning.
Previous works explored synthetic hard negatives but rarely in the context of
vision transformers. We build on this observation and integrate synthetic hard
negatives to improve vision transformer representation learning. This simple
yet effective technique notably improves the discriminative power of learned
representations. Our experiments show performance improvements for both DeiT-S
and Swin-T architectures.

### [179] [See No Evil: Adversarial Attacks Against Linguistic-Visual Association in Referring Multi-Object Tracking Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02028)
*Halima Bouzidi,Haoyu Liu,Mohammad Al Faruque*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VEIL exposes and weaponizes security vulnerabilities in Referring Multi-Object Tracking (RMOT), showing that adversarial perturbations can disrupt referring-matching and persist in FIFO memory, causing ID switches and track terminations; validated on Refer-KITTI, highlighting need for security-aware RMOT designs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RMOT achieves language-guided tracking but robustness and security remain underexplored; adversarial risks threaten critical deployments; the paper frames vulnerabilities and emphasizes a design-logic perspective to uncover them.

Method: Security analysis from a design-logic perspective; identify susceptibilities in linguistic-visual referring and track-object matching; reveal FIFO-memory vulnerability; propose VEIL adversarial framework; perform digital and physical perturbations; evaluate on Refer-KITTI.

Result: VEIL disrupts unified referring-matching, induces tracking reliability errors including track ID switches and terminations; targeted attacks leave lasting effects in history buffers across frames; effective in both digital and physical domains; demonstrates urgent need for security-aware RMOT.

Conclusion: Security-aware RMOT design is essential for critical applications; future work should incorporate robust defenses against adversarial manipulation in both linguistic and temporal dimensions of RMOT.

Abstract: Language-vision understanding has driven the development of advanced
perception systems, most notably the emerging paradigm of Referring
Multi-Object Tracking (RMOT). By leveraging natural-language queries, RMOT
systems can selectively track objects that satisfy a given semantic
description, guided through Transformer-based spatial-temporal reasoning
modules. End-to-End (E2E) RMOT models further unify feature extraction,
temporal memory, and spatial reasoning within a Transformer backbone, enabling
long-range spatial-temporal modeling over fused textual-visual representations.
Despite these advances, the reliability and robustness of RMOT remain
underexplored. In this paper, we examine the security implications of RMOT
systems from a design-logic perspective, identifying adversarial
vulnerabilities that compromise both the linguistic-visual referring and
track-object matching components. Additionally, we uncover a novel
vulnerability in advanced RMOT models employing FIFO-based memory, whereby
targeted and consistent attacks on their spatial-temporal reasoning introduce
errors that persist within the history buffer over multiple subsequent frames.
We present VEIL, a novel adversarial framework designed to disrupt the unified
referring-matching mechanisms of RMOT models. We show that carefully crafted
digital and physical perturbations can corrupt the tracking logic reliability,
inducing track ID switches and terminations. We conduct comprehensive
evaluations using the Refer-KITTI dataset to validate the effectiveness of VEIL
and demonstrate the urgent need for security-aware RMOT designs for critical
large-scale applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Syn2Co investigates synthetic data for self-supervised vision learning, exploring generative data augmentation and synthetic hard negatives to enhance ViT representations, with evaluation on DeiT-S and Swin-T.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Contrastive self-supervised learning relies on large real datasets and curated hard negatives. The paper explores whether synthetic data can reduce data requirements and provide diverse negatives, potentially improving robustness and transferability.

Method: Propose a framework Syn2Co that (1) uses generative models to create synthetic data for unsupervised representation learning to augment sample diversity, and (2) generates synthetic hard negatives in representation space to create challenging contrasts. It evaluates the approach on Vision Transformer architectures DeiT-S and Swin-T.

Result: The study highlights the promise and limitations of synthetic data for self-supervised learning, offering insights for future work but does not claim definitive improvements or a new training method.

Conclusion: Synthetic data can supplement self-supervised learning with potential robustness gains and transferability, but its effectiveness is nuanced and requires further investigation and empirical validation.

Abstract: This paper does not introduce a new method per se. Instead, we build on
existing self-supervised learning approaches for vision, drawing inspiration
from the adage "fake it till you make it". While contrastive self-supervised
learning has achieved remarkable success, it typically relies on vast amounts
of real-world data and carefully curated hard negatives. To explore
alternatives to these requirements, we investigate two forms of "faking it" in
vision transformers. First, we study the potential of generative models for
unsupervised representation learning, leveraging synthetic data to augment
sample diversity. Second, we examine the feasibility of generating synthetic
hard negatives in the representation space, creating diverse and challenging
contrasts. Our framework - dubbed Syn2Co - combines both approaches and
evaluates whether synthetically enhanced training can lead to more robust and
transferable visual representations on DeiT-S and Swin-T architectures. Our
findings highlight the promise and limitations of synthetic data in
self-supervised learning, offering insights for future work in this direction.

### [181] [ContextFusion and Bootstrap: An Effective Approach to Improve Slot Attention-Based Object-Centric Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02032)
*Pinzhuo Tian,Shengjie Yang,Hang Yu,Alex C. Kot*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes ContextFusion and Bootstrap Branch to improve slot attention for object-centric learning by adding semantic cues and decoupling feature adaptation, yielding improved performance on simulated and real-world datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing slot attention relies on low-level features, making it semantically weak and sensitive to texture/color; it also requires stable feature spaces, limiting encoder fine-tuning. There is a need for semantic-rich representations and more flexible adaptation in object-centric learning.

Method: Introduce ContextFusion stage to incorporate foreground/background semantic signals via an auxiliary indicator; introduce Bootstrap Branch to separate feature adaptation from reconstruction and train a feature-adaptive mechanism with a bootstrap strategy; integrate into existing slot attention models.

Result: Significant improvements over state-of-the-art slot attention models on both simulated and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: ContextFusion and Bootstrap Branch address semantic and adaptation limitations, enabling better object-centric learning while maintaining compatibility with existing slot attention models.

Abstract: A key human ability is to decompose a scene into distinct objects and use
their relationships to understand the environment. Object-centric learning aims
to mimic this process in an unsupervised manner. Recently, the slot
attention-based framework has emerged as a leading approach in this area and
has been widely used in various downstream tasks. However, existing slot
attention methods face two key limitations: (1) a lack of high-level semantic
information. In current methods, image areas are assigned to slots based on
low-level features such as color and texture. This makes the model overly
sensitive to low-level features and limits its understanding of object
contours, shapes, or other semantic characteristics. (2) The inability to
fine-tune the encoder. Current methods require a stable feature space
throughout training to enable reconstruction from slots, which restricts the
flexibility needed for effective object-centric learning. To address these
limitations, we propose a novel ContextFusion stage and a Bootstrap Branch,
both of which can be seamlessly integrated into existing slot attention models.
In the ContextFusion stage, we exploit semantic information from the foreground
and background, incorporating an auxiliary indicator that provides additional
contextual cues about them to enrich the semantic content beyond low-level
features. In the Bootstrap Branch, we decouple feature adaptation from the
original reconstruction phase and introduce a bootstrap strategy to train a
feature-adaptive mechanism, allowing for more flexible adaptation. Experimental
results show that our method significantly improves the performance of
different SOTA slot attention models on both simulated and real-world datasets.

*Alejandro Alonso,Sawaiz A. Chaudhry,Juan C. SanMiguel,Álvaro García-Martín,Pablo Ayuso-Albizu,Pablo Carballeira*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Data-centric PAR improvement via diffusion-generated synthetic data guided by text prompts; identifies weak attributes, augments data and modifies loss to boost underrepresented attributes and zero-shot generalization without model changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PAR performance is limited by dataset attribute underrepresentation; a data-centric approach using synthetic augmentation guided by textual descriptions can balance attributes and improve generalization, including zero-shot.

Method: Define protocol to identify weakly recognized attributes across datasets; use a prompt-driven diffusion pipeline to generate synthetic pedestrian images while preserving dataset consistency; apply prompt-based annotation rules and loss modification to integrate synthetic samples into training.

Result: Increases recognition of underrepresented attributes and improves overall PAR performance; enhances zero-shot generalization; validated on popular PAR datasets.

Conclusion: A scalable, architecture-agnostic data-centric augmentation strategy using diffusion-generated synthetic data and text prompts effectively improves pedestrian attribute recognition in real-world settings.

Abstract: Pedestrian Attribute Recognition (PAR) is a challenging task as models are
required to generalize across numerous attributes in real-world data.
Traditional approaches focus on complex methods, yet recognition performance is
often constrained by training dataset limitations, particularly the
under-representation of certain attributes. In this paper, we propose a
data-centric approach to improve PAR by synthetic data augmentation guided by
textual descriptions. First, we define a protocol to identify weakly recognized
attributes across multiple datasets. Second, we propose a prompt-driven
pipeline that leverages diffusion models to generate synthetic pedestrian
images while preserving the consistency of PAR datasets. Finally, we derive a
strategy to seamlessly incorporate synthetic samples into training data, which
considers prompt-based annotation rules and modifies the loss function. Results
on popular PAR datasets demonstrate that our approach not only boosts
recognition of underrepresented attributes but also improves overall model
performance beyond the targeted attributes. Notably, this approach strengthens
zero-shot generalization without requiring architectural changes of the model,
presenting an efficient and scalable solution to improve the recognition of
attributes of pedestrians in the real world.

*Matic Fučka,Vitjan Zavrtanik,Danijel Skočaj*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SALAD is a semantics-aware discriminative logical anomaly detector for surface inspection; it introduces a composition branch to model object composition maps and extracts composition maps without labels, achieving state-of-the-art AUROC on MVTec LOCO (96.1%).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current surface anomaly detectors excel at structural anomalies but miss logical anomalies; existing logical anomaly methods rely on aggregated features/handcrafted descriptors that discard spatial/semantic info, limiting performance.

Method: Proposes SALAD with a composition branch to model the distribution of composition maps; novel composition-map extraction procedure that is label-free and category-agnostic.

Result: Significant improvement over state-of-the-art on MVTec LOCO with image-level AUROC 96.1%.

Conclusion: Modeling composition map distributions and semantic relationships yields better logical anomaly detection; SALAD provides a practical approach with a public codebase.

Abstract: Recent surface anomaly detection methods excel at identifying structural
anomalies, such as dents and scratches, but struggle with logical anomalies,
such as irregular or missing object components. The best-performing logical
anomaly detection approaches rely on aggregated pretrained features or
handcrafted descriptors (most often derived from composition maps), which
discard spatial and semantic information, leading to suboptimal performance. We
propose SALAD, a semantics-aware discriminative logical anomaly detection
method that incorporates a newly proposed composition branch to explicitly
model the distribution of object composition maps, consequently learning
important semantic relationships. Additionally, we introduce a novel procedure
for extracting composition maps that requires no hand-made labels or
category-specific information, in contrast to previous methods. By effectively
modelling the composition map distribution, SALAD significantly improves upon
state-of-the-art methods on the standard benchmark for logical anomaly
detection, MVTec LOCO, achieving an impressive image-level AUROC of 96.1%.

*Benjamin Missaoui,Orcun Cetintas,Guillem Brasó,Tim Meinhardt,Laura Leal-Taixé*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A unified MOT tracker, NOOUGAT, handles arbitrary temporal horizons by processing non-overlapping subclips with a Graph Neural Network and fusing them via an Autoregressive Long-term Tracking (ALT) layer; achieves state-of-the-art performance across online and offline regimes with a controllable latency-context trade-off via subclip size.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The traditional MOT landscape splits online and offline approaches, leading to fragmented solutions: online trackers rely on frame-by-frame hand-crafted associations and struggle with long-term occlusions, while offline methods depend on heuristic stitching for long sequences. A unified method with flexible temporal horizons could address long-term occlusions and varying deployment latency.

Method: Proposes NOOUGAT, a unified Graph Neural Network framework that processes non-overlapping subclips and fuses them using an Autoregressive Long-term Tracking (ALT) layer. Subclip size controls the trade-off between latency and temporal context, enabling both frame-by-frame and batch processing.

Result: NOOUGAT achieves state-of-the-art performance in both online and offline MOT regimes. Specifically, it improves online AssA by +2.3 on DanceTrack, +9.2 on SportsMOT, and +5.0 on MOT20. Offline mode yields even larger gains.

Conclusion: NOOUGAT provides a practical and effective solution for MOT with arbitrary temporal horizons, bridging the online/offline gap. The subclip-based design enables a tunable latency-context trade-off suitable for diverse deployment scenarios, delivering strong gains across benchmarks.

Abstract: The long-standing division between \textit{online} and \textit{offline}
Multi-Object Tracking (MOT) has led to fragmented solutions that fail to
address the flexible temporal requirements of real-world deployment scenarios.
Current \textit{online} trackers rely on frame-by-frame hand-crafted
association strategies and struggle with long-term occlusions, whereas
\textit{offline} approaches can cover larger time gaps, but still rely on
heuristic stitching for arbitrarily long sequences. In this paper, we introduce
NOOUGAT, the first tracker designed to operate with arbitrary temporal
horizons. NOOUGAT leverages a unified Graph Neural Network (GNN) framework that
processes non-overlapping subclips, and fuses them through a novel
Autoregressive Long-term Tracking (ALT) layer. The subclip size controls the
trade-off between latency and temporal context, enabling a wide range of
deployment scenarios, from frame-by-frame to batch processing. NOOUGAT achieves
state-of-the-art performance across both tracking regimes, improving
\textit{online} AssA by +2.3 on DanceTrack, +9.2 on SportsMOT, and +5.0 on
MOT20, with even greater gains in \textit{offline} mode.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Fine-tuned SegFormer with dropout reliably segments hair in dermoscopic images, achieving near-perfect overlap metrics and strong perceptual quality, enabling improved lesion analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hair artifacts impede accurate skin lesion analysis; precise hair masking is a crucial preprocessing step.

Method: Fine-tune SegFormer (MiT-B2 encoder, 3-channel input, 2 classes) with 0.3 dropout in segmentation head; dataset of 500 images with fine-grained hair masks; 10-fold cross-validation; AdamW (lr=0.001); cross-entropy loss; early stopping (patience=3, max 20 epochs/fold).

Result: Mean Dice ≈ 0.96; IoU ≈ 0.93; PSNR ≈ 34 dB; SSIM ≈ 0.97; LPIPS ≈ 0.06.

Conclusion: The method demonstrates effective hair artifact segmentation and potential to improve downstream skin cancer detection; future work could test on larger, more diverse datasets and compare with alternative hair removal strategies.

Abstract: Hair artifacts in dermoscopic images present significant challenges for
accurate skin lesion analysis, potentially obscuring critical diagnostic
features in dermatological assessments. This work introduces a fine-tuned
SegFormer model augmented with dropout regularization to achieve precise hair
mask segmentation. The proposed SegformerWithDropout architecture leverages the
MiT-B2 encoder, pretrained on ImageNet, with an in-channel count of 3 and 2
output classes, incorporating a dropout probability of 0.3 in the segmentation
head to prevent overfitting. Training is conducted on a specialized dataset of
500 dermoscopic skin lesion images with fine-grained hair mask annotations,
employing 10-fold cross-validation, AdamW optimization with a learning rate of
0.001, and cross-entropy loss. Early stopping is applied based on validation
loss, with a patience of 3 epochs and a maximum of 20 epochs per fold.
Performance is evaluated using a comprehensive suite of metrics, including
Intersection over Union (IoU), Dice coefficient, Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio
(PSNR), Structural Similarity Index (SSIM), and Learned Perceptual Image Patch
Similarity (LPIPS). Experimental results from the cross-validation demonstrate
robust performance, with average Dice coefficients reaching approximately 0.96
and IoU values of 0.93, alongside favorable PSNR (around 34 dB), SSIM (0.97),
and low LPIPS (0.06), highlighting the model's effectiveness in accurate hair
artifact segmentation and its potential to enhance preprocessing for downstream
skin cancer detection tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Diffusion-based data expansion can boost Pedestrian Attribute Recognition by generating synthetic PAR-like images; key factors include prompt alignment and image properties, yielding a 4.5% performance gain.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PAR suffers from scarce large-scale annotated datasets and challenges like occlusion, pose variation, and diverse environments. Diffusion models can create diverse, realistic synthetic images to expand training data and improve generalization.

Method: Identify and evaluate key parameters for img2img diffusion-based data expansion—text prompts, image properties, and recent diffusion augmentation techniques—assess their impact on PAR image quality, choose the best expansion strategy, and use it to enrich zero-shot training datasets for PAR models.

Result: Prompt alignment and image properties were found to be critical; when optimally configured, the diffusion-based expansion yielded a 4.5% improvement in PAR recognition performance.

Conclusion: Diffusion-based data augmentation is a promising approach to strengthen PAR robustness and generalization. Success depends on careful prompt–image alignment and parameter tuning; further work can explore parameter interactions and domain-transfer effects to extend gains to broader PAR scenarios.

Abstract: Pedestrian Attribute Recognition (PAR) involves identifying various human
attributes from images with applications in intelligent monitoring systems. The
scarcity of large-scale annotated datasets hinders the generalization of PAR
models, specially in complex scenarios involving occlusions, varying poses, and
diverse environments. Recent advances in diffusion models have shown promise
for generating diverse and realistic synthetic images, allowing to expand the
size and variability of training data. However, the potential of
diffusion-based data expansion for generating PAR-like images remains
underexplored. Such expansion may enhance the robustness and adaptability of
PAR models in real-world scenarios. This paper investigates the effectiveness
of diffusion models in generating synthetic pedestrian images tailored to PAR
tasks. We identify key parameters of img2img diffusion-based data expansion;
including text prompts, image properties, and the latest enhancements in
diffusion-based data augmentation, and examine their impact on the quality of
generated images for PAR. Furthermore, we employ the best-performing expansion
approach to generate synthetic images for training PAR models, by enriching the
zero-shot datasets. Experimental results show that prompt alignment and image
properties are critical factors in image generation, with optimal selection
leading to a 4.5% improvement in PAR recognition performance.

*Xinshen Zhang,Tongxi Fu,Xu Zheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CFpano is the first cross-frame correlated panorama VQA benchmark and testbed for holistic 360° scenes; it is paired with ?methodname, an MLLM fine-tuned with GRPO and tailored rewards, achieving state-of-the-art results (+5.37% overall) across multiple-choice and open-ended VQA.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Omnidirectional (360 b0) scene understanding is essential for embodied AI, autonomous driving, and immersive environments but is hampered by geometric distortion and the lack of cross-frame context. Existing work focuses on single-frame panoramic understanding and neglects cross-frame correlations; a benchmark and learning framework for cross-frame panoramas is needed.

Method: Introduce CFpano, a cross-frame correlated panoramas VQA benchmark consisting of ~2700 images and ~8000 QA pairs (multiple choice and open-ended). Build ?methodname, an MLLM fine-tuned with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) and a set of tailored reward functions to enable robust, consistent reasoning over cross-frame panoramas.

Result: ?methodname achieves state-of-the-art performance on both MC and open-ended VQA tasks, outperforming strong baselines across major reasoning categories by about +5.37% overall. Analyses validate GRPO's effectiveness and establish CFpano as a new benchmark for panoramic scene understanding.

Conclusion: CFpano provides a new dataset and evaluation paradigm for cross-frame panoramic understanding, and the proposed GRPO-finetuned MLLM (?methodname) provides robust cross-frame reasoning, setting a new standard for panoramic VQA research.

Abstract: Omnidirectional scene understanding is vital for various downstream
applications, such as embodied AI, autonomous driving, and immersive
environments, yet remains challenging due to geometric distortion and complex
spatial relations in 360{\deg} imagery. Existing omnidirectional methods
achieve scene understanding within a single frame while neglecting cross-frame
correlated panoramas. To bridge this gap, we introduce \textbf{CFpano}, the
\textbf{first} benchmark dataset dedicated to cross-frame correlated panoramas
visual question answering in the holistic 360{\deg} scenes. CFpano consists of
over 2700 images together with over 8000 question-answer pairs, and the
question types include both multiple choice and open-ended VQA. Building upon
our CFpano, we further present \methodname, a multi-modal large language model
(MLLM) fine-tuned with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) and a set of
tailored reward functions for robust and consistent reasoning with cross-frame
correlated panoramas. Benchmark experiments with existing MLLMs are conducted
with our CFpano. The experimental results demonstrate that \methodname achieves
state-of-the-art performance across both multiple-choice and open-ended VQA
tasks, outperforming strong baselines on all major reasoning categories
(\textbf{+5.37\%} in overall performance). Our analyses validate the
effectiveness of GRPO and establish a new benchmark for panoramic scene
understanding.

Motivation: Spatial reasoning is critical for robust visual understanding but is underexplored in Vision-Language models. Existing VLMs show a notable deficiency in spatial relation understanding, creating a gap between human and machine performance. A dedicated benchmark with real-world data is needed to quantify and drive improvements.

Method: Create entirely new real-world image-text pairs focused on relative spatial relations and the order of objects. Evaluate open-source and frontier VLMs with this benchmark; perform a disentanglement analysis to separate contributions of object localization and spatial reasoning in chain-of-thought-based models, revealing bottlenecks. Release dataset under CC-BY-4.0 and provide evaluation code publicly.

Result: Humans find the tasks easy; current VLMs (open-source and frontier) show a striking lack of spatial relation understanding. Reasoning-based models perform comparatively well on this benchmark. Disentanglement analysis indicates the bottleneck lies in spatial reasoning rather than object localization.

Conclusion: The paper highlights a gap in current VLM capabilities for spatial reasoning, introducing RocketScience as a resource to drive progress. The dataset and code release encourage development and transparent benchmarking of spatial reasoning in vision-language models.

Abstract: We propose RocketScience, an open-source contrastive VLM benchmark that tests
for spatial relation understanding. It is comprised of entirely new real-world
image-text pairs covering mostly relative spatial understanding and the order
of objects. The benchmark is designed
  to be very easy for humans and hard for the current generation of VLMs, and
this is empirically verified. Our results show a striking lack of spatial
relation understanding in open source and frontier commercial VLMs and a
surprisingly high performance of reasoning models. Additionally, we perform a
disentanglement analysis to separate the contributions of object localization
and spatial reasoning in chain-of-thought-based models and find that the
performance on the benchmark is bottlenecked by spatial reasoning and not
object localization capabilities.
  We release the dataset with a CC-BY-4.0 license and make the evaluation code

### [189] [ADVMEM: Adversarial Memory Initialization for Realistic Test-Time Adaptation via Tracklet-Based Benchmarking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02182)
*Shyma Alhuwaider,Motasem Alfarra,Juan C. Perez,Merey Ramazanova,Bernard Ghanem*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduces ITD, a tracklet-based benchmark for test-time adaptation (TTA) that captures inherent temporal dependencies in video-like sequences, and proposes an adversarial memory initialization to boost memory-based TTA methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current TTA benchmarks emphasize distribution shifts and i.i.d. violations but ignore temporal continuity present in real-world streams. This mismatch motivates a dataset that encodes temporal dependencies via tracklet sequences derived from object-tracking bounding boxes to better evaluate TTA under realistic temporal dynamics.

Method: Construct the Inherent Temporal Dependencies (ITD) dataset by collecting tracklet-sequences from bounding boxes in an object-tracking dataset. Use ITD to perform thorough experiments on existing TTA methods and analyze their limitations under temporal dependencies. Propose an adversarial memory initialization strategy to improve memory-based TTA methods.

Result: The adversarial memory initialization strategy substantially boosts the performance of various memory-based TTA methods on the ITD benchmark, highlighting its effectiveness in leveraging temporal context.

Conclusion: ITD reveals limitations of current TTA methods when facing temporal dependencies and demonstrates that memory initialization strategies can significantly enhance performance. The dataset provides a realistic benchmark for evaluating TTA in temporally dependent settings and can guide future method development.

Abstract: We introduce a novel tracklet-based dataset for benchmarking test-time
adaptation (TTA) methods. The aim of this dataset is to mimic the intricate
challenges encountered in real-world environments such as images captured by
hand-held cameras, self-driving cars, etc. The current benchmarks for TTA focus
on how models face distribution shifts, when deployed, and on violations to the
customary independent-and-identically-distributed (i.i.d.) assumption in
machine learning. Yet, these benchmarks fail to faithfully represent realistic
scenarios that naturally display temporal dependencies, such as how consecutive
frames from a video stream likely show the same object across time. We address
this shortcoming of current datasets by proposing a novel TTA benchmark we call
the "Inherent Temporal Dependencies" (ITD) dataset. We ensure the instances in
ITD naturally embody temporal dependencies by collecting them from
tracklets-sequences of object-centric images we compile from the bounding boxes
of an object-tracking dataset. We use ITD to conduct a thorough experimental
analysis of current TTA methods, and shed light on the limitations of these
methods when faced with the challenges of temporal dependencies. Moreover, we
build upon these insights and propose a novel adversarial memory initialization
strategy to improve memory-based TTA methods. We find this strategy
substantially boosts the performance of various methods on our challenging
benchmark.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduces ABPDC and FPRAN to enable robust multimodal fusion for predicting postoperative neck pain recovery in cervical spondylosis, achieving superior accuracy on MMCSD and validated by ablation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neck pain in cervical spondylosis lacks clear mechanisms and suffers from multimodal fusion challenges due to imaging variability and spatial misalignment; robust texture extraction and alignment are needed.

Method: Adaptive Bidirectional Pyramid Difference Convolution (ABPDC) module exploiting difference convolution for texture extraction and grayscale invariance; Feature Pyramid Registration Auxiliary Network (FPRAN) to mitigate structural misalignment; integrated for multimodal fusion; evaluated on MMCSD dataset.

Result: Outperforms existing methods in predicting postoperative neck pain recovery; ablation studies confirm contributions of ABPDC and FPRAN.

Conclusion: The proposed modules enhance multimodal integration and predictive accuracy, offering improved prognosis guidance for cervical spondylosis-related neck pain.

Abstract: Neck pain is the primary symptom of cervical spondylosis, yet its underlying
mechanisms remain unclear, leading to uncertain treatment outcomes. To address
the challenges of multimodal feature fusion caused by imaging differences and
spatial mismatches, this paper proposes an Adaptive Bidirectional Pyramid
Difference Convolution (ABPDC) module that facilitates multimodal integration
by exploiting the advantages of difference convolution in texture extraction
and grayscale invariance, and a Feature Pyramid Registration Auxiliary Network
(FPRAN) to mitigate structural misalignment. Experiments on the MMCSD dataset
demonstrate that the proposed model achieves superior prediction accuracy of
postoperative neck pain recovery compared with existing methods, and ablation
studies further confirm its effectiveness.

### [192] [DSGC-Net: A Dual-Stream Graph Convolutional Network for Crowd Counting via Feature Correlation Mining](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02261)
*Yihong Wu,Jinqiao Wei,Xionghui Zhao,Yidi Li,Shaoyi Du,Bin Ren,Nicu Sebe*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DSGC-Net uses dual graph streams (density- and representation-driven) to model correlations in density variations and pose/visibility differences for crowd counting, achieving state-of-the-art MAE on ShanghaiTech.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In complex crowds, density distributions differ across regions and viewpoint/body-pose changes cause inconsistent representations, limiting counting accuracy. A method that explicitly models correlations in both density and representation can improve adaptability.

Method: A dual-stream network with two semantic graphs: (1) Density Approximation (DA) branch builds a density-driven semantic graph from the predicted density map, and applies graph convolution to model density correlations. (2) Representation Approximation (RA) branch builds a representation-driven semantic graph from global feature similarities, and applies graph convolution to model representation correlations. The two graphs are processed separately to enhance robustness to density variations and multi-view/pose variations.

Result: DSGC-Net outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods on three widely used crowd counting datasets, achieving MAE of 48.9 on ShanghaiTech Part A and 5.9 on Part B.

Conclusion: Dual semantic graphs capturing density and representation correlations improve adaptation to density variations and viewpoint/pose changes, leading to more accurate crowd counting; code is released.

Abstract: Deep learning-based crowd counting methods have achieved remarkable progress
in recent years. However, in complex crowd scenarios, existing models still
face challenges when adapting to significant density distribution differences
between regions. Additionally, the inconsistency of individual representations
caused by viewpoint changes and body posture differences further limits the
counting accuracy of the models. To address these challenges, we propose
DSGC-Net, a Dual-Stream Graph Convolutional Network based on feature
correlation mining. DSGC-Net introduces a Density Approximation (DA) branch and
a Representation Approximation (RA) branch. By modeling two semantic graphs, it
captures the potential feature correlations in density variations and
representation distributions. The DA branch incorporates a density prediction
module that generates the density distribution map, and constructs a
density-driven semantic graph based on density similarity. The RA branch
establishes a representation-driven semantic graph by computing global
representation similarity. Then, graph convolutional networks are applied to
the two semantic graphs separately to model the latent semantic relationships,
which enhance the model's ability to adapt to density variations and improve
counting accuracy in multi-view and multi-pose scenarios. Extensive experiments
on three widely used datasets demonstrate that DSGC-Net outperforms current
state-of-the-art methods. In particular, we achieve MAE of 48.9 and 5.9 in
ShanghaiTech Part A and Part B datasets, respectively. The released code is
available at: https://github.com/Wu-eon/CrowdCounting-DSGCNet.

*Yingrui Ji,Jiansheng Chen,Jingbo Chen,Anzhi Yue,Chenhao Wang,Kai Li,Yao Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RS-OOD introduces a remote-sensing tailored vision-language framework for few-shot OOD detection, featuring spatial feature enhancement, dual-prompt alignment, and confidence-guided self-training to achieve strong performance on RS benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: OOD detection in remote sensing is critical for autonomous monitoring but challenging due to data scarcity, multi-scale scene structure, and distribution shifts; existing natural-image methods and benchmarks do not adequately address RS data.

Method: Three key innovations: (1) spatial feature enhancement to improve scene discrimination; (2) dual-prompt alignment that cross-verifies scene context against fine-grained semantics for spatial-semantic consistency; (3) a confidence-guided self-training loop that dynamically mines pseudo-labels to expand training data without manual annotation.

Result: RS-OOD consistently outperforms existing methods across multiple remote sensing benchmarks and facilitates efficient adaptation with minimal labeled data.

Conclusion: Spatial–semantic integration with self-training enables robust few-shot OOD detection in remote sensing.

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection represents a critical challenge in remote
sensing applications, where reliable identification of novel or anomalous
patterns is essential for autonomous monitoring, disaster response, and
environmental assessment. Despite remarkable progress in OOD detection for
natural images, existing methods and benchmarks remain poorly suited to remote
sensing imagery due to data scarcity, complex multi-scale scene structures, and
pronounced distribution shifts. To this end, we propose RS-OOD, a novel
framework that leverages remote sensing-specific vision-language modeling to
enable robust few-shot OOD detection. Our approach introduces three key
innovations: spatial feature enhancement that improved scene discrimination, a
dual-prompt alignment mechanism that cross-verifies scene context against
fine-grained semantics for spatial-semantic consistency, and a
confidence-guided self-training loop that dynamically mines pseudo-labels to
expand training data without manual annotation. RS-OOD consistently outperforms
existing methods across multiple remote sensing benchmarks and enables
efficient adaptation with minimal labeled data, demonstrating the critical
value of spatial-semantic integration.

*Pushpendra Dhakara,Prachi Chachodhia,Vaibhav Kumar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SynthGenNet is a self-supervised student-teacher framework for robust test-time domain generalization in unstructured urban scenes, using synthetic multi-source data and novel techniques (ClassMix++, GMC, PLGCL) to reach 50% mIoU on IDD, outperforming single-source SOTA.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Unstructured urban environments cause high variability and domain shifts; limited labeled target data; need robust generalization and sim-to-real gap bridging using synthetic sources.

Method: A self-supervised student-teacher architecture; ClassMix++ blends heterogeneous synthetic data while preserving semantic integrity; Grounded Mask Consistency Loss leverages source GT for cross-domain alignment; Pseudo-Label Guided Contrastive Learning enables domain-invariant features via iterative distillation from teacher to student.

Result: Achieves 50% mIoU on Indian Driving Dataset (IDD), surpassing single-source state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: Demonstrates effective test-time domain generalization in complex urban scenes without heavy target labeling; the combination of ClassMix++, GMC, and PLGCL improves robustness to real-world variability and narrows the sim-to-real gap.

Abstract: Unstructured urban environments present unique challenges for scene
understanding and generalization due to their complex and diverse layouts. We
introduce SynthGenNet, a self-supervised student-teacher architecture designed
to enable robust test-time domain generalization using synthetic multi-source
imagery. Our contributions include the novel ClassMix++ algorithm, which blends
labeled data from various synthetic sources while maintaining semantic
integrity, enhancing model adaptability. We further employ Grounded Mask
Consistency Loss (GMC), which leverages source ground truth to improve
cross-domain prediction consistency and feature alignment. The Pseudo-Label
Guided Contrastive Learning (PLGCL) mechanism is integrated into the student
network to facilitate domain-invariant feature learning through iterative
knowledge distillation from the teacher network. This self-supervised strategy
improves prediction accuracy, addresses real-world variability, bridges the
sim-to-real domain gap, and reliance on labeled target data, even in complex
urban areas. Outcomes show our model outperforms the state-of-the-art (relying
on single source) by achieving 50% Mean Intersection-Over-Union (mIoU) value on
real-world datasets like Indian Driving Dataset (IDD).

*Sapir Esther Yiflach,Yuval Atzmon,Gal Chechik*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Learn-to-Steer trains a lightweight classifier to decode spatial relations from diffusion cross-attention maps and uses it as a learned test-time loss, coupled with a dual-inversion strategy to avoid shortcuts, yielding large gains in spatial accuracy and generalizing across relations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Children and benchmarks reveal that text-to-image diffusion models struggle with basic spatial reasoning. Handcrafted losses and fine-tuning are brittle and may embed linguistic biases; learning spatial objectives from model internals can be more robust and data-driven.

Method: Train a lightweight classifier to decode spatial relationships from the diffusion model's cross-attention maps. Use this classifier as a learned loss during inference (test-time optimization). Employ a dual-inversion strategy to prevent the classifier from exploiting linguistic shortcuts and enforce genuine geometric understanding. Evaluate on standard spatial relation benchmarks and across multiple relations.

Result: Large improvements in spatial accuracy: 0.20→0.61 on FLUX.1-dev and 0.07→0.54 on SD2.1. The approach generalizes to multiple spatial relations and shows strong performance on standard benchmarks.

Conclusion: Data-driven, representation-based objective learning for test-time optimization can effectively fix spatial reasoning in diffusion models, offering better generalization and reducing reliance on handcrafted losses.

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models can generate stunning visuals, yet they often
fail at tasks children find trivial--like placing a dog to the right of a teddy
bear rather than to the left. When combinations get more unusual--a giraffe
above an airplane--these failures become even more pronounced. Existing methods
attempt to fix these spatial reasoning failures through model fine-tuning or
test-time optimization with handcrafted losses that are suboptimal. Rather than
imposing our assumptions about spatial encoding, we propose learning these
objectives directly from the model's internal representations. We introduce
Learn-to-Steer, a novel framework that learns data-driven objectives for
test-time optimization rather than handcrafting them. Our key insight is to
train a lightweight classifier that decodes spatial relationships from the
diffusion model's cross-attention maps, then deploy this classifier as a
learned loss function during inference. Training such classifiers poses a
surprising challenge: they can take shortcuts by detecting linguistic traces
rather than learning true spatial patterns. We solve this with a dual-inversion
strategy that enforces geometric understanding. Our method dramatically
improves spatial accuracy: from 0.20 to 0.61 on FLUX.1-dev and from 0.07 to
0.54 on SD2.1 across standard benchmarks. Moreover, our approach generalizes to
multiple relations and significantly improves accuracy.

TL;DR: Board-game-based evaluation of CLIP's color perception and naming; finds general human alignment but cultural biases and abstraction-level inconsistencies; highlights value of diverse tasks for debugging AI models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To more thoroughly assess human-like capabilities of AI by using interactive, culturally-influenced tasks beyond standard benchmarks.

Method: Play the board game Hues & Cues to probe CLIP's color perception and naming; compare results with human judgments; analyze alignment and biases across abstraction levels.

Result: CLIP largely aligns with human observers; tasks reveal cultural biases and inconsistencies across abstraction levels; board-game testing exposes deficiencies not evident in conventional benchmarks.

Conclusion: Incorporating board-game style tasks can uncover model limitations and biases, suggesting broader, task-diverse evaluation strategies to better capture human-like reasoning.

Abstract: Playing games is inherently human, and a lot of games are created to
challenge different human characteristics. However, these tasks are often left
out when evaluating the human-like nature of artificial models. The objective
of this work is proposing a new approach to evaluate artificial models via
board games. To this effect, we test the color perception and color naming
capabilities of CLIP by playing the board game Hues & Cues and assess its
alignment with humans. Our experiments show that CLIP is generally well aligned
with human observers, but our approach brings to light certain cultural biases
and inconsistencies when dealing with different abstraction levels that are
hard to identify with other testing strategies. Our findings indicate that
assessing models with different tasks like board games can make certain
deficiencies in the models stand out in ways that are difficult to test with
the commonly used benchmarks.

### [197] [OmniActor: A Generalist GUI and Embodied Agent for 2D&3D Worlds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02322)
*Longrong Yang,Zhixiong Zeng,Yufeng Zhong,Jing Huang,Liming Zheng,Lei Chen,Haibo Qiu,Zequn Qin,Lin Ma,Xi Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR:  OmniActor, a generalist multimodal agent, uses Layer-heterogeneity MoE to separate deep-layer parameters (to avoid conflicts) from GUI and embodied data while sharing shallow layers (to exploit synergy), unifying their action spaces and training on large-scale GUI/embodied data. This yields strong performance across GUI and embodied tasks, outperforming single-domain agents; code will be released.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need for agents that can operate in both GUI (2D) and embodied (3D) environments. Previous work focuses on one domain, and mixing data causes conflicts that hurt performance. The paper argues that GUI and embodied data offer synergy at shallow levels but conflict at deep levels, akin to brain systems, motivating a structural solution.

Method: Introduce Layer-heterogeneity Mixture of Experts (MoE) that keeps deep-layer parameters separate (to reduce cross-domain interference) while sharing shallow-layer parameters (to harness cross-domain synergy). Unify action spaces for GUI and embodied tasks and train on a large-scale, diverse dataset from multiple sources.

Result: OmniActor outperforms agents trained solely on GUI or solely on embodied data across GUI and embodied tasks, with particularly notable gains in GUI tasks.

Conclusion: A layer-wise separation of parameters coupled with shared shallow layers enables effective integration of GUI and embodied data, yielding a high-performance generalist agent. The unified action space and large-scale data collection further drive cross-domain capabilities; code will be publicly available.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models are evolving toward multimodal agents
capable of proactively executing tasks. Most agent research focuses on GUI or
embodied scenarios, which correspond to agents interacting with 2D virtual
worlds or 3D real worlds, respectively. However, many complex tasks typically
require agents to interleavely interact with these two types of environment. We
initially mix GUI and embodied data to train, but find the performance
degeneration brought by the data conflict. Further analysis reveals that GUI
and embodied data exhibit synergy and conflict at the shallow and deep layers,
respectively, which resembles the cerebrum-cerebellum mechanism in the human
brain. To this end, we propose a high-performance generalist agent OmniActor,
designed from both structural and data perspectives. First, we propose
Layer-heterogeneity MoE to eliminate the conflict between GUI and embodied data
by separating deep-layer parameters, while leverage their synergy by sharing
shallow-layer parameters. By successfully leveraging the synergy and
eliminating the conflict, OmniActor outperforms agents only trained by GUI or
embodied data in GUI or embodied tasks. Furthermore, we unify the action spaces
of GUI and embodied tasks, and collect large-scale GUI and embodied data from
various sources for training. This significantly improves OmniActor under
different scenarios, especially in GUI tasks. The code will be publicly
available.

### [198] [Ordinal Adaptive Correction: A Data-Centric Approach to Ordinal Image Classification with Noisy Labels](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02351)
*Alireza Sedighi Moghaddam,Mohammad Reza Mohammadi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A data-centric approach ORDAC uses Label Distribution Learning to adaptively correct noisy ordinal labels during training, improving robustness and accuracy on age estimation and disease severity tasks, with extensions ORDAC_C and ORDAC_R showing notable gains under asymmetric noise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ordinal image classification faces label noise due to ambiguous class boundaries; traditional denoising or discarding data loses information. A method that models and corrects label uncertainty can better utilize data and improve reliability.

Method: ORDAC dynamically adjusts the mean and standard deviation of the label distribution for each sample during training using Label Distribution Learning to capture inherent ambiguity in ordinal labels. Rather than discarding noisy samples, it corrects them. Extensions ORDAC_C and ORDAC_R were evaluated on Adience (age estimation) and Diabetic Retinopathy (disease severity) under asymmetric Gaussian noise.

Result: ORDAC and its extensions yielded significant improvements under noisy conditions. For example, on Adience with 40% noise, ORDAC_R reduced mean absolute error from 0.86 to 0.62 and increased recall from 0.37 to 0.49. The approach also corrected intrinsic noise in the original datasets.

Conclusion: Adaptive label correction via label distributions is effective for enhancing robustness and accuracy of ordinal classification models in the presence of noisy data.

Abstract: Labeled data is a fundamental component in training supervised deep learning
models for computer vision tasks. However, the labeling process, especially for
ordinal image classification where class boundaries are often ambiguous, is
prone to error and noise. Such label noise can significantly degrade the
performance and reliability of machine learning models. This paper addresses
the problem of detecting and correcting label noise in ordinal image
classification tasks. To this end, a novel data-centric method called ORDinal
Adaptive Correction (ORDAC) is proposed for adaptive correction of noisy
labels. The proposed approach leverages the capabilities of Label Distribution
Learning (LDL) to model the inherent ambiguity and uncertainty present in
ordinal labels. During training, ORDAC dynamically adjusts the mean and
standard deviation of the label distribution for each sample. Rather than
discarding potentially noisy samples, this approach aims to correct them and
make optimal use of the entire training dataset. The effectiveness of the
proposed method is evaluated on benchmark datasets for age estimation (Adience)
and disease severity detection (Diabetic Retinopathy) under various asymmetric
Gaussian noise scenarios. Results show that ORDAC and its extended versions
(ORDAC_C and ORDAC_R) lead to significant improvements in model performance.
For instance, on the Adience dataset with 40% noise, ORDAC_R reduced the mean
absolute error from 0.86 to 0.62 and increased the recall metric from 0.37 to
0.49. The method also demonstrated its effectiveness in correcting intrinsic
noise present in the original datasets. This research indicates that adaptive
label correction using label distributions is an effective strategy to enhance
the robustness and accuracy of ordinal classification models in the presence of
noisy data.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A framework C33D for category+3D-to-3D synthesis that blends a base 3D model with another category via multi-view diffusion and an adaptive text-image harmony module to yield coherent, novel 3D shapes and textures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing text/image/3D-to-3D methods struggle to integrate multiple content sources, causing texture inconsistency and shape inaccuracy. A unified, category-aware approach is needed for coherent 3D synthesis.

Method: Render multi-view RGB images and normal maps from the input model; generate a novel 2D object using adaptive text-image harmony (ATIH) with the front-view image and a text description from a different category; apply texture multi-view diffusion to refine textures across remaining views conditioned on the novel 2D object; apply shape multi-view diffusion to improve 2D shapes of RGBs and normals conditioned on the novel 2D object; reconstruct a complete 3D model from the outputs.

Result: Extensive experiments show the method is effective, producing impressive 3D creations (e.g., shark(3D)-crocodile(text)); a project page is provided.

Conclusion: C33D yields structurally coherent and novel 3D models by tightly integrating multi-view cues with a generated 2D object, demonstrating strong effectiveness and potential generalization.

Abstract: In this paper, we tackle a new task of 3D object synthesis, where a 3D model
is composited with another object category to create a novel 3D model. However,
most existing text/image/3D-to-3D methods struggle to effectively integrate
multiple content sources, often resulting in inconsistent textures and
inaccurate shapes. To overcome these challenges, we propose a straightforward
yet powerful approach, category+3D-to-3D (C33D), for generating novel and
structurally coherent 3D models. Our method begins by rendering multi-view
images and normal maps from the input 3D model, then generating a novel 2D
object using adaptive text-image harmony (ATIH) with the front-view image and a
text description from another object category as inputs. To ensure texture
consistency, we introduce texture multi-view diffusion, which refines the
textures of the remaining multi-view RGB images based on the novel 2D object.
For enhanced shape accuracy, we propose shape multi-view diffusion to improve
the 2D shapes of both the multi-view RGB images and the normal maps, also
conditioned on the novel 2D object. Finally, these outputs are used to
reconstruct a complete and novel 3D model. Extensive experiments demonstrate
the effectiveness of our method, yielding impressive 3D creations, such as
shark(3D)-crocodile(text) in the first row of Fig. 1. A project page is

### [200] [Why Do MLLMs Struggle with Spatial Understanding? A Systematic Analysis from Data to Architecture](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02359)
*Wanyue Zhang,Yibin Huang,Yangbin Xu,JingJing Huang,Helu Zhi,Shuo Ren,Wang Xu,Jiajun Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Multiplexing across single-view, multi-view, and video reveals that data scaling alone cannot achieve strong spatial understanding in MLLMs; the architecture—especially the positional encoding in the visual encoder—plays a bigger role, with architecture-level interventions (reasoning injection, native vs cascaded models) offering a clearer path to improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs steadily improve in many areas but display persistent gaps in spatial understanding, particularly in spatial imagination across different input modalities. A comprehensive, systematic evaluation is missing, spanning single-view, multi-view, and video settings.

Method: Introduce MulSeT, a benchmark for Multi-view Spatial Understanding Tasks, and conduct experiments across three scenarios (single-view, multi-view, video). Analyze data-centric effects (how performance scales with data) and architectural effects (importance of positional encoding in visual encoders, comparison of cascaded vs native MLLMs, and potential for reasoning injection).

Result: Data perspective: performance improves quickly with more data but upper bound remains relatively low, notably for spatial-imagination tasks, implying data scaling alone is insufficient. Architectural perspective: spatial understanding relies more on positional encoding in the visual encoder than in the language model, across both cascaded and native MLLMs. Indications that architectural design choices (e.g., improve positional encoding, inject reasoning modules) can meaningfully influence spatial understanding.

Conclusion: Current MLLMs exhibit limited spatial understanding that is not easily overcome by data scaling. Improvements likely require architectural tuning, especially around visual positional encoding and structured reasoning mechanisms, with MulSeT serving as a benchmark to guide such developments.

Abstract: Spatial understanding is essential for Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs) to support perception, reasoning, and planning in embodied
environments. Despite recent progress, existing studies reveal that MLLMs still
struggle with spatial understanding. However, existing research lacks a
comprehensive and systematic evaluation of these limitations, often restricted
to isolated scenarios, such as single-view or video. In this work, we present a
systematic analysis of spatial understanding from both data and architectural
perspectives across three representative scenarios: single-view, multi-view,
and video. We propose a benchmark named MulSeT (Multi-view Spatial
Understanding Tasks), and design a series of experiments to analyze the spatial
reasoning capabilities of MLLMs. From the data perspective, the performance of
spatial understanding converges quickly as the training data increases, and the
upper bound is relatively low, especially for tasks that require spatial
imagination. This indicates that merely expanding training data is insufficient
to achieve satisfactory performance. From the architectural perspective, we
find that spatial understanding relies more heavily on the positional encoding
within the visual encoder than within the language model, in both cascaded and
native MLLMs. Moreover, we explore reasoning injection and envision future

### [201] [MedDINOv3: How to adapt vision foundation models for medical image segmentation?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02379)
*Yuheng Li,Yizhou Wu,Yuxiang Lai,Mingzhe Hu,Xiaofeng Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MedDINOv3 adapts DINOv3 to medical segmentation using domain-adaptive pretraining on CT data and a simple ViT architecture with multi-scale token aggregation; achieves state-of-the-art performance across four benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical image segmentation requires models that generalize across modalities and institutions. ViT-based vision foundation models often underperform CNNs in medical tasks, and a large domain gap between natural and medical images hinders transfer. Adapting foundation models could provide a unified backbone for medical segmentation.

Method: Use plain ViTs with a lightweight multi-scale token aggregation design. Perform domain-adaptive pretraining on CT-3M (3.87M axial CT slices) using a multi-stage DINOv3 recipe to learn robust dense features for segmentation.

Result: MedDINOv3 matches or exceeds state-of-the-art performance on four segmentation benchmarks, demonstrating the potential of vision foundation models as unified backbones for medical image segmentation.

Conclusion: Vision foundation models, when domain-adapted and paired with a simple multi-scale ViT architecture, can generalize better across medical tasks and modalities, enabling unified segmentation backbones across CT/MRI and institutions.

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of organs and tumors in CT and MRI scans is essential
for diagnosis, treatment planning, and disease monitoring. While deep learning
has advanced automated segmentation, most models remain task-specific, lacking
generalizability across modalities and institutions. Vision foundation models
(FMs) pretrained on billion-scale natural images offer powerful and
transferable representations. However, adapting them to medical imaging faces
two key challenges: (1) the ViT backbone of most foundation models still
underperform specialized CNNs on medical image segmentation, and (2) the large
domain gap between natural and medical images limits transferability. We
introduce \textbf{MedDINOv3}, a simple and effective framework for adapting
DINOv3 to medical segmentation. We first revisit plain ViTs and design a simple
and effective architecture with multi-scale token aggregation. Then, we perform
domain-adaptive pretraining on \textbf{CT-3M}, a curated collection of 3.87M
axial CT slices, using a multi-stage DINOv3 recipe to learn robust dense
features. MedDINOv3 matches or exceeds state-of-the-art performance across four
segmentation benchmarks, demonstrating the potential of vision foundation
models as unified backbones for medical image segmentation. The code is

*Xiaobao Wei,Changyong Shu,Zhaokun Yue,Chang Huang,Weiwei Liu,Shuai Yang,Lirong Yang,Peng Gao,Wenbin Zhang,Gaochao Zhu,Chengxiang Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DBStereo is a deployment-friendly 4D cost aggregation network that uses pure 2D convolutions with a decoupled learning strategy to unify spatial and disparity representation. It delivers real-time stereo matching with high accuracy on mobile-style devices, outperforming existing aggregation-based methods and even IGEV-Stereo, challenging 3D-convolution dominance for 4D cost volumes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-performance real-time stereo often relies on 3D regularization of the 4D cost volume, which is expensive for mobile devices, while 2D regularization struggles in ill-posed regions. A deployment-friendly, efficient method is needed that preserves accuracy without 3D convolutions.

Method: The approach analyzes the decoupling characteristics of the 4D cost volume and introduces a lightweight bidirectional geometry aggregation block that separately captures spatial and disparity representations using pure 2D convolutions. Through decoupled learning of these components, the model achieves real-time performance without heavy 3D operations.

Result: DBStereo outperforms all existing aggregation-based methods in both inference time and accuracy and even surpasses the iterative method IGEV-Stereo. It provides a simple, strong baseline for decoupled aggregation and breaks the standard reliance on 3D convolutions for 4D cost volumes.

Conclusion: Decoupled 4D cost aggregation via 2D convolutions can achieve real-time stereo with high accuracy and deployability, offering a compelling alternative to 3D-based approaches and establishing a practical baseline for decoupled aggregation in stereo vision.

Abstract: High-performance real-time stereo matching methods invariably rely on 3D
regularization of the cost volume, which is unfriendly to mobile devices. And
2D regularization based methods struggle in ill-posed regions. In this paper,
we present a deployment-friendly 4D cost aggregation network DBStereo, which is
based on pure 2D convolutions. Specifically, we first provide a thorough
analysis of the decoupling characteristics of 4D cost volume. And design a
lightweight bidirectional geometry aggregation block to capture spatial and
disparity representation respectively. Through decoupled learning, our approach
achieves real-time performance and impressive accuracy simultaneously.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed DBStereo outperforms all
existing aggregation-based methods in both inference time and accuracy, even
surpassing the iterative-based method IGEV-Stereo. Our study break the
empirical design of using 3D convolutions for 4D cost volume and provides a
simple yet strong baseline of the proposed decouple aggregation paradigm for
further study. Code will be available at

### [203] [From Noisy Labels to Intrinsic Structure: A Geometric-Structural Dual-Guided Framework for Noise-Robust Medical Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02419)
*Tao Wang,Zhenxuan Zhang,Yuanbo Zhou,Xinlin Zhang,Yuanbin Chen,Tao Tan,Guang Yang,Tong Tong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A three-module network (GSD-Net) uses geometric distance-aware weighting, structural label refinement, and knowledge transfer to robustly segment medical images with noisy annotations, achieving state-of-the-art performance on six datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Noisy and subjective annotations in medical image segmentation hinder learning; robust methods leveraging geometric and structural priors are needed to suppress noise and preserve local details.

Method: Geometric Distance-Aware module dynamically adjusts pixel-level weights using geometric cues to emphasize reliable regions; Structure-Guided Label Refinement module refines labels with structural priors; Knowledge Transfer module enriches supervision to improve sensitivity to local details. Evaluated on six datasets, including four with simulated label noise (three noise types) and two with multi-expert annotations.

Result: Claims state-of-the-art performance under noisy annotations, reporting improvements under SR simulated noise: 2.52% on Kvasir, 22.76% on Shenzhen, 8.87% on BU-SUC, and 4.59% on BraTS2020. Public code available at the provided GitHub URL.

Conclusion: GSD-Net demonstrates robustness to annotation noise through geometric/structural priors and transfer learning, with potential applicability to real-world noisy datasets; future work could extend to other modalities, noise types, and efficiency improvements.

Abstract: The effectiveness of convolutional neural networks in medical image
segmentation relies on large-scale, high-quality annotations, which are costly
and time-consuming to obtain. Even expert-labeled datasets inevitably contain
noise arising from subjectivity and coarse delineations, which disrupt feature
learning and adversely impact model performance. To address these challenges,
this study propose a Geometric-Structural Dual-Guided Network (GSD-Net), which
integrates geometric and structural cues to improve robustness against noisy
annotations. It incorporates a Geometric Distance-Aware module that dynamically
adjusts pixel-level weights using geometric features, thereby strengthening
supervision in reliable regions while suppressing noise. A Structure-Guided
Label Refinement module further refines labels with structural priors, and a
Knowledge Transfer module enriches supervision and improves sensitivity to
local details. To comprehensively assess its effectiveness, we evaluated
GSD-Net on six publicly available datasets: four containing three types of
simulated label noise, and two with multi-expert annotations that reflect
real-world subjectivity and labeling inconsistencies. Experimental results
demonstrate that GSD-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance under noisy
annotations, achieving improvements of 2.52% on Kvasir, 22.76% on Shenzhen,
8.87% on BU-SUC, and 4.59% on BraTS2020 under SR simulated noise. The codes of
this study are available at https://github.com/ortonwang/GSD-Net.

### [204] [Faster and Better: Reinforced Collaborative Distillation and Self-Learning for Infrared-Visible Image Fusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02424)
*Yuhao Wang,Lingjuan Miao,Zhiqiang Zhou,Yajun Qiao,Lei Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a collaborative distillation and self-learning framework for infrared–visible image fusion using reinforcement learning to tailor training strategies; enhances lightweight student models by enabling challenging self-learning and adaptive teacher guidance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Lightweight fusion models struggle to achieve high-quality fusion; there is a need for effective, efficient training strategies to transfer knowledge from a teacher and improve learning on hard samples.

Method: A reinforcement learning agent governs a teacher–student fusion framework: the agent selects challenging samples for the student’s self-learning and adjusts the teacher’s guidance strength based on the student’s state, using inputs of student performance and the teacher–student gap; the agent also generates training strategies and modulates knowledge transfer to optimize fusion quality.

Result: Experimental results show significant improvements in the student’s performance and superior fusion quality over existing techniques.

Conclusion: The collaborative distillation with RL-guided self-learning effectively enhances infrared–visible image fusion in lightweight models by smartly balancing knowledge transfer and self-learning.

Abstract: Infrared and visible image fusion plays a critical role in enhancing scene
perception by combining complementary information from different modalities.
Despite recent advances, achieving high-quality image fusion with lightweight
models remains a significant challenge. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel
collaborative distillation and self-learning framework for image fusion driven
by reinforcement learning. Unlike conventional distillation, this approach not
only enables the student model to absorb image fusion knowledge from the
teacher model, but more importantly, allows the student to perform
self-learning on more challenging samples to enhance its capabilities.
Particularly, in our framework, a reinforcement learning agent explores and
identifies a more suitable training strategy for the student.The agent takes
both the student's performance and the teacher-student gap as inputs, which
leads to the generation of challenging samples to facilitate the student's
self-learning. Simultaneously, it dynamically adjusts the teacher's guidance
strength based on the student's state to optimize the knowledge transfer.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method can significantly improve
student performance and achieve better fusion results compared to existing
techniques.

### [205] [Towards High-Fidelity, Identity-Preserving Real-Time Makeup Transfer: Decoupling Style Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02445)
*Lydia Kin Ching Chau,Zhi Yu,Ruo Wei Jiang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A real-time, identity-preserving makeup transfer framework that achieves temporally coherent results by decoupling makeup extraction and rendering and training on pseudo-ground-truth data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need for realistic, temporally stable makeup transfer that preserves user identity and fairness, while existing methods struggle with disentangling semi-transparent cosmetics from skin tones, suffer from identity shifts, and lack real-time performance.

Method: Decouple makeup transfer into two steps: transparent makeup mask extraction and graphics-based mask rendering. Train the extractor on pseudo-ground-truth data generated via a graphics-based rendering pipeline and unsupervised k-means clustering. Use specialized losses (alpha-weighted reconstruction, lip color losses) to improve transparency estimation and color fidelity. Enable real-time rendering for live makeup try-on, with temporal consistency objectives likely guiding the training.

Result: The approach achieves robust makeup transfer across diverse poses, expressions, and skin tones while preserving temporal smoothness. Experiments show superiority over baselines in capturing fine details, maintaining temporal stability, and preserving identity integrity.

Conclusion: This framework offers a practical path for real-time, high-fidelity makeup transfer that preserves user identity and temporal consistency, addressing prior disentanglement and real-time limitations and demonstrating strong performance across varied conditions.

Abstract: We present a novel framework for real-time virtual makeup try-on that
achieves high-fidelity, identity-preserving cosmetic transfer with robust
temporal consistency. In live makeup transfer applications, it is critical to
synthesize temporally coherent results that accurately replicate fine-grained
makeup and preserve user's identity. However, existing methods often struggle
to disentangle semitransparent cosmetics from skin tones and other identify
features, causing identity shifts and raising fairness concerns. Furthermore,
current methods lack real-time capabilities and fail to maintain temporal
consistency, limiting practical adoption. To address these challenges, we
decouple makeup transfer into two steps: transparent makeup mask extraction and
graphics-based mask rendering. After the makeup extraction step, the makeup
rendering can be performed in real time, enabling live makeup try-on. Our
makeup extraction model trained on pseudo-ground-truth data generated via two
complementary methods: a graphics-based rendering pipeline and an unsupervised
k-means clustering approach. To further enhance transparency estimation and
color fidelity, we propose specialized training objectives, including
alpha-weighted reconstruction and lip color losses. Our method achieves robust
makeup transfer across diverse poses, expressions, and skin tones while
preserving temporal smoothness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
approach outperforms existing baselines in capturing fine details, maintaining
temporal stability, and preserving identity integrity.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduces RiverScope, a high-resolution, multi-sensor river/water dataset with global width-benchmark, enabling fine-scale monitoring and training of deep models for accurate width estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the lack of high-resolution, annotated surface-water data for narrow or sediment-rich rivers, which are poorly captured by low-resolution satellites, and support climate adaptation and water management.

Method: Assembles 1,145 high-res images (2,577 km^2) with expert masks; co-registers with Sentinel-2, SWOT, and SWORD; creates a global high-res river width benchmark (7.2 m median error); evaluates CNNs/transformers, pretraining (supervised/self-supervised), and datasets; uses transfer learning with multispectral PlanetScope channels via learned adaptors.

Result: Global, high-res river-width benchmark achieved with 7.2 m median error; dataset enables cost-accuracy trade-off evaluation across sensors; best models leverage transfer learning and multispectral channels, outperforming existing methods; RiverScope provides a resource for fine-scale hydrological modeling.

Conclusion: RiverScope fills a critical data gap for fine-scale river monitoring and multi-sensor hydrological modeling, supporting climate adaptation and sustainable water management.

Abstract: Surface water dynamics play a critical role in Earth's climate system,
influencing ecosystems, agriculture, disaster resilience, and sustainable
development. Yet monitoring rivers and surface water at fine spatial and
temporal scales remains challenging -- especially for narrow or sediment-rich
rivers that are poorly captured by low-resolution satellite data. To address
this, we introduce RiverScope, a high-resolution dataset developed through
collaboration between computer science and hydrology experts. RiverScope
comprises 1,145 high-resolution images (covering 2,577 square kilometers) with
expert-labeled river and surface water masks, requiring over 100 hours of
manual annotation. Each image is co-registered with Sentinel-2, SWOT, and the
SWOT River Database (SWORD), enabling the evaluation of cost-accuracy
trade-offs across sensors -- a key consideration for operational water
monitoring. We also establish the first global, high-resolution benchmark for
river width estimation, achieving a median error of 7.2 meters -- significantly
outperforming existing satellite-derived methods. We extensively evaluate deep
networks across multiple architectures (e.g., CNNs and transformers),
pretraining strategies (e.g., supervised and self-supervised), and training
datasets (e.g., ImageNet and satellite imagery). Our best-performing models
combine the benefits of transfer learning with the use of all the multispectral
PlanetScope channels via learned adaptors. RiverScope provides a valuable
resource for fine-scale and multi-sensor hydrological modeling, supporting
climate adaptation and sustainable water management.

*Shuzhou Yang,Xiaoyu Li,Xiaodong Cun,Guangzhi Wang,Lingen Li,Ying Shan,Jian Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Diffusion Transformer-based VideoComp: an interactive generative video compositing pipeline that preserves the background, fuses a foreground with the target video, and supports user control; introduces Extended Rotary Position Embedding (ERoPE) and a 61k-video dataset; outperforms baselines in fidelity and consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional video compositing pipelines are labor-intensive and slow. Automating this process with generative models enables interactive control over foreground identity, motion, size, and trajectory while maintaining consistency of the edited video.

Method: A Diffusion Transformer (DiT) pipeline with a light-weight background preservation branch using masked token injection; a DiT fusion block employing full self-attention for integrating foreground dynamics; simple foreground augmentation during training; Extended Rotary Position Embedding (ERoPE) for fusing background and foreground with different layouts; a curated dataset VideoComp with 61k video sets for training.

Result: Experiments show the proposed method effectively achieves generative video compositing, outperforming existing possible solutions in fidelity and consistency.

Conclusion: The DiT-based VideoComp approach, together with ERoPE and the fusion block, enables interactive, high-fidelity, and consistent generative video compositing, supported by a substantial VideoComp dataset.

Abstract: Video compositing combines live-action footage to create video production,
serving as a crucial technique in video creation and film production.
Traditional pipelines require intensive labor efforts and expert collaboration,
resulting in lengthy production cycles and high manpower costs. To address this
issue, we automate this process with generative models, called generative video
compositing. This new task strives to adaptively inject identity and motion
information of foreground video to the target video in an interactive manner,
allowing users to customize the size, motion trajectory, and other attributes
of the dynamic elements added in final video. Specifically, we designed a novel
Diffusion Transformer (DiT) pipeline based on its intrinsic properties. To
maintain consistency of the target video before and after editing, we revised a
light-weight DiT-based background preservation branch with masked token
injection. As to inherit dynamic elements from other sources, a DiT fusion
block is proposed using full self-attention, along with a simple yet effective
foreground augmentation for training. Besides, for fusing background and
foreground videos with different layouts based on user control, we developed a
novel position embedding, named Extended Rotary Position Embedding (ERoPE).
Finally, we curated a dataset comprising 61K sets of videos for our new task,
called VideoComp. This data includes complete dynamic elements and high-quality
target videos. Experiments demonstrate that our method effectively realizes
generative video compositing, outperforming existing possible solutions in
fidelity and consistency.

*Yanwen Wang,Yiyu Zhuang,Jiawei Zhang,Li Wang,Yifei Zeng,Xun Cao,Xinxin Zuo,Hao Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TeRA introduces a two-stage text-to-3D avatar generation pipeline that distills a structured latent space from a large human reconstruction model and trains a text-controlled latent diffusion model to generate photorealistic 3D avatars, outperforming SDS-based and large 3D models while enabling partial text-based customization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Efficient, high-quality text-to-3D avatar generation is hampered by slow optimization in SDS-based methods and the inefficiency of large 3D generative models; there is a need for a native 3D avatar latent space that supports partial textual control.

Method: Stage 1: distill a decoder from a large human reconstruction model to obtain a structured latent space suitable for 3D avatars. Stage 2: train a text-controlled latent diffusion model to synthesize photorealistic avatars within that latent space, enabling direct text-based control without iterative optimization.

Result: Empirical evaluations show TeRA surpasses prior text-to-avatar methods in both subjective quality and objective metrics.

Conclusion: TeRA delivers a more efficient and effective 3D avatar generation framework, enabling partial text-based customization via a structured 3D representation and avoiding slow optimization common in prior approaches.

Abstract: In this paper, we rethink text-to-avatar generative models by proposing TeRA,
a more efficient and effective framework than the previous SDS-based models and
general large 3D generative models. Our approach employs a two-stage training
strategy for learning a native 3D avatar generative model. Initially, we
distill a decoder to derive a structured latent space from a large human
reconstruction model. Subsequently, a text-controlled latent diffusion model is
trained to generate photorealistic 3D human avatars within this latent space.
TeRA enhances the model performance by eliminating slow iterative optimization
and enables text-based partial customization through a structured 3D human
representation. Experiments have proven our approach's superiority over
previous text-to-avatar generative models in subjective and objective
evaluation.

### [209] [Anisotropic Fourier Features for Positional Encoding in Medical Imaging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02488)
*Nabil Jabareen,Dongsheng Yuan,Dingming Liu,Foo-Wei Ten,Sören Lukassen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Anisotropic Fourier Feature Positional Encoding (AFPE) improves Transformer performance on anisotropic medical images by capturing shape- and domain-specific spatial dependencies, outperforming traditional isotropic encodings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current positional encodings (SPEs and IFPEs) struggle with preserving Euclidean distances in high-dimensional and anisotropic medical images. There is a need for an anisotropic, domain-aware PE that matches the data structure and target shapes in medical imaging.

Method: Introduce AFPE, a generalization of IFPE that incorporates anisotropic, class-specific, and domain-specific spatial dependencies. Systematically benchmark AFPE against common PEs on tasks including multi-label chest X-ray classification, CT organ classification, and echocardiography ejection fraction regression.

Result: AFPE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art PEs in all tested anisotropic settings. The optimal PE depends on the shape of the structure and the data anisotropy, and selecting an appropriate anisotropic PE yields notable performance gains across tasks.

Conclusion: For anisotropic medical images and videos, adopting an anisotropic PE that aligns with the data and target shape is crucial; AFPE provides a superior encoding choice in such settings.

Abstract: The adoption of Transformer-based architectures in the medical domain is
growing rapidly. In medical imaging, the analysis of complex shapes - such as
organs, tissues, or other anatomical structures - combined with the often
anisotropic nature of high-dimensional images complicates these adaptations. In
this study, we critically examine the role of Positional Encodings (PEs),
arguing that commonly used approaches may be suboptimal for the specific
challenges of medical imaging. Sinusoidal Positional Encodings (SPEs) have
proven effective in vision tasks, but they struggle to preserve Euclidean
distances in higher-dimensional spaces. Isotropic Fourier Feature Positional
Encodings (IFPEs) have been proposed to better preserve Euclidean distances,
but they lack the ability to account for anisotropy in images. To address these
limitations, we propose Anisotropic Fourier Feature Positional Encoding (AFPE),
a generalization of IFPE that incorporates anisotropic, class-specific, and
domain-specific spatial dependencies. We systematically benchmark AFPE against
commonly used PEs on multi-label classification in chest X-rays, organ
classification in CT images, and ejection fraction regression in
echocardiography. Our results demonstrate that choosing the correct PE can
significantly improve model performance. We show that the optimal PE depends on
the shape of the structure of interest and the anisotropy of the data. Finally,
our proposed AFPE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art PEs in all tested
anisotropic settings. We conclude that, in anisotropic medical images and
videos, it is of paramount importance to choose an anisotropic PE that fits the
data and the shape of interest.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mitigate the computational burden of 3D deep models for video-based HAR in fitness contexts and enable real-time or resource-constrained deployment, by leveraging efficient 2D feature extractors plus temporal modeling.

Method: Extract spatial features per frame with pre-trained 2D CNNs/ViT (ResNet50, EfficientNet, ViT). Feed frame features into an LSTM enhanced with a spatial attention mechanism to emphasize informative video segments and capture temporal dynamics. Evaluate on a curated UCF101 fitness subset.

Result: Achieved peak accuracy of 93.34% with the ResNet50-based configuration. Outperformed several state-of-the-art HAR systems on the same subset, demonstrating better balance of accuracy and efficiency for real-time fitness activity recognition.

Conclusion: Demonstrates a scalable, real-time-capable framework for video-based fitness activity recognition that leverages 2D feature extractors and attention-augmented temporal modeling, with potential applications in vision-based health monitoring.

Abstract: Fitness movement recognition, a focused subdomain of human activity
recognition (HAR), plays a vital role in health monitoring, rehabilitation, and
personalized fitness training by enabling automated exercise classification
from video data. However, many existing deep learning approaches rely on
computationally intensive 3D models, limiting their feasibility in real-time or
resource-constrained settings. In this paper, we present a lightweight and
effective framework that integrates pre-trained 2D Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNNs) such as ResNet50, EfficientNet, and Vision Transformers (ViT)
with a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network enhanced by spatial attention.
These models efficiently extract spatial features while the LSTM captures
temporal dependencies, and the attention mechanism emphasizes informative
segments. We evaluate the framework on a curated subset of the UCF101 dataset,
achieving a peak accuracy of 93.34\% with the ResNet50-based configuration.
Comparative results demonstrate the superiority of our approach over several
state-of-the-art HAR systems. The proposed method offers a scalable and
real-time-capable solution for fitness activity recognition with broader
applications in vision-based health and activity monitoring.

*Guyue Hu,Siyuan Song,Jingpeng Sun,Zhe Jin,Chenglong Li,Jin Tang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes MDM-MixMFL, a mix-modal federated learning framework for non-centralized MRI segmentation that decouples modality information into tailored and shared parts and uses a memorizing mechanism to handle incomplete modalities, improving performance across heterogeneous clients.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses severe modality and data heterogeneity in non-centralized multi-modal FL for MRI segmentation; existing MulMFL/CroMFL and centralized methods fail when clients have different modality sets and data distributions.

Method: Introduce mix-modal FL paradigm (MixMFL) and the MDM-MixMFL framework with modality decoupling (modality-tailored and modality-shared encoders) and modality memorizing mechanism that stores prototypes refreshed from tailored encoders; tailored/shared updating during aggregation; prototypes help with incomplete modalities.

Result: Extensive experiments on two public MRI datasets show improved segmentation performance and robustness over baselines (improved aggregation, stability, adaptability).

Conclusion: MDM-MixMFL effectively enables stable, adaptive mix-modal FL for MRI segmentation in non-centralized heterogeneous scenarios, offering a viable path for real-world multi-institution collaborative learning.

Abstract: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) image segmentation is crucial in diagnosing
and treating many diseases, such as brain tumors. Existing MRI image
segmentation methods mainly fall into a centralized multimodal paradigm, which
is inapplicable in engineering non-centralized mix-modal medical scenarios. In
this situation, each distributed client (hospital) processes multiple mixed MRI
modalities, and the modality set and image data for each client are diverse,
suffering from extensive client-wise modality heterogeneity and data
heterogeneity. In this paper, we first formulate non-centralized mix-modal MRI
image segmentation as a new paradigm for federated learning (FL) that involves
multiple modalities, called mix-modal federated learning (MixMFL). It
distinguishes from existing multimodal federating learning (MulMFL) and
cross-modal federating learning (CroMFL) paradigms. Then, we proposed a novel
modality decoupling and memorizing mix-modal federated learning framework
(MDM-MixMFL) for MRI image segmentation, which is characterized by a modality
decoupling strategy and a modality memorizing mechanism. Specifically, the
modality decoupling strategy disentangles each modality into modality-tailored
and modality-shared information. During mix-modal federated updating,
corresponding modality encoders undergo tailored and shared updating,
respectively. It facilitates stable and adaptive federating aggregation of
heterogeneous data and modalities from distributed clients. Besides, the
modality memorizing mechanism stores client-shared modality prototypes
dynamically refreshed from every modality-tailored encoder to compensate for
incomplete modalities in each local client. It further benefits modality
aggregation and fusion processes during mixmodal federated learning. Extensive
experiments on two public datasets for MRI image segmentation demonstrate the
effectiveness and superiority of our methods.

*Xinrui Gong,Oliver Hahn,Christoph Reich,Krishnakant Singh,Simone Schaub-Meyer,Daniel Cremers,Stefan Roth*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MR-DINOSAUR is a minimal unsupervised approach that extends the pre-trained OCL model DINOSAUR for multi-object discovery by using motion-based pseudo labels from frames with no camera motion, refining slot representations and a slot-deactivation module, achieving state-of-the-art results on TRI-PD and KITTI without supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Unsupervised multi-object discovery currently relies on supervision or labeled pseudo-labels to train object-centric learning models. There is a need for fully unsupervised methods that can discover and localize distinct objects using motion cues alone.

Method: Start from a self-supervised pre-trained OCL model (DINOSAUR). Retrieve video frames with no camera motion and perform motion segmentation via unsupervised optical flow to generate high-quality pseudo labels. Use these labels to refine DINOSAUR's slot representations and train a slot deactivation module that assigns slots to foreground vs. background, enabling multi-object discovery without supervision.

Result: MR-DINOSAUR achieves strong multi-object discovery performance on the TRI-PD and KITTI datasets and outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods while remaining fully unsupervised.

Conclusion: A simple yet effective unsupervised MOD framework that leverages motion-based pseudo labeling to refine slot-based object representations, demonstrating competitive results without human supervision.

Abstract: Unsupervised multi-object discovery (MOD) aims to detect and localize
distinct object instances in visual scenes without any form of human
supervision. Recent approaches leverage object-centric learning (OCL) and
motion cues from video to identify individual objects. However, these
approaches use supervision to generate pseudo labels to train the OCL model. We
address this limitation with MR-DINOSAUR -- Motion-Refined DINOSAUR -- a
minimalistic unsupervised approach that extends the self-supervised pre-trained
OCL model, DINOSAUR, to the task of unsupervised multi-object discovery. We
generate high-quality unsupervised pseudo labels by retrieving video frames
without camera motion for which we perform motion segmentation of unsupervised
optical flow. We refine DINOSAUR's slot representations using these pseudo
labels and train a slot deactivation module to assign slots to foreground and
background. Despite its conceptual simplicity, MR-DINOSAUR achieves strong
multi-object discovery results on the TRI-PD and KITTI datasets, outperforming
the previous state of the art despite being fully unsupervised.

*You Shen,Zhipeng Zhang,Yansong Qu,Liujuan Cao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FastVGGT introduces a training-free token merging strategy tailored for 3D vision transformers, achieving significant speedups (4x with 1000 input images) while reducing error accumulation and preserving reconstruction ability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Scaling foundation models for 3D vision to long-sequence inputs is hampered by inference-time inefficiency. Observations of VGGT bottlenecks and token collapse in attention maps motivate a decomposition strategy that eliminates redundant computation without sacrificing 3D reconstruction quality.

Method: Propose FastVGGT, a training-free token merging framework for 3D VGGT. It uses a novel token partitioning strategy designed for 3D architectures and tasks, enabling selective merging to remove redundancy while maintaining reconstruction capability.

Result: Extensive experiments on multiple 3D geometry benchmarks show 4x speedup with 1000 input images and reduced error accumulation in long-sequence scenarios; code is provided.

Conclusion: Token merging is a principled approach to scale 3D vision systems, and tailoring merging strategies to 3D architectures yields practical gains without additional training.

Abstract: Foundation models for 3D vision have recently demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in 3D perception. However, scaling these models to long-sequence
image inputs remains a significant challenge due to inference-time
inefficiency. In this work, we present a detailed analysis of VGGT, a
state-of-the-art feed-forward visual geometry model and identify its primary
bottleneck. Visualization further reveals a token collapse phenomenon in the
attention maps. Motivated by these findings, we explore the potential of token
merging in the feed-forward visual geometry model. Owing to the unique
architectural and task-specific properties of 3D models, directly applying
existing merging techniques proves challenging. To this end, we propose
FastVGGT, which, for the first time, leverages token merging in the 3D domain
through a training-free mechanism for accelerating VGGT. we devise a unique
token partitioning strategy tailored to 3D architectures and tasks, effectively
eliminating redundant computation while preserving VGGT's powerful
reconstruction capacity. Extensive experiments on multiple 3D geometry
benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our approach. Notably, with 1000 input
images, FastVGGT achieves a 4x speedup over VGGT while mitigating error
accumulation in long-sequence scenarios. These findings underscore the
potential of token merging as a principled solution for scalable 3D vision
systems. Code is available at: https://mystorm16.github.io/fastvggt/.

### [214] [Outer Contour-driven Ruled Surface Generation for Linear Hot-wire Rough Machining](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00840)
*Zheng Zhang,Kang Wu,Yi-Fei Li,Xu Liu,Xiang Wang,Ligang Liu,Xiao-Ming Fu*

Main category: cs.CG

TL;DR: Generates non-colliding ruled surfaces via iterative, view-guided extrusion for linear hot-wire rough machining, using a genetic-algorithm-based viewpoint selection and adaptive curve fitting to improve material removal with fewer cuts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of producing collision-free, efficient tooling surfaces (ruled surfaces) for rough machining, reducing errors and improving material removal using fewer passes.

Method: An iterative algorithm alternates between selecting a viewpoint to define an outer contour line and optimizing a smooth planar curve to approximate that contour under collision-free constraints. Viewpoint optimization uses a genetic algorithm; curve fitting is adaptive to satisfy collision constraints. The surfaces are generated by vertical extrusion from planar curves that approach the outer contour lines while avoiding collisions.

Result: Validated on 10 physical examples; the proposed method achieves lower errors than manual designs for the same number of cuts, demonstrating feasibility and practicality.

Conclusion: The approach provides a feasible and practical workflow for collision-free, efficient rough machining using a small set of ruled surfaces, with potential for automation via genetic algorithms and adaptive contour-fitting.

Abstract: We propose a novel method to generate a small set of ruled surfaces that do
not collide with the input shape for linear hot-wire rough machining. Central
to our technique is a new observation: the ruled surfaces constructed by
vertical extrusion from planar smooth curves, which approach the input shape's
outer contour lines while having no collisions, are capable of removing
materials effectively during rough machining. Accordingly, we develop an
iterative algorithm that alternates in each iteration between computing a
viewpoint to determine an outer contour line and optimizing a smooth curve to
approximate that contour line under the collision-free constraint.
Specifically, a view selection approach based on genetic algorithm is used to
optimize the viewpoint for removing materials as much as possible, and present
an adaptive algorithm to find the constrained curves. The feasibility and
practicability of our method are demonstrated through 10 physical examples.
Compared with manual designs, our method obtains lower errors with the same
number of cuts.

### [215] [The Price of Connectivity Augmentation on Planar Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01096)
*Hugo A. Akitaya,Justin Dallant,Erik D. Demaine,Michael Kaufmann,Linda Kleist,Frederick Stock,Csaba D. Tóth,Torsten Ueckerdt*

Main category: cs.CG

TL;DR: This work studies c-to-k connectivity augmentation across several graph classes, proving NP-completeness for 2 ≤ c < k ≤ 5 in planar/plane/planar straight-line graphs, extending to arbitrary k for beyond-planar targets, and linking to edge flips in triangulations with an NP-hard minimum flip distance to a 4-connected triangulation, for which an EPTAS is provided.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understand the computational limits of augmenting graph connectivity with a small edge set in natural geometric and topological graph classes, and connect augmentation problems to triangulations and flips.

Method: Provide NP-hardness reductions for c→k augmentation in planar/plane/planar straight-line settings (2 ≤ c < k ≤ 5); generalize to arbitrary k when the target class is beyond-planar (ℓ-planar, ℓ-plane topological/ geometric graphs), derive tight k vs. local crossing number ℓ bounds, and show hardness results carry over; relate augmentation to minimum flip distance in triangulations and devise an EPTAS for the latter.

Result: NP-completeness of c→k augmentation for the specified ranges (2 ≤ c < k ≤ 5) in planar-related classes; augmented connectivity bound by planar targets is at most 5; extension to arbitrary k for beyond-planar targets with ℓ-crossing constraints and corresponding hardness; NP-complete to compute minimum flip distance to achieve 4-connectivity in triangulations, with an EPTAS.

Conclusion: Connectivity augmentation remains computationally hard in natural geometric/topological graph families, even under planar constraints, while some related problems (flip-distance to 4-connected triangulations) admit approximation schemes, highlighting a nuanced landscape between planarity, crossing constraints, and network augmentation.

Abstract: Given two classes of graphs, $\mathcal{G}_1\subseteq \mathcal{G}_2$, and a
$c$-connected graph $G\in \mathcal{G}_1$, we wish to augment $G$ with a
smallest cardinality set of new edges $F$ to obtain a $k$-connected graph
$G'=(V,E\cup F) \in \mathcal{G}_2$. In general, this is the $c\to k$
connectivity augmentation problem. Previous research considered variants where
$\mathcal{G}_1=\mathcal{G}_2$ is the class of planar graphs, plane graphs, or
planar straight-line graphs. In all three settings, we prove that the $c\to k$
augmentation problem is NP-complete when $2\leq c<k\leq 5$.
  However, the connectivity of the augmented graph $G'$ is at most $5$ if
$\mathcal{G}_2$ is limited to planar graphs. We initiate the study of the $c\to
k$ connectivity augmentation problem for arbitrary $k\in \mathbb{N}$, where
$\mathcal{G}_1$ is the class of planar graphs, plane graphs, or planar
straight-line graphs, and $\mathcal{G}_2$ is a beyond-planar class of graphs:
$\ell$-planar, $\ell$-plane topological, or $\ell$-plane geometric graphs. We
obtain tight bounds on the tradeoffs between the desired connectivity $k$ and
the local crossing number $\ell$ of the augmented graph $G'$. We also show that
our hardness results apply to this setting.
  The connectivity augmentation problem for triangulations is intimately
related to edge flips; and the minimum augmentation problem to the flip
distance between triangulations. We prove that it is NP-complete to find the
minimum flip distance between a given triangulation and a 4-connected
triangulation, settling an open problem posed in 2014, and present an EPTAS for
this problem.

### [216] [Near-Optimal Dynamic Steiner Spanners for Constant-Curvature Spaces](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01443)
*Sándor Kisfaludi-Bak,Geert van Wordragen*

Main category: cs.CG

TL;DR: We construct Steiner (1+ε)-spanners in d-dimensional Euclidean, spherical, and hyperbolic spaces with size O_d(ε^{(1-d)/2} log(1/ε) n), nearly optimal and using simple quadtrees that support dynamic maintenance. We also obtain tight 2-spanner results in hyperbolic spaces (Ω(n log n) lower bound; O_d(n log n) upper bound in d-d hyperbolic space), and an additive-error Steiner spanner with polylog factors. Techniques extend to constant-curvature surfaces and some quotient spaces.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Steiner spanners are a fundamental tool for sparse geometric networks and have applications to dynamic approximate nearest neighbor queries and closest-pair problems. Extending near-optimal spanners to non-Euclidean geometries and providing dynamic constructions fills gaps in our understanding and broadens practical applicability across curvature settings.

Method: Develop Steiner spanners via simple quadtrees generalized to curved geometries (Euclidean, spherical, hyperbolic) and their dynamic maintenance. Analyze size bounds to achieve (1+ε)-spanners with n·polylog(1/ε) edges. Prove hyperbolic 2-spanner lower bounds and match with O(n log n) constructions for constant-dim hyperbolic spaces. Extend to additive-error variants with log(α(n)/ε) factors and to broader spaces.

Result: Steiner (1+ε)-spanners of size O_d(ε^{(1-d)/2} log(1/ε) n) in Euclidean, spherical, and hyperbolic d-space. For hyperbolic plane, a Ω(n log n) lower bound for 2-spanners and a matching O_d(n log n) upper bound in d-dimensional hyperbolic space; additive-error Steiner spanners with size O_d(ε^{(1-d)/2} log(α(n)/ε) n). Dynamic maintenance enabled by the quadtree-based construction; results extend to constant-curvature surfaces.

Conclusion: The quadtree-based approach yields near-optimal Steiner spanners across constant-curvature geometries, with dynamic maintenance and applicability to dynamic data-structure problems. The techniques generalize to constant-curvature surfaces and certain quotient spaces, highlighting robustness across geometric settings.

Abstract: We consider Steiner spanners in Euclidean and non-Euclidean geometries. In
the Euclidean setting, a recent line of work initiated by Le and Solomon
[FOCS'19] and further improved by Chang et al. [SoCG'24] obtained Steiner
$(1+\varepsilon)$-spanners of size
$O_d(\varepsilon^{(1-d)/2}\log(1/\varepsilon)n)$, nearly matching the lower
bounds of Bhore and T\'oth [SIDMA'22].
  We obtain Steiner $(1+\varepsilon)$-spanners of size
$O_d(\varepsilon^{(1-d)/2}\log(1/\varepsilon)n)$ not only in $d$-dimensional
Euclidean space, but also in $d$-dimensional spherical and hyperbolic space.
For any fixed dimension $d$, the obtained edge count is optimal up to an
$O(\log(1/\varepsilon))$ factor in each of these spaces. Unlike earlier
constructions, our Steiner spanners are based on simple quadtrees, and they can
be dynamically maintained, leading to efficient data structures for dynamic
approximate nearest neighbours and bichromatic closest pair.
  In the hyperbolic setting, we also show that $2$-spanners in the hyperbolic
plane must have $\Omega(n\log n)$ edges, and we obtain a $2$-spanner of size
$O_d(n\log n)$ in $d$-dimensional hyperbolic space, matching our lower bound
for any constant $d$. Finally, we give a Steiner spanner with additive error
$\varepsilon$ in hyperbolic space with
$O_d(\varepsilon^{(1-d)/2}\log(\alpha(n)/\varepsilon)n)$ edges, where
$\alpha(n)$ is the inverse Ackermann function.
  Our techniques generalize to closed orientable surfaces of constant curvature
as well as to some quotient spaces.

### [217] [Arcs with increasing chords in $\mathbf{R}^d$](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01580)
*Adrian Dumitrescu,Zsolt Lángi*

Main category: cs.CG

TL;DR: Generalizes the increasing chord property to R^d; (I) gives a high-dimensional length bound L ≤ 2 * (e/2 * (d+4))^{d-1} * |st| for d≥3; (II) gives a subquadratic-time algorithm to test the property for polygonal chains in R^d (d≥4).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extend the known planar result on increasing chords to higher dimensions and study both the geometric length bound and the algorithmic recognition of the property.

Method: (I) Prove a dimension-dependent bound on the length of s-t curves with increasing chords, yielding L ≤ 2 * (e/2 * (d+4))^{d-1} * |st| for d≥3 (first higher-dimensional bound). (II) For a polygonal chain P in R^d with d≥4 and k=floor(d/2), design and analyze a randomized/average-case procedure to test the increasing chord property in O(n^{2-1/(k+1)} polylog n) time (first subquadratic in higher dimensions).

Result: (I) Provides the first length bound in higher dimensions for curves with the increasing chord property. (II) Provides the first subquadratic-time algorithm to test the increasing chord property in higher dimensions.

Conclusion: The increasing chord property imposes a dimension-dependent bound on curve length and permits efficient recognition in high dimensions, extending planar results and enabling practical higher-dimensional geometric analysis.

Abstract: A curve $\gamma$ that connects $s$ and $t$ has the increasing chord property
if $|bc| \leq |ad|$ whenever $a,b,c,d$ lie in that order on $\gamma$. For
planar curves, the length of such a curve is known to be at most $2\pi/3 \cdot
|st|$. Here we examine the question in higher dimensions and from the
algorithmic standpoint and show the following:
  (I) The length of any $s-t$ curve with increasing chords in $\mathbf{R}^d$ is
at most $2 \cdot \left( e/2 \cdot (d+4) \right)^{d-1} \cdot |st|$ for every $d
\geq 3$. This is the first bound in higher dimensions.
  (II) Given a polygonal chain $P=(p_1, p_2, \dots, p_n)$ in $\mathbf{R}^d$,
where $d \geq 4$, $k =\lfloor d/2 \rfloor$, it can be tested whether it
satisfies the increasing chord property in $O\left(n^{2-1/(k+1)} {\rm polylog}
(n) \right)$ expected time. This is the first subquadratic algorithm in higher
dimensions.

*Eric Zhang,Li Wei,Sarah Chen,Michael Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A systematic comparative analysis of four dysfluency detection approaches (YOLO-Stutter, FluentNet, UDM, and SSDM) across performance, controllability, and explainability. UDM offers the best balance of accuracy and clinical interpretability; YOLO-Stutter and FluentNet are efficient but less transparent; SSDM could not be fully reproduced in the authors' experiments; the work provides implementation insights and deployment considerations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clinical adoption of dysfluency models requires not only high accuracy but also controllability and explainability. The paper evaluates a representative set of modeling paradigms to understand trade-offs among performance, interpretability, and reproducibility.

Method: A systematic comparative evaluation of four representative approaches (YOLO-Stutter, FluentNet, UDM, SSDM) on multiple datasets, combined with expert clinician assessments, focusing on performance, controllability, and explainability. The authors also provide detailed implementation insights and deployment considerations.

Result: Findings indicate YOLO-Stutter and FluentNet are efficient and simple but offer limited transparency; UDM achieves the best balance between accuracy and clinical interpretability; SSDM shows promise but could not be fully reproduced in the experiments.

Conclusion: There are meaningful trade-offs among competing approaches. The study highlights directions for clinically viable dysfluency modeling, emphasizing explainability and reproducibility. UDM emerges as a favorable option for clinical interpretability, while SSDM requires improved reproducibility; the paper also offers practical deployment guidance.

Abstract: Recent advances in dysfluency detection have introduced a variety of modeling
paradigms, ranging from lightweight object-detection inspired networks
(YOLOStutter) to modular interpretable frameworks (UDM). While performance on
benchmark datasets continues to improve, clinical adoption requires more than
accuracy: models must be controllable and explainable. In this paper, we
present a systematic comparative analysis of four representative
approaches--YOLO-Stutter, FluentNet, UDM, and SSDM--along three dimensions:
performance, controllability, and explainability. Through comprehensive
evaluation on multiple datasets and expert clinician assessment, we find that
YOLO-Stutter and FluentNet provide efficiency and simplicity, but with limited
transparency; UDM achieves the best balance of accuracy and clinical
interpretability; and SSDM, while promising, could not be fully reproduced in
our experiments. Our analysis highlights the trade-offs among competing
approaches and identifies future directions for clinically viable dysfluency
modeling. We also provide detailed implementation insights and practical
deployment considerations for each approach.

*Terry Jingchen Zhang,Gopal Dev,Ning Wang,Nicole Ni,Wenyuan Jiang,Yinya Huang,Bernhard Schölkopf,Mrinmaya Sachan,Zhijing Jin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Synthesizes research-level QA from arXiv to test LLMs around knowledge cutoffs; finds no clear post-cutoff decay; argues reasoning-based benchmarks mitigate data contamination; open-sources data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Data-contamination concerns in static benchmarks and memorization; uses arXiv's temporal structure to distinguish genuine reasoning from memorization; contrasts with prior studies showing decay when using directly retrieved public data; proposes multi-step reasoning as a robustness mechanism.

Method: Infinitely scalable QA synthesis pipeline drawing from 20,277 arXiv papers to generate 1,643 multi-step questions over 26 months; evaluates 4 frontier models (two models per family with different knowledge cutoffs); analyzes performance before and after cutoff dates and compares with previous longitudinal studies.

Result: No significant post-cutoff performance decay observed across models/sizes. Prior studies showing decay with retrieved data differ; multi-step reasoning appears to add complexity beyond memorization, potentially mitigating contamination. Code and dataset are fully open-sourced.

Conclusion: Advocates a paradigm shift toward reasoning-driven, synthesis-based benchmarks rather than periodic collection of new questions; emphasizes reproducibility and proposes that benchmarks should test reasoning depth to guard against data contamination.

Abstract: Capability evaluation of large language models (LLMs) is increasingly
shadowed by rising concerns of data contamination that cast doubts on whether
static benchmarks measure genuine reasoning or mere memorization. We present an
empirical study using an infinitely scalable framework to synthesize
research-level QA directly from arXiv papers, harnessing the natural temporal
structure of research publications where performance decay after knowledge
cutoffs may indicate potential contamination. We evaluated 4 frontier model
represented by 2 models of different knowledge cutoff dates per family on 1,643
multi-step reasoning questions synthesized from 20,277 arXiv papers stratified
over 26 months, covering at least 6 months before and after all cutoff dates.
Our results consistently showed a lack of significant performance decay near
knowledge cutoff dates for models of various sizes, developers, and release
dates. We further performed a comparative analysis with previous longitudinal
studies that reported significant post-cutoff performance decay using directly
retrieved questions based on public data. we hypothesize that the multi-step
reasoning required by our synthesis pipeline offered additional complexity that
goes deeper than shallow memorization, which effectively serves a mitigation
strategy against benchmark contamination. We fully open source our code and
dataset to aid reproducibility and advocate for a paradigm shift that
prioritize reasoning-driven synthesis to construct benchmarks over simply
collecting newly released questions periodically.

*Cédric Colas,Tracey Mills,Ben Prystawski,Michael Henry Tessler,Noah Goodman,Jacob Andreas,Joshua Tenenbaum*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A framework that treats social learning as Bayesian inference over structured world models, using a pretrained language model to generate and interpret advice, showing linguistic guidance accelerates learning and enables cross-generational transfer in humans and AI across video games.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and enable how linguistic guidance can be integrated with direct sensorimotor experience to support safe, rapid learning, and to transfer this capability to AI systems.

Method: Develop a probabilistic framework that turns a pretrained language model into a model of how humans share advice conditioned on beliefs; perform joint inference over sensorimotor and linguistic data; conduct behavioral experiments and simulations across 10 video games; include iterated learning experiments to study knowledge accumulation and transfer between humans and models.

Result: Linguistic guidance influences exploration, reduces risky interactions, and speeds up key discoveries in both humans and models; knowledge can accumulate across generations; successful transfer of knowledge between humans and models demonstrates potential for language-enabled, human-machine collaborative learning.

Conclusion: Structured, language-compatible representations enable effective human-machine collaboration and scalable knowledge transfer; the framework suggests a path toward robust, safe, and accelerated learning in AI systems through social guidance.

Abstract: The ability to combine linguistic guidance from others with direct experience
is central to human development, enabling safe and rapid learning in new
environments. How do people integrate these two sources of knowledge, and how
might AI systems? We present a computational framework that models social
learning as joint probabilistic inference over structured, executable world
models given sensorimotor and linguistic data. We make this possible by turning
a pretrained language model into a probabilistic model of how humans share
advice conditioned on their beliefs, allowing our agents both to generate
advice for others and to interpret linguistic input as evidence during Bayesian
inference. Using behavioral experiments and simulations across 10 video games,
we show how linguistic guidance can shape exploration and accelerate learning
by reducing risky interactions and speeding up key discoveries in both humans
and models. We further explore how knowledge can accumulate across generations
through iterated learning experiments and demonstrate successful knowledge
transfer between humans and models -- revealing how structured,
language-compatible representations might enable human-machine collaborative
learning.

*Andrew G. A. Correa,Ana C. H de Matos*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Entropy-guided refinement uses a lightweight test-time loop to trigger a single targeted refinement pass based on token-level uncertainty, delivering near-reasoning-model quality at a fraction of the cost by selectively refining about a third of responses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To close the gap between low-cost single-pass inference and expensive multi-step reasoning chains by leveraging uncertainty signals to guide targeted edits, enabling practical production deployment with improved accuracy and reduced latency.

Method: Compute token-level logprobs on top-k alternatives, derive Shannon entropy, and trigger an OR-based decision using perplexity, maximum token entropy, and low-confidence-token count. Return a compact uncertainty report (tokens, confidences, alternatives, context) to the model to perform a single targeted refinement pass rather than full reasoning chains.

Result: A small model with the loop reaches ~95% of a reference reasoning model's quality at ~1/3 of the cost. Selective refinement occurs on ~31% of responses, with a 16-point accuracy gain over single-pass inference.

Conclusion: Uncertainty-aware refinement provides a practical middle ground between single-pass inference and expensive reasoning chains, balancing quality and cost for production deployments.

Abstract: Reasoning models often outperform smaller models but at 3--5$\times$ higher
cost and added latency. We present entropy-guided refinement: a lightweight,
test-time loop that uses token-level uncertainty to trigger a single, targeted
refinement pass. We extract logprobs, compute Shannon entropy on top-$k$
alternatives, and apply a simple OR-logic trigger over perplexity, maximum
token entropy, and low-confidence-token count. Unlike approaches that use
entropy only for measurement or decoding, we pass a compact uncertainty report
(tokens, confidences, alternatives, context) back to the model to guide
corrective edits. On representative technical queries across reasoning,
mathematics, and code generation tasks, a small model with our loop approaches
95\% of a reference reasoning model's quality at approximately one-third of the
cost. The method achieves selective refinement on ~31\% of responses while
improving accuracy by 16 percentage points over single-pass inference. We
demonstrate that this uncertainty-aware loop provides an effective middle
ground between single-pass inference and expensive reasoning chains, making it
practical for production deployments where both quality and cost matter.

*David Freire-Obregón*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Perceptual accuracy in emotion recognition among agent populations critically shapes emergent social dynamics; misperception undermines trust and cohesion, while higher accuracy supports robust emotional clusters and resilience.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how perceptual biases in emotion decoding influence collective behavior and social structure under emotional shocks.

Method: Agents on a 2D torus with face photos from KDEF; three classifiers trained on JAFFE (poor), CK+ (medium), or KDEF (high); local perception of neighbors' emotion; movement toward perceived positive emotions, away from perceived negative; misperception vs ground-truth; experiments with homogeneous/heterogeneous populations and repeated emotional shocks.

Result: Low-accuracy agents show diminished trust, widespread sadness, disordered social organization; high-accuracy agents form stable emotional clusters and resilience; misperception alone can cause segregation even in neutral scenarios.

Conclusion: Biased or imprecise emotion recognition can substantially distort social processes and hinder emotional integration.

Abstract: The ability of humans to detect and respond to others' emotions is
fundamental to understanding social behavior. Here, agents are instantiated
with emotion classifiers of varying accuracy to study the impact of perceptual
accuracy on emergent emotional and spatial behavior. Agents are visually
represented with face photos from the KDEF database and endowed with one of
three classifiers trained on the JAFFE (poor), CK+ (medium), or KDEF (high)
datasets. Agents communicate locally on a 2D toroidal lattice, perceiving
neighbors' emotional state based on their classifier and responding with
movement toward perceived positive emotions and away from perceived negative
emotions. Note that the agents respond to perceived, instead of ground-truth,
emotions, introducing systematic misperception and frustration. A battery of
experiments is carried out on homogeneous and heterogeneous populations and
scenarios with repeated emotional shocks. Results show that low-accuracy
classifiers on the part of the agent reliably result in diminished trust,
emotional disintegration into sadness, and disordered social organization. By
contrast, the agent that develops high accuracy develops hardy emotional
clusters and resilience to emotional disruptions. Even in emotionally neutral
scenarios, misperception is enough to generate segregation and disintegration
of cohesion. These findings underscore the fact that biases or imprecision in
emotion recognition may significantly warp social processes and disrupt
emotional integration.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As LLMs are used in high-stakes decisions, aligning behavior with human values while enabling reproducibility is crucial; proprietary APIs hinder participation; evaluating ensemble debates as a scalable, open framework could improve alignment.

Method: Study of 150 debates across 15 scenarios and 5 ensemble configurations; compared ensembles to single-model baselines using a 7-point rubric; measured overall score and subdimensions; released code, prompts, and debate dataset.

Result: Ensembles outperform baselines on overall rubric (3.48 vs 3.13). Largest gains in reasoning depth (+19.4%), argument quality (+34.1%). Improvements strongest for truthfulness (+1.25 points) and human enhancement (+0.80).

Conclusion: Open-source ensemble debates provide a reproducible foundation for evaluating and improving alignment-oriented reasoning in LLMs; supports broader participation and rigorous alignment research.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) take on greater roles in high-stakes
decisions, alignment with human values is essential. Reliance on proprietary
APIs limits reproducibility and broad participation. We study whether local
open-source ensemble debates can improve alignmentoriented reasoning. Across

outperform single-model baselines on a 7-point rubric (overall: 3.48 vs. 3.13),
with the largest gains in reasoning depth (+19.4%) and argument quality
(+34.1%). Improvements are strongest for truthfulness (+1.25 points) and human
enhancement (+0.80). We provide code, prompts, and a debate data set, providing

### [224] [MODE: Mixture of Document Experts for RAG](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00100)
*Rahul Anand*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MODE offers a lightweight alternative to RAG by clustering documents and routing queries to relevant clusters, achieving fast retrieval on small corpora while maintaining answer quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RAG systems often rely on large vector databases and cross-encoders trained on large corpora, which is excessive for small, domain-specific collections. There is a need for a simpler, faster, and more storage-efficient retrieval mechanism that preserves accuracy.

Method: Documents are embedded and grouped into semantically coherent clusters; each cluster is represented by a cached centroid. At query time, the system routes to the top centroid(s) and retrieves context only within those clusters, avoiding external vector stores and re-ranking. This yields low latency with no external infrastructure.

Result: On HotpotQA and SQuAD corpora with 100-500 chunks, MODE matches or surpasses a dense-retrieval baseline in answer quality while reducing end-to-end retrieval time. Ablations show that cluster granularity and multi-cluster routing control recall/precision trade-offs, and tighter clusters improve downstream accuracy.

Conclusion: MODE provides a practical recipe for small and medium corpora where simplicity, speed, and topical focus matter, offering an effective alternative to full-scale RAG pipelines without sacrificing accuracy.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) often relies on large vector databases
and cross-encoders tuned for large-scale corpora, which can be excessive for
small, domain-specific collections. We present MODE (Mixture of Document
Experts), a lightweight alternative that replaces fine-grained nearest-neighbor
search with cluster-and-route retrieval. Documents are embedded, grouped into
semantically coherent clusters, and represented by cached centroids. At query
time, we route to the top centroid(s) and retrieve context only within those
clusters, eliminating external vector-database infrastructure and reranking
while keeping latency low. On HotpotQA and SQuAD corpora with 100-500 chunks,
MODE matches or exceeds a dense-retrieval baseline in answer quality while
reducing end-to-end retrieval time. Ablations show that cluster granularity and
multi-cluster routing control the recall/precision trade-off, and that tighter
clusters improve downstream accuracy. MODE offers a practical recipe for small
and medium corpora where simplicity, speed, and topical focus matter.

TL;DR: This paper introduces Adaptive Multi-Dimensional Monitoring (AMDM) for agentic AI, linking multi-axis evaluation with an algorithm that normalizes metrics and detects anomalies; it improves detection latency and reduces false positives in simulations and real-world tests, and provides reproducibility resources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Evaluation of agentic AI is dominated by capability metrics; there is a gap in algorithmic instantiation and empirical evidence for monitoring multi-axis safety/economic impact; need for systematic anomaly detection across heterogeneous metrics.

Method: Formalize AMDM: normalize heterogeneous metrics; apply per-axis exponentially weighted moving-average thresholds; perform joint anomaly detection via Mahalanobis distance; assess on benchmarks and deployments; provide ROC/PR analyses; include code/data and reproducibility checklist.

Result: AMDM reduces anomaly-detection latency from 12.3 s to 5.6 s; false positives drop from 4.5% to 0.9% compared with static thresholds; supported by simulations and real-world experiments; 84 papers reviewed show 83% report capability metrics and 30% consider human-centered/economic axes.

Conclusion: AMDM offers a practical, scalable approach to monitoring agentic AI across multiple axes; highlights need for broader evaluation axes beyond capability; emphasizes reproducibility and surface-murface metrics; invites adoption and further experimentation.

Abstract: Agentic artificial intelligence (AI) -- multi-agent systems that combine
large language models with external tools and autonomous planning -- are
rapidly transitioning from research laboratories into high-stakes domains. Our
earlier "Basic" paper introduced a five-axis framework and proposed preliminary
metrics such as goal drift and harm reduction but did not provide an
algorithmic instantiation or empirical evidence. This "Advanced" sequel fills
that gap. First, we revisit recent benchmarks and industrial deployments to
show that technical metrics still dominate evaluations: a systematic review of
84 papers from 2023--2025 found that 83% report capability metrics while only
30% consider human-centred or economic axes [2]. Second, we formalise an
Adaptive Multi-Dimensional Monitoring (AMDM) algorithm that normalises
heterogeneous metrics, applies per-axis exponentially weighted moving-average
thresholds and performs joint anomaly detection via the Mahalanobis distance.
Third, we conduct simulations and real-world experiments. AMDM cuts
anomaly-detection latency from 12.3 s to 5.6 s on simulated goal drift and
reduces false-positive rates from 4.5% to 0.9% compared with static thresholds.
We present a comparison table and ROC/PR curves, and we reanalyse case studies
to surface missing metrics. Code, data and a reproducibility checklist
accompany this paper to facilitate replication.

### [226] [Know When to Explore: Difficulty-Aware Certainty as a Guide for LLM Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00125)
*Ang Li,Zhihang Yuan,Yang Zhang,Shouda Liu,Yisen Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DACE is a reinforcement learning algorithm for LLM reasoning that uses self-assessed certainty as an intrinsic signal to balance exploration and exploitation. It dynamically estimates task difficulty from the policy’s success rate and modulates intrinsic rewards: encourage exploration (lower certainty) on hard tasks and encourage efficient learning (higher certainty) on easy tasks. It yields improved accuracy and robustness on challenging mathematical benchmarks (AIME, MATH) and scales well with more compute.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sparse, outcome-based rewards in RL for LLMs provide limited guidance on reasoning quality and process, making learning inefficient. There is a signal—the model’s self-certainty—that correlates with task difficulty and solution quality, which can be exploited to provide denser feedback.

Method: Introduce Difficulty Aware Certainty guided Exploration (DACE). Online estimation of task difficulty via the policy’s success rate. Use this difficulty signal to modulate an intrinsic reward: for difficult tasks, penalize high certainty to encourage exploration; for easy tasks, reward high certainty to reinforce good solutions. Apply within an RL framework to improve reasoning on challenging benchmarks.

Result: On math reasoning benchmarks (AIME, MATH), DACE outperforms strong baselines, achieving higher accuracy and showing more robust performance when test-time compute is scaled.

Conclusion: Adaptive, certainty-aware intrinsic rewards enable more effective exploration without sacrificing precision, improving LLM reasoning on challenging tasks via DACE.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Feedback (RLVF) has become a key
technique for enhancing the reasoning abilities of Large Language Models
(LLMs). However, its reliance on sparse, outcome based rewards, which only
indicate if a final answer is correct or not, fails to provide granular
guidance on the reasoning process itself. This limitation hinders efficient
learning, as the model cannot distinguish between high quality and inefficient
solutions, nor can it learn effectively from different types of failures. To
address this, we observe that an LLMs self-certainty often correlates with task
difficulty and solution quality. We introduce Difficulty Aware Certainty guided
Exploration (DACE), a novel RL algorithm that leverages this insight to
dynamically balance the exploration exploitation trade-off. DACE assesses task
difficulty online based on the policys success rate. It then uses this signal
to modulate an intrinsic reward: for difficult tasks where the model is
struggling, DACE encourages exploration by penalizing high certainty; for
easier tasks, it encourages learning efficiency by rewarding high certainty.
Experiments on challenging mathematical reasoning benchmarks (AIME, MATH) show
that DACE significantly outperforms strong baselines. The DACE-trained models
not only achieve higher accuracy but also demonstrate more robust performance
when scaling test-time compute, validating that our adaptive approach fosters
effective exploration without sacrificing precision.

*Davin Choo,Yohai Trabelsi,Fentabil Getnet,Samson Warkaye Lamma,Wondesen Nigatu,Kasahun Sime,Lisa Matay,Milind Tambe,Stéphane Verguet*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes Health Access Resource Planner (HARP) for sequential facility planning in Ethiopia, optimizing population coverage under budget uncertainty with regional proportionality targets; introduces a learning-augmented single-step method and a greedy multi-step planner with strong worst-case guarantees; validated in three regions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address Universal Health Coverage (SDG3) by expanding access to essential healthcare through health posts within tight budgets, requiring principled regional prioritization.

Method: Develop HARP optimization framework for sequential facility planning; design two algorithms: (i) a learning-augmented approach improving expert recommendations at a single step, and (ii) a greedy algorithm for multi-step planning; establish strong worst-case approximation guarantees; validate via collaboration with Ethiopian Public Health Institute and Ministry of Health across three regions and multiple scenarios.

Result: Empirical demonstration of efficacy across three regions and various planning scenarios; improved guidance over expert recommendations under budget uncertainty; robust planning with proportionality constraints.

Conclusion: HARP and its algorithms provide a practical decision-support tool for region-wide, budget-constrained health post expansion toward Universal Health Coverage, with demonstrated real-world applicability and potential policy impact.

Abstract: As part of nationwide efforts aligned with the United Nations' Sustainable
Development Goal 3 on Universal Health Coverage, Ethiopia's Ministry of Health
is strengthening health posts to expand access to essential healthcare
services. However, only a fraction of this health system strengthening effort
can be implemented each year due to limited budgets and other competing
priorities, thus the need for an optimization framework to guide prioritization
across the regions of Ethiopia. In this paper, we develop a tool, Health Access
Resource Planner (HARP), based on a principled decision-support optimization
framework for sequential facility planning that aims to maximize population
coverage under budget uncertainty while satisfying region-specific
proportionality targets at every time step. We then propose two algorithms: (i)
a learning-augmented approach that improves upon expert recommendations at any
single-step; and (ii) a greedy algorithm for multi-step planning, both with
strong worst-case approximation estimation. In collaboration with the Ethiopian
Public Health Institute and Ministry of Health, we demonstrated the empirical
efficacy of our method on three regions across various planning scenarios.

### [228] [Virtual Group Knowledge and Group Belief in Topological Evidence Models (Extended Version)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00184)
*Alexandru Baltag,Malvin Gattinger,Djanira Gomes*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Axiomatizes and proves decidability for (hard/soft) group evidence in multi-agent evidence models, analyzes a fragment for group knowledge/belief, and extends to dynamic evidence-sharing operators with axiomatizations showing co-expressiveness with static bases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend topological semantics of evidence-based belief and fallible knowledge from individuals to groups, enabling rigorous analysis of collective epistemic states and the impact of evidence sharing.

Method: Develop topological/group evidence semantics; provide complete axiomatizations for the full group-evidence logic and its knowledge/belief fragment; introduce dynamic evidence-sharing operators; prove completeness and decidability; analyze co-expressiveness of dynamic extensions with static logics.

Result: Complete axiomatizations for hard and soft group evidence and for the group-knowledge/belief fragment; decidability results for these logics; axiomatizations of dynamic evidence-sharing logics; demonstration that dynamic extensions are co-expressive with their static bases.

Conclusion: The paper establishes a solid logical foundation for group epistemic states under evidence-based semantics, showing that both static and dynamic group modalities can be fully axiomatized and decidable, with dynamic sharing not increasing expressive power.

Abstract: We study notions of (virtual) group knowledge and group belief within
multi-agent evidence models, obtained by extending the topological semantics of
evidence-based belief and fallible knowledge from individuals to groups. We
completely axiomatize and show the decidability of the logic of ("hard" and
"soft") group evidence, and do the same for an especially interesting fragment
of it: the logic of group knowledge and group belief. We also extend these
languages with dynamic evidence-sharing operators, and completely axiomatize
the corresponding logics, showing that they are co-expressive with their static
bases.

### [229] [HiVA: Self-organized Hierarchical Variable Agent via Goal-driven Semantic-Topological Evolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00189)
*Jinzhou Tang,Jusheng Zhang,Qinhan Lv,Sidi Liu,Jing Yang,Chengpei Tang,Keze Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: HiVA introduces Hierarchical Variable Agent, a self-organizing workflow framework that optimizes semantic-topological agent structures via the STEV algorithm, using textual gradients as discrete surrogates for backpropagation, achieving improved task accuracy and resource efficiency across diverse benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current agent paradigms force a trade-off between fixed reusable workflows (which lack adaptability) and purely reactive loops (which struggle to distill transferable reasoning into structure). There is a need for scalable, transferable, autonomous task execution in unknown environments.

Method: Model agent workflows as self-organized graphs and optimize hybrid semantic-topological spaces with the STEV algorithm. Use textual gradients as discrete-domain surrogates for backpropagation. The iterative process includes Multi-Armed Bandit–driven forward routing, diagnostic gradient generation from environmental feedback, and coordinated updates that co-evolve semantics and topology.

Result: Empirical evaluations across dialogue, coding, long-context Q&A, mathematical, and agentic benchmarks show 5–10% gains in task accuracy and improved resource efficiency over baselines, indicating HiVA’s effectiveness in autonomous task execution.

Conclusion: HiVA demonstrates a practical path to balancing stable reusable reasoning and flexible adaptation by enabling co-evolution of semantic and topological structures in unknown environments, suggesting strong potential to advance autonomous AGI systems.

Abstract: Autonomous agents play a crucial role in advancing Artificial General
Intelligence, enabling problem decomposition and tool orchestration through
Large Language Models (LLMs). However, existing paradigms face a critical
trade-off. On one hand, reusable fixed workflows require manual reconfiguration
upon environmental changes; on the other hand, flexible reactive loops fail to
distill reasoning progress into transferable structures. We introduce
Hierarchical Variable Agent (HiVA), a novel framework modeling agentic
workflows as self-organized graphs with the Semantic-Topological Evolution
(STEV) algorithm, which optimizes hybrid semantic-topological spaces using
textual gradients as discrete-domain surrogates for backpropagation. The
iterative process comprises Multi-Armed Bandit-infused forward routing,
diagnostic gradient generation from environmental feedback, and coordinated
updates that co-evolve individual semantics and topology for collective
optimization in unknown environments. Experiments on dialogue, coding,
Long-context Q&A, mathematical, and agentic benchmarks demonstrate improvements
of 5-10% in task accuracy and enhanced resource efficiency over existing
baselines, establishing HiVA's effectiveness in autonomous task execution.

### [230] [Universal Deep Research: Bring Your Own Model and Strategy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00244)
*Peter Belcak,Pavlo Molchanov*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: UDR is a generalist agentic system that lets users build customizable deep-research workflows on top of language models, without requiring training or finetuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep research agents are typically fixed to a single strategy and fixed toolsets, which limits adaptability across diverse tasks; there is a need for a flexible, user-definable framework that can compose and refine research strategies.

Method: UDR wraps around any language model and provides interfaces to create, edit, and refine entirely custom deep research strategies. It supports example strategies (minimal, expansive, intensive) and includes a user interface to facilitate experimentation without additional training or finetuning.

Result: The paper demonstrates the generality of UDR by equipping it with example strategies and a UI, illustrating how users can experiment with and deploy diverse research workflows.

Conclusion: UDR enables flexible, trainer-free deep research automation by letting users define their own research strategies and rapidly test them through an accessible interface.

Abstract: Deep research tools are among the most impactful and most commonly
encountered agentic systems today. We observe, however, that each deep research
agent introduced so far is hard-coded to carry out a particular research
strategy using a fixed choice of tools. We introduce Universal Deep Research
(UDR), a generalist agentic system that wraps around any language model and
enables the user to create, edit, and refine their own entirely custom deep
research strategies without any need for additional training or finetuning. To
showcase the generality of our system, we equip UDR with example minimal,
expansive, and intensive research strategies, and provide a user interface to
facilitate experimentation with the system.

### [231] [Instruction-Level Weight Shaping: A Framework for Self-Improving AI Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00251)
*Rimom Costa*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ILWS updates LLM behavior via instruction-space edits guided by a Reflection Engine, enabling adaptive, low-latency reasoning without per-call retrieval.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address stagnation of pre-trained LLMs and limitations of RAG, prompt brittleness, and costly fine-tuning that risks forgetting.

Method: A Reflection Engine inspects conversations, proposes deltas ΔK over instructions, user preferences, and tools. Deltas are version-controlled, rated with a 1-5 star window, auto-repaired on first failure, rolled back on repeated failure. On budget, synthesize a weighted synthetic set and distill matured instruction-space gains into model weights (prompt-space -> weight-space). Governs changes and avoids downtime. Demonstrates enterprise throughput gains and reduced hallucinations.

Result: In enterprise support: throughput 2.4-5.0x and ~80% reduction in audited hallucinations vs frozen baseline. Adobe Commerce Cloud proof-of-concept: 4-5x more tickets/hour; ~80% lower time/ticket; autonomous instruction updates and tool synthesis. Generalizes to dynamic domains.

Conclusion: ILWS offers low-latency, auditable, governance-preserving adaptation at the instruction layer, enabling dynamic domain adaptation without retrieval; potential broad applicability but requires robust Reflection Engine and governance checks.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are fluent but largely static after
pre-training; new or shifting knowledge is typically added with
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) or fine-tuning. RAG raises latency and
engineering overhead and often fails to integrate facts; prompt engineering is
brittle and can conflict with prior knowledge; fine-tuning is costly and risks
catastrophic forgetting. We propose Instruction-Level Weight Shaping (ILWS):
curated system instructions act as external, auditable pseudo-parameters
updated after each session via reflection and user feedback. A Reflection
Engine inspects conversation traces, diagnoses reasoning successes and
failures, and proposes typed deltas $\Delta K=(\Delta S,\Delta U,\Delta T)$
over instructions, user preferences, and tools. Deltas are version-controlled,
evaluated with a sliding window of 1-5 star ratings, auto-repaired on first
failure, and rolled back on repeated failure. When an edit budget crosses a
threshold, the agent compiles a rating-weighted synthetic set and distills
matured instruction-space gains into parameters, converting prompt-space
improvements into weight-space without downtime. ILWS makes explicit the
low-rank shaping induced by context in transformer blocks, preserves
governance, and removes per-call retrieval. In enterprise support it increased
throughput 2.4-5.0x and cut audited hallucinations by about 80% versus a frozen
baseline. In an Adobe Commerce Cloud proof of concept "L0 Support", it achieved
4-5x more tickets per hour and about 80% lower time per ticket, with autonomous
instruction updates and optional tool synthesis. Because ILWS operates at the
instruction layer until controlled distillation, it generalizes to dynamic
domains (legal, medical, engineering) requiring adaptive reasoning, tool
creation, and low-latency deployment.

### [232] [SHERPA: A Model-Driven Framework for Large Language Model Execution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00272)
*Boqi Chen,Kua Chen,José Antonio Hernández López,Gunter Mussbacher,Dániel Varró,Amir Feizpour*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SHERPA introduces a model-driven, hierarchical state-machine framework that injects domain-specific best practices into LLM workflows to improve performance on complex tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs lack structured domain-specific reasoning; multi-step prompts depend on training data and lack fine-grained control; need explicit mechanisms to encode best practices.

Method: Propose SHERPA: hierarchical state machines with rules or ML-driven decisions guiding LLM execution; apply to code generation, class name generation, QA; compare configurations to baselines using multiple LLMs.

Result: State-machine configurations consistently improve output quality over baselines; benefits are pronounced for tasks with established human best practices but limited training data.

Conclusion: Integrating domain-specific best practices via well-designed state machines provides fine-grained control, generalizes across tasks, and enhances LLM performance on complex tasks.

Abstract: Recently, large language models (LLMs) have achieved widespread application
across various fields. Despite their impressive capabilities, LLMs suffer from
a lack of structured reasoning ability, particularly for complex tasks
requiring domain-specific best practices, which are often unavailable in the
training data. Although multi-step prompting methods incorporating human best
practices, such as chain-of-thought and tree-of-thought, have gained
popularity, they lack a general mechanism to control LLM behavior. In this
paper, we propose SHERPA, a model-driven framework to improve the LLM
performance on complex tasks by explicitly incorporating domain-specific best
practices into hierarchical state machines. By structuring the LLM execution
processes using state machines, SHERPA enables more fine-grained control over
their behavior via rules or decisions driven by machine learning-based
approaches, including LLMs. We show that SHERPA is applicable to a wide variety
of tasks-specifically, code generation, class name generation, and question
answering-replicating previously proposed approaches while further improving
the performance. We demonstrate the effectiveness of SHERPA for the
aforementioned tasks using various LLMs. Our systematic evaluation compares
different state machine configurations against baseline approaches without
state machines. Results show that integrating well-designed state machines
significantly improves the quality of LLM outputs, and is particularly
beneficial for complex tasks with well-established human best practices but
lacking data used for training LLMs.

### [233] [SIGMUS: Semantic Integration for Knowledge Graphs in Multimodal Urban Spaces](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00287)
*Brian Wang,Mani Srivastava*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SIGMUS uses LLMs to semantically integrate multimodal urban data into a knowledge graph for incident analysis, avoiding hand-crafted rules and showing plausible connections across text, images, and sensor data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Urban spaces generate diverse, fragmented multimodal data. Reliance on human-driven reasoning to link data and incidents impedes understanding of causes and forecasting. A scalable, automated integration approach is needed to identify relationships and support forecasting of incidents.

Method: Propose SIGMUS, a framework that leverages large language models to produce world knowledge for linking multimodal data to incidents and observations, organizing them into a knowledge graph without manually encoded rules. Evaluates connections among five data sources (news articles, CCTV images, air quality, weather, and traffic) and related incidents.

Result: The system produces reasonable connections between the five data sources and relevant incidents occurring at the same time and location.

Conclusion: Demonstrates feasibility of LLM-driven semantic integration for multimodal urban data via knowledge graphs, enabling structured reasoning about incidents without hand-crafted rules and supporting improved understanding and forecasting of urban incidents.

Abstract: Modern urban spaces are equipped with an increasingly diverse set of sensors,
all producing an abundance of multimodal data. Such multimodal data can be used
to identify and reason about important incidents occurring in urban landscapes,
such as major emergencies, cultural and social events, as well as natural
disasters. However, such data may be fragmented over several sources and
difficult to integrate due to the reliance on human-driven reasoning for
identifying relationships between the multimodal data corresponding to an
incident, as well as understanding the different components which define an
incident. Such relationships and components are critical to identifying the
causes of such incidents, as well as producing forecasting the scale and
intensity of future incidents as they begin to develop. In this work, we create
SIGMUS, a system for Semantic Integration for Knowledge Graphs in Multimodal
Urban Spaces. SIGMUS uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to produce the necessary
world knowledge for identifying relationships between incidents occurring in
urban spaces and data from different modalities, allowing us to organize
evidence and observations relevant to an incident without relying and
human-encoded rules for relating multimodal sensory data with incidents. This
organized knowledge is represented as a knowledge graph, organizing incidents,
observations, and much more. We find that our system is able to produce
reasonable connections between 5 different data sources (new article text, CCTV
images, air quality, weather, and traffic measurements) and relevant incidents
occurring at the same time and location.

*Yen-Che Chien,Kuang-Da Wang,Wei-Yao Wang,Wen-Chih Peng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: NEWSAGENT is a benchmark to evaluate autonomous agents in multimodal web data journalism; shows agents can fetch facts but struggle with planning and narrative integration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fill a gap in evaluating agentic, multimodal data manipulation for real-world journalism; measure planning, information discovery, and narrative construction.

Method: Introduce NEWSAGENT dataset (~6k, derived from real news), convert multimodal content to text; evaluate open- and closed-sourced LLMs with agent frameworks on tasks including search, selection, editing, and rephrasing to produce articles based on an instruction and firsthand data; metrics focus on ability to discover hidden context.

Result: Agents adept at retrieving relevant facts but limited in planning and coherent narrative integration; performance gaps identified.

Conclusion: NEWSAGENT provides a realistic testbed for iterating agent capabilities in multimodal web data manipulation and real-world productivity.

Abstract: Recent advances in autonomous digital agents from industry (e.g., Manus AI
and Gemini's research mode) highlight potential for structured tasks by
autonomous decision-making and task decomposition; however, it remains unclear
to what extent the agent-based systems can improve multimodal web data
productivity. We study this in the realm of journalism, which requires
iterative planning, interpretation, and contextual reasoning from multimodal
raw contents to form a well structured news. We introduce NEWSAGENT, a
benchmark for evaluating how agents can automatically search available raw
contents, select desired information, and edit and rephrase to form a news
article by accessing core journalistic functions. Given a writing instruction
and firsthand data as how a journalist initiates a news draft, agents are
tasked to identify narrative perspectives, issue keyword-based queries,
retrieve historical background, and generate complete articles. Unlike typical
summarization or retrieval tasks, essential context is not directly available
and must be actively discovered, reflecting the information gaps faced in
real-world news writing. NEWSAGENT includes 6k human-verified examples derived
from real news, with multimodal contents converted to text for broad model
compatibility. We evaluate open- and closed-sourced LLMs with commonly-used
agentic frameworks on NEWSAGENT, which shows that agents are capable of
retrieving relevant facts but struggling with planning and narrative
integration. We believe that NEWSAGENT serves a realistic testbed for iterating
and evaluating agent capabilities in terms of multimodal web data manipulation
to real-world productivity.

Conclusion: The approach enhances transparency and reliability in AI-assisted data analysis and storytelling, improving efficiency and collaboration across the data-to-communication pipeline.

Abstract: Recent advancements in the field of AI agents have impacted the way we work,
enabling greater automation and collaboration between humans and agents. In the
data visualization field, multi-agent systems can be useful for employing
agents throughout the entire data-to-communication pipeline. We present a
lightweight multi-agent system that automates the data analysis workflow, from
data exploration to generating coherent visual narratives for insight
communication. Our approach combines a hybrid multi-agent architecture with

to improve transparency and reliability. The system delivers granular, modular
outputs that enable surgical modifications without full regeneration,
supporting sustainable human-AI collaboration. We evaluated our system across 4
diverse datasets, demonstrating strong generalizability, narrative quality, and
computational efficiency with minimal dependencies.

### [236] [Artificial Intelligence-Based Analysis of Ice Cream Melting Behavior Under Various Ingredients](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00507)
*Zhang Lai Bin,Zhen Bin It*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Stabilizers (locust bean gum, guar gum, maltodextrin, carrageenan) enhance ice cream melting resistance and structural resilience; different stabilizers vary in effectiveness; freezing cycles can improve sturdiness; enables cost-effective formulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how common stabilizers affect melting behavior of ice cream and identify cost-effective formulations.

Method: Prepare ice cream samples with each additive, conduct controlled melting tests, record with timelapse, analyze using Python and OpenCV.

Result: All samples preserved a foam-like structure post-melting; stabilizers likely fostered a stable air-cell matrix; refreezing increased structural sturdiness; stabilizers varied in effectiveness; some offered stronger melting resistance and support at potentially lower cost.

Conclusion: Stabilizers play key roles in melting resistance and structure; results guide formulation of durable, economical ice creams for small-scale and commercial production.

Abstract: The stability of ice cream during melting is a critical factor for consumer's
acceptance and product quality. With the commonly added stabilizer to improve
texture, structure and slower melting as the factors to analyze. This report
explores the effects of locust bean gum, guar gum, maltodextrin, and
carrageenan on the melting behavior of homemade ice cream. The main objective
was to assess how these additives influence melting resistance and to identify
a more cost-effective recipe formulation. Ice cream samples incorporating each
additive were prepared and subjected to melting tests under controlled
conditions. Timelapse recordings were used to capture and analyze the
progression of melting over time. Python and OpenCV is used for process and
analysis. Observations revealed that all samples retained a foam-like structure
even after melting, suggesting the stabilizers contributed to the formation of
a stable air-cell matrix. Furthermore, when the melted samples were re-frozen
and subsequently melted again, they displayed increased sturdiness, indicating
improved resilience of the ice cream structure. Comparative analysis of the
different stabilizers highlighted variations in their effectiveness, with some
offering stronger melting resistance and structural support than others.
Overall, the findings provide insights into the functional roles of commonly
used food additives in ice cream formulation. By evaluating both performance
and cost, this study demonstrates the potential for developing recipes that
balance durability with economic efficiency, contributing to practical
applications in both small-scale and commercial ice cream production.

### [237] [LLM-Assisted Iterative Evolution with Swarm Intelligence Toward SuperBrain](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00510)
*Li Weigang,Pedro Carvalho Brom,Lucas Ramson Siefert*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A dynamic, co-evolutionary framework that builds a hierarchy from personalized user–LLM dyads (Subclass Brains) to a pooled Superclass Brain via GA-driven prompt evolution and swarm coordination, culminating in an emergent meta-intelligence for scalable, explainable collective AI; includes prototype demos (e.g., UAV scheduling, keyword filtering) and a registry for cross-dyad knowledge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses limitations of static prompt engineering and isolated agent simulations by enabling adaptive learning, persistent memory, and scalable collective reasoning; aims for explainability, ethical alignment, and generalization across tasks.

Method: Four-stage pathway: (1) Form Subclass Brains through persistent user–LLM interaction with adaptive memory; (2) Apply GA-assisted forward–backward evolution to iteratively refine prompts and task performance; (3) Coordinate Subclass Brains via Swarm Intelligence to optimize multi-objective fitness and exchange distilled heuristics; (4) Integrate standardized behaviors and cognitive signatures into a Superclass Brain as an emergent meta-intelligence; outline architecture and a registry for cross-dyad knowledge consolidation.

Result: The abstract presents a conceptual framework with initial implementations but does not report empirical results; demonstrations are described at a high level (e.g., UAV scheduling, KU/KI keyword filtering) with an emphasis on architecture and theory.

Conclusion: Offers a conceptual foundation and architectural roadmap for scalable, explainable, and ethically aligned collective AI, highlighting abstraction, generalization, and self-improvement as emergent properties of the SuperBrain paradigm.

Abstract: We propose a novel SuperBrain framework for collective intelligence, grounded
in the co-evolution of large language models (LLMs) and human users. Unlike
static prompt engineering or isolated agent simulations, our approach
emphasizes a dynamic pathway from Subclass Brain to Superclass Brain: (1) A
Subclass Brain arises from persistent, personalized interaction between a user
and an LLM, forming a cognitive dyad with adaptive learning memory. (2) Through
GA-assisted forward-backward evolution, these dyads iteratively refine prompts
and task performance. (3) Multiple Subclass Brains coordinate via Swarm
Intelligence, optimizing across multi-objective fitness landscapes and
exchanging distilled heuristics. (4) Their standardized behaviors and cognitive
signatures integrate into a Superclass Brain, an emergent meta-intelligence
capable of abstraction, generalization and self-improvement. We outline the
theoretical constructs, present initial implementations (e.g., UAV scheduling,
KU/KI keyword filtering) and propose a registry for cross-dyad knowledge
consolidation. This work provides both a conceptual foundation and an
architectural roadmap toward scalable, explainable and ethically aligned
collective AI.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AI-powered workflow uses LLMs to draft schematic architectural floor plans from natural language prompts, producing walls, doors, windows, and furniture layouts that are compatible with Revit; demonstrated via a mid-size residential case study; aims for replication-ready BIM outputs with minimal manual effort.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automate and accelerate early-stage architectural drafting while delivering BIM-ready, parametric outputs; enable transparent, replicable workflows and bridge natural language prompts with spatial design.

Method: Combine prompt engineering, a furniture placement refinement algorithm, and Python scripting to interpret natural language prompts and generate layout options (walls, doors, windows, furniture). Produce spatially coherent draft plans compatible with design tools such as Autodesk Revit. Document key prompts to enable independent replication by researchers. Validate with a mid-sized residential case study.

Result: Generated functional and structured draft plans with minimal manual effort; models preserve Revit-native parametric attributes for direct BIM integration; case study demonstrates practical feasibility.

Conclusion: The workflow supports transparent replication and easy adoption by researchers and practitioners, with direct integration into professional BIM processes; demonstrated feasibility in a mid-sized residential layout; potential for broader application and refinement.

Abstract: This paper presents the development of an AI-powered workflow that uses Large
Language Models (LLMs) to assist in drafting schematic architectural floor
plans from natural language prompts. The proposed system interprets textual
input to automatically generate layout options including walls, doors, windows,
and furniture arrangements. It combines prompt engineering, a furniture
placement refinement algorithm, and Python scripting to produce spatially
coherent draft plans compatible with design tools such as Autodesk Revit. A
case study of a mid-sized residential layout demonstrates the approach's
ability to generate functional and structured outputs with minimal manual
effort. The workflow is designed for transparent replication, with all key
prompt specifications documented to enable independent implementation by other
researchers. In addition, the generated models preserve the full range of
Revit-native parametric attributes required for direct integration into
professional BIM processes.

*Xuhui Zhou,Jiarui Liu,Akhila Yerukola,Hyunwoo Kim,Maarten Sap*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: S3AP introduces a POMDP-based structured social world representation that improves social reasoning in LLMs and improves agent decision-making, achieving SOTA gains (≈+51% on FANToM ToM; up to +18% on SOTOPIA).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Humans intuitively simulate social dynamics and perspectives; AI struggles to automatically structure and reason about implicit social contexts; a general, learnable representation of social world states could bridge this gap.

Method: Propose S3AP, a structured social world representation with tuples (state, observation, agent actions, mental states) in a POMDP-inspired framework; can be induced from free-form narratives or other inputs; validate by showing improved LLM social reasoning across five tasks and by inducing social world models to predict future dynamics and aid decision-making.

Result: S3AP leads to +51% improvement on FANToM's theory-of-mind reasoning (with OpenAI's o1) and achieves state-of-the-art performance on that benchmark; induced social world models achieve up to +18% improvement on the SOTOPIA social interaction benchmark.

Conclusion: S3AP appears to be a promising general-purpose representation for social world states, enabling more socially-aware AI systems that better navigate social interactions.

Abstract: Humans intuitively navigate social interactions by simulating unspoken
dynamics and reasoning about others' perspectives, even with limited
information. In contrast, AI systems struggle to automatically structure and
reason about these implicit social contexts. In this paper, we introduce a
novel structured social world representation formalism (S3AP), designed to help
AI systems reason more effectively about social dynamics. Following a
POMDP-driven design, S3AP represents social interactions as structured tuples,
such as state, observation, agent actions, and mental states, which can be
automatically induced from free-form narratives or other inputs. We first show
S3AP can help LLMs better understand social narratives across 5 social
reasoning tasks (e.g., +51% improvement on FANToM's theory-of-mind reasoning
with OpenAI's o1), reaching new state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. We then
induce social world models from these structured representations, demonstrating
their ability to predict future social dynamics and improve agent
decision-making, yielding up to +18% improvement on the SOTOPIA social
interaction benchmark. Our findings highlight the promise of S3AP as a
powerful, general-purpose representation for social world states, enabling the
development of more socially-aware systems that better navigate social
interactions.

### [240] [BALM-TSF: Balanced Multimodal Alignment for LLM-Based Time Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00622)
*Shiqiao Zhou,Holger Schöner,Huanbo Lyu,Edouard Fouché,Shuo Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Balanced Multimodal Alignment for LLM-based Time Series Forecasting (BALM-TSF) integrates time series data and textual descriptors via a learnable prompt and contrastive alignment to produce compact textual embeddings aligned with the time-series latent space, yielding state-of-the-art results with few trainable parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text and time series contain complementary information for forecasting; however, existing multimodal methods tend to bias toward one modality due to modality mismatch, causing information loss.

Method: Time series is encoded by a time-series encoder; descriptive statistics of the series are fed into an LLM with a learnable prompt to obtain textual embeddings; apply a scaling strategy and a contrastive objective to map textual embeddings into the time-series latent space; fuse aligned textual semantic embeddings with time-series embeddings for forecasting; achieves this with minimal trainable parameters; code available at the provided repository.

Result: State-of-the-art performance on standard benchmarks for both long-term and few-shot forecasting with a lightweight parameter footprint; extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of cross-modal alignment.

Conclusion: BALM-TSF shows that balancing cross-modal context via a simple scaling plus contrastive alignment enables effective harnessing of complementary information from text and time series for forecasting, yielding strong performance with limited trainable parameters.

Abstract: Time series forecasting is a long-standing and highly challenging research
topic. Recently, driven by the rise of large language models (LLMs), research
has increasingly shifted from purely time series methods toward harnessing
textual modalities to enhance forecasting performance. However, the vast
discrepancy between text and temporal data often leads current multimodal
architectures to over-emphasise one modality while neglecting the other,
resulting in information loss that harms forecasting performance. To address
this modality imbalance, we introduce BALM-TSF (Balanced Multimodal Alignment
for LLM-Based Time Series Forecasting), a lightweight time series forecasting
framework that maintains balance between the two modalities. Specifically, raw
time series are processed by the time series encoder, while descriptive
statistics of raw time series are fed to an LLM with learnable prompt,
producing compact textual embeddings. To ensure balanced cross-modal context
alignment of time series and textual embeddings, a simple yet effective scaling
strategy combined with a contrastive objective then maps these textual
embeddings into the latent space of the time series embeddings. Finally, the
aligned textual semantic embeddings and time series embeddings are together
integrated for forecasting. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks show
that, with minimal trainable parameters, BALM-TSF achieves state-of-the-art
performance in both long-term and few-shot forecasting, confirming its ability
to harness complementary information from text and time series. Code is
available at https://github.com/ShiqiaoZhou/BALM-TSF.

*Jaber Daneshamooz,Eugene Vuong,Laasya Koduru,Sanjay Chandrasekaran,Arpit Gupta*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: NetGent is an AI-agent framework that converts natural-language workflow specifications into nondeterministic finite automata (NFAs) and executable code to automate realistic web-application traffic generation for networking ML.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Advancing ML in networking requires diverse, realistic traffic data from real web applications. Current browser automation tools are fragile, costly, and not easily reusable across changing interfaces.

Method: Users specify workflows as natural-language rules with state-dependent actions. These specifications are compiled into NFAs, then translated into reusable executable code by a state-synthesis component. This enables deterministic replay, state-cached LLM calls, and quick adaptation when interfaces change.

Result: Evaluated on 50+ workflows spanning video-on-demand, live video streaming, video conferencing, social media, and web scraping. NetGent produced realistic traffic traces and remained robust to UI variability.

Conclusion: Combines the adaptability of language-based agents with the reliability of compiled execution, providing a scalable foundation for generating diverse, repeatable network traffic datasets needed to advance ML in networking.

Abstract: We present NetGent, an AI-agent framework for automating complex application
workflows to generate realistic network traffic datasets. Developing
generalizable ML models for networking requires data collection from network
environments with traffic that results from a diverse set of real-world web
applications. However, using existing browser automation tools that are
diverse, repeatable, realistic, and efficient remains fragile and costly.
NetGent addresses this challenge by allowing users to specify workflows as
natural-language rules that define state-dependent actions. These abstract
specifications are compiled into nondeterministic finite automata (NFAs), which
a state synthesis component translates into reusable, executable code. This
design enables deterministic replay, reduces redundant LLM calls through state
caching, and adapts quickly when application interfaces change. In experiments,
NetGent automated more than 50+ workflows spanning video-on-demand streaming,
live video streaming, video conferencing, social media, and web scraping,
producing realistic traffic traces while remaining robust to UI variability. By
combining the flexibility of language-based agents with the reliability of
compiled execution, NetGent provides a scalable foundation for generating the
diverse, repeatable datasets needed to advance ML in networking.

### [242] [On Verifiable Legal Reasoning: A Multi-Agent Framework with Formalized Knowledge Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00710)
*Albert Sadowski,Jarosław A. Chudziak*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A modular, two-stage, multi-agent framework that separates knowledge extraction from case application using ontology-based symbolic reasoning to improve transparency and accuracy in legal AI, achieving substantial accuracy gains on tax calculation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Legal reasoning is difficult due to nuanced statutory language and complex rules; end-to-end AI approaches often lack verifiability. A framework that yields verifiable intermediate representations can enhance transparency, trust, and consistency.

Method: Stage 1: specialized agents extract legal concepts and formalize rules into verifiable intermediate representations (ontologies). Stage 2: map case facts to the ontology, perform symbolic inference to derive conclusions, and generate final answers via a programmatic implementation of the ontological knowledge. Emphasizes inspection points and bridging natural language understanding with symbolic reasoning.

Result: On statutory tax calculation tasks, foundational models achieve 76.4% accuracy versus 18.8% baseline, substantially narrowing the gap between reasoning and base models. The approach improves transparency and consistency while maintaining computational efficiency.

Conclusion: Modular architectures with formalized knowledge representations can make sophisticated legal reasoning more transparent and trustworthy, providing a foundation for future work in AI-assisted law and expanding accessibility of complex legal reasoning to practical applications.

Abstract: Legal reasoning requires both precise interpretation of statutory language
and consistent application of complex rules, presenting significant challenges
for AI systems. This paper introduces a modular multi-agent framework that
decomposes legal reasoning into distinct knowledge acquisition and application
stages. In the first stage, specialized agents extract legal concepts and
formalize rules to create verifiable intermediate representations of statutes.
The second stage applies this knowledge to specific cases through three steps:
analyzing queries to map case facts onto the ontology schema, performing
symbolic inference to derive logically entailed conclusions, and generating
final answers using a programmatic implementation that operationalizes the
ontological knowledge. This bridging of natural language understanding with
symbolic reasoning provides explicit and verifiable inspection points,
significantly enhancing transparency compared to end-to-end approaches.
Evaluation on statutory tax calculation tasks demonstrates substantial
improvements, with foundational models achieving 76.4\% accuracy compared to
18.8\% baseline performance, effectively narrowing the performance gap between
reasoning and foundational models. These findings suggest that modular
architectures with formalized knowledge representations can make sophisticated
legal reasoning more accessible through computationally efficient models while
enhancing consistency and explainability in AI legal reasoning, establishing a
foundation for future research into more transparent, trustworthy, and
effective AI systems for legal domain.

### [243] [OmniDPO: A Preference Optimization Framework to Address Omni-Modal Hallucination](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00723)
*Junzhe Chen,Tianshu Zhang,Shiyu Huang,Yuwei Niu,Chao Sun,Rongzhou Zhang,Guanyu Zhou,Lijie Wen,Xuming Hu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: OmniDPO mitigates multimodal hallucinations in Omni-modal LLMs by aligning preferences for audio-video interactions and cross-modal cues through text-preference and multimodal-preference samples, improving grounding and reasoning across modalities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text priors dominate in OLLMs, audio-video correlations are underutilized, and fully multimodal settings introduce new hallucination risks. Existing training often aligns each modality with text independently, neglecting intrinsic video-audio correlations.

Method: Propose OmniDPO, a preference-alignment framework with two strategies: (1) text-preference sample pairs to emphasize audio-video interactions; (2) multimodal-preference sample pairs to foreground visual and auditory information. These samples guide the model during learning to balance modalities.

Result: Experiments on two OLLMs show reduced multimodal hallucinations and improved multimodal reasoning and grounding.

Conclusion: OmniDPO effectively mitigates hallucinations in OLLMs and enhances cross-modal reasoning; code and datasets will be released after acceptance.

Abstract: Recently, Omni-modal large language models (OLLMs) have sparked a new wave of
research, achieving impressive results in tasks such as audio-video
understanding and real-time environment perception. However, hallucination
issues still persist. Similar to the bimodal setting, the priors from the text
modality tend to dominate, leading OLLMs to rely more heavily on textual cues
while neglecting visual and audio information. In addition, fully multimodal
scenarios introduce new challenges. Most existing models align visual or
auditory modalities with text independently during training, while ignoring the
intrinsic correlations between video and its corresponding audio. This
oversight results in hallucinations when reasoning requires interpreting hidden
audio cues embedded in video content. To address these challenges, we propose
OmniDPO, a preference-alignment framework designed to mitigate hallucinations
in OLLMs. Specifically, OmniDPO incorporates two strategies: (1) constructing
text-preference sample pairs to enhance the model's understanding of
audio-video interactions; and (2) constructing multimodal-preference sample
pairs to strengthen the model's attention to visual and auditory information.
By tackling both challenges, OmniDPO effectively improves multimodal grounding
and reduces hallucination. Experiments conducted on two OLLMs demonstrate that
OmniDPO not only effectively mitigates multimodal hallucinations but also
significantly enhances the models' reasoning capabilities across modalities.
All code and datasets will be released upon paper acceptance.

*Govind Waghmare,Sumedh BG,Sonia Gupta,Srikanta Bedathur*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Structured input context enables LLMs to solve graph problems without fine-tuning, delivering improved accuracy at lower cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Graph reasoning is challenging for LLMs; there is a need for a scalable, cost-efficient approach that aligns tasks with grounded concepts without requiring fine-tuning.

Method: Inject structured, task-specific context into prompts to guide LLMs; evaluate on multiple graph tasks using both lightweight and large models; compare against baselines including fine-tuning and iterative querying.

Result: Consistent accuracy gains across various graph tasks; performance rivals or exceeds more complex approaches, with favorable cost-accuracy trade-offs and strong scalability.

Conclusion: Structured context injection is a practical, scalable strategy for graph understanding with LLMs, offering a non-fine-tuning pathway to leverage graph reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown strong capabilities in solving
problems across domains, including graph-related tasks traditionally addressed
by symbolic or algorithmic methods. In this work, we present a framework for
structured context injection, where task-specific information is systematically
embedded in the input to guide LLMs in solving a wide range of graph problems.
Our method does not require fine-tuning of LLMs, making it cost-efficient and
lightweight. We observe that certain graph reasoning tasks remain challenging
for LLMs unless they are mapped to conceptually grounded representations.
However, achieving such mappings through fine-tuning or repeated multi-step
querying can be expensive and inefficient. Our approach offers a practical
alternative by injecting structured context directly into the input, enabling
the LLM to implicitly align the task with grounded conceptual spaces. We
evaluate the approach on multiple graph tasks using both lightweight and large
models, highlighting the trade-offs between accuracy and computational cost.
The results demonstrate consistent performance improvements, showing that
structured input context can rival or surpass more complex approaches. Our
findings underscore the value of structured context injection as an effective
and scalable strategy for graph understanding with LLMs.

### [245] [L-MARS -- Legal Multi-Agent Workflow with Orchestrated Reasoning and Agentic Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00761)
*Ziqi Wang,Boqin Yuan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: L-MARS uses coordinated multi-agent reasoning and targeted retrieval to ground legal QA, decomposing queries, searching diverse sources, and employing a Judge Agent to verify sufficiency, jurisdiction, and temporal validity before synthesis; achieving higher factual accuracy and lower uncertainty on a 2025 legal QA benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In high-stakes legal QA, models often hallucinate and rely on ungrounded retrieval. A robust grounding and verification framework is needed to ensure accuracy and compliance with legal standards.

Method: Decompose queries into subproblems; run targeted searches across heterogeneous sources (Serper web, local RAG, CourtListener case law); a Judge Agent verifies sufficiency, jurisdiction, and temporal validity before answer synthesis; an iterative loop of reasoning, search, verification guides answer generation.

Result: Significant improvements in factual accuracy and reductions in uncertainty; higher preference scores from both human experts and LLM-based judges; validated on LegalSearchQA (200 up-to-date 2025 questions).

Conclusion: Multi-agent reasoning with agentic search offers a scalable, reproducible blueprint for deploying LLMs in high-stakes domains requiring precise legal retrieval and deliberation.

Abstract: We present L-MARS (Legal Multi-Agent Workflow with Orchestrated Reasoning and
Agentic Search), a system that reduces hallucination and uncertainty in legal
question answering through coordinated multi-agent reasoning and retrieval.
Unlike single-pass retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), L-MARS decomposes
queries into subproblems, issues targeted searches across heterogeneous sources
(Serper web, local RAG, CourtListener case law), and employs a Judge Agent to
verify sufficiency, jurisdiction, and temporal validity before answer
synthesis. This iterative reasoning-search-verification loop maintains
coherence, filters noisy evidence, and grounds answers in authoritative law. We
evaluated L-MARS on LegalSearchQA, a new benchmark of 200 up-to-date multiple
choice legal questions in 2025. Results show that L-MARS substantially improves
factual accuracy, reduces uncertainty, and achieves higher preference scores
from both human experts and LLM-based judges. Our work demonstrates that
multi-agent reasoning with agentic search offers a scalable and reproducible
blueprint for deploying LLMs in high-stakes domains requiring precise legal
retrieval and deliberation.

*Lee Hyun,Sohee Yoon,Jinwoo Park,Sue In Chae,Seongeon Park,Jooyeon Ahn,Yebin Jung,Youjung Chung,Hogeun Chang,Myeonginn Kang,Jina Kim,Ho-Gyeong Kim,Myeonghun Jeong*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Physics-aware trace sampling (PaRS) enables reliable, calibrated LRMs for process-aware materials discovery by training a student model on physics-consistent reasoning traces generated by a teacher, with selective trace filtering to reduce physics violations and compute cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI-driven materials discovery requires reasoning models that produce physically admissible, calibrated predictions; existing trace-training signals (binary correctness, learned preferences) poorly reflect physical constraints, hindering reliability and efficiency.

Method: Introduce Physics-aware Rejection Sampling (PaRS) for training-time trace selection; use a teacher–student framework where the teacher generates reasoning traces and the student is fine-tuned on traces that are physics-consistent and close to targets, with lightweight halting to control compute; evaluates against rejection sampling baselines under matched token budgets.

Result: PaRS improves prediction accuracy and calibration, reduces physics-violation rates, and lowers sampling cost compared with baselines.

Conclusion: Combining modest domain-aware constraints with trace-level selection provides a practical path toward reliable, efficient large reasoning models for process-aware property prediction and closed-loop materials design.

Abstract: AI-driven materials discovery that couples automated experimentation with
algorithmic decision-making requires process aware recipe to property
predictors that are accurate, calibrated, and physically admissible. We
approach this as a reasoning problem with large reasoning models (LRMs). To
instill reasoning capability into language models, we curate reasoning traces
from a teacher model to train a student model. However, most training pipelines
select reasoning traces using binary correctness or learned preference signals
that poorly reflect physical admissibility. We introduce Physics-aware
Rejection Sampling (PaRS), a training-time trace selection scheme that favors
traces consistent with fundamental physics and numerically close to targets,
with lightweight halting to control compute. We instantiate our framework with
a large student model fine-tuned on traces synthesized by a larger teacher
model, and evaluate under matched token budgets against various rejection
sampling baselines. Our method improves accuracy and calibration, reduces
physics-violation rates, and lowers sampling cost relative to baselines. These
results indicate that modest, domain-aware constraints combined with
trace-level selection provide a practical path toward reliable, efficient LRMs
for process-aware property prediction and closed-loop materials design.

### [247] [Sharpe Ratio Optimization in Markov Decision Processes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00793)
*Shuai Ma,Guangwu Liu,Li Xia*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A DP-compatible framework to optimize Sharpe ratio in infinite-horizon MDPs by transforming to a mean-squared-variance objective; an iterative algorithm with policy iteration that converges to the optimal Sharpe ratio under both average and discounted settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The Sharpe ratio is a fundamental, fractional performance metric in finance, but its optimization is hard within dynamic programming because fractional objectives and risk metrics break standard DP methods. This work seeks a dynamic-programming-friendly approach to maximize Sharpe ratio in MDPs.

Method: Apply Dinkelbach's transform to convert the Sharpe ratio objective into a mean-squared-variance (M2V) objective. Show equivalence of optimal policies when the risk-sensitive parameter equals the optimum Sharpe ratio. Develop an iterative algorithm that repeatedly solves M2V subproblems using a DP-style policy iteration, updating the risk parameter with the current Sharpe estimate. Prove that the Sharpe sequence is monotone increasing and converges to the optimum for both average and discounted MDPs. Include numerical experiments.

Result: The proposed algorithm yields a monotonically increasing sequence of Sharpe ratios that converges to the optimal Sharpe ratio. The policy iteration procedure converges to the optimal policy in both average and discounted MDP settings. Numerical experiments validate the approach and demonstrate DP-type solvability for Sharpe optimization.

Conclusion: This work is, to the authors' knowledge, the first to solve Sharpe ratio optimization in MDPs with dynamic-programming-type algorithms, offering a pathway for tackling other fractional objectives in MDPs.

Abstract: Sharpe ratio (also known as reward-to-variability ratio) is a widely-used
metric in finance, which measures the additional return at the cost of per unit
of increased risk (standard deviation of return). However, the optimization of
Sharpe ratio in Markov decision processes (MDPs) is challenging, because there
exist two difficulties hindering the application of dynamic programming. One is
that dynamic programming does not work for fractional objectives, and the other
is that dynamic programming is invalid for risk metrics. In this paper, we
study the Sharpe ratio optimization in infinite-horizon MDPs, considering both
the long-run average and discounted settings. We address the first challenge
with the Dinkelbachs transform, which converts the Sharpe ratio objective to a
mean-squared-variance (M2V) objective. It is shown that the M2V optimization
and the original Sharpe ratio optimization share the same optimal policy when
the risk-sensitive parameter is equal to the optimal Sharpe ratio. For the
second challenge, we develop an iterative algorithm to solve the M2V
optimization which is similar to a mean-variance optimization in MDPs. We
iteratively solve the M2V problem and obtain the associated Sharpe ratio that
is used to update the risk-sensitive parameter in the next iteration of M2V
problems. We show that such a sequence of Sharpe ratios derived is
monotonically increasing and converges to the optimal Sharpe ratio. For both
average and discounted MDP settings, we develop a policy iteration procedure
and prove its convergence to the optimum. Numerical experiments are conducted
for validation. To the best of our knowledge, our approach is the first that
solves the Sharpe ratio optimization in MDPs with dynamic programming type
algorithms. We believe that the proposed algorithm can shed light on solving
MDPs with other fractional objectives.

*Axel Mezini,Elena Umili,Ivan Donadello,Fabrizio Maria Maggi,Matteo Mancanelli,Fabio Patrizi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Neuro-Symbolic Predictive Process Monitoring (PPM) integrates differentiable LTLf-based logical loss into autoregressive suffix prediction to enforce temporal constraints, improving accuracy and compliance in BPM datasets; introduces local/global logic loss variants; generalizable to other symbolic sequence generation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning suffix predictors often violate domain temporal constraints due to lack of explicit domain knowledge during training; there is a need to embed symbolic temporal logic into learning.

Method: Train an autoregressive sequence model with a differentiable LTLf loss using soft semantics and the Gumbel-Softmax trick to approximate booleans; combine with standard predictive loss; propose local and global variants; evaluate on three real BPM datasets under noisy/realistic settings.

Result: Suffix predictions show higher accuracy and improved logical compliance; the local/global losses are effective under noise; demonstrates applicability beyond BPM to other symbolic sequence generation tasks.

Conclusion: This Neuro-Symbolic framework advances integrating symbolic temporal reasoning into data-driven sequence models; enables logical constraint satisfaction in generated sequences; future work may refine loss formulations and scale to larger domains.

Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of suffix prediction in Business Process
Management (BPM) by proposing a Neuro-Symbolic Predictive Process Monitoring
(PPM) approach that integrates data-driven learning with temporal logic-based
prior knowledge. While recent approaches leverage deep learning models for
suffix prediction, they often fail to satisfy even basic logical constraints
due to the absence of explicit integration of domain knowledge during training.
We propose a novel method to incorporate Linear Temporal Logic over finite
traces (LTLf) into the training process of autoregressive sequence predictors.
Our approach introduces a differentiable logical loss function, defined using a
soft approximation of LTLf semantics and the Gumbel-Softmax trick, which can be
combined with standard predictive losses. This ensures the model learns to
generate suffixes that are both accurate and logically consistent. Experimental
evaluation on three real-world datasets shows that our method improves suffix
prediction accuracy and compliance with temporal constraints. We also introduce
two variants of the logic loss (local and global) and demonstrate their
effectiveness under noisy and realistic settings. While developed in the
context of BPM, our framework is applicable to any symbolic sequence generation
task and contributes toward advancing Neuro-Symbolic AI.

Motivation: Address low real-world adoption of closed-loop insulin delivery systems due to behavioral, psychosocial, and social barriers; need rigorous, scalable evaluation of persuasive AI in healthcare.

Method: Develop ChatCLIDS framework with expert-validated virtual patient library, heterogeneous profiles, realistic barriers; simulate multi-turn interactions with nurse agents using diverse persuasive strategies; supports longitudinal counseling and adversarial social influence; robust evaluation.

Result: Bigger/more reflective models adapt strategies over time; however all models fail to overcome resistance, especially under realistic social pressure.

Conclusion: Current LLMs have limitations for behavior change; ChatCLIDS offers a high-fidelity, scalable testbed to advance trustworthy persuasive AI in healthcare and beyond.

Abstract: Real-world adoption of closed-loop insulin delivery systems (CLIDS) in type 1
diabetes remains low, driven not by technical failure, but by diverse
behavioral, psychosocial, and social barriers. We introduce ChatCLIDS, the
first benchmark to rigorously evaluate LLM-driven persuasive dialogue for
health behavior change. Our framework features a library of expert-validated
virtual patients, each with clinically grounded, heterogeneous profiles and
realistic adoption barriers, and simulates multi-turn interactions with nurse
agents equipped with a diverse set of evidence-based persuasive strategies.
ChatCLIDS uniquely supports longitudinal counseling and adversarial social
influence scenarios, enabling robust, multi-dimensional evaluation. Our
findings reveal that while larger and more reflective LLMs adapt strategies
over time, all models struggle to overcome resistance, especially under
realistic social pressure. These results highlight critical limitations of
current LLMs for behavior change, and offer a high-fidelity, scalable testbed
for advancing trustworthy persuasive AI in healthcare and beyond.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The work analyzes how neural MCCFR component effectiveness changes with game scale and presents an adaptive framework (Robust Deep MCCFR) that uses selective component deployment and stability-friendly mechanisms to mitigate scale-dependent risks, validated by ablations on Kuhn and Leduc Poker with notable exploitability improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address scale-dependent challenges in integrating deep neural networks with MCCFR, such as nonstationary target distributions, action support collapse, variance explosion, and warm-starting bias, and to enable reliable deployment in larger, more complex games.

Method: The authors perform a theoretical analysis of risks in neural MCCFR, develop a Robust Deep MCCFR framework with target networks (delayed updates), uniform exploration mixing, variance-aware training objectives, and extensive diagnostic monitoring, followed by systematic ablation studies on Kuhn and Leduc Poker to inspect scale-dependent component interactions and optimal configurations.

Result: Best configuration reduces exploitability to 0.0628 on Kuhn Poker (60% improvement from 0.156). In Leduc Poker, selective component usage yields 0.2386 exploitability (23.5% improvement from 0.3703). The framework offers convergence guarantees and multi-scale experimental validation.

Conclusion: Scale-aware, selective deployment of neural MCCFR components, within a robust framework, improves performance and provides practical deployment guidelines for larger games, supported by theoretical analysis and empirical evidence.

Abstract: Monte Carlo Counterfactual Regret Minimization (MCCFR) has emerged as a
cornerstone algorithm for solving extensive-form games, but its integration
with deep neural networks introduces scale-dependent challenges that manifest
differently across game complexities. This paper presents a comprehensive
analysis of how neural MCCFR component effectiveness varies with game scale and
proposes an adaptive framework for selective component deployment. We identify
that theoretical risks such as nonstationary target distribution shifts, action
support collapse, variance explosion, and warm-starting bias have
scale-dependent manifestation patterns, requiring different mitigation
strategies for small versus large games. Our proposed Robust Deep MCCFR
framework incorporates target networks with delayed updates, uniform
exploration mixing, variance-aware training objectives, and comprehensive
diagnostic monitoring. Through systematic ablation studies on Kuhn and Leduc
Poker, we demonstrate scale-dependent component effectiveness and identify
critical component interactions. The best configuration achieves final
exploitability of 0.0628 on Kuhn Poker, representing a 60% improvement over the
classical framework (0.156). On the more complex Leduc Poker domain, selective
component usage achieves exploitability of 0.2386, a 23.5% improvement over the
classical framework (0.3703) and highlighting the importance of careful
component selection over comprehensive mitigation. Our contributions include:
(1) a formal theoretical analysis of risks in neural MCCFR, (2) a principled
mitigation framework with convergence guarantees, (3) comprehensive multi-scale
experimental validation revealing scale-dependent component interactions, and
(4) practical guidelines for deployment in larger games.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome weaknesses in existing benchmarks: lack of controllable, scalable, multi-dimensional analysis and limited problem types, which hinder systematic evaluation and training of LLM reasoning.

Method: Generate CNF-based reasoning problems via randomized SAT-based generation across three orthogonal dimensions (instance scale, problem type, question format); verify answers using PySAT; assess multiple LLMs; apply reinforcement fine-tuning on SATQuest-generated data to boost performance and generalization.

Result: LLMs reveal significant gaps in logical reasoning, especially in generalizing beyond familiar math formats. Reinforcement fine-tuning with SATQuest boosts targeted task performance and generalizes to more complex instances, though cross-format adaptation remains challenging.

Conclusion: SATQuest is a foundational tool for systematically evaluating and enhancing LLM logical reasoning and a promising starting point for future research and robust reinforcement learning approaches.

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
general reasoning capabilities. However, systematically evaluating and
enhancing these reasoning capabilities is challenging due to the lack of
controllable and scalable tools for fine-grained analysis. Existing benchmarks
and datasets often lack the necessary variable control for multi-dimensional,
systematic analysis and training, or have narrow problem types and formats. To
address these limitations, we introduce SATQuest, a systematic verifier
designed to evaluate and enhance logical reasoning in LLMs by generating
diverse, Satisfiability-based logical reasoning problems directly from
Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF) instances. SATQuest structures these problems
along three orthogonal dimensions: instance scale, problem type, and question
format, employing randomized, SAT-based problem generation and objective answer
verification via PySAT. This design mitigates memorization issues, allows for
nuanced insights into reasoning performance, and enables effective
reinforcement fine-tuning. Our extensive evaluation of various LLMs using
SATQuest identified significant limitations in their logical reasoning,
particularly in generalizing beyond familiar mathematical formats. Furthermore,
we show that reinforcement fine-tuning with SATQuest rewards substantially
improves targeted task performance and generalizes to more complex instances,
while highlighting remaining challenges in cross-format adaptation. Through
these demonstrations, we showcase SATQuest's potential as a foundational tool
and a valuable starting point for advancing LLM logical reasoning.

*Kishor Datta Gupta,Md Manjurul Ahsan,Mohd Ariful Haque,Roy George,Azmine Toushik Wasi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Introduces an integrated digital twin framework for smart cities that fuses physics-informed ML, multimodal data fusion, knowledge graphs, and LLM-driven edge rules to enable real-time, actionable insights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current urban sensing yields vast data but suffers from scale, latency, and fragmented insights; a cohesive framework is needed to enforce physical consistency, semantically integrate diverse data, and adapt decisions at the edge.

Method: Blend physics-informed machine learning with semantic knowledge graphs as a backbone, multimodal data fusion, and edge-generated, context-aware rules from large language models to support real-time, resource-aware decision-making and digital twin capabilities.

Result: Establishes a foundation for digital twin systems that move beyond passive monitoring to provide actionable, trustworthy insights and efficient operation under constrained resources.

Conclusion: By uniting physics-based reasoning, semantic data fusion, and adaptive rule generation, the approach enables responsive, trustworthy, and sustainable smart infrastructures.

Abstract: Cities today generate enormous streams of data from sensors, cameras, and
connected infrastructure. While this information offers unprecedented
opportunities to improve urban life, most existing systems struggle with scale,
latency, and fragmented insights. This work introduces a framework that blends
physics-informed machine learning, multimodal data fusion, and knowledge graph
representation with adaptive, rule-based intelligence powered by large language
models (LLMs). Physics-informed methods ground learning in real-world
constraints, ensuring predictions remain meaningful and consistent with
physical dynamics. Knowledge graphs act as the semantic backbone, integrating
heterogeneous sensor data into a connected, queryable structure. At the edge,
LLMs generate context-aware rules that adapt filtering and decision-making in
real time, enabling efficient operation even under constrained resources.
Together, these elements form a foundation for digital twin systems that go
beyond passive monitoring to provide actionable insights. By uniting
physics-based reasoning, semantic data fusion, and adaptive rule generation,
this approach opens new possibilities for creating responsive, trustworthy, and
sustainable smart infrastructures.

### [253] [A Hybrid Ai Framework For Strategic Patent Portfolio Pruning: Integrating Learning To-Rank And Market Need Analysis For Technology Transfer Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00958)
*Manish Verma,Vivek Sharma,Vishal Singh*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A multi-stage hybrid AI framework for pruning patent portfolios using Learning-to-Rank, Need-Agent NLP, Seed-Agent LLMs, plus a Core Ontology and HITL validation to support tech transfer decisions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Patent valuation often relies on retrospective indicators and manual, time-consuming analysis. There is a need for an automated, scalable, and credible method to identify high-value assets for technology transfer.

Method: A multi-stage pipeline: (1) a Learning-to-Rank (LTR) model evaluating patents across 30+ legal and commercial features; (2) a Need-Agent using NLP to mine unstructured market/industry data for explicit technological needs; (3) a Seed-Agent using fine-tuned LLMs to analyze patent claims and map technological capabilities; (4) a Core Ontology Framework aligning Seeds with Needs to justify divestment decisions; (5) dynamic parameter weighting; (6) Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) validation to ensure adaptability and credibility.

Result: The paper presents a conceptual architecture and workflow for an automated/practical system, but does not report empirical results within the abstract. It claims potential improvements in automation, depth of analysis, and strategic decision support for tech transfer.

Conclusion: The proposed framework is a promising, adaptable approach to automate patent portfolio pruning and divestment decisions, though it requires empirical validation, robust evaluation, and attention to data, bias, and implementation challenges in real-world settings.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel, multi stage hybrid intelligence framework for
pruning patent portfolios to identify high value assets for technology
transfer. Current patent valuation methods often rely on retrospective
indicators or manual, time intensive analysis. Our framework automates and
deepens this process by combining a Learning to Rank (LTR) model, which
evaluates patents against over 30 legal and commercial parameters, with a
unique "Need-Seed" agent-based system. The "Need Agent" uses Natural Language
Processing (NLP) to mine unstructured market and industry data, identifying
explicit technological needs. Concurrently, the "Seed Agent" employs fine tuned
Large Language Models (LLMs) to analyze patent claims and map their
technological capabilities. The system generates a "Core Ontology Framework"
that matches high potential patents (Seeds) to documented market demands
(Needs), providing a strategic rationale for divestment decisions. We detail
the architecture, including a dynamic parameter weighting system and a crucial
Human in the-Loop (HITL) validation protocol, to ensure both adaptability and
real-world credibility.

*Lun Ai,Johannes Langer,Ute Schmid,Stephen Muggleton*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LENS uses neuro-symbolic techniques to automatically generate natural-language explanations of learned logic programs using LLMs, outperforming prompt-based prompts and hand-crafted templates; but human-learning transfer is limited, suggesting possible cognitive overload.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: USML aims for systems that not only improve ML performance but also teach humans. Scalable, natural-language explanations are needed to transfer knowledge from symbolic learned logic programs to human users, reducing manual engineering of templates.

Method: Integrates symbolic program synthesis with large language models to generate natural-language explanations of machine-learned logic programs. Replaces hand-crafted explanation templates with automated generation; evaluates with multiple LLM judges and human validation; investigates transfer learning in humans across three related domains; code released at the provided URL.

Result: LENS produces explanations rated superior to direct prompting and to hand-crafted templates across multiple judges. However, human learning experiments show no significant performance gains, suggesting that comprehensive LLM responses may overwhelm users for simpler problems.

Conclusion: LENS provides a solid foundation for USML systems to support human learning and demonstrates scalable automated explanation generation. It also highlights the potential downside of overly comprehensive LLM-driven explanations for easy tasks, indicating directions for more user-adaptive explanations and future work.

Abstract: Ultra Strong Machine Learning (USML) refers to symbolic learning systems that
not only improve their own performance but can also teach their acquired
knowledge to quantifiably improve human performance. In this work, we present
LENS (Logic Programming Explanation via Neural Summarisation), a neuro-symbolic
method that combines symbolic program synthesis with large language models
(LLMs) to automate the explanation of machine-learned logic programs in natural
language. LENS addresses a key limitation of prior USML approaches by replacing
hand-crafted explanation templates with scalable automated generation. Through
systematic evaluation using multiple LLM judges and human validation, we
demonstrate that LENS generates superior explanations compared to direct LLM
prompting and hand-crafted templates. To investigate whether LENS can teach
transferable active learning strategies, we carried out a human learning
experiment across three related domains. Our results show no significant human
performance improvements, suggesting that comprehensive LLM responses may
overwhelm users for simpler problems rather than providing learning support.
Our work provides a solid foundation for building effective USML systems to
support human learning. The source code is available on:

### [255] [CoreThink: A Symbolic Reasoning Layer to reason over Long Horizon Tasks with LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00971)
*Jay Vaghasiya,Omkar Ghugarkar,Vishvesh Bhat,Vipul Dholaria,Julian McAuley*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CoreThink introduces General Symbolics, a new reasoning layer (GSR) that boosts performance on tool-calling, code generation, and planning without fine-tuning, achieving SOTA on several benchmarks and proposing an agentic coding IDE.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need for new reasoning techniques beyond scaling and standard RL/SFT approaches to push reasoning performance without training overhead and to overcome diminishing returns of incumbent methods.

Method: Proposes General Symbolics and CoreThink Reasoning Layer with three targeted use cases (tool-calling, code generation, planning). It avoids test-time scaling, SFT, and RLVR, requires no finetuning or training costs, and claims to achieve pure performance uplift.

Result: SOTA scores: 66.66% Livecodebench v6, 89% Instruction-Following Evals, 24.4% ARC-AGI-2; SWE-Bench Lite 62.3%; performance across seven benchmarks; implementation availability; no training cost.

Conclusion: Encourages shift from incumbent methods due to diminishing returns and introduces a high-level description of CoreThink; availability for reasoning-intensive use cases.

Abstract: We introduce CoreThink, a state-of-the-art Reasoning Layer built upon a novel
reasoning method called General Symbolics. This approach diverges from
reasoning paradigms such as test-time scaling, Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT),
and Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR). CoreThink General
Symbolic Reasoner (GSR) is specifically structured around three key use cases:
tool-calling, code generation, and planning, demonstrating exemplary
performance across a total of seven benchmarks in their respective areas.
Notably, we are achieving SOTA scores of 66.66\% on Livecodebench v6, 89\% on
Instruction-Following Evals, and 24.4\% on ARC-AGI-2. We also present an
agentic coding IDE, developed using the principles of General Symbolics, which
achieves a state-of-the-art accuracy of 62.3\% on \texttt{SWE-Bench Lite}. We
are able to achieve these improvements without any finetuning or training
costs. Our Reasoning Layer is designed to provide a pure performance uplift,
ensuring that a model's accuracy on reasoning tasks is never negatively
impacted. We argue that incumbent methods will eventually lead to diminishing
returns in LLM performance, necessitating the development of new reasoning
techniques. This technical report details our approach at a high level and the
availability of the CoreThink models for reasoning-intensive use cases.

### [256] [Self-Exploring Language Models for Explainable Link Forecasting on Temporal Graphs via Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00975)
*Zifeng Ding,Shenyang Huang,Zeyu Cao,Emma Kondrup,Zachary Yang,Xingyue Huang,Yuan Sui,Zhangdie Yuan,Yuqicheng Zhu,Xianglong Hu,Yuan He,Farimah Poursafaei,Michael Bronstein,Andreas Vlachos*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes ReaL-TG, a reinforcement learning framework that fine-tunes LLMs for explainable temporal-graph link forecasting, using outcome-based rewards and an LLM-as-a-judge evaluation; achieves strong ranking metrics and high-quality explanations with a 4B model (ReaL-TG-4B) that outperforms larger frontier LLMs on ranking tasks and is validated by human judgments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address explainability and generalization in temporal-graph forecasting. Traditional temporal GNNs lack interpretable reasoning and do not generalize to unseen graphs without retraining; while LLM-based graph reasoning offers explainability but has been evaluated mainly on static/small graphs and lacks assessment of reasoning quality. The work targets explainable, scalable TG reasoning with evaluation of reasoning traces.

Method: Introduce ReaL-TG, an RL-based framework that fine-tunes LLMs for explainable link forecasting on real-world TGs. Uses outcome-based rewards to encourage self-exploration of reasoning strategies from graph structure and production of explanations that justify predictions. Proposes an evaluation protocol combining ranking metrics with an LLM-as-a-Judge system to assess reasoning quality and hallucinations. Demonstrates ReaL-TG-4B (fine-tuned Qwen3-4B) outperforming larger frontier LLMs on ranking metrics and yielding high-quality explanations per LLM judge and human evaluation.

Result: The approach achieves superior ranking performance compared to much larger frontier LLMs (including GPT-5 mini) and produces explanations that are rated high by both the LLM judge and human evaluators.

Conclusion: RL fine-tuning of a 4B-class LLM can deliver competitive, explainable temporal-graph link forecasting without resorting to extremely large models. The proposed LLM-driven evaluation protocol enables measuring reasoning quality and mitigating hallucinations, underscoring the viability of explainable TG reasoning with relatively small models.

Abstract: Forecasting future links is a central task in temporal graph (TG) reasoning,
requiring models to leverage historical interactions to predict upcoming ones.
Traditional neural approaches, such as temporal graph neural networks, achieve
strong performance but lack explainability and cannot be applied to unseen
graphs without retraining. Recent studies have begun to explore using large
language models (LLMs) for graph reasoning, but most of them are constrained to
static graphs or small synthetic TGs and lack the evaluation of the quality of
reasoning traces generated by LLMs. In this work, we present Reasoning-Enhanced
Learning for Temporal Graphs (ReaL-TG), a reinforcement learning framework that
fine-tunes LLMs to perform explainable link forecasting on real-world TGs.
ReaL-TG uses outcome-based reward to encourage models to self-explore reasoning
strategies from graph structure and to produce explanations that directly
justify their predictions. To enable evaluation on LLM-generated reasoning
traces, we propose a new evaluation protocol combining ranking metrics with an
LLM-as-a-Judge system that assesses both the quality of reasoning and the
impact of hallucinations. Experiments with ReaL-TG-4B, obtained by fine-tuning
Qwen3-4B under our framework, show that it outperforms much larger frontier
LLMs, including GPT-5 mini, on ranking metrics, while producing high-quality
explanations confirmed by both the LLM judge and human evaluation.

*Adib Bazgir,Amir Habibdoust,Yuwen Zhang,Xing Song*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A comprehensive survey of causal multi-agent LLMs, outlining architectural patterns, tasks (causal reasoning, discovery, estimation), evaluation, applications, and open challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with complex causality and personalized reasoning; multi-agent collaborations can mitigate hallucinations and spurious correlations and enable more robust, domain-specific causal modeling. A systematic overview is needed to organize methods and guide future work.

Method: A literature review and taxonomy of causal multi-agent LLMs. The paper categorizes architectures and interaction protocols (pipeline-based processing, debate frameworks, simulation environments, iterative refinement), surveys evaluation methodologies and benchmarks, and maps application domains. It also synthesizes challenges and open questions to chart future directions.

Result: Provides a structured taxonomy of causal multi-agent LLM designs, identifies common design patterns for addressing causality, analyzes evaluation methodologies and benchmarks, and maps current applications (scientific discovery, healthcare, fact-checking, personalized systems). Highlights gaps in benchmarks and evaluation and summarizes practical limitations and potential solutions.

Conclusion: Causal multi-agent LLMs are a promising direction for advancing causal reasoning across domains, but significant challenges remain (robust evaluation, data alignment, personalization, and safety). The paper emphasizes standardized benchmarks, richer simulation environments, and cross-domain collaboration as key future directions.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
various reasoning and generation tasks. However, their proficiency in complex
causal reasoning, discovery, and estimation remains an area of active
development, often hindered by issues like hallucination, reliance on spurious
correlations, and difficulties in handling nuanced, domain-specific, or
personalized causal relationships. Multi-agent systems, leveraging the
collaborative or specialized abilities of multiple LLM-based agents, are
emerging as a powerful paradigm to address these limitations. This review paper
explores the burgeoning field of causal multi-agent LLMs. We examine how these
systems are designed to tackle different facets of causality, including causal
reasoning and counterfactual analysis, causal discovery from data, and the
estimation of causal effects. We delve into the diverse architectural patterns
and interaction protocols employed, from pipeline-based processing and debate
frameworks to simulation environments and iterative refinement loops.
Furthermore, we discuss the evaluation methodologies, benchmarks, and diverse
application domains where causal multi-agent LLMs are making an impact,
including scientific discovery, healthcare, fact-checking, and personalized
systems. Finally, we highlight the persistent challenges, open research
questions, and promising future directions in this synergistic field, aiming to
provide a comprehensive overview of its current state and potential trajectory.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes agent-first data systems to support agentic workloads driven by LLM agents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM agents are likely to dominate future data workloads, making current data systems ill-suited for representing, exploring, and steering large-scale agentic workflows. The paper argues for adapting data systems to support agentic speculation.

Method: Conceptual analysis that identifies four core properties of agentic speculation (scale, heterogeneity, redundancy, steerability) and outlines a new agent-first data systems architecture, including opportunities in query interfaces, processing techniques, and agentic memory stores.

Result: A conceptual framework and set of design directions rather than empirical results; presents concrete research opportunities and architectural components for agent-first data systems.

Conclusion: Adopting an agent-first data systems architecture can better support agentic workloads and drive future research across interfaces, processing, and memory components.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents, acting on their users' behalf to
manipulate and analyze data, are likely to become the dominant workload for
data systems in the future. When working with data, agents employ a
high-throughput process of exploration and solution formulation for the given
task, one we call agentic speculation. The sheer volume and inefficiencies of
agentic speculation can pose challenges for present-day data systems. We argue
that data systems need to adapt to more natively support agentic workloads. We
take advantage of the characteristics of agentic speculation that we identify,
i.e., scale, heterogeneity, redundancy, and steerability - to outline a number
of new research opportunities for a new agent-first data systems architecture,
ranging from new query interfaces, to new query processing techniques, to new
agentic memory stores.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLM-based hypothesis search matches human performance on few-shot rule induction, while direct program generation lags behind, with error analysis highlighting bottlenecks and future directions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how to model inductive reasoning computationally and to compare two concrete AI approaches (LLM-driven hypothesis search vs direct program synthesis) on rule induction tasks.

Method: Empirically compare hypothesis-search driven by large language models with direct program generation methods on few-shot rule induction tasks; evaluate performance and conduct error analysis to identify bottlenecks in hypothesis generation and program induction.

Result: Hypothesis search achieves performance comparable to humans; direct program generation falls notably behind; error analysis identifies bottlenecks in hypothesis generation and suggests directions to improve program induction methods.

Conclusion: LLM-based hypothesis search is a promising route for modeling inductive reasoning; there remain challenges in building more efficient and robust program-induction systems.

Abstract: Inductive reasoning enables humans to infer abstract rules from limited
examples and apply them to novel situations. In this work, we compare an
LLM-based hypothesis search framework with direct program generation approaches
on few-shot rule induction tasks. Our findings show that hypothesis search
achieves performance comparable to humans, while direct program generation
falls notably behind. An error analysis reveals key bottlenecks in hypothesis
generation and suggests directions for advancing program induction methods.
Overall, this paper underscores the potential of LLM-based hypothesis search
for modeling inductive reasoning and the challenges in building more efficient
systems.

*Yukio-Pegio Gunji,Andrew Adamatzky,Panagiotis Mougkogiannis,Andrei Khrenikov*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes open computing in chemical reactions by blending computation with execution environment; introduces Token and Type computing; suggests quantum-like coherence and spike waves enable signal transmission.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To unify artificial and natural intelligence by treating computation as a chemical process and leveraging chemical dynamics to implement adaptive, open systems.

Method: Differentiate closed vs open computing and implement open computing in a chemical mixture. Model computation as a chemical reaction and the execution environment as the degree of aggregation of interacting molecules. Analyze Token computing (individual molecular behavior) and Type computing (normative behavior) and their interplay, focusing on fluctuations and clustering–declustering dynamics.

Result: Observation of spike waves enabling signal transmission; Token computing exhibits self-organizing critical phenomena, Type computing exhibits quantum logic. The interplay recruits fluctuations, potentially yielding quantum-like coherence across Hilbert spaces; enzymes may control spike waves and biochemical rhythms.

Conclusion: Open computing in chemistry can realize dynamic, open-system computation through Token–Type interplay, producing coherent signal dynamics and offering a basis for quantum-like information processing in biochemical contexts.

Abstract: By uncovering the contrast between Artificial Intelligence and Natural-born
Intelligence as a computational process, we define closed computing and open
computing, and implement open computing within chemical reactions. This
involves forming a mixture and invalidation of the computational process and
the execution environment, which are logically distinct, and coalescing both to
create a system that adjusts fluctuations. We model chemical reactions by
considering the computation as the chemical reaction and the execution
environment as the degree of aggregation of molecules that interact with the
reactive environment. This results in a chemical reaction that progresses while
repeatedly clustering and de-clustering, where concentration no longer holds
significant meaning. Open computing is segmented into Token computing, which
focuses on the individual behavior of chemical molecules, and Type computing,
which focuses on normative behavior. Ultimately, both are constructed as an
interplay between the two. In this system, Token computing demonstrates
self-organizing critical phenomena, while Type computing exhibits quantum
logic. Through their interplay, the recruitment of fluctuations is realized,
giving rise to interactions between quantum logical subspaces corresponding to
quantum coherence across different Hilbert spaces. As a result, spike waves are
formed, enabling signal transmission. This occurrence may be termed
quantum-like coherence, implying the source of enzymes responsible for
controlling spike waves and biochemical rhythms.

TL;DR: Block Rearrangement Problem (BRaP) is a graph-search-based planning problem for rearranging blocks in dense grids (up to 80x80) inspired by sliding puzzles; five search-based algorithms are proposed and empirically evaluated for plan quality and scalability, showing efficiency despite exponential search space.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automate and scale rearrangement of storage blocks in large dense warehouse grids to improve planning quality and scalability over ad-hoc methods.

Method: Develop five search-based algorithms that span joint configuration space search, classical planning, multi-agent pathfinding, and expert heuristics; evaluate them empirically on plan quality and scalability in large grids.

Result: The approaches enable efficient generation of rearrangement plans for deeply buried blocks in grids up to 80x80, demonstrating scalability despite exponential growth in the search space.

Conclusion: BRaP frames block rearrangement as a tractable graph-search problem for large-scale warehouses; the five methods offer viable planning options with favorable trade-offs between plan quality and scalability, indicating practical potential for warehouse applications.

Abstract: We introduce the Block Rearrangement Problem (BRaP), a challenging component
of large warehouse management which involves rearranging storage blocks within
dense grids to achieve a target state. We formally define the BRaP as a graph
search problem. Building on intuitions from sliding puzzle problems, we propose
five search-based solution algorithms, leveraging joint configuration space
search, classical planning, multi-agent pathfinding, and expert heuristics. We
evaluate the five approaches empirically for plan quality and scalability.
Despite the exponential relation between search space size and block number,
our methods demonstrate efficiency in creating rearrangement plans for deeply
buried blocks in up to 80x80 grids.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A benchmark (FlashAdventure) for 34 Flash-based adventure games to test full story-arc completion; introduces CUA-as-a-Judge automated evaluator and COAST, a memory-enabled planning framework; results show GUI agents lag human performance and COAST helps but a gap remains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the lack of diverse, story-arc-focused benchmarks for GUI agents, and tackle the observation-behavior gap by enabling long-term memory and planning in agents.

Method: Introduce FlashAdventure dataset of 34 Flash-based adventure games; propose CUA-as-a-Judge automated gameplay evaluator; propose COAST framework leveraging long-term clue memory for improved planning and sequential task solving; conduct experiments comparing GUI agents to baselines and analyze progress on milestones and full story arcs.

Result: Current GUI agents struggle to complete full story arcs; COAST improves milestone completion by bridging the observation-behavior gap; however, there remains a substantial gap between human performance and best agents.

Conclusion: While progress is shown in bridging short-term milestones and linking observations to actions, substantial work remains to close the gap between humans and AI agents in completing full narrative-driven game tasks.

Abstract: GUI agents powered by LLMs show promise in interacting with diverse digital
environments. Among these, video games offer a valuable testbed due to their
varied interfaces, with adventure games posing additional challenges through
complex, narrative-driven interactions. Existing game benchmarks, however, lack
diversity and rarely evaluate agents on completing entire storylines. To
address this, we introduce FlashAdventure, a benchmark of 34 Flash-based
adventure games designed to test full story arc completion and tackle the
observation-behavior gap: the challenge of remembering and acting on earlier
gameplay information. We also propose CUA-as-a-Judge, an automated gameplay
evaluator, and COAST, an agentic framework leveraging long-term clue memory to
better plan and solve sequential tasks. Experiments show current GUI agents
struggle with full story arcs, while COAST improves milestone completion by
bridging the observation-behavior gap. Nonetheless, a marked discrepancy
between humans and best-performing agents warrants continued research efforts
to narrow this divide.

TL;DR: VerlTool delivers a unified, modular ARLT framework with VeRL-aligned upstream integration, standardized multi-modal tool APIs, asynchronous rollout, and broad evaluation across six domains, achieving competitive performance with faster tool use and easier extensibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current ARLT work relies on fragmented, task-specific codebases that suffer synchronization bottlenecks and limited cross-domain reuse, hindering adoption and innovation.

Method: Design principles and components: VeRL-aligned upstream integration; unified tool management via standardized APIs for code, search, SQL, and vision; asynchronous rollout to near 2x speedup; multi-turn trajectories with multi-modal observations; lightweight Python plugin architecture enabling rapid tool integration; open-source framework.

Result: Competitive performance across six ARLT domains (math reasoning, knowledge QA, SQL generation, visual reasoning, web search, software engineering); architecture reduces development overhead and provides scalable training infrastructure; open-source at GitHub.

Conclusion: VerlTool establishes a scalable, extensible framework for tool-augmented RL in ARLT, enabling rapid tool integration and broad community adoption.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has demonstrated
success in enhancing LLM reasoning capabilities, but remains limited to
single-turn interactions without tool integration. While recent Agentic
Reinforcement Learning with Tool use (ARLT) approaches have emerged to address
multi-turn tool interactions, existing works develop task-specific codebases
that suffer from fragmentation, synchronous execution bottlenecks, and limited
extensibility across domains. These inefficiencies hinder broader community
adoption and algorithmic innovation. We introduce VerlTool, a unified and
modular framework that addresses these limitations through systematic design
principles. VerlTool provides four key contributions: (1) upstream alignment
with VeRL ensuring compatibility and simplified maintenance, (2) unified tool
management via standardized APIs supporting diverse modalities including code
execution, search, SQL databases, and vision processing, (3) asynchronous
rollout execution achieving near 2$\times$ speedup by eliminating
synchronization bottlenecks, and (4) comprehensive evaluation demonstrating
competitive performance across 6 ARLT domains. Our framework formalizes ARLT as
multi-turn trajectories with multi-modal observation tokens (text/image/video),
extending beyond single-turn RLVR paradigms. We train and evaluate models on
mathematical reasoning, knowledge QA, SQL generation, visual reasoning, web
search, and software engineering tasks, achieving results comparable to
specialized systems while providing unified training infrastructure. The
modular plugin architecture enables rapid tool integration requiring only
lightweight Python definitions, significantly reducing development overhead and
providing a scalable foundation for tool-augmented RL research. Our code is
open-sourced at https://github.com/TIGER-AI-Lab/verl-tool.

Method: A three-stage training strategy (continued pretraining for embodied reasoning → supervised finetuning for reasoning-action sequences → reinforcement learning) combined with a vision-language architecture that emits atomic low-level commands and human-friendly dialogue. Features include proactive dialogue, real-time interruption handling, and context-aware commonsense reasoning within a hierarchical control setup (high-level planner → low-level controller).

Result: Robix outperforms open-source and commercial baselines (e.g., GPT-4o, Gemini 2.5 Pro) on interactive task execution, generalizes across diverse instruction types (open-ended, multi-stage, constrained, invalid, interrupted), and handles tasks such as table bussing, grocery shopping, and dietary filtering.

Conclusion: A unified, end-to-end vision-language robot model with chain-of-thought reasoning and structured training can achieve strong long-horizon planning, natural human-robot interaction, and robust generalization across tasks, surpassing existing baselines.

Abstract: We introduce Robix, a unified model that integrates robot reasoning, task
planning, and natural language interaction within a single vision-language
architecture. Acting as the high-level cognitive layer in a hierarchical robot
system, Robix dynamically generates atomic commands for the low-level
controller and verbal responses for human interaction, enabling robots to
follow complex instructions, plan long-horizon tasks, and interact naturally
with human within an end-to-end framework. Robix further introduces novel
capabilities such as proactive dialogue, real-time interruption handling, and
context-aware commonsense reasoning during task execution. At its core, Robix
leverages chain-of-thought reasoning and adopts a three-stage training
strategy: (1) continued pretraining to enhance foundational embodied reasoning
abilities including 3D spatial understanding, visual grounding, and
task-centric reasoning; (2) supervised finetuning to model human-robot
interaction and task planning as a unified reasoning-action sequence; and (3)
reinforcement learning to improve reasoning-action consistency and long-horizon
task coherence. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Robix outperforms both
open-source and commercial baselines (e.g., GPT-4o and Gemini 2.5 Pro) in
interactive task execution, demonstrating strong generalization across diverse
instruction types (e.g., open-ended, multi-stage, constrained, invalid, and
interrupted) and various user-involved tasks such as table bussing, grocery
shopping, and dietary filtering.

### [265] [Heads or Tails: A Simple Example of Causal Abstractive Simulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01136)
*Gabriel Simmons*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A note shows how causal abstraction (causal abstractive simulation) can formalize language-model simulation, using a fair coin toss example, with explicit failure modes and a successful case, and discusses implications for benchmarking, philosophy, and math.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a formal foundation for language-model simulation, bridging ad-hoc benchmarking with causal reasoning, and operationalizing the idea that language models can role-play by simulating other systems.

Method: Adopts the causal abstraction framework of causal abstractive simulation and applies it to a simple coin-toss scenario simulated by a language model; presents failure and success examples, and explains how a causal description of the target system can be used to prove simulation.

Result: Shows both failure modes and a valid success case within the framework; illustrates that the formalism can connect empirical benchmarking with formal causality and appeal to multiple audiences (practitioners, philosophers, mathematicians).

Conclusion: Causal abstractive simulation offers a precise operationalization of language-model role-playing and demonstrates a new application of causal abstraction to LM simulation, with potential as a bridging tool across disciplines and for formal analysis of LM-simulation capabilities.

Abstract: This note illustrates how a variety of causal abstraction arXiv:1707.00819
arXiv:1812.03789, defined here as causal abstractive simulation, can be used to
formalize a simple example of language model simulation. This note considers
the case of simulating a fair coin toss with a language model. Examples are
presented illustrating the ways language models can fail to simulate, and a
success case is presented, illustrating how this formalism may be used to prove
that a language model simulates some other system, given a causal description
of the system. This note may be of interest to three groups. For practitioners
in the growing field of language model simulation, causal abstractive
simulation is a means to connect ad-hoc statistical benchmarking practices to
the solid formal foundation of causality. Philosophers of AI and philosophers
of mind may be interested as causal abstractive simulation gives a precise
operationalization to the idea that language models are role-playing
arXiv:2402.12422. Mathematicians and others working on causal abstraction may
be interested to see a new application of the core ideas that yields a new
variation of causal abstraction.

*Wonduk Seo,Taesub Shin,Hyunjin An,Dokyun Kim,Seunghyun Lee*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A multi-agent LLM framework (Q2K) for SKU deduplication/mapping across ecommerce platforms, using targeted questions, focused searches, and reusable reasoning traces, with human-in-the-loop to refine uncertain cases; offers higher accuracy and efficiency than baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Identifying whether two product listings refer to the same SKU is difficult when explicit identifiers are absent and product names vary; rule-based methods miss subtle distinctions in brand, specs, and bundles, necessitating a scalable, interpretable approach.

Method: Propose Q2K, a three-agent system: (1) Reasoning Agent that generates targeted disambiguation questions; (2) Knowledge Agent that resolves them via focused web searches; (3) Deduplication Agent that reuses validated reasoning traces to reduce redundant searches and ensure consistency. A human-in-the-loop handles uncertain cases. Evaluated on real-world consumer goods datasets, showing improved accuracy and robustness, especially for bundles and brand-origin disambiguation.

Result: Q2K surpasses strong baselines in accuracy and robustness, notably in bundle identification and brand-origin disambiguation. Reusing retrieved reasoning traces improves efficiency by reducing repeated searches, yielding scalable and interpretable SKU mapping for product integration.

Conclusion: The framework offers a scalable, interpretable solution for cross-platform product integration, leveraging LLMs and search-based knowledge with trace reuse to balance accuracy and efficiency.

Abstract: Identifying whether two product listings refer to the same Stock Keeping Unit
(SKU) is a persistent challenge in ecommerce, especially when explicit
identifiers are missing and product names vary widely across platforms. Rule
based heuristics and keyword similarity often misclassify products by
overlooking subtle distinctions in brand, specification, or bundle
configuration. To overcome these limitations, we propose Question to Knowledge
(Q2K), a multi agent framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) for
reliable SKU mapping. Q2K integrates: (1) a Reasoning Agent that generates
targeted disambiguation questions, (2) a Knowledge Agent that resolves them via
focused web searches, and (3) a Deduplication Agent that reuses validated
reasoning traces to reduce redundancy and ensure consistency. A human in the
loop mechanism further refines uncertain cases. Experiments on real world
consumer goods datasets show that Q2K surpasses strong baselines, achieving
higher accuracy and robustness in difficult scenarios such as bundle
identification and brand origin disambiguation. By reusing retrieved reasoning
instead of issuing repeated searches, Q2K balances accuracy with efficiency,
offering a scalable and interpretable solution for product integration.

*Jiasheng Xu,Mingda Li,Yongqiang Tang,Peijie Wang,Wensheng Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AnchorRAG is a multi-agent open-world RAG framework that dynamically identifies anchor entities from a knowledge graph, runs parallel multi-hop retrieval from multiple candidates, and uses a supervisor to coordinate and synthesize paths, improving robustness and achieving state-of-the-art QA results without predefined anchors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs relying on static training data can produce factual errors and knowledge gaps. Existing KG-based RAG methods assume accessible anchor entities, limiting robustness in open-world settings with unreliable linking. There is a need for open-world retrieval without predefined anchors.

Method: A predictor agent aligns query terms with KG nodes to identify candidate anchor entities. Independent retriever agents start from each candidate and perform parallel multi-hop explorations. A supervisor agent coordinates the retrieval strategy and synthesizes the resulting knowledge paths to produce the final answer.

Result: AnchorRAG significantly outperforms existing baselines on four public benchmarks and achieves new state-of-the-art results on real-world QA tasks, demonstrating improved retrieval robustness and effectiveness in open-world settings.

Conclusion: AnchorRAG enables robust open-world KG-based RAG without relying on predefined anchors by leveraging multi-agent collaboration, dynamic anchor identification, and coordinated multi-hop retrieval to produce accurate answers.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in
language understanding and reasoning. However, their dependence on static
training corpora makes them prone to factual errors and knowledge gaps.
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) addresses this limitation by incorporating
external knowledge sources, especially structured Knowledge Graphs (KGs), which
provide explicit semantics and efficient retrieval. Existing KG-based RAG
approaches, however, generally assume that anchor entities are accessible to
initiate graph traversal, which limits their robustness in open world settings
where accurate linking between the query and the entity is unreliable. To
overcome this limitation, we propose AnchorRAG, a novel multi-agent
collaboration framework for open-world RAG without the predefined anchor
entities. Specifically, a predictor agent dynamically identifies candidate
anchor entities by aligning user query terms with KG nodes and initializes
independent retriever agents to conduct parallel multi-hop explorations from
each candidate. Then a supervisor agent formulates the iterative retrieval
strategy for these retriever agents and synthesizes the resulting knowledge
paths to generate the final answer. This multi-agent collaboration framework
improves retrieval robustness and mitigates the impact of ambiguous or
erroneous anchors. Extensive experiments on four public benchmarks demonstrate
that AnchorRAG significantly outperforms existing baselines and establishes new
state-of-the-art results on the real-world question answering tasks.

### [268] [Towards Agentic OS: An LLM Agent Framework for Linux Schedulers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01245)
*Yusheng Zheng,Yanpeng Hu,Wei Zhang,Andi Quinn*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SchedCP is a decoupled AI-driven framework that enables autonomous LLM-based optimization of Linux schedulers via a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server, delivering workload analysis, adaptive policy repositories, and execution verification; demonstrated by an agent-based system that synthesizes and deploys eBPF scheduling policies, achieving notable performance gains and cost reductions while ensuring safety.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a fundamental semantic gap between kernel-level policies and application-specific needs, causing suboptimal scheduling. The paper proposes an autonomous, safe framework to bridge this gap and democratize expert-level OS optimization by separating semantic reasoning from safe execution.

Method: Introduce Model Context Protocol (MCP) server with three services: (1) Workload Analysis Engine, (2) Scheduler Policy Repository, and (3) Execution Verifier. Implement sched-agent, a multi-agent system that analyzes workloads, synthesizes custom eBPF scheduling policies, and deploys them via sched_ext. Ensure safety via static and dynamic analysis before deployment.

Result: SchedCP achieves up to 1.79x performance improvement and 13x cost reduction compared to naive agentic approaches, with a high success rate. Code is open-sourced at the provided GitHub URL.

Conclusion: By decoupling AI reasoning from system execution, SchedCP bridges the semantic gap and moves toward truly self-optimizing, application-aware operating systems, making expert-level optimization more accessible through open-source tooling.

Abstract: Operating system schedulers suffer from a fundamental semantic gap, where
kernel policies fail to understand application-specific needs, leading to
suboptimal performance. We introduce SchedCP, the first framework that enables
fully autonomous Large Language Model (LLM) agents to safely and efficiently
optimize Linux schedulers without human involvement. Our core insight is that
the challenge is not merely to apply a better LLM, but to architect a decoupled
control plane that separates the AI's role of semantic reasoning ("what to
optimize") from the system's role of execution ("how to observe and act").
Implemented as Model Context Protocol(MCP) server, SchedCP provides a stable
interface with three key services: a Workload Analysis Engine, an evolving
Scheduler Policy Repository, and an Execution Verifier that validates all
AI-generated code and configure before deployment with static and dynamic
analysis.
  We demonstrate this architecture's power with sched-agent, a multi-agent
system that autonomously analyzes workloads, synthesizes custom eBPF scheduling
policies, and deploys them via the sched\_ext infrastructure. Our evaluation
shows that SchedCP achieves up to an 1.79x performance improvement, and a 13x
cost reduction compared to naive agentic approaches, all while maintaining high
success rate. By bridging the semantic gap, SchedCP democratizes expert-level
system optimization and represents a step towards creating truly
self-optimizing, application-aware operating systems. The code is open-sourced
in https://github.com/eunomia-bpf/schedcp

*Jingxing Fan,Jinrong Shen,Yusheng Yao,Shuangqing Wang,Qian Wang,Yuling Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: VGTeam is a multi-agent LLM-based slide-show video generation system that coordinates specialized agents (script, scenes, audio) in a chat-tower workflow to produce coherent videos at very low cost and high reliability, democratizing video production.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As AI-generated content proliferates, conventional text-to-video models are costly and resource-intensive, prompting a need for efficient, scalable video creation using language models.

Method: A suite of communicative agents organized in a chat tower workflow, each handling a production stage (scriptwriting, scene creation, audio design). The agents collaboratively transform prompts into slide-style narrative videos, emulating traditional video production steps.

Result: Average cost per video is $0.103 with a 98.4% success rate, along with improved efficiency and scalability and reduced computational overhead, while preserving creative fidelity and customization.

Conclusion: VGTeam democratizes video creation, broadening access to high-quality content and highlighting the transformative potential of LLMs in creative domains; positions VGTeam as a pioneering next-generation content-creation framework.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI), the proliferation
of AI-generated content (AIGC) tasks has significantly accelerated developments
in text-to-video generation. As a result, the field of video production is
undergoing a transformative shift. However, conventional text-to-video models
are typically constrained by high computational costs.
  In this study, we propose Video-Generation-Team (VGTeam), a novel slide show
video generation system designed to redefine the video creation pipeline
through the integration of large language models (LLMs). VGTeam is composed of
a suite of communicative agents, each responsible for a distinct aspect of
video generation, such as scriptwriting, scene creation, and audio design.
These agents operate collaboratively within a chat tower workflow, transforming
user-provided textual prompts into coherent, slide-style narrative videos.
  By emulating the sequential stages of traditional video production, VGTeam
achieves remarkable improvements in both efficiency and scalability, while
substantially reducing computational overhead. On average, the system generates
videos at a cost of only $0.103, with a successful generation rate of 98.4%.
Importantly, this framework maintains a high degree of creative fidelity and
customization.
  The implications of VGTeam are far-reaching. It democratizes video production
by enabling broader access to high-quality content creation without the need
for extensive resources. Furthermore, it highlights the transformative
potential of language models in creative domains and positions VGTeam as a
pioneering system for next-generation content creation.

### [270] [GradeSQL: Outcome Reward Models for Ranking SQL Queries from Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01308)
*Mattia Tritto,Giuseppe Farano,Dario Di Palma,Gaetano Rossiello,Fedelucio Narducci,Dharmashankar Subramanian,Tommaso Di Noia*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Outcome Reward Models (ORMs) as a BoN heuristic improve semantic correctness in Text-to-SQL, outperforming ex-BoN and Maj on BIRD and Spider benchmarks; training ORMs and aligning models with SQL (e.g., OmniSQL) yields further gains; more candidates help.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text-to-SQL systems struggle with deep semantic alignment between user intent and database schema. BoN and Maj rely on surface heuristics; ORMs offer semantic evaluation to better align outputs with user goals.

Method: Propose and evaluate a framework for training ORMs for Text-to-SQL; compare ORM-based BoN against execution-based BoN (ex-BoN) and Majority Voting (Maj); evaluate on BIRD and SPIDER benchmarks; finetune various open-source LLMs (Qwen2, Granite3, Llama3); study effects of candidate pool size; also assess models pre-aligned with SQL generation (OmniSQL).

Result: ORMs outperform ex-BoN and Maj, achieving execution-accuracy gains of +4.33% (BIRD) and +2.10% (Spider) over ex-BoN, and +2.91% (BIRD) and +0.93% (Spider) over Maj. Finetuning OmniSQL-aligned models yields superior ORM performance. ORMs are competitive on simple queries and benefit more from larger candidate sets compared to ex-BoN and Maj.

Conclusion: ORM-based BoN is a promising approach for Text-to-SQL, improving semantic alignment and accuracy. Training ORMs and leveraging SQL-aligned models (e.g., OmniSQL) can yield meaningful gains, with increased candidate sets providing additional benefit.

Abstract: Text-to-SQL, the task of translating natural language questions into SQL
queries, has significantly advanced with the introduction of Large Language
Models (LLMs), broadening database accessibility for a wide range of users.
Despite substantial progress in generating valid SQL, current LLMs still
struggle with complex queries that require precise alignment between user
intent and the database schema. To mitigate this, test-time strategies such as
Best-of-N (BoN) and Majority Voting (Maj) are often employed, based on the
assumption that LLMs can generate correct answers but may require multiple
attempts. However, these methods rely on surface-level heuristics, selecting
either the syntactically correct query through execution-based BoN (ex-BoN) or
the most frequently generated query with Maj. Recently, Outcome Reward Models
(ORMs), which assign utility scores to generated outputs based on semantic
correctness, have emerged as a promising approach for better aligning model
predictions with user intent. Nevertheless, their application to Text-to-SQL
remains largely underexplored.
  In this work, we evaluate ORMs as an effective heuristic for BoN, compare
them with ex-BoN and Maj, and introduce a framework for training ORMs for the
Text-to-SQL task. We evaluate our ORMs on the BIRD and SPIDER benchmarks,
finetuning various open-source LLMs, including the Qwen2, Granite3, and Llama3
model families. Our results show that ORMs outperform ex-BoN and Maj, achieving
execution accuracy gains of +4.33% (BIRD) and +2.10% (Spider) over ex-BoN, and
+2.91% (BIRD) and +0.93% (Spider) over Maj. We further demonstrate that
finetuning models already aligned with SQL generation, such as OmniSQL, yields
superior ORM performance. Additionally, we observe that ORMs achieve
competitive results on simple queries and benefit more from an increased number
of candidates compared to ex-BoN and Maj.

### [271] [Conformal Predictive Monitoring for Multi-Modal Scenarios](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01338)
*Francesca Cairoli,Luca Bortolussi,Jyotirmoy V. Deshmukh,Lars Lindemann,Nicola Paoletti*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GenQPM uses score-based diffusion models with a mode classifier to create mode-specific, conformal prediction intervals for quantitative predictive monitoring in multi-modal stochastic systems, improving informativeness over mode-agnostic baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantitative predictive monitoring aims to predict how likely a system is to satisfy a temporal property from its current state. In multi-modal dynamics, mode-agnostic prediction intervals are overly conservative, hindering timely interventions.

Method: Leverage deep generative score-based diffusion models to approximate multi-modal system dynamics without explicit models. Use a mode classifier to partition predicted trajectories by dynamical mode. Apply conformal inference per mode to obtain statistically valid, mode-specific prediction intervals.

Result: On agent navigation and autonomous driving benchmarks, GenQPM yields mode-specific prediction intervals that are significantly more informative (less conservative) than mode-agnostic baselines.

Conclusion: GenQPM provides mode-aware, statistically valid prediction intervals for QPM in multi-modal systems, improving informativeness and potential for timely interventions.

Abstract: We consider the problem of quantitative predictive monitoring (QPM) of
stochastic systems, i.e., predicting at runtime the degree of satisfaction of a
desired temporal logic property from the current state of the system. Since
computational efficiency is key to enable timely intervention against predicted
violations, several state-of-the-art QPM approaches rely on fast
machine-learning surrogates to provide prediction intervals for the
satisfaction values, using conformal inference to offer statistical guarantees.
However, these QPM methods suffer when the monitored agent exhibits multi-modal
dynamics, whereby certain modes may yield high satisfaction values while others
critically violate the property. Existing QPM methods are mode-agnostic and so
would yield overly conservative and uninformative intervals that lack
meaningful mode-specific satisfaction information. To address this problem, we
present GenQPM, a method that leverages deep generative models, specifically
score-based diffusion models, to reliably approximate the probabilistic and
multi-modal system dynamics without requiring explicit model access. GenQPM
employs a mode classifier to partition the predicted trajectories by dynamical
mode. For each mode, we then apply conformal inference to produce statistically
valid, mode-specific prediction intervals. We demonstrate the effectiveness of
GenQPM on a benchmark of agent navigation and autonomous driving tasks,
resulting in prediction intervals that are significantly more informative (less
conservative) than mode-agnostic baselines.

### [272] [Error Notebook-Guided, Training-Free Part Retrieval in 3D CAD Assemblies via Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01350)
*Yunqing Liu,Nan Zhang,Zhiming Tan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: No-training retrieval approach using Error Notebooks + RAG improves specification-aware part retrieval in CAD assemblies without fine-tuning LLMs/VLMs; introduces Error Notebooks and a human-in-the-loop CAD dataset; yields improvements on GPT-4o and Gemini.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs/VLMs face token limits and unsatisfactory performance; fine-tuning access is limited; need effective prompt-based retrieval to handle long 3D metadata.

Method: Create Error Notebooks by collecting erroneous CoTs and reflective corrections; build a repository of tasks with corrected CoTs and final answers; use retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to fetch relevant records from Error Notebooks and inject into inference; evaluate on a human-in-the-loop CAD dataset; tests on proprietary models.

Result: Substantial gains observed; GPT-4o Omni up to 23.4% absolute accuracy improvement on human-preference dataset; ablation shows CoT reasoning helps especially for part counts > 10; robust handling of lengthy non-natural language metadata.

Conclusion: The proposed no-training framework with Error Notebooks and RAG effectively enhances specification-aware part retrieval in complex CAD assemblies, reducing reliance on fine-tuning and enabling better performance with state-of-the-art models.

Abstract: Effective specification-aware part retrieval within complex CAD assemblies is
essential for automated design verification and downstream engineering tasks.
However, directly using LLMs/VLMs to this task presents some challenges: the
input sequences may exceed model token limits, and even after processing,
performance remains unsatisfactory. Moreover, fine-tuning LLMs/VLMs requires
significant computational resources, and for many high-performing general-use
proprietary models (e.g., GPT or Gemini), fine-tuning access is not available.
In this paper, we propose a novel part retrieval framework that requires no
extra training, but using Error Notebooks + RAG for refined prompt engineering
to help improve the existing general model's retrieval performance. The
construction of Error Notebooks consists of two steps: (1) collecting
historical erroneous CoTs and their incorrect answers, and (2) connecting these
CoTs through reflective corrections until the correct solutions are obtained.
As a result, the Error Notebooks serve as a repository of tasks along with
their corrected CoTs and final answers. RAG is then employed to retrieve
specification-relevant records from the Error Notebooks and incorporate them
into the inference process. Another major contribution of our work is a
human-in-the-loop CAD dataset, which is used to evaluate our method. In
addition, the engineering value of our novel framework lies in its ability to
effectively handle 3D models with lengthy, non-natural language metadata.
Experiments with proprietary models, including GPT-4o and the Gemini series,
show substantial gains, with GPT-4o (Omni) achieving up to a 23.4% absolute
accuracy improvement on the human preference dataset. Moreover, ablation
studies confirm that CoT reasoning provides benefits especially in challenging
cases with higher part counts (>10).

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Introduces DeepResearch Arena, a seminar-derived benchmark to evaluate deep research agents; uses a Multi-Agent Hierarchical Task Generation (MAHTG) system to convert seminar insights into 10k+ high-quality research tasks across 12 disciplines, revealing noticeable gaps for current models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Evaluating the true research capability of agents is hard due to scarcity of frontier, attention-capturing research questions; seminars provide rich, expert discourse and reduce data leakage, enabling more realistic benchmarking.

Method: Develop MAHTG to extract research-worthy inspirations from seminar transcripts and translate them into traceable, noise-filtered research tasks; build DeepResearch Arena from 200+ seminars spanning 12 disciplines (~10k tasks).

Result: A large, challenging benchmark with >10k tasks across diverse disciplines; state-of-the-art agents exhibit substantial performance gaps, indicating the benchmark's difficulty and discriminative power.

Conclusion: DeepResearch Arena offers a realistic, leakage-resistant platform for evaluating research agents and can drive future improvements in AI-driven research assistants.

Abstract: Deep research agents have attracted growing attention for their potential to
orchestrate multi-stage research workflows, spanning literature synthesis,
methodological design, and empirical verification. Despite these strides,
evaluating their research capability faithfully is rather challenging due to
the difficulty of collecting frontier research questions that genuinely capture
researchers' attention and intellectual curiosity. To address this gap, we
introduce DeepResearch Arena, a benchmark grounded in academic seminars that
capture rich expert discourse and interaction, better reflecting real-world
research environments and reducing the risk of data leakage. To automatically
construct DeepResearch Arena, we propose a Multi-Agent Hierarchical Task
Generation (MAHTG) system that extracts research-worthy inspirations from
seminar transcripts. The MAHTG system further translates research-worthy
inspirations into high-quality research tasks, ensuring the traceability of
research task formulation while filtering noise. With the MAHTG system, we
curate DeepResearch Arena with over 10,000 high-quality research tasks from
over 200 academic seminars, spanning 12 disciplines, such as literature,
history, and science. Our extensive evaluation shows that DeepResearch Arena
presents substantial challenges for current state-of-the-art agents, with clear
performance gaps observed across different models.

*Cristina Cornelio,Takuya Ito,Ryan Cory-Wright,Sanjeeb Dash,Lior Horesh*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AI-driven hypothesis generation is accelerating scientific discovery but verification must scale and be transparent to prevent stagnation or misdirection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The sheer volume of hypotheses generated by ML and LLMs risks overwhelming traditional verification processes, potentially slowing progress unless robust, scalable verification becomes foundational.

Method: A literature-driven synthesis that surveys data-driven methods, knowledge-aware neural architectures, symbolic reasoning, and LLM-based agents; it also traces the historical arc of scientific discovery to contextualize AI's reshaping role.

Result: AI can reveal patterns and propose candidate laws, expanding discovery Pace, but its scientific value hinges on rigorous, transparent verification; the review delineates key approaches and identifies verification as the central bottleneck and area for methodological development.

Conclusion: For AI-assisted discovery to advance science, verification must be the cornerstone, guiding the design of AI systems and evaluation practices to ensure reliability, reproducibility, and interpretability.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming the practice of science. Machine
learning and large language models (LLMs) can generate hypotheses at a scale
and speed far exceeding traditional methods, offering the potential to
accelerate discovery across diverse fields. However, the abundance of
hypotheses introduces a critical challenge: without scalable and reliable
mechanisms for verification, scientific progress risks being hindered rather
than being advanced. In this article, we trace the historical development of
scientific discovery, examine how AI is reshaping established practices for
scientific discovery, and review the principal approaches, ranging from
data-driven methods and knowledge-aware neural architectures to symbolic
reasoning frameworks and LLM agents. While these systems can uncover patterns
and propose candidate laws, their scientific value ultimately depends on
rigorous and transparent verification, which we argue must be the cornerstone
of AI-assisted discovery.

*Deyu Zhou,Yuqi Hou,Xiao Xue,Xudong Lu,Qingzhong Li,Lizhen Cui*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes an adaptive, three-agent LLM-powered scenario generator to create high-quality social-uncertainty scenarios for service ecosystem governance, improving efficiency and accuracy over predefined-rule methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Governance of service ecosystems amidst increasing social complexity requires scenario analysis. Traditional scenario generation suffers from limited information, many factors, and difficulty measuring social elements, restricting quality and efficiency.

Method: Introduce three coordinating LLM-powered agents: Environment Agent (EA) generates social environments including extremes; Social Agent (SA) designs social collaboration structures; Planner Agent (PA) maps task-role relations and plans solutions. The PA perceives agents' states and adjusts the experimental scheme in real time, enabling autonomous construction of high-quality scenarios. Validation on ProgrammableWeb dataset.

Result: The method yields more accurate scenarios more efficiently compared to baseline approaches.

Conclusion: An adaptive, agent-based scenario generator enhances governance-relevant scenario construction and offers a novel experimental system for service ecosystem governance.

Abstract: As the social environment is growing more complex and collaboration is
deepening, factors affecting the healthy development of service ecosystem are
constantly changing and diverse, making its governance a crucial research
issue. Applying the scenario analysis method and conducting scenario rehearsals
by constructing an experimental system before managers make decisions, losses
caused by wrong decisions can be largely avoided. However, it relies on
predefined rules to construct scenarios and faces challenges such as limited
information, a large number of influencing factors, and the difficulty of
measuring social elements. These challenges limit the quality and efficiency of
generating social and uncertain scenarios for the service ecosystem. Therefore,
we propose a scenario generator design method, which adaptively coordinates
three Large Language Model (LLM) empowered agents that autonomously optimize
experimental schemes to construct an experimental system and generate high
quality scenarios. Specifically, the Environment Agent (EA) generates social
environment including extremes, the Social Agent (SA) generates social
collaboration structure, and the Planner Agent (PA) couples task-role
relationships and plans task solutions. These agents work in coordination, with
the PA adjusting the experimental scheme in real time by perceiving the states
of each agent and these generating scenarios. Experiments on the
ProgrammableWeb dataset illustrate our method generates more accurate scenarios
more efficiently, and innovatively provides an effective way for service
ecosystem governance related experimental system construction.

*Ibne Farabi Shihab,Sanjeda Akter,Anuj Sharma*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CSR (Counterfactual Sensitivity Regularization) is a lightweight training objective that enforces faithfulness between intermediate reasoning steps and final outputs by applying automated operator-level counterfactuals during training and penalizing unchanged answers under invalid traces. It uses COS (Counterfactual Outcome Sensitivity) to measure this faithfulness. It yields large faithfulness gains (up to ~70 points) on GSM8K, PrOntoQA, and Blocks World with minimal accuracy loss, generalizes to larger models, and complements inference-time methods like self-consistency; a pilot on HellaSwag suggests extensions to semantic perturbations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often give correct final answers but rely on flawed, irrelevant, or non-faithful reasoning traces, which reduces trust, especially in high-stakes domains. There is a need for training objectives that align intermediate reasoning with final outputs.

Method: Introduce CSR, which performs automated, operator-level counterfactual interventions during training (e.g., swapping arithmetic operators like "+" and "-"), and penalizes models that keep the same answer under logically invalid traces. Only one extra forward pass per sample is required. Measure faithfulness with COS, which quantifies how perturbations affect predictions.

Result: Across structured reasoning tasks (arithmetic GSM8K, logical deduction PrOntoQA, planning Blocks World), CSR improves faithfulness by up to 70 percentage points over standard fine-tuning and process supervision, with only minor accuracy loss. The sensitivity learned via CSR generalizes to larger models and fits with inference-time methods like self-consistency. A pilot study on HellaSwag indicates semantic perturbations can further enhance faithfulness in commonsense reasoning.

Conclusion: CSR provides a lightweight, effective method to increase faithfulness of LLM reasoning by tying intermediate traces to outputs through counterfactual interventions, with COS as a faithful measure. It generalizes across tasks and models and can be combined with existing inference-time strategies; extensions to semantic perturbations show promise for commonsense tasks.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often produce correct answers while relying on
flawed or irrelevant reasoning traces, undermining their trustworthiness in
high-stakes domains. We propose Counterfactual Sensitivity Regularization
(CSR), a lightweight training objective that enforces dependence between
intermediate reasoning and final outputs. CSR introduces automated,
operator-level counterfactual interventions (e.g., swapping "+" with "-")
during training and penalizes models that preserve the same answer under
logically invalid traces. This requires only one additional forward pass per
sample. To measure faithfulness, we introduce Counterfactual Outcome
Sensitivity (COS), which quantifies the impact of such perturbations on model
predictions. Across structured reasoning tasks - arithmetic (GSM8K), logical
deduction (PrOntoQA), and planning (Blocks World) - CSR improves faithfulness
by up to 70 percentage points over standard fine-tuning and process
supervision, with only minor accuracy loss. The learned sensitivity generalizes
to larger models and synergizes with inference-time methods such as
self-consistency. A pilot study on HellaSwag further demonstrates that
extending CSR with semantic perturbations can enhance faithfulness in
commonsense reasoning.

### [277] [Structured AI Decision-Making in Disaster Management](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01576)
*Julian Gerald Dcruz,Argyrios Zolotas,Niall Ross Greenwood,Miguel Arana-Catania*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A structured decision-making framework for autonomous disaster-management AI improves decision stability and accuracy beyond judgement-based systems and human operators.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address ethical and reliability concerns in autonomous, safety-critical decision-making by introducing a formal framework that ensures decisions are more stable and justifiable in high-stakes disaster scenarios.

Method: Proposes a structured decision-making framework with Enabler agents, Levels, and Scenarios; implements it in autonomous disaster management; evaluates against judgement-based systems and experienced human operators (victims, volunteers, stakeholders).

Result: The framework achieves 60.94% greater stability in consistently accurate decisions across multiple Scenarios versus judgement-based systems and 38.93% higher accuracy than human operators.

Conclusion: Structured decision-making frameworks show promise for building more reliable autonomous AI in safety-critical domains, potentially improving trust and accountability in AI-driven disaster response.

Abstract: With artificial intelligence (AI) being applied to bring autonomy to
decision-making in safety-critical domains such as the ones typified in the
aerospace and emergency-response services, there has been a call to address the
ethical implications of structuring those decisions, so they remain reliable
and justifiable when human lives are at stake. This paper contributes to
addressing the challenge of decision-making by proposing a structured
decision-making framework as a foundational step towards responsible AI. The
proposed structured decision-making framework is implemented in autonomous
decision-making, specifically within disaster management. By introducing
concepts of Enabler agents, Levels and Scenarios, the proposed framework's
performance is evaluated against systems relying solely on judgement-based
insights, as well as human operators who have disaster experience: victims,
volunteers, and stakeholders. The results demonstrate that the structured
decision-making framework achieves 60.94% greater stability in consistently
accurate decisions across multiple Scenarios, compared to judgement-based
systems. Moreover, the study shows that the proposed framework outperforms
human operators with a 38.93% higher accuracy across various Scenarios. These
findings demonstrate the promise of the structured decision-making framework
for building more reliable autonomous AI applications in safety-critical
contexts.

### [278] [Throttling Web Agents Using Reasoning Gates](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01619)
*Abhinav Kumar,Jaechul Roh,Ali Naseh,Amir Houmansadr,Eugene Bagdasarian*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Introduces Web Agent Throttling via rebus-based Reasoning Gates to impose scalable, asymmetric costs on web agents; demonstrates 9.2x cost asymmetry and deploys on MCP and custom sites, with discussion of limitations and environmental impact.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To protect content providers from denial-of-service and scraping by automated web agents while preserving legitimate access; conventional throttling (e.g., CAPTCHAs) are brittle, scalable to only limited degrees, and may be bypassed.

Method: Formalize Throttling Gates; design Reasoning Gates using rebus puzzles that require multi-hop reasoning over world knowledge; develop scalable generation and verification protocol; focus on language models as the common reasoning component; implement on a custom website and Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers; evaluate with real-world web agents.

Result: Achieves computational asymmetry with response-generation cost ~9.2× higher than generation cost for SOTA models; deployed and evaluated in a real setting; provides a scalable, compatible throttling approach.

Conclusion: Notes limitations and environmental impact of real-world deployment; discusses practical trade-offs and avenues for future improvement.

Abstract: AI web agents use Internet resources at far greater speed, scale, and
complexity -- changing how users and services interact. Deployed maliciously or
erroneously, these agents could overload content providers. At the same time,
web agents can bypass CAPTCHAs and other defenses by mimicking user behavior or
flood authentication systems with fake accounts. Yet providers must protect
their services and content from denial-of-service attacks and scraping by web
agents. In this paper, we design a framework that imposes tunable costs on
agents before providing access to resources; we call this Web Agent Throttling.
We start by formalizing Throttling Gates as challenges issued to an agent that
are asymmetric, scalable, robust, and compatible with any agent. Focusing on a
common component -- the language model -- we require the agent to solve
reasoning puzzles, thereby incurring excessive token-generation costs. However,
we find that using existing puzzles, e.g., coding or math, as throttling gates
fails to satisfy our properties. To address this, we introduce rebus-based
Reasoning Gates, synthetic text puzzles that require multi-hop reasoning over
world knowledge (thereby throttling an agent's model). We design a scalable
generation and verification protocol for such reasoning gates. Our framework
achieves computational asymmetry, i.e., the response-generation cost is 9.2x
higher than the generation cost for SOTA models. We further deploy reasoning
gates on a custom website and Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers and evaluate
with real-world web agents. Finally, we discuss the limitations and
environmental impact of real-world deployment of our framework.

### [279] [Unraveling LLM Jailbreaks Through Safety Knowledge Neurons](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01631)
*Chongwen Zhao,Kaizhu Huang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Neuron-level interpretability identifies safety-related neurons; by modulating their activation, model behavior can be steered, achieving strong control metrics; a fine-tuning strategy (SafeTuning) reinforces these neurons to defend against jailbreaking across LLMs, outperforming baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Jailbreak attacks pose safety risks in LLM deployments. Existing defenses (output filtering/detection) are incomplete and their rationale remains unclear. There is a need for deeper, neurony-level understanding of safety mechanisms and more robust defenses.

Method: Introduce a neuron-level interpretability method that projects the model’s internal representations into a consistent, interpretable vocabulary space to identify safety-related neurons. Demonstrate that activating these neurons can control the model’s behavior. Propose SafeTuning, a fine-tuning strategy that reinforces safety-critical neurons to improve robustness against jailbreak attempts.

Result: Activation of safety-related neurons can effectively control model behavior, achieving a mean attack-success-rate (ASR) higher than 97% in control experiments. SafeTuning reduces jailbreak success across multiple LLMs and outperforms four baseline defenses.

Conclusion: A safety-neuron–driven interpretability framework, coupled with SafeTuning, offers a new perspective for understanding and defending against jailbreak attacks, delivering improved robustness over existing defenses.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly attracting attention in various
applications. Nonetheless, there is a growing concern as some users attempt to
exploit these models for malicious purposes, including the synthesis of
controlled substances and the propagation of disinformation, a technique known
as "Jailbreak." While some studies have achieved defenses against jailbreak
attacks by modifying output distributions or detecting harmful content, the
exact rationale still remains elusive. In this work, we present a novel
neuron-level interpretability method that focuses on the role of safety-related
knowledge neurons. Unlike existing approaches, our method projects the model's
internal representation into a more consistent and interpretable vocabulary
space. We then show that adjusting the activation of safety-related neurons can
effectively control the model's behavior with a mean ASR higher than 97%.
Building on this insight, we propose SafeTuning, a fine-tuning strategy that
reinforces safety-critical neurons to improve model robustness against
jailbreaks. SafeTuning consistently reduces attack success rates across
multiple LLMs and outperforms all four baseline defenses. These findings offer
a new perspective on understanding and defending against jailbreak attacks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop AI systems capable of strong physics problem-solving that generalizes to real-world tasks, using a rigorous benchmark (IPhO) to evaluate progress.

Method: Developed Physics Supernova, an AI agent that integrates tools and physics reasoning to tackle IPhO 2025 theory problems; evaluated against top human contestants and analyzed across varied physics tasks; code released for reproducibility.

Result: In IPhO 2025 theory problems, Physics Supernova scored 23.5/30, ranked 14th out of 406 contestants, and surpassed the median performance of human gold medalists.

Conclusion:  principled tool integration within AI agents can yield competitive, scalable improvements in solving challenging science problems and set new benchmarks for AI-assisted scientific problem-solving.

Abstract: Physics provides fundamental laws that describe and predict the natural
world. AI systems aspiring toward more general, real-world intelligence must
therefore demonstrate strong physics problem-solving abilities: to formulate
and apply physical laws for explaining and predicting physical processes. The
International Physics Olympiad (IPhO)--the world's most prestigious physics
competition--offers a rigorous benchmark for this purpose. We introduce Physics
Supernova, an AI agent system with superior physics problem-solving abilities
that match elite IPhO gold medalists. In IPhO 2025 theory problems, Physics
Supernova attains 23.5/30 points, ranking 14th of 406 contestants and
surpassing the median performance of human gold medalists. We extensively

### [281] [An LLM-enabled semantic-centric framework to consume privacy policies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01716)
*Rui Zhao,Vladyslav Melnychuk,Jun Zhao,Jesse Wright,Nigel Shadbolt*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A semantic-centric pipeline using large language models to extract privacy-practice information from policies, ground it in the Data Privacy Vocabulary as Pr^2Graph, and enable formal policy representations and large-scale auditing; datasets and code released.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Users rarely read terms and policies, and the lack of scalable, formal representations of privacy practices hinders user-centric Web approaches and data sharing. There is a gap in obtaining scalable, formal privacy policies (policy graphs) for widespread use.

Method: A semantic-centric pipeline leveraging state-of-the-art LLMs to identify key privacy-practice information from privacy policies and construct Pr^2Graph grounded in the Data Privacy Vocabulary (DPV). The pipeline is applied to the top-100 websites, enabling downstream tasks by generating formal policy representations such as ODRL or psDToU. The approach is evaluated by enriching the Policy-IE dataset with expert annotations and benchmarking multiple LLMs. All datasets and source code are released.

Result: Released Pr^2Graph for the top-100 popular websites and demonstrated how it supports downstream tasks with formal representations (ODRL, psDToU). The authors benchmarked various LLMs and verified capabilities, and released datasets and code publicly.

Conclusion: The work enables large-scale analysis and auditing of online privacy practices, highlighting a promising direction for Web privacy governance and reuse of formal privacy representations.

Abstract: In modern times, people have numerous online accounts, but they rarely read
the Terms of Service or Privacy Policy of those sites, despite claiming
otherwise, due to the practical difficulty in comprehending them. The mist of
data privacy practices forms a major barrier for user-centred Web approaches,
and for data sharing and reusing in an agentic world. Existing research
proposed methods for using formal languages and reasoning for verifying the
compliance of a specified policy, as a potential cure for ignoring privacy
policies. However, a critical gap remains in the creation or acquisition of
such formal policies at scale. We present a semantic-centric approach for using
state-of-the-art large language models (LLM), to automatically identify key
information about privacy practices from privacy policies, and construct
$\mathit{Pr}^2\mathit{Graph}$, knowledge graph with grounding from Data Privacy
Vocabulary (DPV) for privacy practices, to support downstream tasks. Along with
the pipeline, the $\mathit{Pr}^2\mathit{Graph}$ for the top-100 popular
websites is also released as a public resource, by using the pipeline for
analysis. We also demonstrate how the $\mathit{Pr}^2\mathit{Graph}$ can be used
to support downstream tasks by constructing formal policy representations such
as Open Digital Right Language (ODRL) or perennial semantic Data Terms of Use
(psDToU). To evaluate the technology capability, we enriched the Policy-IE
dataset by employing legal experts to create custom annotations. We benchmarked
the performance of different large language models for our pipeline and
verified their capabilities. Overall, they shed light on the possibility of
large-scale analysis of online services' privacy practices, as a promising
direction to audit the Web and the Internet. We release all datasets and source
code as public resources to facilitate reuse and improvement.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Constructive Safety Alignment (CSA) reframes safety from reflexive refusals to guided, constructive interactions for vulnerable users, implemented in Oyster-I (Oy1) with game-theoretic anticipation, risk boundary discovery, and interpretable reasoning control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world safety risks include non-malicious users seeking help while distressed (e.g., self-harm), where blunt refusals can worsen outcomes. Existing safety mainly guards against malicious misuse and adversarial framing; there is a need to balance safety with helpfulness.

Method: CSA is implemented in Oyster-I (Oy1) and combines (1) game-theoretic anticipation of user reactions, (2) fine-grained risk boundary discovery, and (3) interpretable reasoning control to steer responses toward safe, constructive guidance rather than outright refusals.

Result: Oy1 achieves state-of-the-art safety among open models while preserving high general capabilities. On the Constructive Benchmark, Oy1 shows strong constructive engagement (near GPT-5) and unmatched robustness on the Strata-Sword jailbreak dataset (near GPT-01 levels).

Conclusion: Shifting from refusal-first to guidance-first safety redefines the model-user relationship, aiming for systems that are both safe and meaningfully helpful. The authors release Oy1, code, and the benchmark to support responsible, user-centered AI.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) typically deploy safety mechanisms to prevent
harmful content generation. Most current approaches focus narrowly on risks
posed by malicious actors, often framing risks as adversarial events and
relying on defensive refusals. However, in real-world settings, risks also come
from non-malicious users seeking help while under psychological distress (e.g.,
self-harm intentions). In such cases, the model's response can strongly
influence the user's next actions. Simple refusals may lead them to repeat,
escalate, or move to unsafe platforms, creating worse outcomes. We introduce
Constructive Safety Alignment (CSA), a human-centric paradigm that protects
against malicious misuse while actively guiding vulnerable users toward safe
and helpful results. Implemented in Oyster-I (Oy1), CSA combines game-theoretic
anticipation of user reactions, fine-grained risk boundary discovery, and
interpretable reasoning control, turning safety into a trust-building process.
Oy1 achieves state-of-the-art safety among open models while retaining high
general capabilities. On our Constructive Benchmark, it shows strong
constructive engagement, close to GPT-5, and unmatched robustness on the
Strata-Sword jailbreak dataset, nearing GPT-o1 levels. By shifting from
refusal-first to guidance-first safety, CSA redefines the model-user
relationship, aiming for systems that are not just safe, but meaningfully
helpful. We release Oy1, code, and the benchmark to support responsible,
user-centered AI.

### [283] [How Real Is AI Tutoring? Comparing Simulated and Human Dialogues in One-on-One Instruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01914)
*Ruijia Li,Yuan-Hao Jiang,Jiatong Wang,Bo Jiang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Human tutoring dialogues superior to AI in length, questioning, and general feedback, with cognitively rich, diverse interaction patterns centered on a question–factual response–feedback loop; AI shows a simplified, information-transfer loop.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how AI-simulated tutoring dialogues differ from authentic human tutoring, in order to diagnose limitations of current LLM-based tutors and guide the design of more pedagogically effective AI tutoring systems.

Method: Quantitative analysis using Initiation-Response-Feedback (IRF) coding and Epistemic Network Analysis (ENA); comparison of human vs AI dialogues on metrics such as utterance length, initiation-question (I-Q), and general feedback (F-F) behaviors.

Result: Humans produced longer, more varied dialogues with richer questioning and feedback. ENA reveals a divergent interaction pattern: humans follow a "question–factual response–feedback" loop reflecting pedagogical guidance and student thinking, whereas AI dialogues follow an "explanation–simplistic response" loop indicative of basic information transfer and convergence.

Conclusion: The study highlights current limitations of AI-generated tutoring and offers empirical guidance for designing and evaluating more pedagogically effective generative educational dialogue systems.

Abstract: Heuristic and scaffolded teacher-student dialogues are widely regarded as
critical for fostering students' higher-order thinking and deep learning.
However, large language models (LLMs) currently face challenges in generating
pedagogically rich interactions. This study systematically investigates the
structural and behavioral differences between AI-simulated and authentic human
tutoring dialogues. We conducted a quantitative comparison using an
Initiation-Response-Feedback (IRF) coding scheme and Epistemic Network Analysis
(ENA). The results show that human dialogues are significantly superior to
their AI counterparts in utterance length, as well as in questioning (I-Q) and
general feedback (F-F) behaviors. More importantly, ENA results reveal a
fundamental divergence in interactional patterns: human dialogues are more
cognitively guided and diverse, centered around a "question-factual
response-feedback" teaching loop that clearly reflects pedagogical guidance and
student-driven thinking; in contrast, simulated dialogues exhibit a pattern of
structural simplification and behavioral convergence, revolving around an
"explanation-simplistic response" loop that is essentially a simple information
transfer between the teacher and student. These findings illuminate key
limitations in current AI-generated tutoring and provide empirical guidance for
designing and evaluating more pedagogically effective generative educational
dialogue systems.

### [284] [Dynamic Speculative Agent Planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01920)
*Yilin Guan,Wenyue Hua,Qingfeng Lan,Sun Fei,Dujian Ding,Devang Acharya,Chi Wang,William Yang Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Dynamic Speculative Planning (DSP) is an asynchronous online reinforcement learning framework that achieves lossless acceleration for large-language-model–based agents by jointly optimizing end-to-end latency and dollar cost. It introduces a single tunable parameter to steer the tradeoff among faster responses, cheaper operation, or intermediate points. On two standard agent benchmarks, DSP matches the efficiency of the fastest lossless acceleration method while reducing total cost by about 30% and unnecessary costs by up to 60%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reduce latency and inference costs of LLM-based agents without sacrificing performance fidelity, and without requiring extensive preprocessing or offline training of router modules, while giving practitioners simple control over the speed–cost tradeoff.

Method: Propose Dynamic Speculative Planning (DSP), an asynchronous online reinforcement learning framework that optimizes a joint objective over end-to-end latency and dollar cost. It requires no additional pre-deployment preparation and provides a single tunable parameter to guide the system toward faster responses, cheaper operation, or any intermediate point.

Result: DSP achieves comparable efficiency to the fastest lossless acceleration method while lowering total cost by ~30% and reducing unnecessary cost by up to 60% on two standard agent benchmarks.

Conclusion: DSP offers a practical, controllable path to lossless acceleration for LLM-driven agents, delivering speed–cost tradeoffs without performance loss and with open-source code and data.

Abstract: Despite their remarkable success in complex tasks propelling widespread
adoption, large language-model-based agents still face critical deployment
challenges due to prohibitive latency and inference costs. While recent work
has explored various methods to accelerate inference, existing approaches
suffer from significant limitations: they either fail to preserve performance
fidelity, require extensive offline training of router modules, or incur
excessive operational costs. Moreover, they provide minimal user control over
the tradeoff between acceleration and other performance metrics. To address
these gaps, we introduce Dynamic Speculative Planning (DSP), an asynchronous
online reinforcement learning framework that provides lossless acceleration
with substantially reduced costs without requiring additional pre-deployment
preparation. DSP explicitly optimizes a joint objective balancing end-to-end
latency against dollar cost, allowing practitioners to adjust a single
parameter that steers the system toward faster responses, cheaper operation, or
any point along this continuum. Experiments on two standard agent benchmarks
demonstrate that DSP achieves comparable efficiency to the fastest lossless
acceleration method while reducing total cost by 30% and unnecessary cost up to
60%. Our code and data are available through

*Jonathn Chang,Leonard Piff,Suvadip Sana,Jasmine X. Li,Lionel Levine*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A black-box benchmarking method (EigenBench) to quantify language models' alignment to a given value constitution using peer judgments and EigenTrust, without ground-truth labels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a lack of quantitative metrics for value alignment; a need for objective, label-free comparison of how well models adhere to specified values across scenarios and prompts.

Method: Using an ensemble of models, a supplied constitution, and scenario data, each model judges outputs of other models. Aggregated via EigenTrust to yield model-alignment scores relative to the constitution. No ground-truth labels are required. The study also uses prompted personas to assess whether scores are more sensitive to the model or to the prompt.

Result: EigenBench outputs a vector of alignment scores; most observed variance is explained by the prompt, with a smaller residual attributable to the model disposition.

Conclusion: EigenBench provides a practical, ground-truth-free metric for comparing model alignment to a specified value system and for studying how prompts influence measured alignment, while enabling decomposition of prompt-driven vs model-driven variance.

Abstract: Aligning AI with human values is a pressing unsolved problem. To address the
lack of quantitative metrics for value alignment, we propose EigenBench: a
black-box method for comparatively benchmarking language models' values. Given
an ensemble of models, a constitution describing a value system, and a dataset
of scenarios, our method returns a vector of scores quantifying each model's
alignment to the given constitution. To produce these scores, each model judges
the outputs of other models across many scenarios, and these judgments are
aggregated with EigenTrust (Kamvar et al, 2003), yielding scores that reflect a
weighted-average judgment of the whole ensemble. EigenBench uses no ground
truth labels, as it is designed to quantify traits for which reasonable judges
may disagree on the correct label. Using prompted personas, we test whether
EigenBench scores are more sensitive to the model or the prompt: we find that
most of the variance is explained by the prompt, but a small residual
quantifies the disposition of the model itself.

*Shreyash Adappanavar,Krithi Shailya,Gokul S Krishnan,Sriraam Natarajan,Balaraman Ravindran*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Introduces two large, controlled MIMIC-IV–based benchmarks (ED-Triage and Opioid Analgesic Recommendation) with 50k prompts across 12 race×gender variants and 3 context tiers, and a multi-metric fairness framework (mFARM) plus FAB score to evaluate fairness–accuracy trade-offs in healthcare LLMs; empirically shows mFARM detects biases more effectively, with context sensitivity affecting fairness, and releases benchmarks/code.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-stakes medical AI can inherit societal biases; existing fairness metrics are insufficient for multi-dimensional medical harms, risking clinically inert but inaccurate outputs. There is a need for comprehensive, interpretable fairness auditing in healthcare LLMs.

Method: Construct two large-scale benchmarks from MIMIC-IV (ED-Triage and Opioid Analgesic Recommendation) with over 50k prompts across 12 race×gender variants and 3 context tiers. Propose Multi-faceted Fairness Assessment based on hARMs (mFARM) to audit three disparity dimensions—Allocational, Stability, Latent—and aggregate them into an mFARM score; introduce an aggregated Fairness-Accuracy Balance (FAB) score. Evaluate four open-source LLMs (and their finetuned/quantized variants) under varying context settings.

Result: mFARM metrics detect subtle biases better than traditional metrics. Most models keep robust mFARM performance across different quantization levels but degrade significantly when context is reduced. Benchmarks and evaluation code are publicly released to support research in healthcare-aligned AI.

Conclusion: The proposed benchmarks and the mFARM/FAB framework enable more nuanced fairness auditing in healthcare LLMs, highlighting the importance of context and multi-dimensional disparities, and providing resources to advance aligned AI in medicine.

Abstract: The deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) in high-stakes medical
settings poses a critical AI alignment challenge, as models can inherit and
amplify societal biases, leading to significant disparities. Existing fairness
evaluation methods fall short in these contexts as they typically use
simplistic metrics that overlook the multi-dimensional nature of medical harms.
This also promotes models that are fair only because they are clinically inert,
defaulting to safe but potentially inaccurate outputs. To address this gap, our
contributions are mainly two-fold: first, we construct two large-scale,
controlled benchmarks (ED-Triage and Opioid Analgesic Recommendation) from
MIMIC-IV, comprising over 50,000 prompts with twelve race x gender variants and
three context tiers. Second, we propose a multi-metric framework -
Multi-faceted Fairness Assessment based on hARMs ($mFARM$) to audit fairness
for three distinct dimensions of disparity (Allocational, Stability, and
Latent) and aggregate them into an $mFARM$ score. We also present an aggregated
Fairness-Accuracy Balance (FAB) score to benchmark and observe trade-offs
between fairness and prediction accuracy. We empirically evaluate four
open-source LLMs (Mistral-7B, BioMistral-7B, Qwen-2.5-7B, Bio-LLaMA3-8B) and
their finetuned versions under quantization and context variations. Our
findings showcase that the proposed $mFARM$ metrics capture subtle biases more
effectively under various settings. We find that most models maintain robust
performance in terms of $mFARM$ score across varying levels of quantization but
deteriorate significantly when the context is reduced. Our benchmarks and
evaluation code are publicly released to enhance research in aligned AI for
healthcare.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how generative AI affects TA practice and research, guiding safe and effective integration by identifying structural risk factors and proposing mitigations.

Method: Conceptual/analytic paper that (1) analyzes structural causes of AI-related problems in TA, (2) formulates requirements for using AI in TA, (3) discusses proposed solutions with feasibility considerations, and (4) presents examples of AI use in TA.

Result: Locks in the persistence of structurally induced risks despite ongoing AI development; offers a set of solutions with notes on feasibility and illustrates such usage with TA examples.

Conclusion: Structural risks associated with generative AI persist; addressing them requires the proposed measures and ongoing TA research/practice to balance benefits with governance and reliability concerns.

Abstract: Many scientists use generative AI in their scientific work. People working in
technology assessment (TA) are no exception. TA's approach to generative AI is
twofold: on the one hand, generative AI is used for TA work, and on the other
hand, generative AI is the subject of TA research. After briefly outlining the
phenomenon of generative AI and formulating requirements for its use in TA, the
following article discusses in detail the structural causes of the problems
associated with it. Although generative AI is constantly being further
developed, the structurally induced risks remain. The article concludes with
proposed solutions and brief notes on their feasibility, as well as some
examples of the use of generative AI in TA work.

Motivation: Current AI reflects broad functionality but often lacks depth; there is a need to distinguish surface-level simulations from genuine intelligence and to define criteria that capture enduring, purposeful behavior.

Method: Introduce Structural-Generative Ontology of Intelligence: define three core conditions—generativity (ability to create new structures), coordination (organize these structures into reasons), and sustaining (maintain identity over time)—and argue that these yield depth that enables real intelligence.

Result: A theoretical framework and set of criteria for intelligence depth, suggesting that systems meeting these conditions would transcend tool-like status and approach a 'Second Being'; lacks empirical validation but provides a basis for future research.

Conclusion: Depth is the source of true intelligence, not breadth; current AI is surface-level; future systems meeting the three conditions could achieve persistent, autonomous intelligence and reshape human-AI coexistence.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence is often measured by the range of tasks it can
perform. Yet wide ability without depth remains only an imitation. This paper
proposes a Structural-Generative Ontology of Intelligence: true intelligence
exists only when a system can generate new structures, coordinate them into
reasons, and sustain its identity over time. These three conditions --
generativity, coordination, and sustaining -- define the depth that underlies
real intelligence. Current AI systems, however broad in function, remain
surface simulations because they lack this depth. Breadth is not the source of
intelligence but the growth that follows from depth. If future systems were to
meet these conditions, they would no longer be mere tools, but could be seen as
a possible Second Being, standing alongside yet distinct from human existence.

### [289] [LLMs for LLMs: A Structured Prompting Methodology for Long Legal Documents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02241)
*Strahinja Klem,Noura Al Moubayed*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Structured prompting with chunking and two heuristics achieves state-of-the-art QA on CUAD for legal document retrieval without fine-tuning, though evaluation metrics for QA may limit reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address reliability, transparency, and scalability of LLMs in the legal domain by reducing reliance on costly fine-tuning and enabling handling of long documents while promoting accountable AI.

Method: Chunk long legal documents via a chunking/augmentation system; use engineered prompts; feed into QWEN-2 to generate answers per question; apply Distribution-based Localisation and Inverse Cardinality Weighting to select final answers, leveraging a general-purpose model for scalability and prompt-based reliability.

Result: Achieves up to ~9% improvement over prior methods and reaches state-of-the-art on the CUAD dataset; also highlights limitations of current automatic QA evaluation metrics.

Conclusion: Structured prompt engineering is a promising tool to enhance accountability and responsibility of AI in legal domains (and beyond), warranting further research.

Abstract: The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) has had a profoundly transformative
effect on a number of fields and domains. However, their uptake in Law has
proven more challenging due to the important issues of reliability and
transparency. In this study, we present a structured prompting methodology as a
viable alternative to the often expensive fine-tuning, with the capability of
tacking long legal documents from the CUAD dataset on the task of information
retrieval. Each document is first split into chunks via a system of chunking
and augmentation, addressing the long document problem. Then, alongside an
engineered prompt, the input is fed into QWEN-2 to produce a set of answers for
each question. Finally, we tackle the resulting candidate selection problem
with the introduction of the Distribution-based Localisation and Inverse
Cardinality Weighting heuristics. This approach leverages a general purpose
model to promote long term scalability, prompt engineering to increase
reliability and the two heuristic strategies to reduce the impact of the black
box effect. Whilst our model performs up to 9\% better than the previously
presented method, reaching state-of-the-art performance, it also highlights the
limiting factor of current automatic evaluation metrics for question answering,
serving as a call to action for future research. However, the chief aim of this
work is to underscore the potential of structured prompt engineering as a
useful, yet under-explored, tool in ensuring accountability and responsibility
of AI in the legal domain, and beyond.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: An ensemble of LLMs extracts actionable epidemiological information from WHO DONs to create a daily-updated dataset and a knowledge graph (eKG) for enhanced outbreak surveillance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI advances and increased access to social media and news for epidemiological surveillance create opportunities to extract structured knowledge from WHO DONs, supporting timely decision-making and research.

Method: Apply an ensemble of Large Language Models to parse DONs and extract structured epidemiological entities (e.g., events, locations, dates, signals, responses). Build a daily-updated dataset and a knowledge graph (eKG); describe the data structure and provide access services/tools.

Result: Produced a daily-updated dataset and eKG; the work outlines the structure of the eKG and the services/tools used to access the data, enabling new epidemiological analyses.

Conclusion: Innovative data resources (the dataset and eKG) open new opportunities for epidemiological research and improved disease outbreak surveillance.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of artificial intelligence (AI), together with the
increased availability of social media and news for epidemiological
surveillance, are marking a pivotal moment in epidemiology and public health
research. Leveraging the power of generative AI, we use an ensemble approach
which incorporates multiple Large Language Models (LLMs) to extract valuable
actionable epidemiological information from the World Health Organization (WHO)
Disease Outbreak News (DONs). DONs is a collection of regular reports on global
outbreaks curated by the WHO and the adopted decision-making processes to
respond to them. The extracted information is made available in a daily-updated
dataset and a knowledge graph, referred to as eKG, derived to provide a nuanced
representation of the public health domain knowledge. We provide an overview of
this new dataset and describe the structure of eKG, along with the services and
tools used to access and utilize the data that we are building on top. These
innovative data resources open altogether new opportunities for epidemiological
research, and the analysis and surveillance of disease outbreaks.

### [291] [Rewarding Explainability in Drug Repurposing with Knowledge Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02276)
*Susana Nunes,Samy Badreddine,Catia Pesquita*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: REx uses reinforcement learning to generate explanatory, ontology-grounded paths in knowledge graphs for drug repurposing, achieving explainable and improved predictive performance over state-of-the-art.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To ensure KG-based predictions are both accurate and scientifically explainable, addressing trust and utility in biomedical AI.

Method: A reinforcement learning agent with reward and policy mechanisms guided by properties of scientific explanations identifies explanatory KG paths; these paths are enriched with domain ontologies to ground biomedical knowledge.

Result: Evaluations on three knowledge graph benchmarks for drug repurposing show that explanations validate predictive insights against biomedical knowledge and that REx outperforms state-of-the-art predictive approaches.

Conclusion: REx contributes to credible AI-driven scientific discovery by coupling explainable explanations with stronger predictions in biomedical KG tasks.

Abstract: Knowledge graphs (KGs) are powerful tools for modelling complex,
multi-relational data and supporting hypothesis generation, particularly in
applications like drug repurposing. However, for predictive methods to gain
acceptance as credible scientific tools, they must ensure not only accuracy but
also the capacity to offer meaningful scientific explanations. This paper
presents a novel approach REx, for generating scientific explanations based in
link prediction in knowledge graphs. It employs reward and policy mechanisms
that consider desirable properties of scientific explanation to guide a
reinforcement learning agent in the identification of explanatory paths within
a KG. The approach further enriches explanatory paths with domain-specific
ontologies, ensuring that the explanations are both insightful and grounded in
established biomedical knowledge. We evaluate our approach in drug repurposing
using three popular knowledge graph benchmarks. The results clearly demonstrate
its ability to generate explanations that validate predictive insights against
biomedical knowledge and that outperform the state-of-the-art approaches in
predictive performance, establishing REx as a relevant contribution to advance
AI-driven scientific discovery.

### [292] [Re-evaluating LLM-based Heuristic Search: A Case Study on the 3D Packing Problem](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02297)
*Guorui Quan,Mingfei Sun,Manuel López-Ibáñez*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs can build a complete solver for a constrained problem using scaffolding and iterative self-correction, but their improvements center on scoring functions; performance is competitive with human heuristics yet fragile and biased, limiting broader automated innovation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To test whether large language models can move beyond patching human-designed frameworks to create autonomous, effective heuristics for a nontrivial optimization task (constrained 3D packing) and to understand the role of model biases and engineering in such advances.

Method: Task an LLM with building a complete solver for constrained 3D packing, introduce constraint scaffolding (prewritten constraint checks) and iterative self-correction (refinement cycles) to repair bugs and bootstrap a viable initial population. Analyze the model’s focus within a large search space, compare its output to a human-designed greedy algorithm, and test the scoring function within a metaheuristic framework.

Result: The LLM concentrated most refinement effort on the scoring function, producing a heuristic comparable to a human greedy algorithm. Incorporating the LLM-derived scoring into a human-crafted metaheuristic yielded performance rivaling established solvers, though effectiveness declined as constraints tightened. Two major barriers emerged: (1) engineering to mitigate the model’s fragility in complex reasoning tasks, and (2) pretrained biases that narrow exploration and suppress novel solutions.

Conclusion: Current LLMs can automate substantial portions of heuristic design but remain constrained by fragility and priors. The emphasis on scoring functions may reflect model biases more than a principled design strategy, and overcoming these barriers will be necessary for broader, more innovative automated heuristic design.

Abstract: The art of heuristic design has traditionally been a human pursuit. While
Large Language Models (LLMs) can generate code for search heuristics, their
application has largely been confined to adjusting simple functions within
human-crafted frameworks, leaving their capacity for broader innovation an open
question. To investigate this, we tasked an LLM with building a complete solver
for the constrained 3D Packing Problem. Direct code generation quickly proved
fragile, prompting us to introduce two supports: constraint
scaffolding--prewritten constraint-checking code--and iterative
self-correction--additional refinement cycles to repair bugs and produce a
viable initial population. Notably, even within a vast search space in a greedy
process, the LLM concentrated its efforts almost exclusively on refining the
scoring function. This suggests that the emphasis on scoring functions in prior
work may reflect not a principled strategy, but rather a natural limitation of
LLM capabilities. The resulting heuristic was comparable to a human-designed
greedy algorithm, and when its scoring function was integrated into a
human-crafted metaheuristic, its performance rivaled established solvers,
though its effectiveness waned as constraints tightened. Our findings highlight
two major barriers to automated heuristic design with current LLMs: the
engineering required to mitigate their fragility in complex reasoning tasks,
and the influence of pretrained biases, which can prematurely narrow the search
for novel solutions.

### [293] [Exploring Diffusion Models for Generative Forecasting of Financial Charts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02308)
*Taegyeong Lee,Jiwon Park,Kyunga Bang,Seunghyun Hwang,Ung-Jin Jang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes using text-to-image diffusion models to forecast stock price trends by converting time-series charts into images and generating the next chart image from the current image with an instruction prompt; introduces a simple image-based evaluation method and advocates broader research in applying generative models to finance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Financial ML has heavily relied on time-series modeling and transformers; there is a need to explore diverse uses of generative image models and assess their applicability to financial prediction tasks.

Method: Treat time-series data as a single image pattern; generate the next chart image from the current chart image and an instruction prompt using diffusion models; introduce a simple method to evaluate the generated image against a ground-truth chart image.

Result: The paper proposes this approach and an evaluation method, highlighting the potential of text-to-image generative models in finance; no quantitative results are reported in the abstract, but findings are positioned to motivate further research.

Conclusion: Text-to-image generative models can be leveraged in the financial domain; the work encourages additional research to address current limitations and broaden applicability in forecasting and chart-based tasks.

Abstract: Recent advances in generative models have enabled significant progress in
tasks such as generating and editing images from text, as well as creating
videos from text prompts, and these methods are being applied across various
fields. However, in the financial domain, there may still be a reliance on
time-series data and a continued focus on transformer models, rather than on
diverse applications of generative models. In this paper, we propose a novel
approach that leverages text-to-image model by treating time-series data as a
single image pattern, thereby enabling the prediction of stock price trends.
Unlike prior methods that focus on learning and classifying chart patterns
using architectures such as ResNet or ViT, we experiment with generating the
next chart image from the current chart image and an instruction prompt using
diffusion models. Furthermore, we introduce a simple method for evaluating the
generated chart image against ground truth image. We highlight the potential of
leveraging text-to-image generative models in the financial domain, and our
findings motivate further research to address the current limitations and
expand their applicability.

### [294] [Explainability-Driven Dimensionality Reduction for Hyperspectral Imaging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02340)
*Salma Haidar,José Oramas*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Post-hoc explainability-guided band selection yields compact, high-performance hyperspectral subsets (as few as 30 bands) that match or exceed full-spectrum classifiers while reducing computation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hyperspectral data are high-dimensional; dimensionality reduction is needed to cut computation while preserving accuracy. Existing methods may be ad hoc; this work proposes using model explanations to identify and select the most influential spectral bands for classification.

Method: Train a classifier on hyperspectral data; use post-hoc explanations to quantify each band's contribution; conduct deletion–insertion analyses to obtain band influence scores; select top-influence bands to form a reduced spectral subset; evaluate on Pavia University and Salinas datasets, comparing to full-spectrum baselines.

Result: Compact subsets (≈30 bands) achieve accuracy that matches or exceeds full-spectrum baselines while reducing computation; the selected bands correspond to physically meaningful discriminative wavelengths.

Conclusion: Explanation-guided, model-aligned band selection provides a principled, effective approach for dimensionality reduction in hyperspectral imaging with preserved predictive performance.

Abstract: Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) provides rich spectral information for precise
material classification and analysis; however, its high dimensionality
introduces a computational burden and redundancy, making dimensionality
reduction essential. We present an exploratory study into the application of
post-hoc explainability methods in a model--driven framework for band
selection, which reduces the spectral dimension while preserving predictive
performance. A trained classifier is probed with explanations to quantify each
band's contribution to its decisions. We then perform deletion--insertion
evaluations, recording confidence changes as ranked bands are removed or
reintroduced, and aggregate these signals into influence scores. Selecting the
highest--influence bands yields compact spectral subsets that maintain accuracy
and improve efficiency. Experiments on two public benchmarks (Pavia University
and Salinas) demonstrate that classifiers trained on as few as 30 selected
bands match or exceed full--spectrum baselines while reducing computational
requirements. The resulting subsets align with physically meaningful, highly
discriminative wavelength regions, indicating that model--aligned,
explanation-guided band selection is a principled route to effective
dimensionality reduction for HSI.

*Shubham Gandhi,Jason Tsay,Jatin Ganhotra,Kiran Kate,Yara Rizk*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SWE-PRM introduces an inference-time Process Reward Model to detect and fix trajectory-level inefficiencies in LLM-based SWE agents, boosting success rates and efficiency with minimal cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce costly trajectory inefficiencies (e.g., redundant exploration, looping, and failure to terminate) in LLM-driven SWE tasks, addressing the lack of real-time, during-execution correction found in prior post-hoc analyses.

Method: Apply a taxonomy of common inefficiencies to provide lightweight, interpretable feedback via an inference-time Process Reward Model that intervenes during execution without altering the underlying policy; evaluate on SWE-bench Verified with closed-source PRMs; compare taxonomy-guided vs unguided and action-prescriptive variants.

Result: Resolution improved from 40.0% to 50.6% (+10.6 percentage points); largest gains on medium and hard tasks; taxonomy-guided PRMs outperform unguided or action-prescriptive variants; higher success rate and shorter trajectories; added inference cost as low as $0.2.

Conclusion: Inference-time PRMs offer a practical, scalable mechanism to improve SWE agents’ reliability and efficiency by correcting trajectory-level errors without retraining, with taxonomy-guided strategies delivering the best performance at modest cost.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents are increasingly deployed for complex,
multi-step software engineering (SWE) tasks. However, their trajectories often
contain costly inefficiencies, such as redundant exploration, looping, and
failure to terminate once a solution is reached. Prior work has largely treated
these errors in a post-hoc manner, diagnosing failures only after execution. In
this paper, we introduce SWE-PRM, an inference-time Process Reward Model (PRM)
that intervenes during execution to detect and course-correct trajectory-level
errors. Our PRM design leverages a taxonomy of common inefficiencies and
delivers lightweight, interpretable feedback without modifying the underlying
policy. On SWE-bench Verified, closed-source PRMs improve resolution from 40.0%
to 50.6% (+10.6 p.p.), with the largest gains on medium and hard tasks. Among
feedback strategies, taxonomy-guided PRMs outperform unguided or explicit
action-prescriptive variants, increasing success rate while reducing trajectory
length. These benefits come at an acceptable added inference cost of as low as
$0.2, making PRMs a practical and scalable mechanism for improving SWE agents'
reliability and efficiency.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Uncertainty-aware LLM agents improve reliability in query-conditioned multi-table biomedical summarization by using retrieval and summary uncertainty, with GRPO-based RL, boosting factuality and downstream predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs in structured biomedical data environments often produce fluent but overconfident outputs when reasoning over complex multi-table sets; there is a need for uncertainty-aware mechanisms to improve factuality, calibration, and reliability.

Method: Introduce two complementary uncertainty signals: retrieval uncertainty (entropy over multiple table-selection rollouts) and summary uncertainty (self-consistency and perplexity). Use summary uncertainty in reinforcement learning via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO); use both uncertainties to guide inference-time filtering and to construct higher-quality synthetic datasets.

Result: On multi-omics benchmarks, factuality and calibration improve; correct and useful claims per summary nearly tripled (from 3.0 to 8.4 internal; 3.6 to 9.9 cancer multi-omics); downstream survival prediction substantially improved (C-index 0.32 to 0.63).

Conclusion: Uncertainty can serve as a control signal enabling agents to abstain, communicate confidence, and become more reliable tools for complex structured-data environments.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents are increasingly deployed in structured
biomedical data environments, yet they often produce fluent but overconfident
outputs when reasoning over complex multi-table data. We introduce an
uncertainty-aware agent for query-conditioned multi-table summarization that
leverages two complementary signals: (i) retrieval uncertainty--entropy over
multiple table-selection rollouts--and (ii) summary uncertainty--combining
self-consistency and perplexity. Summary uncertainty is incorporated into
reinforcement learning (RL) with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO),
while both retrieval and summary uncertainty guide inference-time filtering and
support the construction of higher-quality synthetic datasets.
  On multi-omics benchmarks, our approach improves factuality and calibration,
nearly tripling correct and useful claims per summary (3.0\(\rightarrow\)8.4
internal; 3.6\(\rightarrow\)9.9 cancer multi-omics) and substantially improving
downstream survival prediction (C-index 0.32\(\rightarrow\)0.63). These results
demonstrate that uncertainty can serve as a control signal--enabling agents to
abstain, communicate confidence, and become more reliable tools for complex

TL;DR: AppCopilot presents a multimodal, on-device, multi-agent mobile assistant designed to generalize across tasks, achieve precise on-screen actions, plan long-horizon goals, and run efficiently on resource-constrained devices, via an end-to-end full-stack pipeline and optimized architecture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mobile agent systems struggle to generalize across tasks, achieve precise interaction, maintain long-horizon planning, and operate efficiently on constrained hardware. On-device solutions can improve privacy, latency, and energy efficiency while enabling broad applicability across apps and devices.

Method: End-to-end autonomous pipeline from data collection to deployment and efficient inference.

System optimizes latency, memory, and energy via profiling-driven adaptation across heterogeneous hardware.

Result: AppCopilot achieves notable improvements across four core dimensions: stronger generalization across tasks/modalities/apps/devices; higher-precision on-screen actions; more reliable long-horizon task completion; and faster, more resource-efficient runtime.

Conclusion: A full-stack, on-device mobile-agent framework that integrates multimodal models, advanced planning, and cross-app orchestration, demonstrating practical feasibility and providing a blueprint for scalable, efficient mobile AI assistants.

Abstract: With the raid evolution of large language models and multimodal foundation
models, the mobile-agent landscape has proliferated without converging on the
fundamental challenges. This paper identifies four core problems that must be
solved for mobile agents to deliver practical, scalable impact: (1)
generalization across tasks, modalities, apps, and devices; (2) accuracy,
specifically precise on-screen interaction and click targeting; (3)
long-horizon capability for sustained, multi-step goals; and (4) efficiency,
specifically high-performance runtime on resource-constrained devices. We
present AppCopilot, a multimodal, multi-agent, general-purpose on-device
assistant that operates across applications and constitutes a full-stack,
closed-loop system from data to deployment. AppCopilot operationalizes this
position through an end-to-end autonomous pipeline spanning data collection,
training, deployment, high-quality and efficient inference, and mobile
application development. At the model layer, it integrates multimodal
foundation models with robust Chinese-English support. At the reasoning and
control layer, it combines chain-of-thought reasoning, hierarchical task
planning and decomposition, and multi-agent collaboration. At the execution
layer, it enables user personalization and experiential adaptation, voice
interaction, function calling, cross-app and cross-device orchestration, and
comprehensive mobile app support. The system design incorporates
profiling-driven optimization for latency, memory, and energy across
heterogeneous hardware. Empirically, AppCopilot achieves significant
improvements along all four dimensions: stronger generalization,
higher-precision on-screen actions, more reliable long-horizon task completion,
and faster, more resource-efficient runtime.

TL;DR: UI-TARS-2 is a native GUI-centered agent that tackles data scalability, multi-turn RL stability, and environment limitations via a data flywheel, stabilized multi-turn RL, a hybrid GUI environment, and large-scale sandbox rollouts; it yields strong GUI benchmark performance, competitive game scores, and broad generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address core AI challenges in GUI agents: data scalability for RL, effective multi-turn decision making, GUI-only operation limitations, and unstable training in large-scale agent systems.

Method: Introduce UI-TARS-2 with (1) a data flywheel to scale data generation, (2) a stabilized multi-turn RL framework, (3) a hybrid GUI environment integrating file systems and terminals, and (4) a unified sandbox platform for large-scale rollouts.

Result: On GUI benchmarks: 88.2 Online-Mind2Web, 47.5 OSWorld, 50.6 WindowsAgentArena, 73.3 AndroidWorld; in game environments: mean normalized score 59.8 across 15 games (~60% of human performance); competitive with frontier models (e.g., OpenAI o3); generalizes to long-horizon information-seeking tasks and software-engineering benchmarks; training dynamics provide insights into stability and efficiency.

Conclusion: UI-TARS-2 advances GUI agents with improved scalability, stability, and generalization, showing robust performance across GUI and game tasks and promising applicability to real-world interactive scenarios.

Abstract: The development of autonomous agents for graphical user interfaces (GUIs)
presents major challenges in artificial intelligence. While recent advances in
native agent models have shown promise by unifying perception, reasoning,
action, and memory through end-to-end learning, open problems remain in data
scalability, multi-turn reinforcement learning (RL), the limitations of
GUI-only operation, and environment stability. In this technical report, we
present UI-TARS-2, a native GUI-centered agent model that addresses these
challenges through a systematic training methodology: a data flywheel for
scalable data generation, a stabilized multi-turn RL framework, a hybrid GUI
environment that integrates file systems and terminals, and a unified sandbox
platform for large-scale rollouts. Empirical evaluation demonstrates that
UI-TARS-2 achieves significant improvements over its predecessor UI-TARS-1.5.
On GUI benchmarks, it reaches 88.2 on Online-Mind2Web, 47.5 on OSWorld, 50.6 on
WindowsAgentArena, and 73.3 on AndroidWorld, outperforming strong baselines
such as Claude and OpenAI agents. In game environments, it attains a mean
normalized score of 59.8 across a 15-game suite-roughly 60% of human-level
performance-and remains competitive with frontier proprietary models (e.g.,
OpenAI o3) on LMGame-Bench. Additionally, the model can generalize to
long-horizon information-seeking tasks and software engineering benchmarks,
highlighting its robustness across diverse agent tasks. Detailed analyses of
training dynamics further provide insights into achieving stability and
efficiency in large-scale agent RL. These results underscore UI-TARS-2's
potential to advance the state of GUI agents and exhibit strong generalization
to real-world interactive scenarios.

Result: A formal framework and dual taxonomy for Agentic RL, plus a consolidated compendium of environments/benchmarks/frameworks. The survey maps the field’s landscape, clarifies opportunities and challenges, and provides guidance toward scalable, general-purpose AI agents.

Conclusion: Reinforcement learning is the critical mechanism for transforming agentic capabilities from static modules into adaptive, robust behaviors; the field is rapidly evolving, with a clear research roadmap and resource base to guide future work.

Abstract: The emergence of agentic reinforcement learning (Agentic RL) marks a paradigm
shift from conventional reinforcement learning applied to large language models
(LLM RL), reframing LLMs from passive sequence generators into autonomous,
decision-making agents embedded in complex, dynamic worlds. This survey
formalizes this conceptual shift by contrasting the degenerate single-step
Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) of LLM-RL with the temporally extended,
partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) that define Agentic RL.
Building on this foundation, we propose a comprehensive twofold taxonomy: one
organized around core agentic capabilities, including planning, tool use,
memory, reasoning, self-improvement, and perception, and the other around their
applications across diverse task domains. Central to our thesis is that
reinforcement learning serves as the critical mechanism for transforming these
capabilities from static, heuristic modules into adaptive, robust agentic
behavior. To support and accelerate future research, we consolidate the
landscape of open-source environments, benchmarks, and frameworks into a
practical compendium. By synthesizing over five hundred recent works, this
survey charts the contours of this rapidly evolving field and highlights the
opportunities and challenges that will shape the development of scalable,
general-purpose AI agents.

### [301] [Robotic Fire Risk Detection based on Dynamic Knowledge Graph Reasoning: An LLM-Driven Approach with Graph Chain-of-Thought](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00054)
*Haimei Pan,Jiyun Zhang,Qinxi Wei,Xiongnan Jin,Chen Xinkai,Jie Cheng*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A KG-driven, LLM/LMM-based framework (IOG) for fire rescue that fuses prevention guidelines and rescue docs into a KG, uses LMMs to generate perception-driven risk graphs from real-time imagery, enabling early risk detection and interpretable robot configuration; validated by simulations and real-world tests.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome incomplete perception, limited fire situational awareness, and delayed response in fire disasters, and to enhance pre-disaster warnings and disaster-time rescue via intelligent perception and response planning for robots.

Method: Build a knowledge graph from fire prevention guidelines and rescue task docs using LLMs; integrate KG with Large Multimodal Models in the Insights-on-Graph framework to produce perception-driven risk graphs from real-time imagery, enabling early risk detection and interpretable emergency responses for task modules and robot components.

Result: IOG shows good applicability and practical value in fire risk detection and rescue decision-making, validated through extensive simulations and real-world experiments.

Conclusion: IOG advances intelligent perception and response planning in fire scenarios by combining structured domain knowledge with multimodal perception, yielding interpretable, risk-aware robot configuration and timely emergency actions.

Abstract: Fire is a highly destructive disaster, but effective prevention can
significantly reduce its likelihood of occurrence. When it happens, deploying
emergency robots in fire-risk scenarios can help minimize the danger to human
responders. However, current research on pre-disaster warnings and
disaster-time rescue still faces significant challenges due to incomplete
perception, inadequate fire situational awareness, and delayed response. To
enhance intelligent perception and response planning for robots in fire
scenarios, we first construct a knowledge graph (KG) by leveraging large
language models (LLMs) to integrate fire domain knowledge derived from fire
prevention guidelines and fire rescue task information from robotic emergency
response documents. We then propose a new framework called Insights-on-Graph
(IOG), which integrates the structured fire information of KG and Large
Multimodal Models (LMMs). The framework generates perception-driven risk graphs
from real-time scene imagery to enable early fire risk detection and provide
interpretable emergency responses for task module and robot component
configuration based on the evolving risk situation. Extensive simulations and
real-world experiments show that IOG has good applicability and practical
application value in fire risk detection and rescue decision-making.

*Tongtong Feng,Xin Wang,Feilin Han,Leping Zhang,Wenwu Zhu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: First large-scale long-horizon swarm UAV dataset and online closed-loop verification platform (U2UData-2) enabling persistent-long-term autonomous flight research and wildlife-conservation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long-horizon (LH) UAV tasks require handling long-term dependencies, persistent states, and dynamic goal adaptation; existing datasets focus on basic tasks and fail to translate to real-world deployment for LH tasks.

Method: Collected data from 15 UAVs performing autonomous collaborative flights across 12 scenes, yielding 720 traces, 120 hours, 600 seconds per trajectory, 4.32M LiDAR frames and 12.96M RGB frames, plus environmental sensors (brightness, temperature, humidity, smoke, airflow). The authors built a scalable online platform enabling simulator/UAV/sensor/config customization, a visual control window for one-click data collection, and closed-loop algorithm verification; introduced a wildlife-conservation LH task and evaluated 9 SOTA models.

Result: Provides the first large-scale LH swarm UAV dataset and a scalable online collection/verification platform. It supports customizable LH tasks, comprehensive multimodal data, and benchmarks with 9 state-of-the-art models, enabling long-horizon research and real-world deployment prospects.

Conclusion: U2UData-2 advances LH swarm UAV research by delivering a comprehensive dataset and closed-loop platform for long-horizon tasks (e.g., wildlife conservation), bridging the gap between research and real-world deployment; the project is publicly accessible at the provided site.

Abstract: Swarm UAV autonomous flight for Long-Horizon (LH) tasks is crucial for
advancing the low-altitude economy. However, existing methods focus only on
specific basic tasks due to dataset limitations, failing in real-world
deployment for LH tasks. LH tasks are not mere concatenations of basic tasks,
requiring handling long-term dependencies, maintaining persistent states, and
adapting to dynamic goal shifts. This paper presents U2UData-2, the first
large-scale swarm UAV autonomous flight dataset for LH tasks and the first
scalable swarm UAV data online collection and algorithm closed-loop
verification platform. The dataset is captured by 15 UAVs in autonomous
collaborative flights for LH tasks, comprising 12 scenes, 720 traces, 120
hours, 600 seconds per trajectory, 4.32M LiDAR frames, and 12.96M RGB frames.
This dataset also includes brightness, temperature, humidity, smoke, and
airflow values covering all flight routes. The platform supports the
customization of simulators, UAVs, sensors, flight algorithms, formation modes,
and LH tasks. Through a visual control window, this platform allows users to
collect customized datasets through one-click deployment online and to verify
algorithms by closed-loop simulation. U2UData-2 also introduces an LH task for
wildlife conservation and provides comprehensive benchmarks with 9 SOTA models.

### [303] [Correspondence-Free, Function-Based Sim-to-Real Learning for Deformable Surface Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00060)
*Yingjun Tian,Guoxin Fang,Renbo Su,Aoran Lyu,Neelotpal Dutta,Simeon Gill,Andrew Weightman,Charlie C. L. Wang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A neural network-based, correspondence-free sim-to-real method that learns a deformation function space and a confidence map to align simulated shapes with real ones, enabling marker-free (or partially marked) transfer and integration into inverse kinematics/shape control for deformable surfaces across multiple soft robots.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional sim-to-real transfer for deformable surfaces relies on precise correspondences (marker points), which is fragile due to marker dropout and calibration. A correspondence-free approach that can use either 3D scans (point clouds) or marker data would enable robust, flexible transfer and seamless control integration.

Method: Train a neural network that jointly learns a deformation function space and a confidence map to map simulated shapes to real shapes. The method supports inputs from 3D scanner point clouds (no correspondences) or motion capture marker sets (tolerant of missing markers), enabling sim-to-real transfer that can be embedded in neural network-based inverse kinematics and shape-control pipelines.

Result: The method is demonstrated on four pneumatically actuated soft robots (a deformable membrane, a robotic mannequin, and two soft manipulators) and across vision devices, showing versatility, adaptability, and effective correspondence-free transfer for deformation control.

Conclusion: The approach provides a robust, flexible path for sim-to-real transfer of deformable surfaces without explicit correspondences, facilitating integration with neural IPC pipelines for inverse kinematics and real-time shape control across diverse soft-robot platforms.

Abstract: This paper presents a correspondence-free, function-based sim-to-real
learning method for controlling deformable freeform surfaces. Unlike
traditional sim-to-real transfer methods that strongly rely on marker points
with full correspondences, our approach simultaneously learns a deformation
function space and a confidence map -- both parameterized by a neural network
-- to map simulated shapes to their real-world counterparts. As a result, the
sim-to-real learning can be conducted by input from either a 3D scanner as
point clouds (without correspondences) or a motion capture system as marker
points (tolerating missed markers). The resultant sim-to-real transfer can be
seamlessly integrated into a neural network-based computational pipeline for
inverse kinematics and shape control. We demonstrate the versatility and
adaptability of our method on both vision devices and across four pneumatically
actuated soft robots: a deformable membrane, a robotic mannequin, and two soft
manipulators.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: OpenTie is a training-free 3D rebar tying framework that converts RGB to a point cloud and uses open-vocabulary, prompt-based detection to guide a robotic arm for horizontal and vertical rebar tying, validated in real-world settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current solutions focus on flat rebar settings and require training data, leaving a gap for 3D, training-free perception and manipulation in complex rebar scenarios on construction sites.

Method: Deploys OpenTie on a robotic arm with a binocular camera. It uses an image-to-point-cloud generation framework to filter targets, followed by prompt-based open-vocabulary object detection and a post-processing procedure to operate in 3D for rebar tying tasks.

Result: Real-world rebar experiments demonstrate high accuracy and practical effectiveness of the system.

Conclusion: OpenTie offers a practical, training-free 3D perception and manipulation pipeline for rebar tying with flexibility for both horizontal and vertical orientations, showing promise for deployment in construction environments.

Abstract: Robotic practices on the construction site emerge as an attention-attracting
manner owing to their capability of tackle complex challenges, especially in
the rebar-involved scenarios. Most of existing products and research are mainly
focused on flat rebar setting with model training demands. To fulfill this gap,
we propose OpenTie, a 3D training-free rebar tying framework utilizing a
RGB-to-point-cloud generation and an open-vocabulary detection. We implements
the OpenTie via a robotic arm with a binocular camera and guarantees a high
accuracy by applying the prompt-based object detection method on the image
filtered by our propose post-processing procedure based a image to point cloud
generation framework. The system is flexible for horizontal and vertical rebar
tying tasks and the experiments on the real-world rebar setting verifies that
the effectiveness of the system in practice.

### [305] [Hybrid Perception and Equivariant Diffusion for Robust Multi-Node Rebar Tying](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00065)
*Zhitao Wang,Yirong Xiong,Roberto Horowitz,Yanke Wang,Yuxing Han*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A hybrid perception and diffusion-EDFs planner enables robust multi-node rebar tying with minimal training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automating rebar tying is ergonomically risky and data-hungry; robust perception and planning are needed for dense, unstructured construction environments.

Method: Perception uses DBSCAN clustering, geometry-based node feature extraction, and PCA to segment rebar bars, identify nodes, and estimate orientation for sequential ranking. The motion planner uses Equivariant Diffusion on SE(3) (Diffusion-EDFs) trained on 5–10 demonstrations to generate sequential end-effector poses that optimize collision avoidance and tying efficiency.

Result: Validated on single-layer, multi-layer, and cluttered rebar meshes with high node detection and sequential tying success; demonstrates robustness with minimal data and favorable comparison to data-intensive conventional methods.

Conclusion: Hybrid perception and diffusion-driven planning can enhance on-site construction automation, improving safety and labor efficiency while reducing data requirements.

Abstract: Rebar tying is a repetitive but critical task in reinforced concrete
construction, typically performed manually at considerable ergonomic risk.
Recent advances in robotic manipulation hold the potential to automate the
tying process, yet face challenges in accurately estimating tying poses in
congested rebar nodes. In this paper, we introduce a hybrid perception and
motion planning approach that integrates geometry-based perception with
Equivariant Denoising Diffusion on SE(3) (Diffusion-EDFs) to enable robust
multi-node rebar tying with minimal training data. Our perception module
utilizes density-based clustering (DBSCAN), geometry-based node feature
extraction, and principal component analysis (PCA) to segment rebar bars,
identify rebar nodes, and estimate orientation vectors for sequential ranking,
even in complex, unstructured environments. The motion planner, based on
Diffusion-EDFs, is trained on as few as 5-10 demonstrations to generate
sequential end-effector poses that optimize collision avoidance and tying
efficiency. The proposed system is validated on various rebar meshes, including
single-layer, multi-layer, and cluttered configurations, demonstrating high
success rates in node detection and accurate sequential tying. Compared with
conventional approaches that rely on large datasets or extensive manual
parameter tuning, our method achieves robust, efficient, and adaptable
multi-node tying while significantly reducing data requirements. This result
underscores the potential of hybrid perception and diffusion-driven planning to
enhance automation in on-site construction tasks, improving both safety and
labor efficiency.

### [306] [A Comparative Study of Spline-Based Trajectory Reconstruction Methods Across Varying Automatic Vehicle Location Data Densities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00119)
*Jake Robbennolt,Sirajum Munira,Stephen D. Boyles*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Evaluates 13 trajectory reconstruction methods on Austin AVL data, finding velocity-aware approaches outperform position-only ones; smoothing can hurt in dense urban contexts; velocity-constrained Hermite interpolation with monotonicity enforcement (VCHIP-ME) offers best accuracy and efficiency; higher-frequency AVL data is valuable.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AVL data quality varies due to update frequency; reconstructing trajectories requires understanding method trade-offs and resource costs, especially across sparse vs dense data.

Method: Assess 13 reconstruction methods across four factors (velocity, position, smoothing, data density) using high-resolution AVL data from Austin; evaluate with traditional position/velocity errors plus physical realism constraints; compare across sparse and dense datasets; identify trade-offs and practical guidance.

Result: Velocity-aware methods consistently outperform position-only; smoothing-based methods can degrade performance in congested environments; enforcing monotonicity improves results; VCHIP-ME achieves optimal balance of accuracy and computational efficiency; high-frequency data enhances predictive power and applicability to both historical and real-time use.

Conclusion: Provide practical guidance for practitioners; emphasize investing in higher-frequency AVL collection; recommend VCHIP-ME for trajectory reconstruction; note importance of physical realism constraints; results inform method selection for infrastructure evaluations.

Abstract: Automatic vehicle location (AVL) data offers insights into transit dynamics,
but its effectiveness is often hampered by inconsistent update frequencies,
necessitating trajectory reconstruction. This research evaluates 13 trajectory
reconstruction methods, including several novel approaches, using
high-resolution AVL data from Austin, Texas. We examine the interplay of four
critical factors -- velocity, position, smoothing, and data density -- on
reconstruction performance. A key contribution of this study is evaluation of
these methods across sparse and dense datasets, providing insights into the
trade-off between accuracy and resource allocation. Our evaluation framework
combines traditional mathematical error metrics for positional and velocity
with practical considerations, such as physical realism (e.g., aligning
velocity and acceleration with stopped states, deceleration rates, and speed
variability). In addition, we provide insight into the relative value of each
method in calculating realistic metrics for infrastructure evaluations. Our
findings indicate that velocity-aware methods consistently outperform
position-only approaches. Interestingly, we discovered that smoothing-based
methods can degrade overall performance in complex, congested urban
environments, although enforcing monotonicity remains critical. The velocity
constrained Hermite interpolation with monotonicity enforcement (VCHIP-ME)
yields optimal results, offering a balance between high accuracy and
computational efficiency. Its minimal overhead makes it suitable for both
historical analysis and real-time applications, providing significant
predictive power when combined with dense datasets. These findings offer
practical guidance for researchers and practitioners implementing trajectory
reconstruction systems and emphasize the importance of investing in
higher-frequency AVL data collection for improved analysis.

### [307] [Poke and Strike: Learning Task-Informed Exploration Policies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00178)
*Marina Y. Aoyama,Joao Moura,Juan Del Aguila Ferrandis,Sethu Vijayakumar*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Task-informed reinforcement learning explores how to estimate object properties for dynamic tasks by rewarding sensitivity of a privileged task policy to estimation errors, with an uncertainty-based switch to execution; achieves fast, high-accuracy property estimation and robust task execution, validated on simulation and a KUKA iiwa robot.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In dynamic tasks where object properties are critical to success and failures cannot be easily retried, the agent must quickly learn which properties matter and how to estimate them to complete the task.

Method: Train an exploration policy with rewards derived from how sensitive the privileged task policy is to errors in estimated properties; use an uncertainty-based criterion to decide when exploration is sufficient and to transition to task execution; validate in striking pucks, CartPole, and a physical KUKA iiwa setup.

Result: Achieves 90% success in the striking task with average exploration time under 1.2 seconds; baselines reach at most 40% or require inefficient simulator retraining; the task-informed rewards reflect the relative importance of properties across tasks; successful identification of object properties and adjusted execution in a physical setup.

Conclusion: Task-informed exploration with uncertainty-based switching enables efficient property estimation and robust task execution, with demonstrated generalization to classic control tasks and physical robotic hardware.

Abstract: In many dynamic robotic tasks, such as striking pucks into a goal outside the
reachable workspace, the robot must first identify the relevant physical
properties of the object for successful task execution, as it is unable to
recover from failure or retry without human intervention. To address this
challenge, we propose a task-informed exploration approach, based on
reinforcement learning, that trains an exploration policy using rewards
automatically generated from the sensitivity of a privileged task policy to
errors in estimated properties. We also introduce an uncertainty-based
mechanism to determine when to transition from exploration to task execution,
ensuring sufficient property estimation accuracy with minimal exploration time.
Our method achieves a 90% success rate on the striking task with an average
exploration time under 1.2 seconds, significantly outperforming baselines that
achieve at most 40% success or require inefficient querying and retraining in a
simulator at test time. Additionally, we demonstrate that our task-informed
rewards capture the relative importance of physical properties in both the
striking task and the classical CartPole example. Finally, we validate our
approach by demonstrating its ability to identify object properties and adjust
task execution in a physical setup using the KUKA iiwa robot arm.

*Joseph Amigo,Rooholla Khorrambakht,Elliot Chane-Sane,Nicolas Mansard,Ludovic Righetti*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A hybrid RL method that unrolls trajectories with the (non-differentiable) simulator while backpropagating through a learned differentiable surrogate of the simulator to enable efficient first-order policy optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Simulator gradients can greatly improve learning but are often unavailable or costly to obtain; model-based RL that estimates them can suffer from compounded prediction errors and inefficiency.

Method: Unroll trajectories with the simulator while computing gradients via backpropagation through a learned differentiable model of the simulator; optionally learn a critic from simulation rollouts to improve value estimates; aim for efficient, stable first-order policy optimization with broad applicability.

Result: The approach attains sample efficiency and speed comparable to specialized optimizers like SHAC, while preserving the generality of PPO and avoiding instability seen in other first-order MBRL methods; validated on benchmark control tasks and on a real Go2 quadruped robot, across quadrupedal and bipedal locomotion tasks.

Conclusion: Decoupling trajectory generation from gradient computation—by unrolling with the simulator and differentiating through a learned simulator model—yields efficient, stable first-order policy optimization when simulator gradients are unavailable, combining strengths of model-based and model-free approaches.

Abstract: There is growing interest in reinforcement learning (RL) methods that
leverage the simulator's derivatives to improve learning efficiency. While
early gradient-based approaches have demonstrated superior performance compared
to derivative-free methods, accessing simulator gradients is often impractical
due to their implementation cost or unavailability. Model-based RL (MBRL) can
approximate these gradients via learned dynamics models, but the solver
efficiency suffers from compounding prediction errors during training rollouts,
which can degrade policy performance. We propose an approach that decouples
trajectory generation from gradient computation: trajectories are unrolled
using a simulator, while gradients are computed via backpropagation through a
learned differentiable model of the simulator. This hybrid design enables
efficient and consistent first-order policy optimization, even when simulator
gradients are unavailable, as well as learning a critic from simulation
rollouts, which is more accurate. Our method achieves the sample efficiency and
speed of specialized optimizers such as SHAC, while maintaining the generality
of standard approaches like PPO and avoiding ill behaviors observed in other
first-order MBRL methods. We empirically validate our algorithm on benchmark
control tasks and demonstrate its effectiveness on a real Go2 quadruped robot,
across both quadrupedal and bipedal locomotion tasks.

*Yishu Li,Xinyi Mao,Ying Yuan,Kyutae Sim,Ben Eisner,David Held*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: History-Aware Verifier (HAVE) decouples action generation from verification to disambiguate uncertain manipulation tasks by using an unconditional diffusion generator to propose actions and a history-based verifier to pick among them, improving expected action quality in varied environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robots face visually ambiguous objects where outcomes are uncertain until interaction; generative models alone underperform in ambiguity; leveraging past interactions can help disambiguate and select better actions.

Method: Generate multiple candidate actions with an unconditional diffusion-based generator; use a history-aware verifier that reasons about past interactions to select the most promising action; provide theoretical analysis showing verifier improves expected action quality; evaluate on simulated and real-world tasks (articulated objects, multi-modal doors, uneven object pick-up).

Result: Empirical results show HAVE and verifier outperform baselines and improve action quality across tasks; ablations/analysis support the effectiveness of history-aware verification.

Conclusion: Decoupling action generation from verification and incorporating action history yields more reliable disambiguation and improved manipulation performance in uncertain scenarios; the approach is validated in diverse environments and demonstrated on a public project page.

Abstract: We introduce a novel History-Aware VErifier (HAVE) to disambiguate uncertain
scenarios online by leveraging past interactions. Robots frequently encounter
visually ambiguous objects whose manipulation outcomes remain uncertain until
physically interacted with. While generative models alone could theoretically
adapt to such ambiguity, in practice they obtain suboptimal performance in
ambiguous cases, even when conditioned on action history. To address this, we
propose explicitly decoupling action generation from verification: we use an
unconditional diffusion-based generator to propose multiple candidate actions
and employ our history-aware verifier to select the most promising action by
reasoning about past interactions. Through theoretical analysis, we demonstrate
that employing a verifier significantly improves expected action quality.
Empirical evaluations and analysis across multiple simulated and real-world
environments including articulated objects, multi-modal doors, and uneven
object pick-up confirm the effectiveness of our method and improvements over
baselines. Our project website is available at:

### [311] [TReF-6: Inferring Task-Relevant Frames from a Single Demonstration for One-Shot Skill Generalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00310)
*Yuxuan Ding,Shuangge Wang,Tesca Fitzgerald*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A one-shot imitation method (TReF-6) learns a compact 6DoF task-relevant frame from a single trajectory, enabling robust, semantically grounded one-shot skills that generalize to new object configurations by grounding a frame in vision-language models and Grounded-SAM, and parameterizing a DMP for manipulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generalizing manipulation from a single demonstration is challenging due to lack of a transferable and interpretable spatial representation. A task-relevant frame that captures the essential geometry can enable reliable imitation across variations.

Method: Infer a 6DoF Task-Relevant Frame (TReF-6) from trajectory geometry by identifying an influence point that defines the frame origin. Use this frame to parameterize a Dynamic Movement Primitive (DMP). Semantically ground the inferred frame with a vision-language model and localize it in new scenes via Grounded-SAM, enabling cross-scene generalization. Validate in simulation (robust to noise) and deploy an end-to-end real-world imitation pipeline for one-shot learning across diverse object configurations.

Result: The approach yields a transferable, interpretable frame that supports DMP-based imitation and cross-scene generalization. It demonstrates robustness to trajectory noise in simulation and enables successful one-shot imitation in real-world tasks with diverse object configurations.

Conclusion: TReF-6 provides a concise, semantically grounded, task-relevant frame for one-shot imitation, extending standard DMPs beyond start-goal imitation and improving generalization across object configurations, though its reliance on semantic grounding components may affect performance in visually challenging environments.

Abstract: Robots often struggle to generalize from a single demonstration due to the
lack of a transferable and interpretable spatial representation. In this work,
we introduce TReF-6, a method that infers a simplified, abstracted 6DoF
Task-Relevant Frame from a single trajectory. Our approach identifies an
influence point purely from the trajectory geometry to define the origin for a
local frame, which serves as a reference for parameterizing a Dynamic Movement
Primitive (DMP). This influence point captures the task's spatial structure,
extending the standard DMP formulation beyond start-goal imitation. The
inferred frame is semantically grounded via a vision-language model and
localized in novel scenes by Grounded-SAM, enabling functionally consistent
skill generalization. We validate TReF-6 in simulation and demonstrate
robustness to trajectory noise. We further deploy an end-to-end pipeline on
real-world manipulation tasks, showing that TReF-6 supports one-shot imitation
learning that preserves task intent across diverse object configurations.

### [312] [A Framework for Task and Motion Planning based on Expanding AND/OR Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00317)
*Fulvio Mastrogiovanni,Antony Thomas*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: TMP-EAOG is an expanding AND/OR graph-based Task and Motion Planning framework for space robotics that couples task sequencing with in-the-loop motion feasibility, enabling robust, controllable, and adaptable autonomy; validated on two benchmark tasks with a simulated mobile manipulator.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Space robotics face high perception and motion uncertainty, strict kinematic constraints, and limited human intervention. A planning framework that integrates task-level abstractions with continuous motion feasibility and can adapt to uncertainty is needed.

Method: We propose TMP-EAOG: an expanding AND/OR graph that encodes task-level abstractions; plan expansion happens iteratively during execution; employs in-the-loop motion planning to check feasibility; allows human expert validation of the graph and provides alternative paths to handle unfeasible motions.

Result: Evaluation on two benchmarks using a simulated mobile manipulator shows TMP-EAOG handles a wide range of challenges, demonstrating robustness to uncertainty, controlled autonomy, and bounded flexibility.

Conclusion: TMP-EAOG provides a versatile, robust, and adaptable framework for autonomous space operations, combining discrete task planning with continuous feasibility checks, and enabling human-in-the-loop validation and fallback strategies.

Abstract: Robot autonomy in space environments presents unique challenges, including
high perception and motion uncertainty, strict kinematic constraints, and
limited opportunities for human intervention. Therefore, Task and Motion
Planning (TMP) may be critical for autonomous servicing, surface operations, or
even in-orbit missions, just to name a few, as it models tasks as discrete
action sequencing integrated with continuous motion feasibility assessments. In
this paper, we introduce a TMP framework based on expanding AND/OR graphs,
referred to as TMP-EAOG, and demonstrate its adaptability to different
scenarios. TMP-EAOG encodes task-level abstractions within an AND/OR graph,
which expands iteratively as the plan is executed, and performs in-the-loop
motion planning assessments to ascertain their feasibility. As a consequence,
TMP-EAOG is characterised by the desirable properties of (i) robustness to a
certain degree of uncertainty, because AND/OR graph expansion can accommodate
for unpredictable information about the robot environment, (ii) controlled
autonomy, since an AND/OR graph can be validated by human experts, and (iii)
bounded flexibility, in that unexpected events, including the assessment of
unfeasible motions, can lead to different courses of action as alternative
paths in the AND/OR graph. We evaluate TMP-EAOG on two benchmark domains. We
use a simulated mobile manipulator as a proxy for space-grade autonomous
robots. Our evaluation shows that TMP-EAOG can deal with a wide range of
challenges in the benchmarks.

*Chi Kit Ng,Huxin Gao,Tian-Ao Ren,Jiewen Lai,Hongliang Ren*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A DRL-based Contact-Aided Navigation (CAN) strategy for flexible endoscopes using contact force feedback and PPO in a FEM-based stomach simulation, achieving near-perfect navigation accuracy and strong robustness, outperforming baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Navigating a flexible endoscope in a deformable stomach is challenging due to dynamic contact with soft walls. Incorporating contact force feedback through DRL can improve stability, precision, and robustness during navigation.

Method: Train a CAN DRL policy within a physics-based FEM simulation of a deformable stomach using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). The policy leverages contact force feedback to guide motion, validated in static, dynamic, and unseen/uncontrolled disturbance scenarios, and compared against baseline policies.

Result: In static and dynamic stomach environments, CAN achieved 100% success with an average end-effector error of 1.6 mm. In challenging unseen scenarios with stronger disturbances, CAN maintained 85% success. It substantially outperformed prior methods.

Conclusion: DRL-based CAN with contact force feedback improves FRE navigation performance in deformable environments and shows strong robustness and accuracy, suggesting notable potential for safer and more precise endoscopic procedures.

Abstract: Navigating a flexible robotic endoscope (FRE) through the gastrointestinal
tract is critical for surgical diagnosis and treatment. However, navigation in
the dynamic stomach is particularly challenging because the FRE must learn to
effectively use contact with the deformable stomach walls to reach target
locations. To address this, we introduce a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)
based Contact-Aided Navigation (CAN) strategy for FREs, leveraging contact
force feedback to enhance motion stability and navigation precision. The
training environment is established using a physics-based finite element method
(FEM) simulation of a deformable stomach. Trained with the Proximal Policy
Optimization (PPO) algorithm, our approach achieves high navigation success
rates (within 3 mm error between the FRE's end-effector and target) and
significantly outperforms baseline policies. In both static and dynamic stomach
environments, the CAN agent achieved a 100% success rate with 1.6 mm average
error, and it maintained an 85% success rate in challenging unseen scenarios
with stronger external disturbances. These results validate that the DRL-based
CAN strategy substantially enhances FRE navigation performance over prior
methods.

### [314] [Mechanistic interpretability for steering vision-language-action models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00328)
*Bear Häon,Kaylene Stocking,Ian Chuang,Claire Tomlin*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A framework to interpret and steer Vision-Language-Action models via their internal activations, enabling real-time, zero-shot control without fine-tuning—validated on Pi0/OpenVLA across simulation and a UR5 robot.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLAs currently lack mechanistic interpretability and controllability, which limits robustness and explainability for real-world robotics. Inspired by mechanistic interpretability in LLMs, the work seeks transparent, intervention-ready control of learned agents.

Method: Project feedforward transformer activations onto the token embedding basis to find sparse, semantically meaningful directions (e.g., speed, direction) that causally influence action selection. Introduce a real-time activation-steering mechanism that modulates behavior without fine-tuning, reward shaping, or environment interaction.

Result: Demonstrated zero-shot behavioral control in simulation (LIBERO) and on a physical UR5 robot using two open-source VLAs (Pi0 and OpenVLA). The approach shows actionable, interpretable control signals derived from internal representations.

Conclusion: Interpretable components within embodied VLAs can be leveraged for direct control, enabling a transparent and steerable class of foundation models in robotics and raising prospects for safer, more robust deployment.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models are a promising path to realizing
generalist embodied agents that can quickly adapt to new tasks, modalities, and
environments. However, methods for interpreting and steering VLAs fall far
short of classical robotics pipelines, which are grounded in explicit models of
kinematics, dynamics, and control. This lack of mechanistic insight is a
central challenge for deploying learned policies in real-world robotics, where
robustness and explainability are critical. Motivated by advances in
mechanistic interpretability for large language models, we introduce the first
framework for interpreting and steering VLAs via their internal
representations, enabling direct intervention in model behavior at inference
time. We project feedforward activations within transformer layers onto the
token embedding basis, identifying sparse semantic directions - such as speed
and direction - that are causally linked to action selection. Leveraging these
findings, we introduce a general-purpose activation steering method that
modulates behavior in real time, without fine-tuning, reward signals, or
environment interaction. We evaluate this method on two recent open-source
VLAs, Pi0 and OpenVLA, and demonstrate zero-shot behavioral control in
simulation (LIBERO) and on a physical robot (UR5). This work demonstrates that
interpretable components of embodied VLAs can be systematically harnessed for
control - establishing a new paradigm for transparent and steerable foundation
models in robotics.

### [315] [Jacobian Exploratory Dual-Phase Reinforcement Learning for Dynamic Endoluminal Navigation of Deformable Continuum Robots](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00329)
*Yu Tian,Chi Kit Ng,Hongliang Ren*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: JEDP-RL: a Jacobian-guided dual-phase RL for deformable continuum robots that estimates a deformation Jacobian via local exploration and augments the state to restore Markovianity, yielding faster convergence, fewer steps, and better generalization than PPO in SOFA simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DCRs deform nonlinearly and have partial observability, breaking Markov assumptions; rigid-robot Jacobian methods don't transfer due to time-varying kinematics and underactuated deformation.

Method: Two-phase training: (1) local exploratory actions to estimate a deformation Jacobian at each step; (2) augment state with Jacobian features and execute policy; compare against PPO in SOFA surgical dynamics simulations.

Result: JEDP-RL converges 3.2x faster than PPO, uses 25% fewer steps to reach target, and shows strong generalization: 92% success under material-property variations and 83% (33% higher than PPO) in unseen tissue environments.

Conclusion: Jacobian-based state augmentation for deformable robots improves learning efficiency and generalization; promising for planning under nonstationary, partially observable deformation dynamics, with validation in a physics-based simulator.

Abstract: Deformable continuum robots (DCRs) present unique planning challenges due to
nonlinear deformation mechanics and partial state observability, violating the
Markov assumptions of conventional reinforcement learning (RL) methods. While
Jacobian-based approaches offer theoretical foundations for rigid manipulators,
their direct application to DCRs remains limited by time-varying kinematics and
underactuated deformation dynamics. This paper proposes Jacobian Exploratory
Dual-Phase RL (JEDP-RL), a framework that decomposes planning into phased
Jacobian estimation and policy execution. During each training step, we first
perform small-scale local exploratory actions to estimate the deformation
Jacobian matrix, then augment the state representation with Jacobian features
to restore approximate Markovianity. Extensive SOFA surgical dynamic
simulations demonstrate JEDP-RL's three key advantages over proximal policy
optimization (PPO) baselines: 1) Convergence speed: 3.2x faster policy
convergence, 2) Navigation efficiency: requires 25% fewer steps to reach the
target, and 3) Generalization ability: achieve 92% success rate under material
property variations and achieve 83% (33% higher than PPO) success rate in the
unseen tissue environment.

Method: A generative video model predicts future RGB-D frames from a single side-view RGB image and a task description to provide visual plans. A decoupled pose estimation model extracts end-effector poses from the predicted frames and converts them into executable commands via low-level controllers. The system is closed-loop, iteratively integrating video foresight and pose estimation for real-time adaptation.

Result: Real-time, adaptive manipulation across a broad range of tasks demonstrated in both simulation and real-world settings. The approach reduces reliance on task-specific action data and generalizes effectively.

Conclusion: GVF-TAPE offers a practical, scalable solution for intelligent robotic systems by leveraging vision-based foresight and pose estimation in a closed loop to achieve broad generalization with less task-specific data.

Abstract: Robotic manipulation in unstructured environments requires systems that can

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Two extended diffeomorphism designs map primary to follower robot poses using predefined workspace key points, enabling smoother and more accurate teleoperation across different workspaces; validated with a dual-arm UR5, showing improved precision and motion smoothness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To compensate spatial placement differences between robot workspaces for real-time multi-robot teleoperation and faithful motion reproduction.

Method: Develop two extended diffeomorphism designs that generate smooth pose mappings between robots based on predefined key points in each workspace, balancing mapping error (precision) and gradient (smoothness); validated via a dual-arm UR5 picking task.

Result: The mapping method reduces both pose error and motion gradient, enabling accurate and smooth replicated movements across workspaces in teleoperation.

Conclusion: The proposed extended diffeomorphism-based mapping enhances real-time, precise, and smooth multi-robot teleoperation across spatially different workspaces.

Abstract: This paper presents two types of extended diffeomorphism designs to
compensate for spatial placement differences between robot workspaces.
Teleoperation of multiple robots is attracting attention to expand the
utilization of the robot embodiment. Real-time reproduction of robot motion
would facilitate the efficient execution of similar tasks by multiple robots. A
challenge in the motion reproduction is compensating for the spatial
arrangement errors of target keypoints in robot workspaces. This paper proposes
a methodology for smooth mappings that transform primary robot poses into
follower robot poses based on the predefined key points in each workspace.
Through a picking task experiment using a dual-arm UR5 robot, this study
demonstrates that the proposed mapping generation method can balance lower
mapping errors for precise operation and lower mapping gradients for smooth
replicated movement.

*Arman Javan Sekhavat Pishkhani*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A gray-box Computed Torque Controller tuned by Twin-Delayed DDPG enables sample-efficient, stable tracking for differential-drive robots by constraining parameters and enforcing damping, validated in MuJoCo against CTM and a kinematic controller.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CTM suffers from parameter uncertainty; DRL is sample-inefficient and lacks strong stability guarantees. A gray-box approach aims to combine physics-based control with learned optimization to achieve stable performance with fewer learning episodes.

Method: Replace a DRL policy with a gray-box Computed Torque Controller whose parameters are optimized by TD3. Enforce parameter bounds to ensure physical plausibility and apply a mechanism to achieve critically damped closed-loop response. Validate on a simulated differential-drive robot in MuJoCo and compare to raw CTC and a conventional kinematic controller.

Result: The approach enables finding an optimal set of controller parameters for an arbitrary reward function using only a few short learning episodes, and demonstrates improved closed-loop stability and sample efficiency in simulation compared to baselines.

Conclusion: A gray-box CTC optimized via TD3 offers a practical, data-efficient, and stable control framework for differential-drive robots, with physically plausible parameter learning and applicability to arbitrary reward structures; it outperforms pure CTC and conventional kinematic control in the reported simulations.

Abstract: This study presents a learning-based nonlinear algorithm for tracking control
of differential-drive mobile robots. The Computed Torque Method (CTM) suffers
from inaccurate knowledge of system parameters, while Deep Reinforcement
Learning (DRL) algorithms are known for sample inefficiency and weak stability
guarantees. The proposed method replaces the black-box policy network of a DRL
agent with a gray-box Computed Torque Controller (CTC) to improve sample
efficiency and ensure closed-loop stability. This approach enables finding an
optimal set of controller parameters for an arbitrary reward function using
only a few short learning episodes. The Twin-Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy
Gradient (TD3) algorithm is used for this purpose. Additionally, some
controller parameters are constrained to lie within known value ranges,
ensuring the RL agent learns physically plausible values. A technique is also
applied to enforce a critically damped closed-loop time response. The
controller's performance is evaluated on a differential-drive mobile robot
simulated in the MuJoCo physics engine and compared against the raw CTC and a
conventional kinematic controller.

*Philip Lorimer,Alan Hunter,Wenbin Li*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: GAIL-based Learning from Demonstrations enables autonomous cinematic dolly-in shots with direct sim-to-real transfer, outperforming RL baselines without custom rewards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cinematic camera control requires both precision and artistry; handcrafted rewards in RL are brittle and hamper creative usability. A reward-free LfD approach aims for intuitive, stylized control and real-world deployment with minimal tuning.

Method: Train a GAIL policy on expert joystick teleoperation trajectories collected in simulation for dolly-in shots with a ground-based filming robot. The policy is learned exclusively from demonstrations, without explicit objective design, and is evaluated against RL baselines (PPO in simulation; TD3 in real world) for sim-to-real performance.

Result: In simulation, the GAIL policy outperforms PPO in rewards, convergence speed, and variance. It transfers directly to a real-world robot without fine-tuning, achieving more consistent framing and subject alignment than a prior TD3-based method.

Conclusion: LfD with GAIL offers a robust, reward-free alternative to RL for cinematic robotics, enabling real-time deployment with minimal technical effort and bridging artistic intent with robotic autonomy.

Abstract: Cinematic camera control demands a balance of precision and artistry -
qualities that are difficult to encode through handcrafted reward functions.
While reinforcement learning (RL) has been applied to robotic filmmaking, its
reliance on bespoke rewards and extensive tuning limits creative usability. We
propose a Learning from Demonstration (LfD) approach using Generative
Adversarial Imitation Learning (GAIL) to automate dolly-in shots with a
free-roaming, ground-based filming robot. Expert trajectories are collected via
joystick teleoperation in simulation, capturing smooth, expressive motion
without explicit objective design.
  Trained exclusively on these demonstrations, our GAIL policy outperforms a
PPO baseline in simulation, achieving higher rewards, faster convergence, and
lower variance. Crucially, it transfers directly to a real-world robot without
fine-tuning, achieving more consistent framing and subject alignment than a
prior TD3-based method. These results show that LfD offers a robust,
reward-free alternative to RL in cinematic domains, enabling real-time
deployment with minimal technical effort. Our pipeline brings intuitive,
stylized camera control within reach of creative professionals, bridging the

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A large open-world robotic dataset with language-annotated subgoals enables a two-component system (G0) for multimodal planning and fine-grained execution, trained via a three-stage curriculum, achieving strong manipulation performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable robust, language-conditioned manipulation in diverse, authentic human environments, addressing limits of closed, scripted datasets and single-embodiment setups.

Method: Introduce Galaxea Open-World Dataset with consistent robotic embodiment and subtask-level language annotations; propose G0 — a Vision-Language Model for planning (VLM) and a Vision-Language-Action model for execution (VLA); train with a three-stage curriculum: cross-embodiment pre-training, single-embodiment pre-training, and task-specific post-training.

Result: Benchmark results across tabletop manipulation, few-shot learning, and long-horizon mobile manipulation show the approach is effective; ablations indicate the single-embodiment pre-training stage and the dataset are critical for strong performance.

Conclusion: The Galaxea dataset and G0 framework offer a practical pathway to open-world, language-guided robotic manipulation, with the pre-training strategy and dataset diversity being key contributors to success.

Abstract: We present Galaxea Open-World Dataset, a large-scale, diverse collection of
robot behaviors recorded in authentic human living and working environments.
All demonstrations are gathered using a consistent robotic embodiment, paired
with precise subtask-level language annotations to facilitate both training and
evaluation. Building on this dataset, we introduce G0, a dual-system framework
that couples a Vision-Language Model (VLM) for multimodal planning with a
Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model for fine-grained execution. G0 is trained
using a three-stage curriculum: cross-embodiment pre-training,
single-embodiment pre-training, and task-specific post-training. A
comprehensive benchmark spanning tabletop manipulation, few-shot learning, and
long-horizon mobile manipulation, demonstrates the effectiveness of our
approach. In particular, we find that the single-embodiment pre-training stage,
together with the Galaxea Open-World Dataset, plays a critical role in
achieving strong performance.

*Rui Bai,Rui Xu,Teng Rui,Jiale Liu,Qi Wei Oung,Hoi Leong Lee,Zhen Tian,Fujiang Yuan*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A TTC-integrated double quintic polynomial trajectory planner for safe, real-time lane-changing in mixed traffic, offering safety-aware generation without post-hoc validation and outperforming standard curve methods in simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Lane-changing in mixed traffic with HDVs requires proactive safety guarantees and comfortable interactions. Current trajectory methods struggle to guarantee safety in real-time, especially with dynamic surrounding vehicles.

Method: Proposes an improved double quintic polynomial trajectory generation framework that embeds a time-to-collision (TTC) penalty directly into the closed-form solver. Includes state estimation for the ego and surrounding HDVs, real-time TTC computation, and adaptive trajectory evaluation to produce safety-aware trajectories.

Result: Extensive simulations across diverse traffic scenarios show the approach achieves safety, efficiency, and comfort, avoiding collisions and producing smooth transitions. It outperforms quintic polynomials, Bezier curves, and B-splines in the tested metrics.

Conclusion: The work delivers a real-time, safety-aware trajectory generation method by integrating TTC analytically into the double-quintic solver, bridging model-based planning and adaptive techniques, and offering a stable solution for real-world autonomous driving.

Abstract: Autonomous driving technology has made significant advancements in recent
years, yet challenges remain in ensuring safe and comfortable interactions with
human-driven vehicles (HDVs), particularly during lane-changing maneuvers. This
paper proposes an improved double quintic polynomial approach for safe and
efficient lane-changing in mixed traffic environments. The proposed method
integrates a time-to-collision (TTC) based evaluation mechanism directly into
the trajectory optimization process, ensuring that the ego vehicle proactively
maintains a safe gap from surrounding HDVs throughout the maneuver. The
framework comprises state estimation for both the autonomous vehicle (AV) and
HDVs, trajectory generation using double quintic polynomials, real-time TTC
computation, and adaptive trajectory evaluation. To the best of our knowledge,
this is the first work to embed an analytic TTC penalty directly into the
closed-form double-quintic polynomial solver, enabling real-time safety-aware
trajectory generation without post-hoc validation. Extensive simulations
conducted under diverse traffic scenarios demonstrate the safety, efficiency,
and comfort of the proposed approach compared to conventional methods such as
quintic polynomials, Bezier curves, and B-splines. The results highlight that
the improved method not only avoids collisions but also ensures smooth
transitions and adaptive decision-making in dynamic environments. This work
bridges the gap between model-based and adaptive trajectory planning
approaches, offering a stable solution for real-world autonomous driving
applications.

Conclusion: The work advances unified VRU safety concepts in ADS via VVE-based evaluation, addressing key gaps and laying groundwork for broader testing and eventual real-world validation, including bicyclist safety.

Abstract: Extensive research has already been conducted in the autonomous driving field
to help vehicles navigate safely and efficiently. At the same time, plenty of
current research on vulnerable road user (VRU) safety is performed which
largely concentrates on perception, localization, or trajectory prediction of
VRUs. However, existing research still exhibits several gaps, including the
lack of a unified planning and collision avoidance system for autonomous
vehicles, limited investigation into delay tolerant control strategies, and the
absence of an efficient and standardized testing methodology. Ensuring VRU
safety remains one of the most pressing challenges in autonomous driving,
particularly in dynamic and unpredictable environments. In this two year
project, we focused on applying the Vehicle in Virtual Environment (VVE) method
to develop, evaluate, and demonstrate safety functions for Vulnerable Road
Users (VRUs) using automated steering and braking of ADS. In this current
second year project report, our primary focus was on enhancing the previous

Conclusion: The DHF-enhanced QP-MPC trajectory planning framework offers improved safety–efficiency–comfort trade-offs and broad validation relevance, indicating strong potential for robust autonomous driving performance in dynamic environments.

Abstract: Trajectory planning is a critical component in ensuring the safety,
stability, and efficiency of autonomous vehicles. While existing trajectory
planning methods have achieved progress, they often suffer from high
computational costs, unstable performance in dynamic environments, and limited
validation across diverse scenarios. To overcome these challenges, we propose
an enhanced QP-MPC-based framework that incorporates three key innovations: (i)
a novel cost function designed with a dynamic hazard field, which explicitly
balances safety, efficiency, and comfort; (ii) seamless integration of this
cost function into the QP-MPC formulation, enabling direct optimization of
desired driving behaviors; and (iii) extensive validation of the proposed
framework across complex tasks. The spatial safe planning is guided by a
dynamic hazard field (DHF) for risk assessment, while temporal safe planning is
based on a space-time graph. Besides, the quintic polynomial sampling and
sub-reward of comforts are used to ensure comforts during lane-changing. The
sub-reward of efficiency is used to maintain driving efficiency. Finally, the
proposed DHF-enhanced objective function integrates multiple objectives,
providing a proper optimization tasks for QP-MPC. Extensive simulations
demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms benchmark optimization
methods in terms of efficiency, stability, and comfort across a variety of
scenarios likes lane-changing, overtaking, and crossing intersections.

Conclusion: CARIS provides a publicly available, context-adaptable tool for the HRI community, enabling researchers to streamline data-driven approaches to building intelligent robot behavior across diverse settings.

Abstract: The human-robot interaction (HRI) field has traditionally used Wizard-of-Oz
(WoZ) controlled robots to explore navigation, conversational dynamics,
human-in-the-loop interactions, and more to explore appropriate robot behaviors
in everyday settings. However, existing WoZ tools are often limited to one

robotic platforms. To mitigate these issues, we introduce a Context-Adaptable
Robot Interface System (CARIS) that combines advanced robotic capabilities such
teleoperation, human perception, human-robot dialogue, and multimodal data
recording. Through pilot studies, we demonstrate the potential of CARIS to WoZ
control a robot in two contexts: 1) mental health companion and as a 2) tour
guide. Furthermore, we identified areas of improvement for CARIS, including
smoother integration between movement and communication, clearer functionality

Conclusion: Proposes DyPho-SLAM as a resource-efficient, robust solution for dynamic environments, combining refined masking and adaptive features with Gaussian Splatting to improve pose accuracy and dense mapping in dynamic scenes.

Abstract: Visual SLAM algorithms have been enhanced through the exploration of Gaussian
Splatting representations, particularly in generating high-fidelity dense maps.
While existing methods perform reliably in static environments, they often
encounter camera tracking drift and fuzzy mapping when dealing with the
disturbances caused by moving objects. This paper presents DyPho-SLAM, a
real-time, resource-efficient visual SLAM system designed to address the
challenges of localization and photorealistic mapping in environments with
dynamic objects. Specifically, the proposed system integrates prior image
information to generate refined masks, effectively minimizing noise from mask
misjudgment. Additionally, to enhance constraints for optimization after
removing dynamic obstacles, we devise adaptive feature extraction strategies
significantly improving the system's resilience. Experiments conducted on
publicly dynamic RGB-D datasets demonstrate that the proposed system achieves

### [333] [Inverse Kinematics for a 6-Degree-of-Freedom Robot Manipulator Using Comprehensive Gröbner Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00823)
*Takumu Okazaki,Akira Terui,Masahiko Mikawa*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Proposes a computer-algebra-based method to solve inverse kinematics for a class of 6-DOF manipulators, extending solvability to cases where two consecutive joint axes intersect, via Comprehensive Gröbner System (CGS) with joint parameters as coefficients; experiments validate effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Inverse kinematics for 6-DOF manipulators is computationally challenging; existing methods succeed when three consecutive joint axes intersect. Extending to manipulators where two consecutive axes intersect broadens solvable robots and can lead to more efficient, symbolic solutions.

Method: Model the IK problem using computer algebra and Comprehensive Gröbner Systems (CGS). Treat joint parameters as parameters in CGS coefficients to avoid repeated Gr"obner basis recalculation. Begin from the known case with three intersecting axes and extend to the case with two consecutive intersecting axes, solving for position and orientation separately and reconstructing joint variables from the algebraic solutions.

Result: Experiments demonstrate the method’s effectiveness, showing that CGS-based symbolic solving is feasible and beneficial for the extended class of 6-DOF manipulators, with reduced recomputation and successful IK solutions in tested scenarios.

Conclusion: The approach broadens the range of 6-DOF manipulators for which IK can be solved symbolically and more efficiently, by leveraging CGS with parameterized coefficients to avoid repeated calculations.

Abstract: We propose an effective method for solving the inverse kinematic problem of a
specific model of 6-degree-of-freedom (6-DOF) robot manipulator using computer
algebra. It is known that when the rotation axes of three consecutive
rotational joints of a manipulator intersect at a single point, the inverse
kinematics problem can be divided into determining position and orientation. We
extend this method to more general manipulators in which the rotational axes of
two consecutive joints intersect. This extension broadens the class of 6-DOF
manipulators for which the inverse kinematics problem can be solved, and is
expected to enable more efficient solutions. The inverse kinematic problem is
solved using the Comprehensive Gr\"obner System (CGS) with joint parameters of
the robot appearing as parameters in the coefficients to prevent repetitive
calculations of the Gr\"obner bases. The effectiveness of the proposed method
is shown by experiments.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A three-step, IK-aware path-planning framework for a 6-DOF manipulator that uses feasible-region analysis and a shortest-path optimization over IK solutions at via-points, validated experimentally.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To handle inverse-kinematics ambiguity and ensure feasible, optimal trajectories along a prescribed end-effector path for a 6-DOF manipulator, by integrating algebraic methods with graph-based optimization.

Method: 1) Compute the feasible region for a given end-effector configuration. 2) Determine a trajectory along the given line-segment path and a corresponding sequence of joint configurations. 3) Construct a graph of IK solutions at via-points and solve for the optimal sequence using Dijkstra's algorithm, leveraging computer algebra.

Result: Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Conclusion: The approach provides an effective framework for optimizing path planning for a 6-DOF manipulator by combining inverse kinematics, feasible-region analysis, and shortest-path optimization.

Abstract: An effective method for optimizing path planning for a specific model of a
6-degree-of-freedom (6-DOF) robot manipulator is presented as part of the
motion planning of the manipulator using computer algebra. We assume that we
are given a path in the form of a set of line segments that the end-effector
should follow. We also assume that we have a method to solve the inverse
kinematic problem of the manipulator at each via-point of the trajectory. The
proposed method consists of three steps. First, we calculate the feasible
region of the manipulator under a specific configuration of the end-effector.
Next, we aim to find a trajectory on the line segments and a sequence of joint
configurations the manipulator should follow to move the end-effector along the
specified trajectory. Finally, we find the optimal combination of solutions to
the inverse kinematic problem at each via-point along the trajectory by
reducing the problem to a shortest-path problem of the graph and applying
Dijkstra's algorithm. We show the effectiveness of the proposed method by
experiments.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A framework that combines Configuration Space Distance Fields (CDFs) with Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) control to do fast, one-step horizon motion planning in joint space, achieving robust collision avoidance with high success and ultra-fast control rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations of gradient-based SDF methods (local minima, vanishing gradients) and gradient-free MPPI’s computational burden by leveraging differentiable CDFs for reliable gradient information in configuration space, enabling efficient high-dimensional planning.

Method: Integrate CDF gradients into MPPI in joint space and reduce the horizon to a single step, performing direct navigation in the robot’s configuration space. Demonstrated in 2D scenarios and challenging 7-DOF Franka simulations with complex obstacles, achieving high update rates (over 750 Hz).

Result: High success: near 100% in 2D environments and consistently high in 7-DOF Franka simulations with obstacles. Control frequencies exceed 750 Hz, outperforming both optimization-based and standard MPPI baselines.

Conclusion: CDF-MPPI provides an effective, efficient approach for high-dimensional, collision-avoiding motion planning by exploiting differentiable CDFs for reliable gradient information and a one-step horizon to attain real-time performance and strong success rates.

Abstract: Motion planning for robotic manipulators is a fundamental problem in
robotics. Classical optimization-based methods typically rely on the gradients
of signed distance fields (SDFs) to impose collision-avoidance constraints.
However, these methods are susceptible to local minima and may fail when the
SDF gradients vanish. Recently, Configuration Space Distance Fields (CDFs) have
been introduced, which directly model distances in the robot's configuration
space. Unlike workspace SDFs, CDFs are differentiable almost everywhere and
thus provide reliable gradient information. On the other hand, gradient-free
approaches such as Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) control leverage
long-horizon rollouts to achieve collision avoidance. While effective, these
methods are computationally expensive due to the large number of trajectory
samples, repeated collision checks, and the difficulty of designing cost
functions with heterogeneous physical units. In this paper, we propose a
framework that integrates CDFs with MPPI to enable direct navigation in the
robot's configuration space. Leveraging CDF gradients, we unify the MPPI cost
in joint-space and reduce the horizon to one step, substantially cutting
computation while preserving collision avoidance in practice. We demonstrate
that our approach achieves nearly 100% success rates in 2D environments and
consistently high success rates in challenging 7-DOF Franka manipulator
simulations with complex obstacles. Furthermore, our method attains control
frequencies exceeding 750 Hz, substantially outperforming both
optimization-based and standard MPPI baselines. These results highlight the
effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed CDF-MPPI framework for
high-dimensional motion planning.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A fast, reactive grasping framework for high-DoF robotic hands that merges task-space velocity fields with a hierarchical joint-space QP, enabling real-time, collision-free reaching by planning in low-dimensional task space and tracking in full joint space.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-DoF planning suffers combinatorial explosion in state space and planning horizon, making real-time planning difficult. The work targets robust, collision-free grasping in dynamic environments by reducing planning dimensionality and handling constraints.

Method: Construct velocity fields in multiple task-space coordinates (e.g., fingertip positions) or a subset of joints, and solve a weighted joint-space QP to compute joint velocities that track these fields with assigned priorities. Plan globally in task space and track locally in the full joint space within a hierarchical framework, enforcing constraints. Evaluations include simulations (with privileged knowledge) and real-world tests using FoundationPose for pose tracking.

Result: Demonstrates real-time, collision-free reaching motions for high-DoF arm-hand systems in dynamic environments and under disturbances, validated through simulations and real-world experiments.

Conclusion: A hierarchical, task-space velocity-field plus joint-space QP approach enables fast, reactive grasping for high-DoF hands, combining low-dimensional global planning with local, constraint-aware execution.

Abstract: We present a fast and reactive grasping framework for multi-DoF grippers that
combines task-space velocity fields with a joint-space Quadratic Program (QP)
in a hierarchical structure. Reactive, collision-free global motion planning is
particularly challenging for high-DoF systems, since simultaneous increases in
state dimensionality and planning horizon trigger a combinatorial explosion of
the search space, making real-time planning intractable. To address this, we
plan globally in a lower-dimensional task space, such as fingertip positions,
and track locally in the full joint space while enforcing all constraints. This
approach is realized by constructing velocity fields in multiple task-space
coordinates (or in some cases a subset of joint coordinates) and solving a
weighted joint-space QP to compute joint velocities that track these fields
with appropriately assigned priorities. Through simulation experiments with
privileged knowledge and real-world tests using the recent pose-tracking
algorithm FoundationPose, we verify that our method enables high-DoF arm-hand
systems to perform real-time, collision-free reaching motions while adapting to
dynamic environments and external disturbances.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Proposes FPE-based Model Predictive Control (FPE-MPC) to govern the probability distribution of a soft robotic finger, addressing high uncertainty with stochastic dynamics; demonstrated via two numerical simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Soft robots' inherent flexibility enables adaptability and safety but leads to highly uncertain, nonlinear dynamics. Open-loop and deterministic models struggle under this uncertainty, motivating a probabilistic control approach using the Fokker-Planck Equation.

Method: Model the state distribution evolution with the Fokker-Planck Equation and apply MPC on the distribution (FPE-MPC) to compute control inputs. Validate with two numerical simulation case studies on a soft robotic finger to assess performance under stochastic effects.

Result: Two numerical simulations show that FPE-MPC can manage uncertainty in soft robotic systems, effectively shaping the state distribution and improving performance under stochastic dynamics.

Conclusion: FPE-MPC is a promising probabilistic control framework for soft robots with uncertain dynamics, capable of steering the probability distribution instead of exact states; future work could include experimental validation, comparison with other stochastic controllers, and computational optimization.

Abstract: The inherent flexibility of soft robots offers numerous advantages, such as
enhanced adaptability and improved safety. However, this flexibility can also
introduce challenges regarding highly uncertain and nonlinear motion. These
challenges become particularly problematic when using open-loop control
methods, which lack a feedback mechanism and are commonly employed in soft
robot control. Though one potential solution is model-based control, typical
deterministic models struggle with uncertainty as mentioned above. The idea is
to use the Fokker-Planck Equation (FPE), a master equation of a stochastic
process, to control not the state of soft robots but the probabilistic
distribution. In this study, we propose and implement a stochastic-based
control strategy, termed FPE-based Model Predictive Control (FPE-MPC), for a
soft robotic finger. Two numerical simulation case studies examine the
performance and characteristics of this control method, revealing its efficacy
in managing the uncertainty inherent in soft robotic systems.

*Haolan Zhang,Chenghao Li,Thanh Nguyen Canh,Lijun Wang,Nak Young Chong*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: SRR-SLAM: a scene-reliability based framework that makes feature-based SLAM more robust and adaptive by incorporating environment-aware processing and multiple reliability metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing feature-based SLAM struggles with limited adaptability in dynamic feature culling and pose estimation, and with insufficient environmental awareness in assessment/optimization strategies across diverse environments.

Method: Introduces a unified scene reliability assessment using multiple metrics and historical data; (i) adaptive dynamic region selection with flexible geometric constraints; (ii) depth-assisted self-adjusting clustering for efficient dynamic feature removal in high-dimensional spaces; (iii) reliability-aware pose refinement that blends direct methods when features are scarce; (iv) reliability-based keyframe selection and a weighted optimization scheme to reduce computation while improving accuracy.

Result: Extensive experiments on public datasets and real-world scenarios show SRR-SLAM outperforms state-of-the-art dynamic SLAM methods, achieving up to 90% improvement in accuracy and robustness across diverse environments.

Conclusion: The framework enhances measurement precision and reliability in autonomous robotic sensing systems by making SLAM more aware of scene reliability and dynamics, and by adaptively shaping processing and optimization accordingly.

Abstract: Visual simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) plays a critical role in
autonomous robotic systems, especially where accurate and reliable measurements
are essential for navigation and sensing. In feature-based SLAM, the
quantityand quality of extracted features significantly influence system
performance. Due to the variations in feature quantity and quality across
diverse environments, current approaches face two major challenges: (1) limited
adaptability in dynamic feature culling and pose estimation, and (2)
insufficient environmental awareness in assessment and optimization strategies.
To address these issues, we propose SRR-SLAM, a scene-reliability based
framework that enhances feature-based SLAM through environment-aware
processing. Our method introduces a unified scene reliability assessment
mechanism that incorporates multiple metrics and historical observations to
guide system behavior. Based on this assessment, we develop: (i) adaptive
dynamic region selection with flexible geometric constraints, (ii)
depth-assisted self-adjusting clustering for efficient dynamic feature removal
in high-dimensional settings, and (iii) reliability-aware pose refinement that
dynamically integrates direct methods when features are insufficient.
Furthermore, we propose (iv) reliability-based keyframe selection and a
weighted optimization scheme to reduce computational overhead while improving
estimation accuracy. Extensive experiments on public datasets and real world
scenarios show that SRR-SLAM outperforms state-of-the-art dynamic SLAM methods,
achieving up to 90% improvement in accuracy and robustness across diverse
environments. These improvements directly contribute to enhanced measurement
precision and reliability in autonomous robotic sensing systems.

*Haiyun Zhang,Kelvin HoLam Heung,Gabrielle J. Naquila,Ashwin Hingwe,Ashish D. Deshpande*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A coupling of pseudo-rigid body modeling with the Logarithmic Decrement Method (PRBM+LDM) for soft robotic hands enables real-time parameter estimation and improved position/force control, outperforming PID in accuracy on grasping tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Soft robots deform continuously making accurate, real-time control challenging; existing reduced models are too computationally heavy or require hard parameter identification. A fast, accurate parameter estimation method is needed.

Method: Combine PRBM with Logarithmic Decrement Method for parameter estimation; validate on a soft hand test bed by predicting position and force from pressure; implement as closed-loop position and force controllers; benchmark against PID and constant-pressure grasping on delicate objects.

Result: PRBM+LDM achieved lower position error (average maximum error across fingers: 4.37° vs 20.38°). In force control on delicate objects, grasping accuracy improved (potato chip 86 vs 82.5; screwdriver 74.42 vs 70; brass coin 64.75 vs 35).

Conclusion: PRBM+LDM provides a computationally efficient, accurate modeling basis for soft actuators, enabling stable, flexible grasping with precise force regulation.

Abstract: The rapid advancement in physical human-robot interaction (HRI) has
accelerated the development of soft robot designs and controllers. Controlling
soft robots, especially soft hand grasping, is challenging due to their
continuous deformation, motivating the use of reduced model-based controllers
for real-time dynamic performance. Most existing models, however, suffer from
computational inefficiency and complex parameter identification, limiting their
real-time applicability. To address this, we propose a paradigm coupling
Pseudo-Rigid Body Modeling with the Logarithmic Decrement Method for parameter
estimation (PRBM plus LDM). Using a soft robotic hand test bed, we validate
PRBM plus LDM for predicting position and force output from pressure input and
benchmark its performance. We then implement PRBM plus LDM as the basis for
closed-loop position and force controllers. Compared to a simple PID
controller, the PRBM plus LDM position controller achieves lower error (average
maximum error across all fingers: 4.37 degrees versus 20.38 degrees). For force
control, PRBM plus LDM outperforms constant pressure grasping in pinching tasks
on delicate objects: potato chip 86 versus 82.5, screwdriver 74.42 versus 70,
brass coin 64.75 versus 35. These results demonstrate PRBM plus LDM as a
computationally efficient and accurate modeling technique for soft actuators,
enabling stable and flexible grasping with precise force regulation.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Two bellow-structured upper-limb actuators (LISPER for elbow, SCASPER for shoulder) are introduced with analytical models linking pressure, bending, and force to enable tunable ROM/torque for rehabilitation; preliminary validation on a dummy arm demonstrates capability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address slow response, limited range of motion, and low output force in soft rehabilitation actuators, and to provide quantitative models showing how bellow-based designs affect performance.

Method: Design LISPER and SCASPER actuators, develop comprehensive analytical models relating input pressure, bending angle, and output force for each actuator, analyze how geometry sets ROM and force, and perform preliminary tests on a dummy arm.

Result: LISPER exhibits higher bandwidth, greater output force/torque, and high linearity; SCASPER provides high output force/torque with simplified fabrication; the models describe the pressure-bend-force relationships and enable geometry-driven tuning; preliminary dummy-arm tests confirm actuator capability.

Conclusion: A design paradigm with quantitative models enables tunable ROM and output forces for wearable soft actuators in rehabilitation; the approach addresses current limitations, though further validation with real users and dynamic tasks is needed.

Abstract: Soft robots have been increasingly utilized as sophisticated tools in
physical rehabilitation, particularly for assisting patients with neuromotor
impairments. However, many soft robotics for rehabilitation applications are
characterized by limitations such as slow response times, restricted range of
motion, and low output force. There are also limited studies on the precise
position and force control of wearable soft actuators. Furthermore, not many
studies articulate how bellow-structured actuator designs quantitatively
contribute to the robots' capability. This study introduces a paradigm of upper
limb soft actuator design. This paradigm comprises two actuators: the
Lobster-Inspired Silicone Pneumatic Robot (LISPER) for the elbow and the
Scallop-Shaped Pneumatic Robot (SCASPER) for the shoulder. LISPER is
characterized by higher bandwidth, increased output force/torque, and high
linearity. SCASPER is characterized by high output force/torque and simplified
fabrication processes. Comprehensive analytical models that describe the
relationship between pressure, bending angles, and output force for both
actuators were presented so the geometric configuration of the actuators can be
set to modify the range of motion and output forces. The preliminary test on a
dummy arm is conducted to test the capability of the actuators.

Conclusion: OpenMulti advances multi-agent mapping by enabling instance-level, semantically-aware representations across agents, facilitating downstream tasks that require object-level understanding. The project website is publicly available.

Abstract: Multi-agent distributed collaborative mapping provides comprehensive and
efficient representations for robots. However, existing approaches lack
instance-level awareness and semantic understanding of environments, limiting
their effectiveness for downstream applications. To address this issue, we
propose OpenMulti, an open-vocabulary instance-level multi-agent distributed
implicit mapping framework. Specifically, we introduce a Cross-Agent Instance
Alignment module, which constructs an Instance Collaborative Graph to ensure
consistent instance understanding across agents. To alleviate the degradation
of mapping accuracy due to the blind-zone optimization trap, we leverage Cross
Rendering Supervision to enhance distributed learning of the scene.
Experimental results show that OpenMulti outperforms related algorithms in both
fine-grained geometric accuracy and zero-shot semantic accuracy. In addition,
OpenMulti supports instance-level retrieval tasks, delivering semantic
annotations for downstream applications. The project website of OpenMulti is

*Nouhed Naidja,Stéphane Font,Marc Revilloud,Guillaume Sandou*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A unified multi-criteria framework for evaluating and optimizing autonomous vehicle trajectories that integrates formal safety (adaptive ellipse safety zones with Shoelace-based intersection area), comfort (jerk-based indicators), and efficiency (travel time) into a single objective solved by PSO, validated in real urban intersections and simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of simultaneously ensuring safety, rider comfort, and efficiency in AV trajectory planning under dynamic traffic, by providing an integrated, quantifiable, and optimizable framework that handles misaligned and time-varying configurations.

Method: Proposes a unified optimization framework using adaptive ellipse-based safety zones; computes collision risk via intersection area using the Shoelace formula for misaligned/time-varying configurations; models comfort via longitudinal and lateral jerk indicators; assesses efficiency via travel time; aggregates criteria into a single objective and solves with a PSO-based algorithm; validates with real-traffic experiments at an urban intersection (AV vs. human-driven vehicle) and simulations using real driving data.

Result: The method was successfully validated in real traffic experiments at an urban intersection involving an autonomous vehicle interacting with a human-operated vehicle, and in simulation using data recorded from human driving in real traffic.

Conclusion: The proposed framework offers a comprehensive, data-driven approach to multi-criteria AV trajectory optimization, delivering a robust, PSO-optimized solution with a geometric safety indicator, jerk-based comfort metrics, and travel-time efficiency, applicable to real-world mixed-traffic scenarios.

Abstract: This paper presents a unified framework for the evaluation and optimization
of autonomous vehicle trajectories, integrating formal safety, comfort, and
efficiency criteria. An innovative geometric indicator, based on the analysis
of safety zones using adaptive ellipses, is used to accurately quantify
collision risks. Our method applies the Shoelace formula to compute the
intersection area in the case of misaligned and time-varying configurations.
Comfort is modeled using indicators centered on longitudinal and lateral jerk,
while efficiency is assessed by overall travel time. These criteria are
aggregated into a comprehensive objective function solved using a PSO based
algorithm. The approach was successfully validated under real traffic
conditions via experiments conducted in an urban intersection involving an
autonomous vehicle interacting with a human-operated vehicle, and in simulation
using data recorded from human driving in real traffic.

### [347] [Disentangled Multi-Context Meta-Learning: Unlocking robust and Generalized Task Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01297)
*Seonsoo Kim,Jun-Gill Kang,Taehong Kim,Seongil Hong*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A disentangled multi-context meta-learning framework assigns distinct context vectors to task factors, enabling decoupling of variations, better interpretability, robustness, and generalization, with successful sinusoidal regression and sim-to-real transfer in robotics using limited data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Meta-learning often relies on entangled representations of task factors, hindering interpretability and generalization. By explicitly disentangling factors into separate context vectors and sharing across tasks with shared factors, the approach aims to improve robustness and transfer.

Method: Introduce a framework that maps each task factor to a distinct context vector, decoupling variations and allowing shared contexts across tasks with common factors. Evaluate on sinusoidal regression (OOD generalization via shared amplitude/phase contexts) and a quadruped locomotion setting where dynamics-contexts transfer to RL to improve robustness and enable sim-to-real transfer using only 20 seconds of real data.

Result: In sinusoidal regression, the model outperforms baselines on OOD tasks and generalizes to unseen sine functions by sharing contexts for shared amplitudes or phases. In quadruped locomotion, disentangled dynamics contexts transferred to RL yield more robust policies under OOD conditions and enable successful sim-to-real transfer on challenging terrains with minimal real data, outperforming single-unified-context baselines.

Conclusion: Disentangled multi-context meta-learning improves robustness and generalization by decoupling task factors and sharing context across tasks. It provides practical benefits in both regression and robotics, including efficient sim-to-real transfer with very limited real data.

Abstract: In meta-learning and its downstream tasks, many methods rely on implicit
adaptation to task variations, where multiple factors are mixed together in a
single entangled representation. This makes it difficult to interpret which
factors drive performance and can hinder generalization. In this work, we
introduce a disentangled multi-context meta-learning framework that explicitly
assigns each task factor to a distinct context vector. By decoupling these
variations, our approach improves robustness through deeper task understanding
and enhances generalization by enabling context vector sharing across tasks
with shared factors. We evaluate our approach in two domains. First, on a
sinusoidal regression task, our model outperforms baselines on
out-of-distribution tasks and generalizes to unseen sine functions by sharing
context vectors associated with shared amplitudes or phase shifts. Second, in a
quadruped robot locomotion task, we disentangle the robot-specific properties
and the characteristics of the terrain in the robot dynamics model. By
transferring disentangled context vectors acquired from the dynamics model into
reinforcement learning, the resulting policy achieves improved robustness under
out-of-distribution conditions, surpassing the baselines that rely on a single
unified context. Furthermore, by effectively sharing context, our model enables
successful sim-to-real policy transfer to challenging terrains with
out-of-distribution robot-specific properties, using just 20 seconds of real
data from flat terrain, a result not achievable with single-task adaptation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address memory management challenges in long-horizon ObjectNav tasks and dynamic scenes by linking transient observations to enduring spatial memory.

Method: Build and continuously update a topological graph that encodes scene connections, adjacency, and semantic meaning, enabling knowledge accumulation, key information retrieval, and reasoning toward distant goals.

Result: TopoNav achieves state-of-the-art performance on ObjectNav benchmarks with higher success rates and more efficient paths, especially in diverse and complex environments.

Conclusion: Topological memory effectively bridges temporary visual inputs with lasting spatial understanding, improving long-horizon object navigation.

Abstract: Object Navigation (ObjectNav) has made great progress with large language
models (LLMs), but still faces challenges in memory management, especially in
long-horizon tasks and dynamic scenes. To address this, we propose TopoNav, a
new framework that leverages topological structures as spatial memory. By
building and updating a topological graph that captures scene connections,
adjacency, and semantic meaning, TopoNav helps agents accumulate spatial
knowledge over time, retrieve key information, and reason effectively toward
distant goals. Our experiments show that TopoNav achieves state-of-the-art
performance on benchmark ObjectNav datasets, with higher success rates and more
efficient paths. It particularly excels in diverse and complex environments, as
it connects temporary visual inputs with lasting spatial understanding.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To optimize human-robot collaboration by understanding how users want to be assisted and how different forms of assistance affect their experience and performance.

Method: Quantitative and qualitative analysis of a user study in an HRC assembly task, focusing on on-demand assistance from a remote human; also examining perceptions of future non-human agents and the choice between on-demand vs unsolicited help.

Result: The abstract does not provide concrete results; it states that the study will analyze the impact of these design decisions on emotional responses, productivity, and user preferences.

Conclusion: The work aims to inform the design of future user-assisting agents in HRC by clarifying which agent type and assistance mode best support human users.

Abstract: As robot technology advances, collaboration between humans and robots will
become more prevalent in industrial tasks. When humans run into issues in such
scenarios, a likely future involves relying on artificial agents or robots for
aid. This study identifies key aspects for the design of future user-assisting
agents. We analyze quantitative and qualitative data from a user study
examining the impact of on-demand assistance received from a remote human in a
human-robot collaboration (HRC) assembly task. We study scenarios in which
users require help and we assess their experiences in requesting and receiving
assistance. Additionally, we investigate participants' perceptions of future
non-human assisting agents and whether assistance should be on-demand or
unsolicited. Through a user study, we analyze the impact that such design
decisions (human or artificial assistant, on-demand or unsolicited help) can
have on elicited emotional responses, productivity, and preferences of humans
engaged in HRC tasks.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: FGO-SLAM uses a Gaussian-derived opacity radiance field to improve geometry in Visual SLAM, with global pose and sparse point cloud optimization, 3D Gaussian-based surfaces extraction, yielding state-of-the-art tracking and mapping on diverse datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional SLAM methods struggle to deliver high-quality scene reconstruction; Gaussian SLAM offers fast rendering and good mapping but lacks robust pose optimization and reliable geometric reconstruction.

Method: Represent scenes with an opacity radiance field built from 3D Gaussians. After initial pose estimation, perform global adjustment of camera poses and sparse points. Maintain a globally consistent opacity field; incorporate depth distortion and normal consistency losses. Build tetrahedral grids and extract surfaces via level sets directly from 3D Gaussians.

Result: Demonstrates state-of-the-art tracking accuracy and mapping performance across real-world and large-scale synthetic datasets, with robust tracking and improved geometric reconstruction.

Conclusion: FGO-SLAM achieves superior geometry and pose optimization for Gaussian SLAM by coupling opacity radiance fields with global optimization and surface extraction from 3D Gaussians, enabling reliable large-scale scene reconstruction.

Abstract: Visual SLAM has regained attention due to its ability to provide perceptual
capabilities and simulation test data for Embodied AI. However, traditional
SLAM methods struggle to meet the demands of high-quality scene reconstruction,
and Gaussian SLAM systems, despite their rapid rendering and high-quality
mapping capabilities, lack effective pose optimization methods and face
challenges in geometric reconstruction. To address these issues, we introduce
FGO-SLAM, a Gaussian SLAM system that employs an opacity radiance field as the
scene representation to enhance geometric mapping performance. After initial
pose estimation, we apply global adjustment to optimize camera poses and sparse
point cloud, ensuring robust tracking of our approach. Additionally, we
maintain a globally consistent opacity radiance field based on 3D Gaussians and
introduce depth distortion and normal consistency terms to refine the scene
representation. Furthermore, after constructing tetrahedral grids, we identify
level sets to directly extract surfaces from 3D Gaussians. Results across
various real-world and large-scale synthetic datasets demonstrate that our
method achieves state-of-the-art tracking accuracy and mapping performance.

### [351] [Aleatoric Uncertainty from AI-based 6D Object Pose Predictors for Object-relative State Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01583)
*Thomas Jantos,Stephan Weiss,Jan Steinbrener*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper extends a DL-based 6D pose predictor with two detached MLPs to infer aleatoric uncertainty, integrates it into an EKF with dynamic covariance, enabling edge-friendly, uncertainty-aware object-relative state estimation, outperforming fixed-covariance baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate uncertainty quantification for DNN-based pose measurements is essential for probabilistic state estimation in robotics; current predictors lack efficient, trainable, per-measurement uncertainty.

Method: Add two multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) detached from translation and rotation outputs of the DL predictor to output pose uncertainty; train them while freezing the original predictor; use the predicted pose and its uncertainty as measurement and noise covariance in an EKF; run on edge devices with minimal overhead.

Result: Demonstrates improved object-relative state estimation performance over fixed-covariance approaches on synthetic and real-world data; feasible for edge deployment due to low overhead.

Conclusion: Aleatoric uncertainty inference can be effectively integrated with DL-based 6D pose predictors to enhance probabilistic estimation in robotics without heavy retraining; approach is practical for deployment on resource-constrained platforms.

Abstract: Deep Learning (DL) has become essential in various robotics applications due
to excelling at processing raw sensory data to extract task specific
information from semantic objects. For example, vision-based object-relative
navigation relies on a DL-based 6D object pose predictor to provide the
relative pose between the object and the robot as measurements to the robot's
state estimator. Accurately knowing the uncertainty inherent in such Deep
Neural Network (DNN) based measurements is essential for probabilistic state
estimators subsequently guiding the robot's tasks. Thus, in this letter, we
show that we can extend any existing DL-based object-relative pose predictor
for aleatoric uncertainty inference simply by including two multi-layer
perceptrons detached from the translational and rotational part of the DL
predictor. This allows for efficient training while freezing the existing
pre-trained predictor. We then use the inferred 6D pose and its uncertainty as
a measurement and corresponding noise covariance matrix in an extended Kalman
filter (EKF). Our approach induces minimal computational overhead such that the
state estimator can be deployed on edge devices while benefiting from the
dynamically inferred measurement uncertainty. This increases the performance of
the object-relative state estimation task compared to a fix-covariance
approach. We conduct evaluations on synthetic data and real-world data to
underline the benefits of aleatoric uncertainty inference for the
object-relative state estimation task.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A hybrid input DRL framework for autonomous lane changes using predicted surrounding-vehicle trajectories and multi-modal sensing to guide macro decisions and end-to-end control, improving lane-change safety in CARLA.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Lane changes in dense traffic are high-stakes decisions that benefit from foreseeing surrounding vehicle behavior and leveraging diverse sensory information; improving decision rationality and safety in an autonomous driving system.

Method: 1) Predict surrounding vehicles' trajectories to inform ego decisions. 2) Extract features from high-dimensional images and low-dimensional sensor data. 3) Fuse trajectory predictions with multi-modal information as the DRL state space. 4) Integrate RL macro decisions with end-to-end vehicle control for a complete lane-change process.

Result: Experiments in the CARLA simulator show that the hybrid state space significantly enhances the safety of lane-change decisions.

Conclusion: The proposed hybrid-input DRL framework enables more rational and safer lane-change behavior by combining trajectory prediction with multi-modal sensing and linking macro decisions to vehicle control, validated in simulation.

Abstract: Lane change decision-making for autonomous vehicles is a complex but
high-reward behavior. In this paper, we propose a hybrid input based deep
reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm, which realizes abstract lane change
decisions and lane change actions for autonomous vehicles within traffic flow.
Firstly, a surrounding vehicles trajectory prediction method is proposed to
reduce the risk of future behavior of surrounding vehicles to ego vehicle, and
the prediction results are input into the reinforcement learning model as
additional information. Secondly, to comprehensively leverage environmental
information, the model extracts feature from high-dimensional images and
low-dimensional sensor data simultaneously. The fusion of surrounding vehicle
trajectory prediction and multi-modal information are used as state space of
reinforcement learning to improve the rationality of lane change decision.
Finally, we integrate reinforcement learning macro decisions with end-to-end
vehicle control to achieve a holistic lane change process. Experiments were
conducted within the CARLA simulator, and the results demonstrated that the
utilization of a hybrid state space significantly enhances the safety of
vehicle lane change decisions.

TL;DR: Explores equitable LGBTQ+-oriented robotics via speculative design, proposing three queer robot roles, examining ethics, and outlining aspirational futures and the steps needed to realize them.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provoke thought and conversation in robotics about inclusive, queer futures, bridging arts and sciences and addressing underexplored social dimensions.

Method: An exploratory essay that reviews queer robotics in fiction and science, then presents three speculative design proposals for queer robot roles, followed by ethical discussion and aspirational futures, with recommendations for realization.

Result: Articulates three speculative designs: (1) robots reflecting and celebrating in-group queer identity; (2) queer-identity performance as a form of activism to engage out-group users and reduce bigotry; (3) a network of queer-owned robots to connect the community and distribute/access resources; includes ethical questions about queering robots and discusses implications; ends with envisioned aspirational futures and the prerequisites to achieve them.

Conclusion: Advocates careful, ethically guided exploration of queerness in robotics, highlighting social, technical, and cultural prerequisites and calling for ongoing interdisciplinary dialogue to pursue inclusive futures for LGBTQ+ communities through robotics.

Abstract: This paper examines the speculative topic of equitable robots through an
exploratory essay format. It focuses specifically on robots by and for LGBTQ+
populations. It aims to provoke thought and conversations in the field about
what aspirational queer robotics futures may look like, both in the arts and
sciences. First, it briefly reviews the state-of-the-art of queer robotics in
fiction and science, drawing together threads from each. Then, it discusses
queering robots through three speculative design proposals for queer robot
roles: 1) reflecting the queerness of their ''in-group'' queer users, building
and celebrating ''in-group'' identity, 2) a new kind of queer activism by
implementing queer robot identity performance to interact with ''out-group''
users, with a goal of reducing bigotry through familiarisation, and 3) a
network of queer-owned robots, through which the community could reach each
other, and distribute and access important resources. The paper then questions
whether robots should be queered, and what ethical implications this raises.
Finally, the paper makes suggestions for what aspirational queer robotics
futures may look like, and what would be required to get there.

*Amber Xie,Rahul Chand,Dorsa Sadigh,Joey Hejna*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A KDE-based importance-weighted retrieval (IWR) for few-shot imitation learning that corrects retrieval bias by ratioing target and prior densities, yielding consistent gains with minimal changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of retrieval-based imitation: nearest-neighbor rules are high-variance and ignore the prior data distribution; few-shot learning needs effective data selection from large priors.

Method: Propose IWR: estimate P_target(x)/P_prior(x) via Gaussian KDEs; use these weights in retrieval, effectively weighting samples from prior data; smooth estimates by leveraging all data rather than just nearest neighbors; integrate with existing retrieval pipelines with minor modifications.

Result: Empirically, across simulation and real Bridge dataset, IWR improves performance of retrieval-based methods consistently; requires only minor modifications.

Conclusion: IWR mitigates bias in retrieval data selection and improves few-shot imitation learning by modeling data distributions with KDEs; generalizable and robust across environments.

Abstract: While large-scale robot datasets have propelled recent progress in imitation
learning, learning from smaller task specific datasets remains critical for
deployment in new environments and unseen tasks. One such approach to few-shot
imitation learning is retrieval-based imitation learning, which extracts
relevant samples from large, widely available prior datasets to augment a
limited demonstration dataset. To determine the relevant data from prior
datasets, retrieval-based approaches most commonly calculate a prior data
point's minimum distance to a point in the target dataset in latent space.
While retrieval-based methods have shown success using this metric for data
selection, we demonstrate its equivalence to the limit of a Gaussian kernel
density (KDE) estimate of the target data distribution. This reveals two
shortcomings of the retrieval rule used in prior work. First, it relies on
high-variance nearest neighbor estimates that are susceptible to noise. Second,
it does not account for the distribution of prior data when retrieving data. To
address these issues, we introduce Importance Weighted Retrieval (IWR), which
estimates importance weights, or the ratio between the target and prior data
distributions for retrieval, using Gaussian KDEs. By considering the
probability ratio, IWR seeks to mitigate the bias of previous selection rules,
and by using reasonable modeling parameters, IWR effectively smooths estimates
using all data points. Across both simulation environments and real-world
evaluations on the Bridge dataset we find that our method, IWR, consistently
improves performance of existing retrieval-based methods, despite only
requiring minor modifications.

### [355] [MoTo: A Zero-shot Plug-in Interaction-aware Navigation for General Mobile Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01658)
*Zhenyu Wu,Angyuan Ma,Xiuwei Xu,Hang Yin,Yinan Liang,Ziwei Wang,Jiwen Lu,Haibin Yan*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: MoTo plugs into any off-the-shelf manipulation foundation model to enable mobile manipulation by planning docking points with an interaction-aware navigation policy, plus VLM-based interaction keypoints and joint motion planning. It achieves zero-shot mobile manipulation without extra training data and shows notable improvements over SOTA on OVMM and real-world tests.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generalization gap in mobile manipulation: traditional mobile approaches require large task-specific data, while fixed-base manipulation foundation models generalize well but are limited to fixed bases. A plug-in that extends fixed-base models to mobile contexts can enable zero-shot mobile manipulation without task-specific data.

Method: MoTo integrates with existing manipulation foundation models and adds (1) an interaction-aware navigation policy to generate docking points; (2) an interaction keypoints framework using vision-language models with multi-view consistency for following instructions for both the target object and the robotic arm; (3) motion planning objectives for the mobile base and arm to minimize the distance between the two keypoints and ensure trajectory feasibility; (4) zero-shot operation without mobile manipulation expert data.

Result: Experiments on OVMM and real-world tasks show MoTo outperforms state-of-the-art mobile manipulation methods by 2.68 percentage points (OVMM) and 16.67 percentage points (real-world), without requiring additional training data.

Conclusion: MoTo successfully endows fixed-base manipulation foundation models with mobile manipulation capabilities in a zero-shot manner, through docking-point planning, VLM-based interaction keypoints, and coordinated motion planning, yielding meaningful performance gains and a practical plug-in solution.

Abstract: Mobile manipulation stands as a core challenge in robotics, enabling robots
to assist humans across varied tasks and dynamic daily environments.
Conventional mobile manipulation approaches often struggle to generalize across
different tasks and environments due to the lack of large-scale training.
However, recent advances in manipulation foundation models demonstrate
impressive generalization capability on a wide range of fixed-base manipulation
tasks, which are still limited to a fixed setting. Therefore, we devise a
plug-in module named MoTo, which can be combined with any off-the-shelf
manipulation foundation model to empower them with mobile manipulation ability.
Specifically, we propose an interaction-aware navigation policy to generate
robot docking points for generalized mobile manipulation. To enable zero-shot
ability, we propose an interaction keypoints framework via vision-language
models (VLM) under multi-view consistency for both target object and robotic
arm following instructions, where fixed-base manipulation foundation models can
be employed. We further propose motion planning objectives for the mobile base
and robot arm, which minimize the distance between the two keypoints and
maintain the physical feasibility of trajectories. In this way, MoTo guides the
robot to move to the docking points where fixed-base manipulation can be
successfully performed, and leverages VLM generation and trajectory
optimization to achieve mobile manipulation in a zero-shot manner, without any
requirement on mobile manipulation expert data. Extensive experimental results
on OVMM and real-world demonstrate that MoTo achieves success rates of 2.68%
and 16.67% higher than the state-of-the-art mobile manipulation methods,
respectively, without requiring additional training data.

*Abdelrhman Werby,Martin Büchner,Adrian Röfer,Chenguang Huang,Wolfram Burgard,Abhinav Valada*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Introduces ArtiPoint for robust 3D articulation estimation under dynamic camera motion and partial observability, powered by deep point tracking and factor graph optimization; accompanies Arti4D ego-centric dataset; outperforms baselines; code/dataset released.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding articulated object motion in unconstrained, real-world environments where camera motion and partial observations hinder existing methods; humans can infer articulation by watching manipulation.

Method: Integrates deep point tracking with a factor graph optimization framework to recover articulated part trajectories and articulation axes from RGB-D videos; handles dynamic camera motion and partial observability; introduces Arti4D dataset with scene-level interactions, articulation labels, and ground-truth camera poses.

Result: Empirically outperforms classical and learning-based baselines on Arti4D; demonstrates robustness to challenging conditions; code and Arti4D dataset publicly available.

Conclusion: Advances understanding of articulated object motion in-the-wild; enables more robust robotic scene understanding, manipulation, and planning; provides dataset and code to spur further research.

Abstract: Understanding the 3D motion of articulated objects is essential in robotic
scene understanding, mobile manipulation, and motion planning. Prior methods
for articulation estimation have primarily focused on controlled settings,
assuming either fixed camera viewpoints or direct observations of various
object states, which tend to fail in more realistic unconstrained environments.
In contrast, humans effortlessly infer articulation by watching others
manipulate objects. Inspired by this, we introduce ArtiPoint, a novel
estimation framework that can infer articulated object models under dynamic
camera motion and partial observability. By combining deep point tracking with
a factor graph optimization framework, ArtiPoint robustly estimates articulated
part trajectories and articulation axes directly from raw RGB-D videos. To
foster future research in this domain, we introduce Arti4D, the first
ego-centric in-the-wild dataset that captures articulated object interactions
at a scene level, accompanied by articulation labels and ground-truth camera
poses. We benchmark ArtiPoint against a range of classical and learning-based
baselines, demonstrating its superior performance on Arti4D. We make code and
Arti4D publicly available at https://artipoint.cs.uni-freiburg.de.

### [357] [Constrained Decoding for Robotics Foundation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01728)
*Parv Kapoor,Akila Ganlath,Changliu Liu,Sebastian Scherer,Eunsuk Kang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Constrained decoding framework enforcing STL on robot action trajectories to guarantee runtime correctness for foundation models without retraining; validated on navigation models; improves safety and enables conditional generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robotics foundation models are data-driven and lack explicit behavioral correctness and safety guarantees, necessitating runtime safety constraints without retraining.

Method: Introduce a decoding-time constrained decoding framework that enforces Signal Temporal Logic (STL) specifications on action trajectories in dynamical systems; model-agnostic and does not require retraining; ensures provable STL satisfaction at runtime.

Result: Comprehensive evaluation across state-of-the-art navigation foundation models shows decoding-time interventions filter unsafe actions and enable conditional action-generation, with demonstrations in videos.

Conclusion: Decoding-time STL-constrained decoding provides runtime safety guarantees for robotics foundation models, enabling safe, reliable action generation without retraining and broad applicability to robotic control tasks.

Abstract: Recent advances in the development of robotic foundation models have led to
promising end-to-end and general-purpose capabilities in robotic systems. These
models are pretrained on vast datasets of robot trajectories to process multi-
modal inputs and directly output a sequence of action that the system then
executes in the real world. Although this approach is attractive from the
perspective of im- proved generalization across diverse tasks, these models are
still data-driven and, therefore, lack explicit notions of behavioral
correctness and safety constraints. We address these limitations by introducing
a constrained decoding framework for robotics foundation models that enforces
logical constraints on action trajec- tories in dynamical systems. Our method
ensures that generated actions provably satisfy signal temporal logic (STL)
specifications at runtime without retraining, while remaining agnostic of the
underlying foundation model. We perform com- prehensive evaluation of our
approach across state-of-the-art navigation founda- tion models and we show
that our decoding-time interventions are useful not only for filtering unsafe
actions but also for conditional action-generation. Videos available on our

*Yixuan Huang,Novella Alvina,Mohanraj Devendran Shanthi,Tucker Hermans*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Fail2Progress uses Stein variational inference to generate parallel simulation environments for targeted data collection of failure scenarios in long-horizon manipulation, enabling a skill-effect model to recover from and reduce failures across tasks and object counts, outperforming baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long-horizon manipulation skill effect models fail outside training distributions. Efficiently generating data targeted to observed failures is essential to improve robustness and reduce future failures.

Method: Propose Fail2Progress, which leverages Stein variational inference to produce multiple simulation environments in parallel that mirror observed failure modes. Fine-tune a skill effect model on the failure-targeted dataset and evaluate recovery and reduction of future failures across tasks (transporting objects, shelf organization, tabletop organization). Demonstrated through large-scale simulation and real-world experiments.

Result: The approach learns from failures across varying object counts and outperforms several baselines in both simulation and real-world settings.

Conclusion: Fail2Progress provides an effective framework for data-efficient learning from failure in long-horizon manipulation by generating targeted failure data in parallel, improving robustness and generalization to different task configurations.

Abstract: Skill effect models for long-horizon manipulation tasks are prone to failures
in conditions not covered by training data distributions. Therefore, enabling
robots to reason about and learn from failures is necessary. We investigate the
problem of efficiently generating a dataset targeted to observed failures.
After fine-tuning a skill effect model on this dataset, we evaluate the extent
to which the model can recover from failures and minimize future failures. We
propose Fail2Progress, an approach that leverages Stein variational inference
to generate multiple simulation environments in parallel, enabling efficient
data sample generation similar to observed failures. Our method is capable of
handling several challenging mobile manipulation tasks, including transporting
multiple objects, organizing a constrained shelf, and tabletop organization.
Through large-scale simulation and real-world experiments, we demonstrate that
our approach excels at learning from failures across different numbers of
objects. Furthermore, we show that Fail2Progress outperforms several baselines.

*Skand Peri,Akhil Perincherry,Bikram Pandit,Stefan Lee*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A hyperparameter-free gradient projection method to minimize energy use in RL without hurting task performance, achieving 64% energy reduction on locomotion benchmarks and demonstrating Sim2Real transfer on a quadruped.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Energy-efficient control in RL is hampered by the need to tune energy penalties in rewards; a hyperparameter-free method that preserves task performance while reducing energy could simplify learning and improve robustness.

Method: Introduce policy gradient projection between task and energy objectives, yielding updates that reduce energy expenditure without impacting task performance; requires no energy-related hyperparameters, compatible with any policy gradient method; inspired by multitask learning.

Result: Empirically reduces energy usage by 64% on DM-Control and HumanoidBench with comparable task performance; demonstrates Sim2Real transfer on Unitree GO2 quadruped; easy to implement with minimal code changes.

Conclusion: Provides a principled alternative to reward shaping for energy-efficient control, generalizable across policy gradient methods and suitable for real-world deployment thanks to hyperparameter-free formulation.

Abstract: Efficient robot control often requires balancing task performance with energy
expenditure. A common approach in reinforcement learning (RL) is to penalize
energy use directly as part of the reward function. This requires carefully
tuning weight terms to avoid undesirable trade-offs where energy minimization
harms task success. In this work, we propose a hyperparameter-free gradient
optimization method to minimize energy expenditure without conflicting with
task performance. Inspired by recent works in multitask learning, our method
applies policy gradient projection between task and energy objectives to derive
policy updates that minimize energy expenditure in ways that do not impact task
performance. We evaluate this technique on standard locomotion benchmarks of
DM-Control and HumanoidBench and demonstrate a reduction of 64% energy usage
while maintaining comparable task performance. Further, we conduct experiments
on a Unitree GO2 quadruped showcasing Sim2Real transfer of energy efficient
policies. Our method is easy to implement in standard RL pipelines with minimal
code changes, is applicable to any policy gradient method, and offers a
principled alternative to reward shaping for energy efficient control policies.

*Md Mahbub Alam,Jose F. Rodrigues-Jr,Gabriel Spadon*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A transformer-based multi-vessel trajectory predictor with integrated collision risk analysis outperforms single-vessel models on AIS data by modeling inter-vessel interactions and explicit collision risk.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current data-driven maritime trajectory models largely forecast for a single vessel and ignore inter-vessel interactions, navigation rules, and explicit collision risk assessment. There is a need for joint multi-vessel prediction and explicit risk analysis to improve safety and decision support.

Method: For a target vessel, identify nearby vessels and jointly predict their future trajectories via parallel streams that encode kinematic and derived physical features. Use causal convolutions to capture temporal locality, spatial transformations for positional encoding, and hybrid positional embeddings to capture local motion patterns and long-range dependencies. Train with joint multi-vessel metrics and simulate interactions among predicted trajectories to quantify collision risk.

Result: On large-scale real-world AIS data, the approach achieves superior forecasting performance compared to traditional single-vessel displacement-error baselines, as demonstrated by joint multi-vessel metrics. The framework also quantifies collision risk through simulated interactions, providing actionable safety insights.

Conclusion: The proposed framework advances maritime safety and decision support by delivering accurate multi-vessel trajectory predictions and explicit collision risk assessment; it opens avenues for safer routing and rule-informed decision tools, though scalability and real-time deployment potential warrant further study.

Abstract: Accurate vessel trajectory prediction is essential for enhancing situational
awareness and preventing collisions. Still, existing data-driven models are
constrained mainly to single-vessel forecasting, overlooking vessel
interactions, navigation rules, and explicit collision risk assessment. We
present a transformer-based framework for multi-vessel trajectory prediction
with integrated collision risk analysis. For a given target vessel, the
framework identifies nearby vessels. It jointly predicts their future
trajectories through parallel streams encoding kinematic and derived physical
features, causal convolutions for temporal locality, spatial transformations
for positional encoding, and hybrid positional embeddings that capture both
local motion patterns and long-range dependencies. Evaluated on large-scale
real-world AIS data using joint multi-vessel metrics, the model demonstrates
superior forecasting capabilities beyond traditional single-vessel displacement
errors. By simulating interactions among predicted trajectories, the framework
further quantifies potential collision risks, offering actionable insights to
strengthen maritime safety and decision support.

TL;DR: Underwater AI is rapidly expanding as a research frontier due to environmental monitoring needs, democratized datasets via citizen science, and researchers moving from terrestrial CV; challenges unique to underwater perception drive advances in weak supervision, open-set recognition, and robust perception, with broader implications for foundation models and general CV.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The abstract identifies environmental necessity for ecosystem-scale monitoring, greater access to underwater data through citizen science, and talent migration from saturated terrestrial CV as the key drivers transforming marine perception from niche to pivotal for AI innovation.

Method: A review and analytical synthesis of emerging trends, datasets, scene understanding, and 3D reconstruction in underwater AI, framed as a survey of factors and their consequences for method development and cross-domain impact.

Result: Three convergent drivers push underwater AI forward: (1) ecosystem-scale monitoring needs; (2) democratized data via citizen science; (3) migration of researchers into underwater CV. Challenges such as turbidity, cryptic species, annotation bottlenecks, and cross-ecosystem generalization are catalyzing advances in weakly supervised learning, open-set recognition, and robust perception. Trends include datasets, scene understanding, and 3D reconstruction, signaling a shift from passive observation to AI-driven, targeted intervention. Underwater constraints are also advancing foundation models, self-supervised learning, and perception techniques with broad relevance beyond marine domains.

Conclusion: Underwater constraints are not merely domain-specific challenges but drivers of fundamental AI advancement with implications for general computer vision, robotics, and environmental monitoring. The research indicates a paradigm shift toward scalable, autonomous, and intervention-ready perception systems, potentially benefiting diverse applications beyond marine contexts.

Abstract: Marine ecosystems face increasing pressure due to climate change, driving the
need for scalable, AI-powered monitoring solutions. This paper examines the
rapid emergence of underwater AI as a major research frontier and analyzes the
factors that have transformed marine perception from a niche application into a
catalyst for AI innovation. We identify three convergent drivers: environmental
necessity for ecosystem-scale monitoring, democratization of underwater
datasets through citizen science platforms, and researcher migration from
saturated terrestrial computer vision domains. Our analysis reveals how unique
underwater challenges - turbidity, cryptic species detection, expert annotation
bottlenecks, and cross-ecosystem generalization - are driving fundamental
advances in weakly supervised learning, open-set recognition, and robust
perception under degraded conditions. We survey emerging trends in datasets,
scene understanding and 3D reconstruction, highlighting the paradigm shift from
passive observation toward AI-driven, targeted intervention capabilities. The
paper demonstrates how underwater constraints are pushing the boundaries of
foundation models, self-supervised learning, and perception, with
methodological innovations that extend far beyond marine applications to
benefit general computer vision, robotics, and environmental monitoring.

TL;DR: Proposes AutoDrive-R^2, a vision-language-action model for autonomous driving that uses chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning and reinforcement learning (RL) to improve interpretability and trajectory plausibility. It introduces nuScenesR^2-6K for supervised CoT, and applies Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) within a physics-grounded reward to produce realistic, smooth trajectories. Achieves state-of-the-art results and strong generalization on nuScenes and Waymo.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the interpretability and coherence gaps in vision-language-action models for autonomous driving, ensuring credible reasoning and plausible action sequences through structured reasoning (CoT) and physics-aware RL.

Method: 1) Construct nuScenesR^2-6K, a CoT-focused supervised dataset that maps input information to output trajectories via a four-step logical chain with self-reflection for validation. 2) Fine-tune with chain-of-thought supervision. 3) Use Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) in a reinforcement learning stage with a physics-grounded reward framework that enforces spatial alignment, vehicle dynamics constraints, and temporal smoothness for realistic trajectory planning.

Result: Extensive evaluations on nuScenes and Waymo indicate state-of-the-art performance and robust generalization of AutoDrive-R^2.

Conclusion: AutoDrive-R^2 advances decision-making in autonomous driving through integrated CoT reasoning and self-reflection, combined with physics-aware RL, achieving superior performance and generalization across major datasets.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models in autonomous driving systems have
recently demonstrated transformative potential by integrating multimodal
perception with decision-making capabilities. However, the interpretability and
coherence of the decision process and the plausibility of action sequences
remain largely underexplored. To address these issues, we propose
AutoDrive-R$^2$, a novel VLA framework that enhances both reasoning and
self-reflection capabilities of autonomous driving systems through
chain-of-thought (CoT) processing and reinforcement learning (RL).
Specifically, we first propose an innovative CoT dataset named nuScenesR$^2$-6K
for supervised fine-tuning, which effectively builds cognitive bridges between
input information and output trajectories through a four-step logical chain
with self-reflection for validation. Moreover, to maximize both reasoning and
self-reflection during the RL stage, we further employ the Group Relative
Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm within a physics-grounded reward framework
that incorporates spatial alignment, vehicle dynamic, and temporal smoothness
criteria to ensure reliable and realistic trajectory planning. Extensive
evaluation results across both nuScenes and Waymo datasets demonstrates the
state-of-the-art performance and robust generalization capacity of our proposed
method.

Motivation: Earth-Mars communication delays and mission complexity require autonomous decision-making that adapts in real-time to objectives and conditions.

Method: Integrate Finite State Machine with Behavior Trees into a deterministic high-level controller; event-driven state transitions and BT-based task execution, with Monte Carlo simulations and field tests; middleware-agnostic (e.g., F-Prime).

Result: Demonstrated robustness and adaptability to discrete events and real-time feedback; reactive and context-aware behavior; validated in both simulation and real-world tests.

Conclusion: FSM-BT hybrid autonomy offers scalable, efficient autonomy for deep-space aerial exploration and can extend beyond aerial robotics with middleware integration.

Abstract: Autonomous aerial vehicles, such as NASA's Ingenuity, enable rapid planetary
surface exploration beyond the reach of ground-based robots. Thus, NASA is
studying a Mars Science Helicopter (MSH), an advanced concept capable of
performing long-range science missions and autonomously navigating challenging
Martian terrain. Given significant Earth-Mars communication delays and mission
complexity, an advanced autonomy framework is required to ensure safe and
efficient operation by continuously adapting behavior based on mission
objectives and real-time conditions, without human intervention. This study
presents a deterministic high-level control framework for aerial exploration,
integrating a Finite State Machine (FSM) with Behavior Trees (BTs) to achieve a
scalable, robust, and computationally efficient autonomy solution for critical
scenarios like deep space exploration. In this paper we outline key
capabilities of a possible MSH and detail the FSM-BT hybrid autonomy framework
which orchestrates them to achieve the desired objectives. Monte Carlo
simulations and real field tests validate the framework, demonstrating its
robustness and adaptability to both discrete events and real-time system
feedback. These inputs trigger state transitions or dynamically adjust behavior
execution, enabling reactive and context-aware responses. The framework is
middleware-agnostic, supporting integration with systems like F-Prime and
extending beyond aerial robotics.

*Eduardo Espindola,Yu Tang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A symmetry-aware sliding mode control framework on principal fiber bundles that splits reaching and sliding stages between base space and structure group, with stability guarantees and applications to spacecraft and unicycle.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle coordinate- and Lie-group-specific design challenges in sliding mode control for mechanical systems with symmetry, by leveraging reduced dynamics on principal fiber bundles.

Method: Build a sliding subgroup on the structure group from a kinematic controller; design a sliding variable converging to the identity; create a reaching law on the base space using the mechanical connection and covariant derivative; prove almost global asymptotic stability and local exponential stability via Lyapunov analysis.

Result: Theoretical framework with stability proofs; applied to a fully actuated spacecraft (reaction wheels) and a subactuated unicycle; simulations illustrate the approach.

Conclusion: The proposed framework reduces design complexity by avoiding specific Lie-group coordinates, achieves robust sliding behavior on the bundle, and is applicable to both fully actuated and subactuated mechanical systems, with stability guarantees.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a framework for designing sliding mode controllers
for a class of mechanical systems with symmetry, both unconstrained and
constrained, that evolve on principal fiber bundles. Control laws are developed
based on the reduced motion equations by exploring symmetries, leading to a
sliding mode control strategy where the reaching stage is executed on the base
space, and the sliding stage is performed on the structure group. Thus, design
complexity is reduced, and difficult choices for coordinate representations
when working with a particular Lie group are avoided. For this purpose, a
sliding subgroup is constructed on the structure group based on a kinematic
controller, and the sliding variable will converge to the identity of the state
manifold upon reaching the sliding subgroup. A reaching law based on a general
sliding vector field is then designed on the base space using the local form of
the mechanical connection to drive the sliding variable to the sliding
subgroup, and its time evolution is given according to the appropriate
covariant derivative. Almost global asymptotic stability and local exponential
stability are demonstrated using a Lyapunov analysis. We apply the results to a
fully actuated system (a rigid spacecraft actuated by reaction wheels) and a
subactuated nonholonomic system (unicycle mobile robot actuated by wheels),
which is also simulated for illustration.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A multimodal shared-control framework (Virtual Admittance + MMIPN) enhances VR-based multi-object teleoperation by improving grasp success (MMIPN) and movement efficiency (VA), with gaze as the key modality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address perceptual ambiguities in VR and the limits of single-modality intention recognition in multi-object grasping tasks, enabling more natural and robust human-robot interaction.

Method: Propose a shared control framework combining a Virtual Admittance (VA) model using artificial potential fields to guide operators and an MMIPN (Multimodal-CNN-based Human Intention Perception Network) that fuses gaze, robot motions, and environmental context to infer grasping intentions. A user study with four conditions across two factors evaluated grasp success and path length, highlighting modality importance.

Result: MMIPN significantly improved grasp success rates; VA improved movement efficiency by shortening path lengths; gaze data emerged as the most crucial input modality.

Conclusion: Integrating multimodal cues with implicit guidance yields a robust VR-based teleoperation solution for multi-object grasping, enabling more natural interactions and broader applicability across future HRI tasks.

Abstract: Effective human-robot interaction (HRI) in multi-object teleoperation tasks
faces significant challenges due to perceptual ambiguities in virtual reality
(VR) environments and the limitations of single-modality intention recognition.
This paper proposes a shared control framework that combines a virtual
admittance (VA) model with a Multimodal-CNN-based Human Intention Perception
Network (MMIPN) to enhance teleoperation performance and user experience. The
VA model employs artificial potential fields to guide operators toward target
objects by adjusting admittance force and optimizing motion trajectories. MMIPN
processes multimodal inputs, including gaze movement, robot motions, and
environmental context, to estimate human grasping intentions, helping to
overcome depth perception challenges in VR. Our user study evaluated four
conditions across two factors, and the results showed that MMIPN significantly
improved grasp success rates, while the VA model enhanced movement efficiency
by reducing path lengths. Gaze data emerged as the most crucial input modality.
These findings demonstrate the effectiveness of combining multimodal cues with
implicit guidance in VR-based teleoperation, providing a robust solution for
multi-object grasping tasks and enabling more natural interactions across
various applications in the future.

*Beibei Zhou,Zhiyuan Zhang,Zhenbo Song,Jianhui Guo,Hui Kong*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Unsupervised LiDAR odometry robust to snow through patch-level denoising and adaptive point weighting for real-time performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LiDAR odometry performance degrades in snowfall due to snowflake noise and outliers; need a generalizable, real-time method that works across clear and snowy conditions.

Method: Introduce Patch Spatial Measure (PSM) to detect dispersed noise in patches, and Patch Point Weight Predictor (PPWP) to assign adaptive weights to points. Use an intensity threshold mask to quickly suppress dense snow near the sensor, followed by multi-modal feature fusion to refine weights.

Result: Demonstrates robust odometry performance in both clear and snowy weather, with improved generalization and real-time applicability due to efficient denoising and weighted point processing.

Conclusion: The proposed patch-based denoising and adaptive weighting framework closes the gap between clear-weather and snowy scenarios, enabling more reliable autonomous systems across diverse environments.

Abstract: Deep learning-based LiDAR odometry is crucial for autonomous driving and
robotic navigation, yet its performance under adverse weather, especially
snowfall, remains challenging. Existing models struggle to generalize across
conditions due to sensitivity to snow-induced noise, limiting real-world use.
In this work, we present an unsupervised LiDAR odometry model to close the gap
between clear and snowy weather conditions. Our approach focuses on effective
denoising to mitigate the impact of snowflake noise and outlier points on pose
estimation, while also maintaining computational efficiency for real-time
applications.
  To achieve this, we introduce a Patch Spatial Measure (PSM) module that
evaluates the dispersion of points within each patch, enabling effective
detection of sparse and discrete noise.
  We further propose a Patch Point Weight Predictor (PPWP) to assign adaptive
point-wise weights, enhancing their discriminative capacity within local
regions. To support real-time performance, we first apply an intensity
threshold mask to quickly suppress dense snowflake clusters near the LiDAR, and
then perform multi-modal feature fusion to refine the point-wise weight
prediction, improving overall robustness under adverse weather. Our model is
trained in clear weather conditions and rigorously tested across various
scenarios, including snowy and dynamic. Extensive experimental results confirm
the effectiveness of our method, demonstrating robust performance in both clear
and snowy weather. This advancement enhances the model's generalizability and
paves the way for more reliable autonomous systems capable of operating across
a wider range of environmental conditions.

### [368] [Align-Then-stEer: Adapting the Vision-Language Action Models through Unified Latent Guidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02055)
*Yang Zhang,Chenwei Wang,Ouyang Lu,Yuan Zhao,Yunfei Ge,Zhenglong Sun,Xiu Li,Chi Zhang,Chenjia Bai,Xuelong Li*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A data-efficient, plug-and-play adaptation framework Align-Then-stEer (ATE) for Vision-Language-Action models that aligns heterogeneous action spaces via a variational autoencoder with reverse KL, then guides the model during fine-tuning to the target domain; yields improved cross-embodiment and cross-task performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLA models pretrained on large, diverse data show strong potential, but adapting them to downstream tasks with different robot embodiments or tasks causes action-distribution mismatch that requires large data and compute for fine-tuning.

Method: 1) Align action spaces by constructing a unified latent space using a variational autoencoder constrained by reverse KL divergence to embed adaptation actions into modes of the pre-training action latent distribution. 2) During fine-tuning, steer (guide) diffusion- or flow-based VLA generation toward the target domain by a guidance mechanism that shifts output distributions.

Result: Experiments in cross-embodiment and cross-task manipulation show substantial gains: up to 9.8% average multi-task success rate improvement in simulation, and a 32% real-world success rate gain in cross-embodiment settings, compared to direct fine-tuning of representative VLAs.

Conclusion: ATE provides a general, lightweight, plug-and-play solution that significantly improves the practicality of deploying VLA models to new robotic platforms and tasks.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models pre-trained on large, diverse datasets
show remarkable potential for general-purpose robotic manipulation. However, a
primary bottleneck remains in adapting these models to downstream tasks,
especially when the robot's embodiment or the task itself differs from the
pre-training data. This discrepancy leads to a significant mismatch in action
distributions, demanding extensive data and compute for effective fine-tuning.
To address this challenge, we introduce \textbf{Align-Then-stEer
(\texttt{ATE})}, a novel, data-efficient, and plug-and-play adaptation
framework. \texttt{ATE} first aligns disparate action spaces by constructing a
unified latent space, where a variational autoencoder constrained by reverse KL
divergence embeds adaptation actions into modes of the pre-training action
latent distribution. Subsequently, it steers the diffusion- or flow-based VLA's
generation process during fine-tuning via a guidance mechanism that pushes the
model's output distribution towards the target domain. We conduct extensive
experiments on cross-embodiment and cross-task manipulation in both simulation
and real world. Compared to direct fine-tuning of representative VLAs, our
method improves the average multi-task success rate by up to \textbf{9.8\%} in
simulation and achieves a striking \textbf{32\% success rate gain} in a
real-world cross-embodiment setting. Our work presents a general and
lightweight solution that greatly enhances the practicality of deploying VLA
models to new robotic platforms and tasks.

*Guangzhen Sun,Ye Ding,Xiangyang Zhu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Analytical base-parameter identification for robots via a projective geometric algebra framework, introducing the tetrahedral-point model and a robust, efficient DRNG algorithm with O(1) per-regressor complexity after O(N) preprocessing; validated on multiple robots.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate, analytic determination of base inertial parameters is essential for precise robot dynamics and control; existing methods may be inefficient, opaque, or limited in handling complex configurations. The authors propose a geometry-driven, closed-form approach to improve robustness and speed, especially for parallel kinematic machines.

Method: Reform dynamics with projective geometric algebra; define tetrahedral-point (TP) model; derive regression coefficients in closed form with clear geometric meaning; propose three principles (shared points, fixed points, planar rotations) to guide base-parameter extraction; implement Dynamics Regressor Nullspace Generator (DRNG) with O(1) per-parameter complexity after an O(N) preprocessing; apply to four robots.

Result: Successfully identifies the complete base-parameter sets for Puma560, Unitree Go2, 2RRU-1RRS PKM, and 2PRS-1PSR PKM; demonstrates robustness and computational efficiency, particularly for PKMs.

Conclusion: The approach is general, robust, and efficient for analytic base-parameter identification; the TP model and DRNG provide insights and practical tools for accurate robot dynamics modeling.

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel geometric method for analytically determining the
base inertial parameters of robotic systems. The rigid body dynamics is
reformulated using projective geometric algebra, leading to a new
identification model named ``tetrahedral-point (TP)" model. Based on the rigid
body TP model, coefficients in the regresoor matrix of the identification model
are derived in closed-form, exhibiting clear geometric interpretations.
Building directly from the dynamic model, three foundational principles for
base parameter analysis are proposed: the shared points principle, fixed points
principle, and planar rotations principle. With these principles, algorithms
are developed to automatically determine all the base parameters. The core
algorithm, referred to as Dynamics Regressor Nullspace Generator (DRNG),
achieves $O(1)$-complexity theoretically following an $O(N)$-complexity
preprocessing stage, where $N$ is the number of rigid bodies. The proposed
method and algorithms are validated across four robots: Puma560, Unitree Go2, a
2RRU-1RRS parallel kinematics mechanism (PKM), and a 2PRS-1PSR PKM. In all
cases, the algorithms successfully identify the complete set of base
parameters. Notably, the approach demonstrates high robustness and
computational efficiency, particularly in the cases of PKMs. Through the
comprehensive demonstrations, the method is shown to be general, robust, and
efficient.

*Andrea Eirale,Matteo Leonetti,Marcello Chiaberge*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A framework to learn a social-valued heuristic for navigation (HPLSV) and apply it to queue-joining; aims to generalize social norms beyond standard obstacle avoidance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robots must exhibit socially acceptable behavior that standard navigation cannot guarantee; social norms need to be learned and encoded as costs.

Method: Learn a value function capturing the cost of socially compliant navigation and use it as an auxiliary heuristic in heuristic-search path planning; demonstrated in the common scenario of joining a queue.

Result: Preliminary work with an initial demonstration; no extensive empirical results reported.

Conclusion: Suggests that learning social costs as part of planning can improve social acceptance; future work to broaden scenarios and evaluate performance.

Abstract: Social robotic navigation has been at the center of numerous studies in
recent years. Most of the research has focused on driving the robotic agent
along obstacle-free trajectories, respecting social distances from humans, and
predicting their movements to optimize navigation. However, in order to really
be socially accepted, the robots must be able to attain certain social norms
that cannot arise from conventional navigation, but require a dedicated
learning process. We propose Heuristic Planning with Learned Social Value
(HPLSV), a method to learn a value function encapsulating the cost of social
navigation, and use it as an additional heuristic in heuristic-search path
planning. In this preliminary work, we apply the methodology to the common
social scenario of joining a queue of people, with the intention of
generalizing to further human activities.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Proposes metrics to evaluate trade-offs in motion-level simplifications within bilevel optimization for industrial robotic work cells; uses simulations to study the impact on high-level design and applies to time-optimal kinematic design in palletization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-level optimization of hyperparameters (e.g., base/tool placement, kinematic design) depends on low-level motion planning, which is computationally expensive. Simplifications introduce trade-offs whose effects on overall performance are not yet quantified.

Method: Introduce metrics for optimality, time gain, robustness, and consistency to assess motion-level trade-offs. Conduct extensive simulations to study how simplified motion planning affects high-level optimization outcomes. Apply the framework to find time-optimal kinematic designs for a modular robot in two palletization scenarios.

Result: The metrics enable systematic evaluation of trade-offs between motion-level simplifications and high-level optimization outcomes. Simulation results illustrate the impact on solution quality and computational effort, guiding how to balance complexity and performance.

Conclusion: The proposed metrics and framework provide a systematic approach to quantify and balance trade-offs in bilevel optimization for robotic work cells, demonstrated via time-optimal kinematic design in palletization scenarios.

Abstract: The performance of industrial robotic work cells depends on optimizing
various hyperparameters referring to the cell layout, such as robot base
placement, tool placement, and kinematic design. Achieving this requires a
bilevel optimization approach, where the high-level optimization adjusts these
hyperparameters, and the low-level optimization computes robot motions.
However, computing the optimal robot motion is computationally infeasible,
introducing trade-offs in motion planning to make the problem tractable. These
trade-offs significantly impact the overall performance of the bilevel
optimization, but their effects still need to be systematically evaluated. In
this paper, we introduce metrics to assess these trade-offs regarding
optimality, time gain, robustness, and consistency. Through extensive
simulation studies, we investigate how simplifications in motion-level
optimization affect the high-level optimization outcomes, balancing
computational complexity with solution quality. The proposed algorithms are
applied to find the time-optimal kinematic design for a modular robot in two
palletization scenarios.

*Ruibin Zhang,Fei Gao*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Radar-based 3D environmental perception for agriculture using parallel frame accumulation, diffusion-model hierarchical learning for denoising and semantic reconstruction, and a sparse 3D network; on real-field data, it improves accuracy and efficiency and can reconstruct thin structures that are hard for optical methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Optical sensors suffer from occlusion and contamination in agricultural environments. Radar offers penetration and robustness, but existing radar-based methods struggle with noise, clutter, and large-scale data. A dense, efficient radar-based 3D semantic pipeline is needed for reliable autonomous farming.

Method: Three core modules: (1) parallel frame accumulation to boost radar signal-to-noise ratio; (2) a diffusion model-based hierarchical learning framework that first filters radar sidelobe artifacts and then generates fine-grained 3D semantic point clouds; (3) a sparse 3D network optimized for processing large-scale radar raw data.

Result: On a self-built real-world agricultural dataset, the approach achieves superior structural and semantic predictions over existing methods, while reducing computation cost by 51.3% and memory usage by 27.5%. It also enables complete reconstruction and accurate classification of thin structures (e.g., poles, wires) that prior methods struggle to perceive.

Conclusion: The proposed radar-based framework shows strong potential for dense and accurate 3D radar perception in agricultural environments, offering robustness to sensor contamination and occlusion with notable efficiency gains.

Abstract: Accurate and robust environmental perception is crucial for robot autonomous
navigation. While current methods typically adopt optical sensors (e.g.,
camera, LiDAR) as primary sensing modalities, their susceptibility to visual
occlusion often leads to degraded performance or complete system failure. In
this paper, we focus on agricultural scenarios where robots are exposed to the
risk of onboard sensor contamination. Leveraging radar's strong penetration
capability, we introduce a radar-based 3D environmental perception framework as
a viable alternative. It comprises three core modules designed for dense and
accurate semantic perception: 1) Parallel frame accumulation to enhance
signal-to-noise ratio of radar raw data. 2) A diffusion model-based
hierarchical learning framework that first filters radar sidelobe artifacts
then generates fine-grained 3D semantic point clouds. 3) A specifically
designed sparse 3D network optimized for processing large-scale radar raw data.
We conducted extensive benchmark comparisons and experimental evaluations on a
self-built dataset collected in real-world agricultural field scenes. Results
demonstrate that our method achieves superior structural and semantic
prediction performance compared to existing methods, while simultaneously
reducing computational and memory costs by 51.3% and 27.5%, respectively.
Furthermore, our approach achieves complete reconstruction and accurate
classification of thin structures such as poles and wires-which existing
methods struggle to perceive-highlighting its potential for dense and accurate
3D radar perception.

TL;DR: Unified LLM-guided planning and VLM-based perception for long-horizon deformable-object manipulation (cloth folding), achieving strong generalization across seen/unseen tasks and real-world robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deformable-object manipulation is hard due to high degrees of freedom, complex dynamics, and the need for reliable language grounding; cloth folding requires long-horizon planning and fine-grained perception.

Method: A unified framework combining (1) an LLM-based planner that decomposes high-level instructions into action primitives, bridging semantic-execution gap; (2) a VLM-based perception module built on SigLIP2 with bidirectional cross-attention fusion and DoRA-based fine-tuning for language-conditioned visual grounding; (3) a task execution module to carry out actions. Evaluated in simulation and real robot.

Result: Simulation: outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by 2.23, 1.87, and 33.3 on seen instructions, unseen instructions, and unseen tasks. Real robot: robust multi-step folding across diverse cloth materials/configurations, showing strong generalization.

Conclusion: The proposed LLM-VLM unified framework effectively bridges semantics and perception to enable language-guided long-horizon manipulation of deformable objects, with notable generalization and real-world applicability. A project page is provided.

Abstract: Language-guided long-horizon manipulation of deformable objects presents
significant challenges due to high degrees of freedom, complex dynamics, and
the need for accurate vision-language grounding. In this work, we focus on
multi-step cloth folding, a representative deformable-object manipulation task
that requires both structured long-horizon planning and fine-grained visual
perception. To this end, we propose a unified framework that integrates a Large
Language Model (LLM)-based planner, a Vision-Language Model (VLM)-based
perception system, and a task execution module. Specifically, the LLM-based
planner decomposes high-level language instructions into low-level action
primitives, bridging the semantic-execution gap, aligning perception with
action, and enhancing generalization. The VLM-based perception module employs a
SigLIP2-driven architecture with a bidirectional cross-attention fusion
mechanism and weight-decomposed low-rank adaptation (DoRA) fine-tuning to
achieve language-conditioned fine-grained visual grounding. Experiments in both
simulation and real-world settings demonstrate the method's effectiveness. In
simulation, it outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by 2.23, 1.87, and 33.3
on seen instructions, unseen instructions, and unseen tasks, respectively. On a
real robot, it robustly executes multi-step folding sequences from language

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address depth estimation challenges due to transparent microrobots, low-contrast imaging, and scarce annotated data in optical microrobot manipulation tasks.

Method: Augments convolutional feature extraction with physics-based focus metrics (entropy, Laplacian of Gaussian, gradient sharpness) computed on an adaptive grid that concentrates computation on microrobot regions, yielding improved depth sensitivity with reduced compute.

Result: Achieves over 60% reduction in mean squared error and higher R^2 across test cases; robust when trained on only 20% of data, outperforming ResNet50 trained on full data.

Conclusion: Demonstrates a robust, data-efficient, physics-informed approach for 3D depth estimation of optical microrobots in challenging imaging environments; code released at GitHub.

Abstract: Optical microrobots actuated by optical tweezers (OT) offer great potential
for biomedical applications such as cell manipulation and microscale assembly.
These tasks demand accurate three-dimensional perception to ensure precise
control in complex and dynamic biological environments. However, the
transparent nature of microrobots and low-contrast microscopic imaging
challenge conventional deep learning methods, which also require large
annotated datasets that are costly to obtain. To address these challenges, we
propose a physics-informed, data-efficient framework for depth estimation of
optical microrobots. Our method augments convolutional feature extraction with
physics-based focus metrics, such as entropy, Laplacian of Gaussian, and
gradient sharpness, calculated using an adaptive grid strategy. This approach
allocates finer grids over microrobot regions and coarser grids over background
areas, enhancing depth sensitivity while reducing computational complexity. We
evaluate our framework on multiple microrobot types and demonstrate significant
improvements over baseline models. Specifically, our approach reduces mean
squared error (MSE) by over 60% and improves the coefficient of determination
(R^2) across all test cases. Notably, even when trained on only 20% of the
available data, our model outperforms ResNet50 trained on the full dataset,
highlighting its robustness under limited data conditions. Our code is

Motivation: Indoor cluttered layouts and partial observability in homes/offices create significant barriers for blind/VI users performing multi-object search. Existing assistive tech focuses on navigation/obstacle avoidance and lacks scalable, open-vocabulary, multi-object search in real-world settings.

Method: OpenGuide integrates open-vocabulary natural language understanding with vision-language foundation models to reason about object–scene relationships, uses frontier-based exploration for informative sensing, and employs a POMDP planner with belief-space reasoning and value decay to recover from missed detections. Evaluation includes both simulated and real-world experiments.

Conclusion: Provides a foundation for scalable, human-centered robotic assistance in assisted living, enabling flexible multi-object search in cluttered indoor environments and paving the way for broader adoption and future enhancements.

Abstract: Indoor built environments like homes and offices often present complex and
cluttered layouts that pose significant challenges for individuals who are
blind or visually impaired, especially when performing tasks that involve
locating and gathering multiple objects. While many existing assistive
technologies focus on basic navigation or obstacle avoidance, few systems
provide scalable and efficient multi-object search capabilities in real-world,
partially observable settings. To address this gap, we introduce OpenGuide, an
assistive mobile robot system that combines natural language understanding with
vision-language foundation models (VLM), frontier-based exploration, and a
Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) planner. OpenGuide
interprets open-vocabulary requests, reasons about object-scene relationships,
and adaptively navigates and localizes multiple target items in novel
environments. Our approach enables robust recovery from missed detections
through value decay and belief-space reasoning, resulting in more effective
exploration and object localization. We validate OpenGuide in simulated and
real-world experiments, demonstrating substantial improvements in task success
rate and search efficiency over prior methods. This work establishes a
foundation for scalable, human-centered robotic assistance in assisted living

TL;DR: Coral provides a higher-level abstraction layer that enables composable, independent software components in robotics, improving integration, reusability, and configurability without modifying low-level code; demonstrated on LiDAR-SLAM and multi-robot tasks; open-sourced.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robotics software is often tightly coupled and monolithic, making integration and adaptation time-consuming; users across skill levels struggle to assemble reliable systems from diverse components; there is a need for a layer that constrains integration to semantically meaningful choices to reduce configuration burden while preserving adaptability.

Method: Introduce Coral as an abstraction layer for building, deploying, and coordinating software components; it complements existing tools by providing high-level constraints that guide integration; describes Coral architecture and semantics; demonstrates on LiDAR-based SLAM and multi-robot corrosion mitigation tasks; evaluations revolve around composability, reusability, and configurability; open-source release.

Result: Coral improves practical composability in robotics software, enabling rapid integration, better component reusability, system reconfigurability, and accessibility for both expert and non-expert users; reduces configuration burden while supporting diverse domains; case studies show enabling integration of LiDAR-SLAM and multi-robot tasks without modifying low-level code.

Conclusion: Coral offers a scalable solution to robotics system integration challenges by providing a higher-level abstraction that complements existing tools, enhancing composability and accessibility; open-source release to foster adoption.

Abstract: Despite the multitude of excellent software components and tools available in
the robotics and broader software engineering communities, successful
integration of software for robotic systems remains a time-consuming and
challenging task for users of all knowledge and skill levels. And with robotics
software often being built into tightly coupled, monolithic systems, even minor
alterations to improve performance, adjust to changing task requirements, or
deploy to new hardware can require significant engineering investment. To help
solve this problem, this paper presents Coral, an abstraction layer for
building, deploying, and coordinating independent software components that
maximizes composability to allow for rapid system integration without modifying
low-level code. Rather than replacing existing tools, Coral complements them by
introducing a higher-level abstraction that constrains the integration process
to semantically meaningful choices, reducing the configuration burden without
limiting adaptability to diverse domains, systems, and tasks. We describe Coral
in detail and demonstrate its utility in integrating software for scenarios of

### [381] [Classification of Vision-Based Tactile Sensors: A Review](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02478)
*Haoran Li,Yijiong Lin,Chenghua Lu,Max Yang,Efi Psomopoulou,Nathan F Lepora*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A proposed two-principle taxonomy for vision-based tactile sensors (VBTS): Marker-Based and Intensity-Based transduction, with SMB/MMB subtypes under Marker-Based and RLB/TLB under Intensity-Based, accompanied by a hardware-focused comparison and a discussion of interpretation methods, challenges, and future directions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To organize the diverse VBTS designs into a coherent framework, enabling standardized comparison of hardware characteristics and interpretation strategies across architectures.

Method: A literature-driven comparative study that (i) defines a four-type taxonomy (SMB, MMB, RLB, TLB) based on transduction principles, (ii) surveys hardware configurations and combinations within these types, and (iii) reviews common tactile-information interpretation methods, culminating in a synthesis of challenges and future directions.

Result: Introduction of a two-principle classification of VBTS (Marker-Based vs Intensity-Based) with two subtypes each (SMB/MMB; RLB/TLB); a hardware-oriented comparison across the four types, and a discussion of prevailing interpretation methods; identification of key challenges and suggested directions for future research.

Conclusion: The taxonomy clarifies the VBTS landscape, enabling more systematic hardware design and interpretation strategies, and highlights practical challenges and research gaps to guide future work.

Abstract: Vision-based tactile sensors (VBTS) have gained widespread application in
robotic hands, grippers and prosthetics due to their high spatial resolution,
low manufacturing costs, and ease of customization. While VBTSs have common
design features, such as a camera module, they can differ in a rich diversity
of sensing principles, material compositions, multimodal approaches, and data
interpretation methods. Here, we propose a novel classification of VBTS that
categorizes the technology into two primary sensing principles based on the
underlying transduction of contact into a tactile image: the Marker-Based
Transduction Principle and the Intensity-Based Transduction Principle.
Marker-Based Transduction interprets tactile information by detecting marker
displacement and changes in marker density. In contrast, Intensity-Based
Transduction maps external disturbances with variations in pixel values.
Depending on the design of the contact module, Marker-Based Transduction can be
further divided into two subtypes: Simple Marker-Based (SMB) and Morphological
Marker-Based (MMB) mechanisms. Similarly, the Intensity-Based Transduction
Principle encompasses the Reflective Layer-based (RLB) and Transparent
Layer-Based (TLB) mechanisms. This paper provides a comparative study of the
hardware characteristics of these four types of sensors including various
combination types, and discusses the commonly used methods for interpreting
tactile information. This~comparison reveals some current challenges faced by
VBTS technology and directions for future research.

*Minghuan Liu,Zhengbang Zhu,Xiaoshen Han,Peng Hu,Haotong Lin,Xinyao Li,Jingxiao Chen,Jiafeng Xu,Yichu Yang,Yunfeng Lin,Xinghang Li,Yong Yu,Weinan Zhang,Tao Kong,Bingyi Kang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Proposes Camera Depth Models (CDMs) that denoise and convert raw depth from RGB-D cameras into accurate metric depth using a neural data engine trained on simulated noise patterns; demonstrates near-simulation depth accuracy and zero-shot sim-to-real transfer for long-horizon robotic manipulation without real-world fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robotic manipulation often relies on 2D RGB streams, which generalize poorly; humans use 3D geometric cues. Depth cameras offer 3D information but suffer from noise and inaccuracies, hindering real-world transfer. A reliable, easy-to-deploy depth perception module could bridge the sim-to-real gap.

Method: Introduce Camera Depth Models (CDMs) as a plugin for common depth cameras. Use a neural data engine that creates high-quality RGB-D paired data from simulation by modeling the camera's noise. Train CDMs to output denoised, accurate metric depth from RGB images and raw depth maps.

Result: CDMs achieve nearly simulation-level depth accuracy, enabling policies trained on simulated depth to transfer to real robots without real-world fine-tuning. Demonstrated on two long-horizon tasks with articulated, reflective, and slender objects, showing limited performance degradation in real-world transfer.

Conclusion: Leveraging simulated data and 3D depth information via CDMs can bridge the sim-to-real gap in manipulation policies, encouraging further exploration of depth-based perception and simulation-to-reality transfer.

Abstract: Modern robotic manipulation primarily relies on visual observations in a 2D
color space for skill learning but suffers from poor generalization. In
contrast, humans, living in a 3D world, depend more on physical properties-such
as distance, size, and shape-than on texture when interacting with objects.
Since such 3D geometric information can be acquired from widely available depth
cameras, it appears feasible to endow robots with similar perceptual
capabilities. Our pilot study found that using depth cameras for manipulation
is challenging, primarily due to their limited accuracy and susceptibility to
various types of noise. In this work, we propose Camera Depth Models (CDMs) as
a simple plugin on daily-use depth cameras, which take RGB images and raw depth
signals as input and output denoised, accurate metric depth. To achieve this,
we develop a neural data engine that generates high-quality paired data from
simulation by modeling a depth camera's noise pattern. Our results show that
CDMs achieve nearly simulation-level accuracy in depth prediction, effectively
bridging the sim-to-real gap for manipulation tasks. Notably, our experiments
demonstrate, for the first time, that a policy trained on raw simulated depth,
without the need for adding noise or real-world fine-tuning, generalizes
seamlessly to real-world robots on two challenging long-horizon tasks involving
articulated, reflective, and slender objects, with little to no performance
degradation. We hope our findings will inspire future research in utilizing
simulation data and 3D information in general robot policies.

### [384] [Diagnosing Psychiatric Patients: Can Large Language and Machine Learning Models Perform Effectively in Emergency Cases?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00026)
*Abu Shad Ahammed,Sayeri Mukherjee,Roman Obermaisser*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Explores using traditional ML and large language models (e.g., Llama 3.1) to assess emergency psychiatric patients from a German rescue station dataset to aid diagnosis in urgent situations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mental disorders are often misjudged due to subtle symptoms; emergency contexts demand rapid, accurate identification to improve outcomes; evaluating ML/LLM tools could support triage and diagnosis.

Method: Collect data from emergency psychiatric patients at a rescue station in Germany; apply traditional ML models and large language models (including Llama 3.1) to the data to assess predictive capability for identifying unhealthy mental disorders in rescue scenarios.

Result: Not reported in abstract; aims to evaluate predictive capabilities, but no results/metrics provided.

Conclusion: The study seeks to determine feasibility and usefulness of ML/LLMs for rapid psychiatric assessment in emergencies; no definitive conclusions presented in the abstract.

Abstract: Mental disorders are clinically significant patterns of behavior that are
associated with stress and/or impairment in social, occupational, or family
activities. People suffering from such disorders are often misjudged and poorly
diagnosed due to a lack of visible symptoms compared to other health
complications. During emergency situations, identifying psychiatric issues is
that's why challenging but highly required to save patients. In this paper, we
have conducted research on how traditional machine learning and large language
models (LLM) can assess these psychiatric patients based on their behavioral
patterns to provide a diagnostic assessment. Data from emergency psychiatric
patients were collected from a rescue station in Germany. Various machine
learning models, including Llama 3.1, were used with rescue patient data to
assess if the predictive capabilities of the models can serve as an efficient
tool for identifying patients with unhealthy mental disorders, especially in
rescue cases.

*Elie Thellier,Huiyu Li,Nicholas Ayache,Hervé Delingette*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A simple export-time defense: decaying layer-wise fine-tuning perturbs model parameters to block data exfiltration in medical data lakes while preserving utility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical data lakes enable powerful ML but pose privacy risks: adversaries can reconstruct protected health information from model parameters or through memorization in multi-task settings; a defense is needed that preserves model utility.

Method: Fine-tune exported models with a decaying layer-wise learning rate to corrupt embedded data; evaluate on DermaMNIST, ChestMNIST, and MIMIC-CXR; compare to prior defenses; perform ablations and analyze adaptive attacks.

Result: Utility performance is preserved; exfiltration attacks are disrupted and outperformed prior defenses; exfiltrated data becomes unusable; ablation results support effectiveness; adaptive attack discussion highlights limits and future directions.

Conclusion: Presents a practical defense against data leakage in data lake-trained models and centralized federated learning, with guidance for deployment and avenues for future work.

Abstract: Data lakes enable the training of powerful machine learning models on
sensitive, high-value medical datasets, but also introduce serious privacy
risks due to potential leakage of protected health information. Recent studies
show adversaries can exfiltrate training data by embedding latent
representations into model parameters or inducing memorization via multi-task
learning. These attacks disguise themselves as benign utility models while
enabling reconstruction of high-fidelity medical images, posing severe privacy
threats with legal and ethical implications. In this work, we propose a simple
yet effective mitigation strategy that perturbs model parameters at export time
through fine-tuning with a decaying layer-wise learning rate to corrupt
embedded data without degrading task performance. Evaluations on DermaMNIST,
ChestMNIST, and MIMIC-CXR show that our approach maintains utility task
performance, effectively disrupts state-of-the-art exfiltration attacks,
outperforms prior defenses, and renders exfiltrated data unusable for training.
Ablations and discussions on adaptive attacks highlight challenges and future
directions. Our findings offer a practical defense against data leakage in data
lake-trained models and centralized federated learning.

*Qitao Tan,Xiaoying Song,Jin Lu,Guoming Li,Jun Liu,Lingzi Hong,Caiwen Ding,Jundong Li,Xiaoming Zhai,Shaoyi Huang,Wei Niu,Geng Yuan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A zeroth-order QAT framework, ZeroQAT, achieves end-to-end high-quality low-bit quantization by using forward-only gradient estimation and jointly optimizing quantized weights, clipping thresholds, and equivalent transformations, matching QAT accuracy with PTQ efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantizing large language models (LLMs) is essential for reducing deployment costs. Post-training quantization (PTQ) is efficient but accuracy-degrading due to layer-wise optimization and misalignment with downstream tasks, while quantization-aware training (QAT) is accurate but costly due to backpropagation. A practical solution needs end-to-end optimization with low overhead.

Method: ZeroQAT employs zeroth-order optimization with forward-only gradient estimation to eliminate backpropagation. It performs end-to-end QAT while jointly learning quantized weights, weight clipping thresholds, and equivalent transformations to mitigate quantization errors and handle activation outliers.

Result: Experiments indicate that ZeroQAT achieves the efficiency of PTQ while retaining the accuracy of QAT, offering a practical solution for high-quality low-bit quantization of LLMs.

Conclusion: ZeroQAT provides a practical framework for high-quality, low-bit quantization of LLMs by combining end-to-end optimization with zeroth-order gradients and joint parameter learning, reducing compute and memory overhead without sacrificing accuracy.

Abstract: Quantization is an effective technique to reduce the deployment cost of large
language models (LLMs), and post-training quantization (PTQ) has been widely
studied due to its efficiency. However, existing low-bit PTQ methods suffer
from accuracy degradation because their layer-wise optimization introduces
cumulative error propagation and misalignment between local reconstruction
objectives and downstream performance. While quantization-aware training (QAT)
provides a principled solution, its reliance on backpropagation incurs
prohibitive data, time, and memory costs, limiting its practicality. To address
these challenges, we propose ZeroQAT, a zeroth-order optimization-based QAT
framework. ZeroQAT leverages forward-only gradient estimation to eliminate the
need for backpropagation, significantly reducing computational and memory
overhead while retaining the benefits of end-to-end optimization. Moreover,
ZeroQAT jointly learns quantized weights, weight clipping thresholds, and
equivalent transformations to mitigate quantization error and handle activation
outliers. Experiments demonstrate that ZeroQAT achieves the efficiency of PTQ
while retaining the accuracy of QAT, offering a practical solution for
high-quality low-bit quantization of LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Slag flow contamination causes financial losses in steel casting; robust, cross-domain, real-time diagnostics are needed to improve reliability and efficiency.

Method: Hybrid model: 1D CNN + LSTM applied to raw time-domain accelerometer signals; RMS preprocessing; selective embedding data loading; evaluation on a cross-domain dataset with 16 domains; benchmarked against a standard 1D CNN.

Result: Highest test accuracy of 99.10 ± 0.30%; robust generalization across domains; outperforms traditional models and loading techniques.

Conclusion: Demonstrates a practical, scalable solution for real-time slag flow monitoring with industrial relevance and potential impact on reliability and efficiency.

Abstract: Steel casting processes are vulnerable to financial losses due to slag flow
contamination, making accurate slag flow condition detection essential. This
study introduces a novel cross-domain diagnostic method using vibration data
collected from an industrial steel foundry to identify various stages of slag
flow. A hybrid deep learning model combining one-dimensional convolutional
neural networks and long short-term memory layers is implemented, tested, and
benchmarked against a standard one-dimensional convolutional neural network.
The proposed method processes raw time-domain vibration signals from
accelerometers and evaluates performance across 16 distinct domains using a
realistic cross-domain dataset split. Results show that the hybrid
convolutional neural network and long short-term memory architecture, when
combined with root mean square preprocessing and a selective embedding data
loading strategy, achieves robust classification accuracy, outperforming
traditional models and loading techniques. The highest test accuracy of 99.10
+/- 0.30 demonstrates the method's capability for generalization and industrial
relevance. This work presents a practical and scalable solution for real-time
slag flow monitoring, contributing to improved reliability and operational
efficiency in steel manufacturing.

*Yuxuan Yin,Rebecca Chen,Boxun Xu,Chen He,Peng Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Transfer learning from 16nm legacy data with on-chip odometer features enables accurate V_min prediction at 5nm.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate V_min prediction is crucial for chip energy efficiency and reliability, but at advanced nodes data is scarce and the mapping from process variations to V_min is complex.

Method: A transfer learning framework that uses abundant 16nm data and augments it with input features derived from on-chip silicon odometer sensor data to capture localized process variations relevant at 5nm.

Result: Significant improvement in V_min prediction accuracy at 5nm.

Conclusion: The proposed framework enables accurate V_min prediction at advanced technology nodes by leveraging legacy data and odometer-based features.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of chip performance is critical for ensuring energy
efficiency and reliability in semiconductor manufacturing. However, developing
minimum operating voltage ($V_{min}$) prediction models at advanced technology
nodes is challenging due to limited training data and the complex relationship
between process variations and $V_{min}$. To address these issues, we propose a
novel transfer learning framework that leverages abundant legacy data from the
16nm technology node to enable accurate $V_{min}$ prediction at the advanced
5nm node. A key innovation of our approach is the integration of input features
derived from on-chip silicon odometer sensor data, which provide fine-grained
characterization of localized process variations -- an essential factor at the
5nm node -- resulting in significantly improved prediction accuracy.

### [389] [A-FloPS: Accelerating Diffusion Sampling with Adaptive Flow Path Sampler](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00036)
*Cheng Jin,Zhenyu Xiao,Yuantao Gu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A-FloPS is a training-free framework that reparameterizes diffusion-model sampling into a flow-matching form with an adaptive velocity decomposition, enabling high-quality, low-NFE sampling without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models achieve state-of-the-art generative performance but are computationally expensive due to iterative sampling. Training-free acceleration methods are limited by inefficient sampling trajectories and cannot fully leverage high-order solvers.

Method: Reparameterize the diffusion sampling trajectory into a flow-matching formulation and map diffusion scores to flow velocities. Introduce an adaptive velocity decomposition that splits the velocity into a linear drift and a suppressed-variation residual, preserving accuracy at very low numbers of function evaluations (NFE). Works on pre-trained models and improves flow-based generators as well.

Result: A-FloPS consistently outperforms existing training-free samplers in sample quality (lower FID, sharper, more coherent images) and efficiency across conditional image generation and text-to-image tasks, achieving strong results with as few as 5 function evaluations. The adaptive mechanism also enhances native flow-based models, indicating broad applicability and robustness.

Conclusion: A-FloPS is a versatile, effective solution for high-quality, low-latency generative modeling that can be applied to pre-trained diffusion models without retraining, with broad generality and notable performance gains.

Abstract: Diffusion models deliver state-of-the-art generative performance across
diverse modalities but remain computationally expensive due to their inherently
iterative sampling process. Existing training-free acceleration methods
typically improve numerical solvers for the reverse-time ODE, yet their
effectiveness is fundamentally constrained by the inefficiency of the
underlying sampling trajectories. We propose A-FloPS (Adaptive Flow Path
Sampler), a principled, training-free framework that reparameterizes the
sampling trajectory of any pre-trained diffusion model into a flow-matching
form and augments it with an adaptive velocity decomposition. The
reparameterization analytically maps diffusion scores to flow-compatible
velocities, yielding integration-friendly trajectories without retraining. The
adaptive mechanism further factorizes the velocity field into a linear drift
term and a residual component whose temporal variation is actively suppressed,
restoring the accuracy benefits of high-order integration even in extremely
low-NFE regimes. Extensive experiments on conditional image generation and
text-to-image synthesis show that A-FloPS consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art training-free samplers in both sample quality and efficiency.
Notably, with as few as $5$ function evaluations, A-FloPS achieves
substantially lower FID and generates sharper, more coherent images. The
adaptive mechanism also improves native flow-based generative models,
underscoring its generality. These results position A-FloPS as a versatile and
effective solution for high-quality, low-latency generative modeling.

*Chunming Ye,Songzhou Li,Xu Xu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Layer-wise weight distributions in LLMs exhibit power-law cosine distances; a distribution-aware initialization for LoRA via a Gaussian-Pareto generator yields modest gains without changing training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand cross-layer weight correlations across layers with different architectures and their potential impact on LoRA (LoRA) training effectiveness.

Method: 1) Extract Query-projection, down-projection, and other matrices from self-attention and MLP layers. 2) Compute singular values via SVD and organize them by projection type. 3) Analyze cosine-distance distributions between these matrices and identify power-law characteristics. 4) Propose a qualitative descriptor for distribution across models. 5) Design a data generator combining Gaussian process and Pareto distributions to simulate distributions matching the characteristics. 6) Reshape LoRA initialization weights based on these distributions. 

Result: Demonstrates power-law characteristics in inter-layer cosine distances; provides a qualitative descriptor for model distribution characteristics; introduces a Gaussian-Pareto data generator to shape weight initializations for LoRA; reports modest improvements in LoRA training without changing model structure or training process.

Conclusion: Distribution-aware initialization informed by cross-layer weight distribution characteristics can modestly improve LoRA training efficacy and points to new directions for PEFT (parameter-efficient fine-tuning) design.

Abstract: The performance of Large Language Models is influenced by their
characteristics such as architecture, model sizes, decoding methods and so on.
Due to differences in structure or function, the weights in different layers of
large models have varying distributions. This paper explores the correlations
between different types of layers in terms of weights distribution and studies
the potential impact of these correlations on LoRA training effectiveness.
Firstly, the study reveals that in the model the cosine distances between
weights of different layers manifest power-law distribution. We extract
Query-projection, down-projection and other weight matrices from the
self-attention layers and MLP layers, calculate the singular values of the
matrices using singular value decomposition, and organize a certain number of
singular values into matrices according to projection's type. By analyzing the
probability distribution of the cosine distances between these matrices, it is
found that the cosine distances values between them have distinct power-law
distribution characteristics. Secondly, based on the results of distance
calculations and analysis across different layers of model, a qualitative
method is proposed to describe the distribution characteristics of different
models. Next, to construct weights that align with the distribution
characteristics, a data generator is designed using a combination of Gaussian
process and Pareto distribution functions. The generator is used to simulate
the generation of data that aligns with specific distribution characteristics.
Finally, based on the aforementioned distribution characteristics and data
generation method, the weights in LoRA initialization are reshaped for
training. Experimental results indicate that, without altering the model
structure or training process, this method achieves a certain improvement in
the performance of LoRA training.

*Jina Kim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Internal replay reduces forgetting in continual learning, especially when combined with Synaptic Intelligence (SI), but at the cost of reduced initial task accuracy and greater latent-space overlap that may blur task-specific distinctions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To critically evaluate the internal replay mechanism as a core brain-inspired strategy to combat catastrophic forgetting in continual learning, using CIFAR-100 in a class-incremental setting and examining its interaction with Synaptic Intelligence.

Method: Empirical evaluation on CIFAR-100 in a class-incremental setting comparing internal replay alone and in combination with Synaptic Intelligence (SI). Various analyses (log-likelihood distributions, reconstruction errors, silhouette scores, and UMAP projections) to assess representational changes and forgetting.

Result: Internal replay substantially mitigates forgetting, with enhanced effect when paired with SI, but it reduces initial task accuracy and increases representational overlap in latent space, potentially reducing task-specific differentiation.

Conclusion: Brain-inspired internal replay offers a notable stability benefit but introduces a plasticity-cost and representational blurring. Balancing retention and adaptability remains a key challenge; future work should address controllable trade-offs to preserve task-specific distinctions while mitigating forgetting.

Abstract: Artificial neural networks (ANNs) continue to face challenges in continual
learning, particularly due to catastrophic forgetting, the loss of previously
learned knowledge when acquiring new tasks. Inspired by memory consolidation in
the human brain, we investigate the internal replay mechanism proposed
by~\citep{brain_inspired_replay1}, which reactivates latent representations of
prior experiences during learning. As internal replay was identified as the
most influential component among the brain-inspired mechanisms in their
framework, it serves as the central focus of our in-depth investigation. Using
the CIFAR-100 dataset in a class-incremental setting, we evaluate the
effectiveness of internal replay, both in isolation and in combination with
Synaptic Intelligence (SI). Our experiments show that internal replay
significantly mitigates forgetting, especially when paired with SI, but at the
cost of reduced initial task accuracy, highlighting a trade-off between memory
stability and learning plasticity. Further analyses using log-likelihood
distributions, reconstruction errors, silhouette scores, and UMAP projections
reveal that internal replay increases representational overlap in latent space,
potentially limiting task-specific differentiation. These results underscore
the limitations of current brain-inspired methods and suggest future directions
for balancing retention and adaptability in continual learning systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To accelerate site screening for underground hydrogen storage, natural hydrogen exploration, and radioactive waste containment by moving beyond time-consuming, error-prone traditional experiments and capturing geological heterogeneity.

Method: An adaptive PINN framework that combines classical isotherm models with thermodynamic constraints. Uses multi-category feature engineering across seven categories, deep residual networks with multi-head attention, adaptive loss functions, and Monte Carlo dropout for uncertainty. Trained on 155 samples (50 clays, 60 shales, 45 coals) with K-fold cross-validation and hyperparameter optimization. Interpretability via SHAP, accumulated local effects, and Friedman's H-statistics.

Result: Achieves R2 = 0.979 and RMSE = 0.045 mol/kg on the overall dataset. Lithology-specific R2: clays 0.981, shales 0.971, coals 0.978. 67% faster convergence despite a 15-fold increase in complexity. Reliability scores between 85–91%. 86.7% of feature pairs show strong interactions.

Conclusion: The adaptive PINN framework provides robust, physically consistent hydrogen sorption predictions with quantified uncertainty, enabling faster site screening and risk-informed decision-making; the results also underscore the importance of non-linear modeling and feature interactions in capturing sorption dynamics.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of hydrogen sorption in clays, shales, and coals is vital
for advancing underground hydrogen storage, natural hydrogen exploration, and
radioactive waste containment. Traditional experimental methods, while
foundational, are time-consuming, error-prone, and limited in capturing
geological heterogeneity. This study introduces an adaptive physics-informed
neural network (PINN) framework with multi-category feature engineering to
enhance hydrogen sorption prediction. The framework integrates classical
isotherm models with thermodynamic constraints to ensure physical consistency
while leveraging deep learning flexibility. A comprehensive dataset consisting
of 155 samples, which includes 50 clays, 60 shales, and 45 coals, was employed,
incorporating diverse compositional properties and experimental conditions.
Multi-category feature engineering across seven categories captured complex
sorption dynamics. The PINN employs deep residual networks with multi-head
attention, optimized via adaptive loss functions and Monte Carlo dropout for
uncertainty quantification. K-fold cross-validation and hyperparameter
optimization achieve significant accuracy (R2 = 0.979, RMSE = 0.045 mol per kg)
with 67% faster convergence despite 15-fold increased complexity. The framework
demonstrates robust lithology-specific performance across clay minerals (R2 =
0.981), shales (R2 = 0.971), and coals (R2 = 0.978), maintaining 85-91%
reliability scores. Interpretability analysis via SHAP, accumulated local
effects, and Friedman's H-statistics reveal that hydrogen adsorption capacity
dominates predictions, while 86.7% of feature pairs exhibit strong
interactions, validating the necessity of non-linear modeling approaches. This
adaptive physics-informed framework accelerates site screening and enables
risk-informed decision-making through robust uncertainty quantification.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Deep learning-based anomaly detection on public TLE data reveals statistically significant anomalous activity patterns of Russian RSO around the February 2022 invasion, with per-object analyses and interpretable, element-level insights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Provide indications and warnings (I&W) of aggressive space behavior by Russian resident space objects (RSO) using publicly available two-line element data; enable monitoring of pattern of life/behavior to inform future conflict readiness.

Method: Apply multiple anomaly-detection models (Isolation Forest, Autoencoder variants including traditional AE, VAE, Kolmogorov Arnold Network, and a novel anchor-loss based Autoencoder). Train per-object models on a five-year baseline of RSO activity using TLE data, focusing on the six months before the invasion (Feb 2022) and post-invasion periods. Use reconstruction-error thresholds (sigma) to flag anomalies, with detailed analysis of each RSO by the six orbital elements to improve explainability.

Result: The approaches identified statistically significant anomalies in Russian RSO activity and provided detailed, element-level anomalous findings for individual orbital elements, demonstrating the feasibility of per-object, interpretable anomaly detection on TLE data.

Conclusion: Deep-learning-based PoL/PoB anomaly detection on public TLE data can contribute to I&W for space-domain events. Per-object modeling enhances interpretability by highlighting which orbital elements drive anomalies. Further work could expand datasets, refine thresholds, and explore real-time applications.

Abstract: We apply deep learning techniques for anomaly detection to analyze activity
of Russian-owned resident space objects (RSO) prior to the Ukraine invasion and
assess the results for any findings that can be used as indications and
warnings (I&W) of aggressive military behavior for future conflicts. Through
analysis of anomalous activity, an understanding of possible tactics and
procedures can be established to assess the existence of statistically
significant changes in Russian RSO pattern of life/pattern of behavior
(PoL/PoB) using publicly available two-line element (TLE) data. This research
looks at statistical and deep learning approaches to assess anomalous activity.
The deep learning methods assessed are isolation forest (IF), traditional
autoencoder (AE), variational autoencoder (VAE), Kolmogorov Arnold Network
(KAN), and a novel anchor-loss based autoencoder (Anchor AE). Each model is
used to establish a baseline of on-orbit activity based on a five-year data
sample. The primary investigation period focuses on the six months leading up
to the invasion date of February 24, 2022. Additional analysis looks at RSO
activity during an active combat period by sampling TLE data after the invasion
date. The deep learning autoencoder models identify anomalies based on
reconstruction errors that surpass a threshold sigma. To capture the nuance and
unique characteristics of each RSO an individual model was trained for each
observed space object. The research made an effort to prioritize explainability
and interpretability of the model results thus each observation was assessed
for anomalous behavior of the individual six orbital elements versus analyzing
the input data as a single monolithic observation. The results demonstrate not
only statistically significant anomalies of Russian RSO activity but also
details anomalous findings to the individual orbital element.

### [394] [From Data to Decision: A Multi-Stage Framework for Class Imbalance Mitigation in Optical Network Failure Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00057)
*Yousuf Moiz Ali,Jaroslaw E. Prilepsky,Nicola Sambo,Joao Pedro,Mohammad M. Hosseini,Antonio Napoli,Sergei K. Turitsyn,Pedro Freire*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Direct cross-stage comparison of pre-, in-, and post-processing for class-imbalance in ML-based optical-network failure management. Post-processing (notably Threshold Adjustment) yields the largest F1 gains for failure detection, while under-sampling offers fastest inference. For failure identification, Generative AI (GenAI) methods provide the biggest performance gains; post-processing is less impactful in multiclass settings. When class overlap exists and latency matters, oversampling (SMOTE) is most effective; without latency constraints, Meta-Learning performs best. In low-overlap scenarios, Generative AI achieves high performance with minimal inference time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses a persistent challenge in ML-based optical-network failure management: severe class imbalance. While pre- and in-processing techniques are well-studied, post-processing methods remain under-explored. The study aims to directly compare pre-, in-, and post-processing approaches on an experimental dataset to guide practical imbalance mitigation.

Method: Experimental dataset with failure detection (binary) and failure identification (multiclass). Systematically compares pre-, in-, and post-processing approaches for imbalance mitigation. Evaluates performance under various conditions: class overlap and latency constraints. Reported metrics include F1 score improvements and inference time (latency). Methods mentioned include Random Under-Sampling, SMOTE (oversampling), Threshold Adjustment (post-processing), GenAI approaches, Meta-Learning, etc.

Result: For failure detection: post-processing approaches—especially Threshold Adjustment—achieve the highest F1-score improvement (up to 15.3%), while Random Under-Sampling offers fastest inference. For failure identification: GenAI methods yield the largest gains (up to 24.2%), with post-processing showing limited impact in multiclass settings. When class overlap exists and latency is critical, SMOTE (oversampling) is most effective; without latency constraints, Meta-Learning performs best. In low-overlap scenarios, Generative AI approaches provide the highest performance with minimal inference time.

Conclusion: The study provides a direct, task- and constraint-aware comparison across preprocessing stages for imbalance mitigation. Practical guidance depends on the task (detection vs. identification), latency tolerance, and class-overlap level. Post-processing is valuable for detection; GenAI and generative methods dominate identification under various conditions; oversampling is preferred for latency-sensitive scenarios; meta-learning is advantageous when latency is not a constraint, and low-overlap scenarios favor Generative AI for faster inference.

Abstract: Machine learning-based failure management in optical networks has gained
significant attention in recent years. However, severe class imbalance, where
normal instances vastly outnumber failure cases, remains a considerable
challenge. While pre- and in-processing techniques have been widely studied,
post-processing methods are largely unexplored. In this work, we present a
direct comparison of pre-, in-, and post-processing approaches for class
imbalance mitigation in failure detection and identification using an
experimental dataset. For failure detection, post-processing
methods-particularly Threshold Adjustment-achieve the highest F1 score
improvement (up to 15.3%), while Random Under-Sampling provides the fastest
inference. In failure identification, GenAI methods deliver the most
substantial performance gains (up to 24.2%), whereas post-processing shows
limited impact in multi-class settings. When class overlap is present and
latency is critical, over-sampling methods such as the SMOTE are most
effective; without latency constraints, Meta-Learning yields the best results.
In low-overlap scenarios, Generative AI approaches provide the highest
performance with minimal inference time.

### [395] [T-MLP: Tailed Multi-Layer Perceptron for Level-of-Detail Signal Representation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00066)
*Chuanxiang Yang,Yuanfeng Zhou,Guangshun Wei,Siyu Ren,Yuan Liu,Junhui Hou,Wenping Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A new T-MLP architecture attaches tails to hidden layers to enable level-of-detail (LoD) representation, achieving better results than neural LoD baselines across several signal tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LoD representations enable efficient modeling and transmission of signals (images, 3D shapes). Classical MLPs operate at a single scale and lack native LoD support, creating a need for architectures that support multi-scale representations.

Method: Modify the standard MLP by attaching multiple output branches (tails) to hidden layers. Use a loss formulation and training strategy that supervises each hidden layer to learn a target signal at a specific LoD, enabling multi-scale modeling within a single network.

Result: Extensive experiments show that the T-MLP outperforms other neural LoD baselines across various signal representation tasks.

Conclusion: T-MLP provides native LoD support and multi-scale modeling within a single architecture, offering improved performance and broad applicability for efficient signal representation.

Abstract: Level-of-detail (LoD) representation is critical for efficiently modeling and
transmitting various types of signals, such as images and 3D shapes. In this
work, we present a novel neural architecture that supports LoD signal
representation. Our architecture is based on an elaborate modification of the
widely used Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), which inherently operates at a single
scale and therefore lacks native support for LoD. Specifically, we introduce
the Tailed Multi-Layer Perceptron (T-MLP) that extends the MLP by attaching
multiple output branches, also called tails, to its hidden layers, enabling
direct supervision at multiple depths. Our loss formulation and training
strategy allow each hidden layer to effectively learn a target signal at a
specific LoD, thus enabling multi-scale modeling. Extensive experimental
results show that our T-MLP outperforms other neural LoD baselines across a
variety of signal representation tasks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A framework combines anomaly detection with explainable AI visuals (BERTViz, Captum) and attention-based NLP reports to streamline cybersecurity workflows; RoBERTa achieves 99.6% accuracy on HDFS data, outperforming Falcon-7B and DeBERTa and showing greater flexibility than Mistral-7B; user feedback indicates ease of use and better anomaly understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address false positives and trust issues in AI for cybersecurity, and to reduce manual remediation by providing high-quality explanations and actionable insights.

Method: Developed a framework that detects anomalies and generates explanations using visual tools BERTViz and Captum, plus natural language reports derived from attention outputs; evaluated on the HDFS dataset from LogHub; compared RoBERTa, Falcon-7B, DeBERTa, and Mistral-7B.

Result: RoBERTa achieved high accuracy (99.6%) and strong anomaly detection; outperformed Falcon-7B and DeBERTa; more flexible than Mistral-7B on HDFS; user feedback indicates ease of use and improved understanding of anomalies.

Conclusion: The framework strengthens cybersecurity workflows by combining anomaly detection with interpretable explanations, speeding remediation and illustrating the value of XAI for security analysts.

Abstract: Conversational AI and Large Language Models (LLMs) have become powerful tools
across domains, including cybersecurity, where they help detect threats early
and improve response times. However, challenges such as false positives and
complex model management still limit trust. Although Explainable AI (XAI) aims
to make AI decisions more transparent, many security analysts remain uncertain
about its usefulness. This study presents a framework that detects anomalies
and provides high-quality explanations through visual tools BERTViz and Captum,
combined with natural language reports based on attention outputs. This reduces
manual effort and speeds up remediation. Our comparative analysis showed that
RoBERTa offers high accuracy (99.6 %) and strong anomaly detection,
outperforming Falcon-7B and DeBERTa, as well as exhibiting better flexibility
than large-scale Mistral-7B on the HDFS dataset from LogHub. User feedback
confirms the chatbot's ease of use and improved understanding of anomalies,
demonstrating the ability of the developed framework to strengthen
cybersecurity workflows.

*Shang Liu,Jing Wang,Wenji Fang,Zhiyao Xie*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SynCircuit uses a diffusion-based generator for directed cyclic graphs to synthesize valid HDL circuits, refines outputs to enforce circuit constraints, and applies Monte Carlo tree search to reduce logic redundancy, producing more realistic synthetic circuits that improve downstream ML tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Publicly available circuit data for AI-assisted IC design is severely limited, hindering progress. Generating valid, realistic synthetic HDL data can enable training and evaluation of ML models in IC design.

Method: 1) Develop a customized diffusion-based generative model tailored to directed cyclic graphs (DCGs) representing circuits. 2) Refine initial graph outputs to enforce essential circuit constraints and ensure validity. 3) Use Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) to optimize and reduce logic redundancy in the generated graphs.

Result: Experiments show SynCircuit can generate more realistic synthetic circuits and improve ML model performance on downstream circuit design tasks.

Conclusion: SynCircuit represents a first attempt at generating valid HDL circuits via synthetic data, addressing data scarcity and providing a pipeline that yields realistic circuits and better downstream performance.

Abstract: In recent years, AI-assisted IC design methods have demonstrated great
potential, but the availability of circuit design data is extremely limited,
especially in the public domain. The lack of circuit data has become the
primary bottleneck in developing AI-assisted IC design methods. In this work,
we make the first attempt, SynCircuit, to generate new synthetic circuits with
valid functionalities in the HDL format. SynCircuit automatically generates
synthetic data using a framework with three innovative steps: 1) We propose a
customized diffusion-based generative model to resolve the Directed Cyclic
Graph (DCG) generation task, which has not been well explored in the AI
community. 2) To ensure our circuit is valid, we enforce the circuit
constraints by refining the initial graph generation outputs. 3) The Monte
Carlo tree search (MCTS) method further optimizes the logic redundancy in the
generated graph. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed SynCircuit
can generate more realistic synthetic circuits and enhance ML model performance
in downstream circuit design tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address information overload, improve clinical efficiency, and extract valuable insights from heterogeneous, high-volume RPM and EHR data while preserving privacy and safety.

Method: Literature-driven overview (conceptual synthesis) of GenAI capabilities, data sources, integration challenges, and potential applications; discussion of workflow implications and requirements; identification of risks and acceptance factors.

Result: A structured synthesis detailing the capabilities of GenAI to navigate longitudinal patient data, provide decision-support, and streamline clinician workflows; a map of opportunities, requirements, and challenges for implementing GenAI in RPM/EHR contexts.

Conclusion: This work is the first summarization of GenAI techniques for managing clinician data overload from combined RPM and EHR data complexities, highlighting both high potential and critical considerations for adoption.

Abstract: Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI), particularly Large Language
Models (LLMs), offer powerful capabilities for interpreting the complex data
landscape in healthcare. In this paper, we present a comprehensive overview of
the capabilities, requirements and applications of GenAI for deriving clinical
insights and improving clinical efficiency. We first provide some background on
the forms and sources of patient data, namely real-time Remote Patient
Monitoring (RPM) streams and traditional Electronic Health Records (EHRs). The
sheer volume and heterogeneity of this combined data present significant
challenges to clinicians and contribute to information overload. In addition,
we explore the potential of LLM-powered applications for improving clinical
efficiency. These applications can enhance navigation of longitudinal patient
data and provide actionable clinical decision support through natural language
dialogue. We discuss the opportunities this presents for streamlining clinician
workflows and personalizing care, alongside critical challenges such as data
integration complexity, ensuring data quality and RPM data reliability,
maintaining patient privacy, validating AI outputs for clinical safety,
mitigating bias, and ensuring clinical acceptance. We believe this work
represents the first summarization of GenAI techniques for managing clinician
data overload due to combined RPM / EHR data complexities.

*Zachery Dahm,Konstantinos Vasili,Vasileios Theos,Konstantinos Gkouliaras,William Richards,True Miller,Brian Jowers,Stylianos Chatzidakis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A multi-layered AI/ML framework integrating IT and OT data can distinguish cyber-related events from normal/abnormal operations in a nuclear reactor use case, showing promise but needing refinement in synchronization and multi-class differentiation; demonstrated on PUR-1 with 13 abnormal states and 13.8M data points.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Growing interest in applying AI/ML to nuclear safety and cybersecurity; limited live reactor studies exist, necessitating evaluation of feasibility and data-fusion architectures that can detect anomalies and cyber events.

Method: Propose a multi-layered AI/ML architecture that fuses information technology and operational technology data streams; apply it to Purdue PUR-1 reactor using a representative use case with multiple concurrent false data injections and DoS attacks; include 14 system states (1 normal, 13 abnormal) and over 13.8 million multivariate data points; assess the model's ability to classify normal, abnormal, and cybersecurity-related events and the impact of IT+OT data fusion.

Result: The study demonstrates that AI/ML can differentiate normal, abnormal, and cybersecurity-related events, even under DoS conditions; combining IT and OT data improves classification accuracy, but raises synchronization and data-collection challenges during certain cyber events.

Conclusion: AI/ML show significant promise for nuclear cybersecurity; however, refinement is needed for handling complex, multi-class event differentiation and robust data synchronization/collection to support real-time monitoring in reactor environments.

Abstract: There is increased interest in applying Artificial Intelligence and Machine
Learning (AI/ML) within the nuclear industry and nuclear engineering community.
Effective implementation of AI/ML could offer benefits to the nuclear domain,
including enhanced identification of anomalies, anticipation of system
failures, and operational schedule optimization. However, limited work has been
done to investigate the feasibility and applicability of AI/ML tools in a
functioning nuclear reactor. Here, we go beyond the development of a single
model and introduce a multi-layered AI/ML architecture that integrates both
information technology and operational technology data streams to identify,
characterize, and differentiate (i) among diverse cybersecurity events and (ii)
between cyber events and other operational anomalies. Leveraging Purdue
Universitys research reactor, PUR-1, we demonstrate this architecture through a
representative use case that includes multiple concurrent false data injections
and denial-of-service attacks of increasing complexity under realistic reactor
conditions. The use case includes 14 system states (1 normal, 13 abnormal) and
over 13.8 million multi-variate operational and information technology data
points. The study demonstrated the capability of AI/ML to distinguish between
normal, abnormal, and cybersecurity-related events, even under challenging
conditions such as denial-of-service attacks. Combining operational and
information technology data improved classification accuracy but posed
challenges related to synchronization and collection during certain cyber
events. While results indicate significant promise for AI/ML in nuclear
cybersecurity, the findings also highlight the need for further refinement in
handling complex event differentiation and multi-class architectures.

### [400] [Data Cartography for Detecting Memorization Hotspots and Guiding Data Interventions in Generative Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00083)
*Laksh Patel,Neel Shanbhag*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GenDataCarto introduces a data-centric framework that scores training samples by difficulty (early loss) and memorization (forget events), partitions into four quadrants, and uses pruning and weighting to reduce leakage (canaries) with minimal impact on generative performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generative models are prone to overfitting and memorizing rare training examples, which can leak via adversaries or inflate benchmark results. A data-centric approach, rather than purely model-centric defenses, can mitigate memorization while preserving usefulness.

Method: For each pretraining sample, compute a difficulty score from early-epoch loss and a memorization score from the frequency of forget events. Partition samples into four quadrants and apply targeted pruning and up-/down-weighting accordingly. The paper proves that memorization score lower-bounds classical influence under smoothness assumptions and that down-weighting high-memorization hotspots decreases the generalization gap via uniform stability bounds.

Result: Empirically, GenDataCarto reduces synthetic canary extraction success by over 40% at just 10% data pruning, while increasing validation perplexity by less than 0.5%. The approach yields leakage reduction with minimal degradation of generative performance.

Conclusion: Principled data interventions like GenDataCarto can dramatically mitigate leakage in generative models with modest costs to performance, highlighting the value of data-centric pruning and weighting strategies to improve privacy and generalization.

Abstract: Modern generative models risk overfitting and unintentionally memorizing rare
training examples, which can be extracted by adversaries or inflate benchmark
performance. We propose Generative Data Cartography (GenDataCarto), a
data-centric framework that assigns each pretraining sample a difficulty score
(early-epoch loss) and a memorization score (frequency of ``forget events''),
then partitions examples into four quadrants to guide targeted pruning and
up-/down-weighting. We prove that our memorization score lower-bounds classical
influence under smoothness assumptions and that down-weighting
high-memorization hotspots provably decreases the generalization gap via
uniform stability bounds. Empirically, GenDataCarto reduces synthetic canary
extraction success by over 40\% at just 10\% data pruning, while increasing
validation perplexity by less than 0.5\%. These results demonstrate that
principled data interventions can dramatically mitigate leakage with minimal
cost to generative performance.

*Qibin Wang,Pu Zhao,Shaohan Huang,Fangkai Yang,Lu Wang,Furu Wei,Qingwei Lin,Saravan Rajmohan,Dongmei Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GSR is a parallel test-time scaling framework that generates candidate solutions with a unified model, then self-refines to produce a superior answer, addressing Best-of-N limitations and avoiding extra deployment costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with multi-step reasoning and decision quality depends on candidate responses. Traditional test-time strategies like Best-of-N and majority voting fail when all candidates are incorrect, and adding a separate selector model increases deployment costs.

Method: GSR first generates multiple candidate responses in parallel and then uses self-refinement to synthesize a superior solution from a prompt that includes the problem and the candidates. The model is trained with a hybrid objective that jointly optimizes direct problem solving and refinement capabilities.

Result: The approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on five mathematical benchmarks and the learned self-refinement skill is model-agnostic, robust across model scales, and generalizes to out-of-distribution reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: GSR provides a cost-efficient, scalable enhancement for LLM reasoning by enabling effective self-refinement, reducing reliance on candidate quality and limiting deployment costs.

Abstract: To further enhance the ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to solve
complex, multi-step reasoning problems, test-time scaling (TTS) methods have
gained widespread attention. Existing approaches such as Best-of-N and majority
voting are limited as their performance depends on the quality of candidate
responses, making them unable to produce a correct solution when all candidates
are incorrect. Introducing an additional model to select the best response also
incurs significant deployment costs. To this end, we introduce Generative
Self-Refinement (GSR), a novel parallel test-time scaling framework where a
unified model first generates a set of candidate responses in parallel and then
performs self-refinement to synthesize a new superior solution based on a
prompt consisting of the problem and these candidates. However, LLMs struggle
to perform refinement effectively when prompted directly. Therefore, we design
a hybrid training pipeline by jointly optimizing for two complementary
objectives, solving problems directly and refining candidate responses.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance across five mathematical benchmarks. We further show that this
learned self-refinement skill is a model-agnostic enhancement, robust across
different model scales and generalizing to out-of-distribution reasoning tasks.

*Rodrigo Tertulino*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Federated Learning with FedProx applied to SAEB data across 50 Brazilian schools yields performance close to a centralized model while preserving privacy per LGPD (61.23% vs 63.96% accuracy; 2.73-point drop; dataset >2M records).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Privacy legislation (LGPD) restricts centralizing sensitive student data; need privacy-preserving ML to personalize learning and identify at-risk students.

Method: Federated learning using FedProx with a Deep Neural Network trained across 50 simulated schools; compared against a centralized XGBoost model; evaluation on SAEB microdata >2M records.

Result: Centralized model accuracy 63.96%; federated model accuracy 61.23%; performance loss is modest, indicating federated learning is viable for this context.

Conclusion: Federated Learning is a viable and effective approach for collaborative predictive modeling in Brazilian education under LGPD, enabling privacy-preserving data utilization without substantial loss in predictive performance.

Abstract: The application of data mining and artificial intelligence in education
offers unprecedented potential for personalizing learning and early
identification of at-risk students. However, the practical use of these
techniques faces a significant barrier in privacy legislation, such as Brazil's
General Data Protection Law (LGPD), which restricts the centralization of
sensitive student data. To resolve this challenge, privacy-preserving
computational approaches are required. The present study evaluates the
feasibility and effectiveness of Federated Learning, specifically the FedProx
algorithm, to predict student performance using microdata from the Brazilian
Basic Education Assessment System (SAEB). A Deep Neural Network (DNN) model was
trained in a federated manner, simulating a scenario with 50 schools, and its
performance was rigorously benchmarked against a centralized eXtreme Gradient
Boosting (XGBoost) model. The analysis, conducted on a universe of over two
million student records, revealed that the centralized model achieved an
accuracy of 63.96%. Remarkably, the federated model reached a peak accuracy of
61.23%, demonstrating a marginal performance loss in exchange for a robust
privacy guarantee. The results indicate that Federated Learning is a viable and
effective solution for building collaborative predictive models in the
Brazilian educational context, in alignment with the requirements of the LGPD.

*Mojtaba Moattari*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Nonlinearized gating, input reordering, and weight-norm optimization to enhance LSTM for text classification, showing improved accuracy over standard LSTM.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LSTMs' gates and weight norms don't optimally emphasize long-term or specific past inputs; exploring input ordering, Lp-norm weight selection, and nonlinear gate modeling could capture richer temporal dependencies and attention-like effects.

Method: 1) Propose input reordering to prioritize certain input indices; 2) study weight normalization by selecting appropriate Lp norm and exponent via main supervised loss; 3) replace/augment gates with a small feedforward network to introduce nonlinearity; 4) implement variants and compare to baseline LSTM on text classification tasks.

Result: Empirical results indicate improved accuracy of LSTM-based models over the simple baseline in text classification tasks; proposed methods yield gains.

Conclusion: Nonlinearizing gates and reordering inputs, along with norm-aware weight selection, can enhance LSTM performance for text classification, offering an attention-like mechanism and richer nonlinear modeling.

Abstract: LSTM models used in current Machine Learning literature and applications, has
a promising solution for permitting long term information using gating
mechanisms that forget and reduce effect of current input information. However,
even with this pipeline, they do not optimally focus on specific old index or
long-term information. This paper elaborates upon input reordering approaches
to prioritize certain input indices. Moreover, no LSTM based approach is found
in the literature that examines weight normalization while choosing the right
weight and exponent of Lp norms through main supervised loss function. In this
paper, we find out which norm best finds relationship between weights to either
smooth or sparsify them. Lastly, gates, as weighted representations of inputs
and states, which control reduction-extent of current input versus previous
inputs (~ state), are not nonlinearized enough (through a small FFNN). As
analogous to attention mechanisms, gates easily filter current information to
bold (emphasize on) past inputs. Nonlinearized gates can more easily tune up to
peculiar nonlinearities of specific input in the past. This type of
nonlinearization is not proposed in the literature, to the best of author's
knowledge. The proposed approaches are implemented and compared with a simple
LSTM to understand their performance in text classification tasks. The results
show they improve accuracy of LSTM.

*Li Dengjin,Guo Yanming,Xie Yuxiang,Li Zheng,Chen Jiangming,Li Xiaolong,Lao Mingrui*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CEAT introduces cooperative ensemble adversarial training that weights samples by sub-model prediction disparities and uses a calibrating distance regularization to boost ensemble robustness, achieving state-of-the-art results and being model-agnostic.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current ensemble adversarial training (EAT) trains sub-models independently, missing cooperative benefits. Samples where sub-models disagree lie near the ensemble decision boundary and disproportionately affect robustness; exploiting inter-model cooperation can enhance defense.

Method: CEAT adaptively assigns sample weights based on predictive disparities between sub-models during adversarial training of each sub-model, guided by calibrating distance regularization to stabilize and promote collaboration across the ensemble.

Result: Extensive experiments on standard datasets show CEAT achieving state-of-the-art robustness compared with competitive EAT methods, and its model-agnostic nature allows easy integration into various ensemble schemes.

Conclusion: CEAT demonstrates that fostering cooperative learning among sub-models yields improvements in ensemble robustness; it is efficient, adaptable, and readily incorporable into diverse ensemble architectures.

Abstract: Ensemble Adversarial Training (EAT) attempts to enhance the robustness of
models against adversarial attacks by leveraging multiple models. However,
current EAT strategies tend to train the sub-models independently, ignoring the
cooperative benefits between sub-models. Through detailed inspections of the
process of EAT, we find that that samples with classification disparities
between sub-models are close to the decision boundary of ensemble, exerting
greater influence on the robustness of ensemble. To this end, we propose a
novel yet efficient Collaborative Ensemble Adversarial Training (CEAT), to
highlight the cooperative learning among sub-models in the ensemble. To be
specific, samples with larger predictive disparities between the sub-models
will receive greater attention during the adversarial training of the other
sub-models. CEAT leverages the probability disparities to adaptively assign
weights to different samples, by incorporating a calibrating distance
regularization. Extensive experiments on widely-adopted datasets show that our
proposed method achieves the state-of-the-art performance over competitive EAT
methods. It is noteworthy that CEAT is model-agnostic, which can be seamlessly
adapted into various ensemble methods with flexible applicability.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A datum-wise transformer detects synthetic tabular data in the wild, outperforming prior baselines and gaining robustness with table adaptation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Detecting synthetic tabular data is critical for data integrity but understudied due to tabular heterogeneity and unseen schemas at test time; existing methods underperform in real-world, variable-schema settings.

Method: Introduce a datum-wise transformer architecture that operates on tabular data with variable schemas; includes a table-adaptation component to improve robustness to unseen formats.

Result: Outperforms the only published baseline by ~7 points in both AUC and accuracy; table adaptation adds ~7 additional accuracy points, demonstrating strong performance and robustness in real-world conditions.

Conclusion: Synthetic tabular data can be detected reliably in real-world scenarios with high reliability using the proposed datum-wise transformer and table adaptation.

Abstract: The rise of powerful generative models has sparked concerns over data
authenticity. While detection methods have been extensively developed for
images and text, the case of tabular data, despite its ubiquity, has been
largely overlooked. Yet, detecting synthetic tabular data is especially
challenging due to its heterogeneous structure and unseen formats at test time.
We address the underexplored task of detecting synthetic tabular data in the
wild, where tables have variable and previously unseen schemas. We introduce a
novel datum-wise transformer architecture that significantly outperforms the
only previously published baseline, improving both AUC and accuracy by 7
points. By incorporating a table-adaptation component, our model gains an
additional 7 accuracy points, demonstrating enhanced robustness. This work
provides the first strong evidence that detecting synthetic tabular data in
real-world conditions is not only feasible, but can be done with high
reliability.

TL;DR: A hybrid deep RL framework for dynamic budget allocation using Dirichlet-inspired stochasticity and quantum mutation-based genetic optimization, achieving near-perfect alignment with actual allocations on unseen Apple financial data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the stochastic, nonlinear nature of real-world budgeting data and improve adaptability of budget allocation across R&D and SG&A by integrating stochastic state evolution and quantum-inspired heuristics.

Method: Develop a hybrid reinforcement learning (RL) framework that allocates budgets between R&D and SG&A. The state evolves under a Dirichlet-inspired stochastic process; the objective includes L2 penalties to discourage unrealistic deviations. After initial RL training, a genetic algorithm with quantum mutation (parameterized qubit rotation circuits) refines the policy to escape local minima and improve generalization. Training logs include generation-wise rewards and penalties to monitor convergence.

Result: On unseen fiscal data, the model achieves high alignment with actual allocations (cosine similarity 0.9990; KL divergence 0.0023), indicating strong generalization and the potential of combining deep RL, stochastic modeling, and quantum-inspired heuristics for adaptive budgeting.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the feasibility and promise of integrating deep RL with stochastic Dirichlet dynamics and quantum-inspired GA refinements for enterprise budgeting, offering a pathway to adaptive and data-driven budget allocation.

Abstract: Traditional budget allocation models struggle with the stochastic and
nonlinear nature of real-world financial data. This study proposes a hybrid
reinforcement learning (RL) framework for dynamic budget allocation, enhanced
with Dirichlet-inspired stochasticity and quantum mutation-based genetic
optimization. Using Apple Inc. quarterly financial data (2009 to 2025), the RL
agent learns to allocate budgets between Research and Development and Selling,
General and Administrative to maximize profitability while adhering to
historical spending patterns, with L2 penalties discouraging unrealistic

### [407] [Pruning Weights but Not Truth: Safeguarding Truthfulness While Pruning LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00096)
*Yao Fu,Runchao Li,Xianxuan Long,Haotian Yu,Xiaotian Han,Yu Yin,Pan Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces Truthful Pruning aligned by Layer-wise Outliers (TPLO) to prune LLMs while preserving lie-detection activation features; naive sparsity pruning can destroy discriminative inner-state features; TPLO prioritizes layers with activation outliers and strong discriminative power and includes a prompting rule to improve TruthfulQA benchmarking, yielding 88% lie-detection accuracy at 50% sparsity and better TruthfulQA performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pruning LLMs can disrupt internal activation features used by lie-detection probes; standard layer-wise pruning based on general importance may remove crucial weights that preserve these discriminative signals.

Method: Propose TPLO — a pruning framework that biases sparsity toward layers with more activation outliers and stronger discriminative features, balancing preservation of original performance with retention of lie-detection-relevant inner-state signals; accompany pruning with a prompting rule to enrich TruthfulQA benchmark.

Result: Empirically, TPLO improves lie-detection accuracy for pruned LLMs (e.g., 88% at 50% sparsity) and enhances TruthfulQA performance, while maintaining overall capability on non-pruned tasks.

Conclusion: TPLO provides an effective strategy to prune LLMs without sacrificing key lie-detection features, by focusing on layer-wise activation outliers and discriminative cues; the prompting rule further helps calibrate benchmarking on TruthfulQA.

Abstract: Neural network pruning has emerged as a promising approach for deploying LLMs
in low-resource scenarios while preserving downstream task performance.
However, for the first time, we reveal that such pruning disrupts LLMs'
internal activation features crucial for lie detection, where probing
classifiers (typically small logistic regression models) trained on these
features assess the truthfulness of LLM-generated statements. This discovery
raises a crucial open question: how can we prune LLMs without sacrificing these
critical lie detection capabilities? Our investigation further reveals that
naively adjusting layer-wise pruning sparsity based on importance inadvertently
removes crucial weights, failing to improve lie detection performance despite
its reliance on the most crucial LLM layer. To address this issue, we propose
Truthful Pruning aligned by Layer-wise Outliers (TPLO), which places greater
emphasis on layers with more activation outliers and stronger discriminative
features simultaneously. This preserves LLMs' original performance while
retaining critical features of inner states needed for robust lie detection.
Moreover, we introduce a prompting rule to enrich the TruthfulQA benchmark for
better calibrating LLM pruning. Empirical results show that our approach
improves the hallucination detection for pruned LLMs (achieving 88% accuracy at
50% sparsity) and enhances their performance on TruthfulQA.

### [408] [Progressive Element-wise Gradient Estimation for Neural Network Quantization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00097)
*Kaiqi Zhao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes PEGE, a gradient-estimation-based alternative to STE for QAT that progressively replaces full-precision weights/activations with quantized values using a logarithmic curriculum and a co-optimization of task loss and discretization error, achieving improved accuracy and matching or surpassing full-precision models on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet across common architectures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: STE-based QAT ignores discretization errors between continuous and quantized representations, causing accuracy degradation at very low bit-widths. A gradient estimator that accounts for quantization errors and a principled training objective could yield better performance and robustness in low-precision networks.

Method: Introduce Progressive Element-wise Gradient Estimation (PEGE) with a logarithmic curriculum-driven mixed-precision replacement that progressively swaps in quantized weights/activations. Formulate QAT as a joint optimization of task loss and discretization error, making the framework both simple and generalizable across forward-propagation methods.

Result: Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet across architectures (ResNet, VGG) show PEGE consistently outperforms existing backpropagation methods and enables low-precision models to match or exceed full-precision accuracy.

Conclusion: PEGE is a simple yet effective alternative to STE that integrates with forward propagation, offering a unified framework to reduce discretization error during quantization and achieve high accuracy in low-precision networks.

Abstract: Neural network quantization aims to reduce the bit-widths of weights and
activations, making it a critical technique for deploying deep neural networks
on resource-constrained hardware. Most Quantization-Aware Training (QAT)
methods rely on the Straight-Through Estimator (STE) to address the
non-differentiability of discretization functions by replacing their
derivatives with that of the identity function. While effective, STE overlooks
discretization errors between continuous and quantized values, which can lead
to accuracy degradation -- especially at extremely low bit-widths. In this
paper, we propose Progressive Element-wise Gradient Estimation (PEGE), a simple
yet effective alternative to STE, which can be seamlessly integrated with any
forward propagation methods and improves the quantized model accuracy. PEGE
progressively replaces full-precision weights and activations with their
quantized counterparts via a novel logarithmic curriculum-driven
mixed-precision replacement strategy. Then it formulates QAT as a
co-optimization problem that simultaneously minimizes the task loss for
prediction and the discretization error for quantization, providing a unified
and generalizable framework. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet
across various architectures (e.g., ResNet, VGG) demonstrate that PEGE
consistently outperforms existing backpropagation methods and enables
low-precision models to match or even outperform the accuracy of their
full-precision counterparts.

*Huixiang Zhang,Mahzabeen Emu,Salimur Choudhury*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: An end-to-end framework, LLM-QUBO, automates translating natural-language problems into QUBO and solves via a hybrid quantum-classical Benders' decomposition to cope with hardware limits, validated on classical solvers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantum annealing faces two main hurdles: manual, error-prone translation to QUBO and limited hardware scalability. An automated, scalable pipeline could unlock real-world optimization on quantum devices.

Method: Leverage an LLM to convert natural-language descriptions into a structured mathematical representation; apply a hybrid Benders' decomposition that splits the problem into a compact QUBO master and linearly-structured subproblems solved classically; validate by solving with classical solvers to assess correctness and scalability; position framework as a bridge between classical AI and quantum computing.

Result: QUBO generation correctness is demonstrated; hybrid method scales on classical solvers; framework shows readiness for quantum hardware; establishes baseline performance and substantial barrier reduction to using quantum accelerators for large-scale optimization.

Conclusion: LLM-QUBO provides an automated, end-to-end workflow from problem formulation to solution, enabling quantum devices to serve as scalable accelerators for real-world optimization by integrating AI and quantum techniques.

Abstract: Quantum annealing offers a promising paradigm for solving NP-hard
combinatorial optimization problems, but its practical application is severely
hindered by two challenges: the complex, manual process of translating problem
descriptions into the requisite Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization
(QUBO) format and the scalability limitations of current quantum hardware. To
address these obstacles, we propose a novel end-to-end framework, LLM-QUBO,
that automates this entire formulation-to-solution pipeline. Our system
leverages a Large Language Model (LLM) to parse natural language, automatically
generating a structured mathematical representation. To overcome hardware
limitations, we integrate a hybrid quantum-classical Benders' decomposition
method. This approach partitions the problem, compiling the combinatorial
complex master problem into a compact QUBO format, while delegating linearly
structured sub-problems to classical solvers. The correctness of the generated
QUBO and the scalability of the hybrid approach are validated using classical
solvers, establishing a robust performance baseline and demonstrating the
framework's readiness for quantum hardware. Our primary contribution is a
synergistic computing paradigm that bridges classical AI and quantum computing,
addressing key challenges in the practical application of optimization problem.
This automated workflow significantly reduces the barrier to entry, providing a
viable pathway to transform quantum devices into accessible accelerators for
large-scale, real-world optimization challenges.

### [410] [Exploiting a Mixture-of-Layers in an Electrocardiography Foundation Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00102)
*Phu X. Nguyen,Huy Phan,Hieu Pham,Christos Chatzichristos,Bert Vandenberk,Maarten De Vos*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes Post-pretraining Mixture-of-layers Aggregation (PMA) to fuse layer-wise representations from a Transformer-based ECG model, showing that the final layer is suboptimal for downstream tasks; includes both a gating-based fusion during downstream use and an extension to pretraining with group-wise averaging.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The last-layer representations of transformer-based ECG models may not be optimal for downstream tasks. Exploit the representation diversity across layers to improve performance.

Method: Pretrain a 1D Vision Transformer (ViT) on ECG signals via masked modeling. Introduce PMA, a gating network that selectively fuses representations from multiple transformer layers for downstream tasks. Extend PMA to pretraining by aggregating all layer representations through group-wise averaging before feeding into the decoder-based Transformer.

Result: Claimed improvement in downstream performance by leveraging layer diversity; empirical and theoretical analyses suggest the last layer is not optimal and PMA enhances representational power.

Conclusion: Relying solely on the final layer is suboptimal for ECG tasks. PMA effectively leverages multi-layer representations, improving downstream performance, and can be extended to pretraining to boost overall representation quality.

Abstract: Transformer-based foundation models for Electrocardiograms (ECGs) have
recently achieved impressive performance in many downstream applications.
However, the internal representations of such models across layers have not
been fully understood and exploited. An important question arises: Does the
final layer of the pre-trained Transformer model, the \emph{de facto}
representational layer, provide optimal performance for downstream tasks?
Although our answer based on empirical and theoretical analyses for this
question is negative, we propose a novel approach to leverage the
representation diversity of the model's layers effectively. Specifically, we
introduce a novel architecture called Post-pretraining Mixture-of-layers
Aggregation (PMA), which enables a flexible combination of the layer-wise
representations from the layer stack of a Transformer-based foundation model.
We first pre-train the model from ECG signals using the 1-dimensional Vision
Transformer (ViT) via masked modeling. In downstream applications, instead of
relying solely on the last layer of the model, we employ a gating network to
selectively fuse the representations from the pretrained model's layers,
thereby enhancing representation power and improving performance of the
downstream applications. In addition, we extend the proposed method to the
pretraining stage by aggregating all representations through group-wise
averaging before feeding them into the decoder-based Transformer.

*Robert MacKnight,Jose Emilio Regio,Jeffrey G. Ethier,Luke A. Baldwin,Gabe Gomes*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LLM-guided optimization (LLM-GO) using pre-trained knowledge can match or exceed Bayesian optimization in complex categorical chemistry spaces, outperforming in sparse regions; a topology-agnostic information-theory framework explains higher exploration entropy; Iron Mind platform enables benchmarking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional optimization in experimental chemistry struggles with high-dimensional, sparse, categorical spaces. Pre-trained LLMs offer domain knowledge that may improve exploration and navigation of chemical parameter space.

Method: Evaluate six fully enumerated categorical reaction datasets (768–5,684 experiments). Benchmark LLM-GO against Bayesian optimization and random sampling across single- and multi-objective tasks. Introduce a topology-agnostic information theory framework to quantify sampling diversity (exploration entropy). Release Iron Mind, a no-code benchmarking platform for side-by-side human/algorithm/LLM optimization with public leaderboards.

Result: Frontier LLMs match or exceed Bayesian optimization performance on five single-objective datasets; advantages grow with parameter complexity and when high-performing regions are scarce (<5% of search space). BO remains superior only for explicit multi-objective trade-offs. LLMs exhibit higher exploration entropy while achieving superior performance across datasets, with the gap most pronounced in sparse, high-quality regions.

Conclusion: LLM-GO excels where traditional optimization struggles: complex, domain-rich categorical spaces. Pre-trained domain knowledge enables more effective navigation of chemical parameter space rather than replacing structured exploration; Iron Mind enables transparent benchmarking and community validation.

Abstract: Modern optimization in experimental chemistry employs algorithmic search
through black-box parameter spaces. Here we demonstrate that pre-trained
knowledge in large language models (LLMs) fundamentally changes this paradigm.
Using six fully enumerated categorical reaction datasets (768 - 5,684
experiments), we benchmark LLM-guided optimization (LLM-GO) against Bayesian
optimization (BO) and random sampling. Frontier LLMs consistently match or
exceed BO performance across five single-objective datasets, with advantages
growing as parameter complexity increases and high-performing conditions become
scarce (<5% of space). BO retains superiority only for explicit multi-objective
trade-offs. To understand these contrasting behaviors, we introduce a
topology-agnostic information theory framework quantifying sampling diversity
throughout optimization campaigns. This analysis reveals that LLMs maintain
systematically higher exploration entropy than BO across all datasets while
achieving superior performance, with advantages most pronounced in
solution-scarce parameter spaces where high-entropy exploration typically fails
- suggesting that pre-trained domain knowledge enables more effective
navigation of chemical parameter space rather than replacing structured
exploration strategies. To enable transparent benchmarking and community
validation, we release Iron Mind (https://gomes.andrew.cmu.edu/iron-mind), a
no-code platform for side-by-side evaluation of human, algorithmic, and LLM
optimization campaigns with public leaderboards and complete trajectories. Our
findings establish that LLM-GO excels precisely where traditional methods
struggle: complex categorical spaces requiring domain understanding rather than
mathematical optimization.

### [412] [Principled Approximation Methods for Efficient and Scalable Deep Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00174)
*Pedro Savarese*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Principled differentiable approximations enable efficient deep learning via (i) fine-grained pruning/quantization, (ii) parameter-sharing NAS for implicitly recurrent architectures, and (iii) an adaptive optimizer; these yield compact, fast models with preserved or improved accuracy across vision, language, and generative tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large deep learning models require substantial compute and energy. Discrete constraints and non-differentiability hinder optimization and deployment, motivating scalable, principled approaches to improve efficiency.

Method: Three-pronged approach: (1) model compression with differentiable relaxations for pruning and quantization; (2) architecture search leveraging parameter sharing across layers to efficiently explore implicitly recurrent architectures; (3) adaptive optimization that revisits theoretical properties of common methods and introduces a tunable adaptive optimizer for quick hyperparameter tuning.

Result: Experiments on image classification, language modeling, and generative modeling show significant improvements in training and inference efficiency while maintaining or improving model performance; the methods enable fine-grained sparsity and precision control without extensive fine-tuning and improve NAS efficiency.

Conclusion: Principled approximations can tackle computationally hard efficiency problems at scale, delivering practical speedups and compact models without sacrificing performance.

Abstract: Recent progress in deep learning has been driven by increasingly larger
models. However, their computational and energy demands have grown
proportionally, creating significant barriers to their deployment and to a
wider adoption of deep learning technologies. This thesis investigates
principled approximation methods for improving the efficiency of deep learning
systems, with a particular focus on settings that involve discrete constraints
and non-differentiability.
  We study three main approaches toward improved efficiency: architecture
design, model compression, and optimization. For model compression, we propose
novel approximations for pruning and quantization that frame the underlying
discrete problem as continuous and differentiable, enabling gradient-based
training of compression schemes alongside the model's parameters. These
approximations allow for fine-grained sparsity and precision configurations,
leading to highly compact models without significant fine-tuning. In the
context of architecture design, we design an algorithm for neural architecture
search that leverages parameter sharing across layers to efficiently explore
implicitly recurrent architectures. Finally, we study adaptive optimization,
revisiting theoretical properties of widely used methods and proposing an
adaptive optimizer that allows for quick hyperparameter tuning.
  Our contributions center on tackling computationally hard problems via
scalable and principled approximations. Experimental results on image
classification, language modeling, and generative modeling tasks show that the
proposed methods provide significant improvements in terms of training and
inference efficiency while maintaining, or even improving, the model's
performance.

*Hongyu Wang,Jingquan Wang,Dan Negrut*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FNODE is a flow-matching neural ODE that learns acceleration fields directly from trajectory data, avoiding backpropagation through ODE solvers by supervising accelerations with FFT+FD-derived targets, and it outperforms MBD-NODE, LSTM, and FCNN on several constrained multibody benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Constrained multibody system modeling suffers from high computational cost and limited long-term prediction accuracy in data-driven approaches, motivating a more efficient and accurate framework.

Method: Introduce Flow-Matching Neural ODE (FNODE) that trains by supervising accelerations rather than integrated states. Acceleration targets are obtained efficiently using a hybrid Fast Fourier Transform and Finite Difference scheme. The approach is validated on single/triple mass-spring-damper, double pendulum, slider-crank, and cart-pole systems, and compared against MBD-NODE, LSTM, and FCNN.

Result: FNODE consistently achieves better accuracy, generalization, and computational efficiency than the baselines across all tested benchmarks.

Conclusion: Flow-matching acceleration supervision effectively enables accurate and efficient learning of constrained multibody dynamics, eliminating the ODE-backprop bottleneck and demonstrating strong performance across diverse mechanical systems.

Abstract: Data-driven modeling of constrained multibody systems faces two persistent
challenges: high computational cost and limited long-term prediction accuracy.
To address these issues, we introduce the Flow-Matching Neural Ordinary
Differential Equation (FNODE), a framework that learns acceleration vector
fields directly from trajectory data. By reformulating the training objective
to supervise accelerations rather than integrated states, FNODE eliminates the
need for backpropagation through an ODE solver, which represents a bottleneck
in traditional Neural ODEs. Acceleration targets are computed efficiently using
numerical differentiation techniques, including a hybrid Fast Fourier Transform
(FFT) and Finite Difference (FD) scheme. We evaluate FNODE on a diverse set of
benchmarks, including the single and triple mass-spring-damper systems, double
pendulum, slider-crank, and cart-pole. Across all cases, FNODE consistently
outperforms existing approaches such as Multi-Body Dynamic Neural ODE
(MBD-NODE), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, and Fully Connected Neural
Networks (FCNN), demonstrating good accuracy, generalization, and computational
efficiency.

*Hao Mark Chen,Zhiwen Mo,Guanxi Lu,Shuang Liang,Lingxiao Ma,Wayne Luk,Hongxiang Fan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FlashTTS enables memory-constrained edge LLMs to perform test-time scaling with three optimizations, achieving cloud-like accuracy and latency on a 24GB GPU, with 2.2x goodput gain and 38-68% latency reduction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Edge devices require privacy and low latency; memory limits prevent deploying large LLMs with strong reasoning. Test-Time Scaling (TTS) can help but often incurs high overhead on edge hardware, limiting practicality.

Method: Introduce three synergistic optimizations integrated as a plug-and-play library for vLLM: (i) Speculative Beam Extension to reduce stragglers from irregular reasoning paths, (ii) Asymmetric Multi-Model Memory Allocation to balance memory between generation and verification, and (iii) Dynamic Prefix-Aware Scheduling to maximize KV-cache reuse.

Result: With these optimizations, FlashTTS enables edge LLMs on a single 24 GB GPU to match the accuracy and latency of large cloud models, achieving ~2.2x higher goodput and 38–68% latency reduction versus a vLLM baseline.

Conclusion: FlashTTS demonstrates that practical, high-performance agentic AI at the edge is feasible by making test-time scaling memory-efficient; this democratizes access to capable on-device reasoning.

Abstract: Deploying agentic AI on edge devices is crucial for privacy and
responsiveness, but memory constraints typically relegate these systems to
smaller Large Language Models (LLMs) with inferior reasoning capabilities.
Test-Time Scaling (TTS) can bridge this reasoning gap by dedicating more
compute during inference, but existing methods incur prohibitive overhead on
edge hardware. To overcome this, we introduce FlashTTS, a serving system that
makes TTS practical for memory-constrained LLM reasoning. FlashTTS introduces
three synergistic optimizations: (i) Speculative Beam Extension to mitigate
system stragglers from irregular reasoning paths; (ii) Asymmetric Multi-Model
Memory Allocation to dynamically balance memory between generation and
verification; and (iii) Dynamic Prefix-Aware Scheduling to maximize KV-cache
reuse. Built as a plug-and-play library for vLLM, FlashTTS enables edge LLMs on
a single consumer GPU (24 GB) to match the accuracy and latency of large cloud
models. Our evaluation demonstrates that FlashTTS achieves an average 2.2x
higher goodput and reduces latency by 38%-68% compared to a vLLM baseline,
paving the way for democratized, high-performance agentic AI on edge devices.

*Zhongpan Tang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A Transformer variant named TConstFormer achieves a truly constant-size KV cache and amortized O(1) inference per step for long-sequence processing, outperforming baselines in speed and memory.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome Transformer autoregressive bottlenecks—growing KV cache and quadratic attention—that hinder long-sequence and streaming LLMs.

Method: Introduces periodic state update mechanism in TConstFormer (built on TLinFormer) enabling constant-size KV cache with amortized constant-time updates: k-1 steps cost O(1) and a single linear-time synchronization on every k-th step.

Result: Theoretical analysis and experiments show significant speedup and memory efficiency gains with robust long-text inference performance.

Conclusion: Offers a scalable solution for streaming language models, enabling efficient long-sequence processing and robust performance.

Abstract: Although the Transformer has become the cornerstone of modern AI, its
autoregressive inference suffers from a linearly growing KV Cache and a
computational complexity of O(N^2 d), severely hindering its ability to process
ultra-long sequences. To overcome this limitation, this paper introduces the
TConstFormer architecture, building upon our previous work, TLinFormer.
TConstFormer employs an innovative periodic state update mechanism to achieve a
truly constant-size O(1) KV Cache. The computational complexity of this
mechanism is also O(1) in an amortized sense: it performs purely constant-time
computations for $k-1$ consecutive steps (e.g., $k=256$) and executes a single
linear-time global information synchronization only on the $k$-th step.
Theoretical calculations and experimental results demonstrate that TConstFormer
exhibits an overwhelming advantage over baseline models in terms of speed,
memory efficiency, and overall performance on long-text inference tasks. This
breakthrough paves the way for efficient and robust streaming language model
applications.

TL;DR: Neptune is a data-efficient neural-field framework that infers parameter fields in PDEs from sparse observations, surpassing PINNs and SINDy, with strong extrapolation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Inferring spatially/temporally varying parameters in PDEs is hard when data are sparse and dynamics nonlinear; existing methods struggle with multiphysics and limited observables.

Method: Use independent coordinate neural networks to represent each parameter field in physical/state space; train to fit observed system responses under the governing PDEs; general-purpose, data-efficient.

Result: Across physical/biomedical problems, Neptune achieves robust parameter estimation from as few as 50 observations; reduces parameter estimation errors by ~100x and dynamic response errors by ~10x compared with PINNs; shows superior extrapolation beyond training regimes.

Conclusion: Neptune enables reliable, data-efficient parameter inference with broad potential across engineering, healthcare, and beyond.

Abstract: Parameterized partial differential equations (PDEs) underpin the mathematical
modeling of complex systems in diverse domains, including engineering,
healthcare, and physics. A central challenge in using PDEs for real-world
applications is to accurately infer the parameters, particularly when the
parameters exhibit non-linear and spatiotemporal variations. Existing parameter
estimation methods, such as sparse identification and physics-informed neural
networks (PINNs), struggle in such cases, especially with nonlinear dynamics,
multiphysics interactions, or limited observations of the system response. To
address these challenges, we introduce Neptune, a general-purpose method
capable of inferring parameter fields from sparse measurements of system
responses. Neptune employs independent coordinate neural networks to
continuously represent each parameter field in physical space or in state
variables. Across various physical and biomedical problems, where direct
parameter measurements are prohibitively expensive or unattainable, Neptune
significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving robust parameter
estimation from as few as 50 observations, reducing parameter estimation errors
by two orders of magnitude and dynamic response prediction errors by a factor
of ten compared to PINNs. Furthermore, Neptune exhibits superior extrapolation
capabilities, enabling accurate predictions in regimes beyond training data
where PINN fail. By facilitating reliable and data-efficient parameter
inference, Neptune promises broad transformative impacts in engineering,
healthcare, and beyond.

Result: Evaluated on H100 clusters with MoE models up to 1.6T parameters, Learn to Shard achieves up to 3.5x throughput improvement over metaheuristic baselines and 1.06x over Megatron heuristics.

Conclusion: This work is, to our knowledge, the first RL-based approach to jointly optimize both coarse-grained parallelism and fine-grained per-operator sharding for distributed LLM inference, demonstrating substantial throughput gains and suggesting RL-driven search can better adapt to diverse hardware topologies than static heuristic methods.

Abstract: Distributed LLM inference requires careful coordination of parallelization
strategies across hundreds to thousands of NPUs to meet production SLOs.

TL;DR: Speech foundation models yield domain-independent representations that improve time-series tasks in wearables; probing shows HuBERT/wav2vec2.0 features outperform modality-specific SSL features, with convolutional encoders especially effective.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bridge speech and sensor time-series representations to enable generalized, robust models, particularly in data-scarce wearable analytics.

Method: Use probes trained on features extracted from HuBERT and wav2vec 2.0 pretrained on speech; compare against probes using modality-specific self-supervised features; evaluate on mood classification, arrhythmia detection, and activity classification; analyze encoder type (convolutional vs others).

Result: Speech SSL features outperform modality-specific SSL features for the evaluated tasks; convolutional feature encoders from speech models show strong relevance for wearable sensor tasks; simple probing yields improved performance and robustness in data-scarce settings.

Conclusion: Supports domain-independent representations and advances toward generalized time-series models for both speech and sensor data; motivates cross-domain pretraining and probing as a research direction.

Abstract: Both speech and sensor time series data encode information in both the time-
and frequency- domains, like spectral powers and waveform shapelets. We show
that speech foundation models learn representations that are domain-independent
and achieve state-of-the-art performance on time series tasks from wearable
sensors. Probes trained on features extracted from HuBERT and wav2vec 2.0
outperform those extracted from self-supervised models trained directly on
modality specific datasets for mood classification, arrhythmia detection, and
activity classification tasks. We find a particularly strong relevance of the
convolutional feature encoders from speech models for wearable sensor tasks.
The methods proposed here improve performance and robustness for data-scarce
time series tasks, using simple probing methods. This work is a step towards
generalized time series models for speech and sensor data, a topic for further
exploration.

*Stefan-Alexandru Jura,Mihai Udrescu,Alexandru Topirceanu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Q-SSM is a hybrid quantum-optimized state-space model that uses a variational quantum gate to regulate memory updates, offering a lightweight alternative to attention for long-range multivariate time series forecasting and achieving improved accuracy and stability over strong baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long-range time series forecasting is hard due to non-stationarity and multi-scale temporal dependencies, requiring robustness to noise, efficiency, and stability. Transformer-based models have quadratic complexity and degrade on very long horizons, while linear-time SSMs like S-Mamba can be unstable and less robust for multivariate forecasting.

Method: Propose Quantum-Optimized Selective State Space Model (Q-SSM) that integrates state-space dynamics with a parametrized quantum circuit (RY-RX ansatz). The expectation values from the quantum circuit regulate memory updates adaptively, serving as a gating mechanism without relying on attention.

Result: Empirical evaluation on three benchmarks (ETT, Traffic, Exchange Rate) shows Q-SSM consistently improves over strong baselines (LSTM, TCN, Reformer), Transformer-based models, and S-Mamba.

Conclusion: Variational quantum gating can address current limitations in long-range forecasting, yielding accurate and robust multivariate predictions with a lightweight, stable alternative to attention-based methods.

Abstract: Long-range time series forecasting remains challenging, as it requires
capturing non-stationary and multi-scale temporal dependencies while
maintaining noise robustness, efficiency, and stability. Transformer-based
architectures such as Autoformer and Informer improve generalization but suffer
from quadratic complexity and degraded performance on very long time horizons.
State space models, notably S-Mamba, provide linear-time updates but often face
unstable training dynamics, sensitivity to initialization, and limited
robustness for multivariate forecasting. To address such challenges, we propose
the Quantum-Optimized Selective State Space Model (Q-SSM), a hybrid
quantum-optimized approach that integrates state space dynamics with a
variational quantum gate. Instead of relying on expensive attention mechanisms,
Q-SSM employs a simple parametrized quantum circuit (RY-RX ansatz) whose
expectation values regulate memory updates adaptively. This quantum gating
mechanism improves convergence stability, enhances the modeling of long-term
dependencies, and provides a lightweight alternative to attention. We
empirically validate Q-SSM on three widely used benchmarks, i.e., ETT, Traffic,
and Exchange Rate. Results show that Q-SSM consistently improves over strong
baselines (LSTM, TCN, Reformer), Transformer-based models, and S-Mamba. These
findings demonstrate that variational quantum gating can address current
limitations in long-range forecasting, leading to accurate and robust
multivariate predictions.

### [420] [ReLATE: Learning Efficient Sparse Encoding for High-Performance Tensor Decomposition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00280)
*Ahmed E. Helal,Fabio Checconi,Jan Laukemann,Yongseok Soh,Jesmin Jahan Tithi,Fabrizio Petrini,Jee Choi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ReLATE proposes a learning-augmented, reinforcement-learned adaptive tensor encoding to automatically build sparse tensor representations for tensor decomposition, yielding robust performance without labeled data and outperforming expert-designed formats.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-dimensional sparse data and irregular access patterns hamper performance; existing formats are hand-designed and inflexible; need data-adaptive encoding without labeled data.

Method: Autonomous RL agent with hybrid model-free/model-based learning to discover tensor encodings via interaction with the TD environment; rule-based action masking; dynamics-informed action filtering to guarantee correctness and bounded runtime; learning from real and imagined actions; no labels required.

Result: Sparse encodings learned by ReLATE outperform expert-designed formats across diverse datasets with up to 2x speedup over the best sparse format; geometric mean speedup 1.4-1.46x; adaptable to irregular shapes and distributions.

Conclusion: ReLATE enables automatic, data-adaptive sparse tensor encoding for TD, reducing manual engineering and delivering consistent performance improvements across datasets.

Abstract: Tensor decomposition (TD) is essential for analyzing high-dimensional sparse
data, yet its irregular computations and memory-access patterns pose major
performance challenges on modern parallel processors. Prior works rely on
expert-designed sparse tensor formats that fail to adapt to irregular tensor
shapes and/or highly variable data distributions. We present the
reinforcement-learned adaptive tensor encoding (ReLATE) framework, a novel
learning-augmented method that automatically constructs efficient sparse tensor
representations without labeled training samples. ReLATE employs an autonomous
agent that discovers optimized tensor encodings through direct interaction with
the TD environment, leveraging a hybrid model-free and model-based algorithm to
learn from both real and imagined actions. Moreover, ReLATE introduces
rule-driven action masking and dynamics-informed action filtering mechanisms
that ensure functionally correct tensor encoding with bounded execution time,
even during early learning stages. By automatically adapting to both irregular
tensor shapes and data distributions, ReLATE generates sparse tensor
representations that consistently outperform expert-designed formats across
diverse sparse tensor data sets, achieving up to 2X speedup compared to the
best sparse format, with a geometric-mean speedup of 1.4-1.46X.

### [421] [Continuously Tempered Diffusion Samplers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00316)
*Ezra Erives,Bowen Jing,Peter Holderrieth,Tommi Jaakkola*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes continuously tempered diffusion samplers to improve exploration in annealing-based neural samplers by using a temperature-annealed family of distributions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Isolated modes and pathologies in annealing paths cause insufficient exploration, leading to degraded sampler performance after training.

Method: Introduce a continuously tempered diffusion framework: a family of distributions across temperatures lowers energy barriers at high temperatures to promote exploration, then focuses at the target temperature for sampling.

Result: Empirical experiments show improved sampler performance due to the extended exploration enabled by continuous tempering; code is provided.

Conclusion: Continuous tempering in diffusion samplers enhances exploratory behavior and performance of annealing-based neural samplers; code release facilitates reproducibility.

Abstract: Annealing-based neural samplers seek to amortize sampling from unnormalized
distributions by training neural networks to transport a family of densities
interpolating from source to target. A crucial design choice in the training
phase of such samplers is the proposal distribution by which locations are
generated at which to evaluate the loss. Previous work has obtained such a
proposal distribution by combining a partially learned transport with annealed
Langevin dynamics. However, isolated modes and other pathological properties of
the annealing path imply that such proposals achieve insufficient exploration
and thereby lower performance post training. To remedy this, we propose
continuously tempered diffusion samplers, which leverage exploration techniques
developed in the context of molecular dynamics to improve proposal
distributions. Specifically, a family of distributions across different
temperatures is introduced to lower energy barriers at higher temperatures and
drive exploration at the lower temperature of interest. We empirically validate
improved sampler performance driven by extended exploration. Code is available
at https://github.com/eje24/ctds.

### [422] [Chunked TabPFN: Exact Training-Free In-Context Learning for Long-Context Tabular Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00326)
*Renat Sergazinov,Shao-An Yin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a tiled-block attention strategy to enable TabPFN v2 to process long contexts (>10k tokens) without context pre-processing, demonstrated on TabArena.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: TabPFN v2 achieves strong tabular results but is bottlenecked by quadratic memory/computation for transformers, limiting to ~10k tokens; existing context compression (e.g., KNN) loses information. Need a way to handle long contexts directly.

Method: Introduce tiled-block attention within TabPFN to compute attention in blocks (tiles), enabling long-context processing on standard GPUs without pre-processing. Compatible with existing TabPFN architecture.

Result: Empirically validated on the TabArena benchmark, showing effectiveness in processing long contexts; demonstrates practical scalability.

Conclusion: The tiled-block approach removes the need for context compression and enables TabPFN v2 to handle long contexts efficiently, broadening applicability on tabular benchmarks.

Abstract: TabPFN v2 achieves better results than tree-based models on several tabular
benchmarks, which is notable since tree-based models are usually the strongest
choice for tabular data. However, it cannot handle more than 10K context tokens
because transformers have quadratic computation and memory costs.
  Unlike existing approaches that rely on context compression, such as
selecting representative samples via K-nearest neighbors (KNN), we introduce a
\textbf{tiled-block} strategy to compute attention within the TabPFN framework.
This design is compatible with standard GPU setups and, to the best of our
knowledge, is the first to enable TabPFN to \textbf{process long contexts
without any pre-processing}. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach
on the standard TabArena benchmark.

*Rahul Raja,Arpita Vats*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: IPS-weighted training with a Propensity Regularizer (PR) improves stability and generalization in offline recommender evaluation by combining IPS-weighted BPR with a variance-reducing regularizer; outperforms naive IPS and DM/SNIPS in biased exposure settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Exposure bias in logged implicit feedback makes offline evaluation and learning unreliable. IPS addresses bias but can have high variance; there's a need for a stable, practical counterfactual learning approach for recommender systems.

Method: Proposes an IPS-weighted training pipeline using an IPS-weighted Bayesian Personalized Ranking (BPR) objective augmented with a Propensity Regularizer. Evaluates Direct Method (DM), IPS, and Self-Normalized IPS (SNIPS) for offline policy evaluation. Validates on synthetic data and MovieLens 100K.

Result: IPS-weighted training improves model robustness under biased exposure; the Propensity Regularizer reduces variance amplification from extreme propensity weights, yielding more stable estimates. Experiments show better generalization under unbiased exposure and reduced evaluation variance compared to naive and standard IPS methods.

Conclusion: A practical, stable counterfactual learning and evaluation framework for recommender systems: combining IPS-weighted training with a Propensity Regularizer mitigates variance and improves robustness, with demonstrated gains on synthetic data and MovieLens 100K.

Abstract: Learning and evaluating recommender systems from logged implicit feedback is
challenging due to exposure bias. While inverse propensity scoring (IPS)
corrects this bias, it often suffers from high variance and instability. In
this paper, we present a simple and effective pipeline that integrates
IPS-weighted training with an IPS-weighted Bayesian Personalized Ranking (BPR)
objective augmented by a Propensity Regularizer (PR). We compare Direct Method
(DM), IPS, and Self-Normalized IPS (SNIPS) for offline policy evaluation, and
demonstrate how IPS-weighted training improves model robustness under biased
exposure. The proposed PR further mitigates variance amplification from extreme
propensity weights, leading to more stable estimates. Experiments on synthetic
and MovieLens 100K data show that our approach generalizes better under
unbiased exposure while reducing evaluation variance compared to naive and
standard IPS methods, offering practical guidance for counterfactual learning
and evaluation in real-world recommendation settings.

### [424] [Are We Really Learning the Score Function? Reinterpreting Diffusion Models Through Wasserstein Gradient Flow Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00336)
*An B. Vuong,Michael T. McCann,Javier E. Santos,Yen Ting Lin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Diffusion models are better understood as flow matching to a Wasserstein Gradient Flow velocity field than as strict score-function learning; empirical evidence shows learned vector fields are non-conservative yet still generate high-quality samples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The common view that diffusion models learn a conservative score function is contradicted by observed non-conservative vector fields; this paradox motivates a new principled theoretical framework.

Method: Provide numerical evidence that trained diffusion networks violate score constraints; formulate training as flow matching to a Wasserstein Gradient Flow; analyze how probability flow arises under this view and why sampling remains effective despite non-conservative errors.

Result: Non-conservative neural vector fields can still transport density effectively; the probability flow emerges naturally from the WGF framework, explaining strong generative performance without relying on reverse-time SDE theory.

Conclusion: Adopt the Wasserstein Gradient Flow perspective as a principled, elegant framework for understanding diffusion generative models, clarifying the role of flow rather than strict score learning.

Abstract: Diffusion models are commonly interpreted as learning the score function,
i.e., the gradient of the log-density of noisy data. However, this assumption
implies that the target of learning is a conservative vector field, which is
not enforced by the neural network architectures used in practice. We present
numerical evidence that trained diffusion networks violate both integral and
differential constraints required of true score functions, demonstrating that
the learned vector fields are not conservative. Despite this, the models
perform remarkably well as generative mechanisms. To explain this apparent
paradox, we advocate a new theoretical perspective: diffusion training is
better understood as flow matching to the velocity field of a Wasserstein
Gradient Flow (WGF), rather than as score learning for a reverse-time
stochastic differential equation. Under this view, the "probability flow"
arises naturally from the WGF framework, eliminating the need to invoke
reverse-time SDE theory and clarifying why generative sampling remains
successful even when the neural vector field is not a true score. We further
show that non-conservative errors from neural approximation do not necessarily
harm density transport. Our results advocate for adopting the WGF perspective
as a principled, elegant, and theoretically grounded framework for
understanding diffusion generative models.

*Hanping Zhang,Yuhong Guo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LLMDPD is a prompt-driven offline RL method that uses LLM-derived task descriptions and trajectory prompts to condition a policy diffusion model, improving generalization to unseen tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Offline RL suffers from limited and biased data making generalization to new tasks hard; leveraging external task knowledge and structured behavior prompts can guide policy learning to be more adaptable.

Method: Process text-based task descriptions with a large language model and encode trajectory prompts with a transformer to capture behavioral patterns; these prompts condition a context-aware policy-level diffusion model trained on offline data to generalize to unseen tasks.

Result: LLMDPD outperforms state-of-the-art offline RL methods on unseen tasks, demonstrating improved generalization and adaptability across diverse settings.

Conclusion: Prompt-informed diffusion for offline RL is a promising direction; future work may explore richer prompts, scaling LLMs, and broader task distributions to further enhance generalization.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) is known for its strong decision-making
capabilities and has been widely applied in various real-world scenarios.
However, with the increasing availability of offline datasets and the lack of
well-designed online environments from human experts, the challenge of
generalization in offline RL has become more prominent. Due to the limitations
of offline data, RL agents trained solely on collected experiences often
struggle to generalize to new tasks or environments. To address this challenge,
we propose LLM-Driven Policy Diffusion (LLMDPD), a novel approach that enhances
generalization in offline RL using task-specific prompts. Our method
incorporates both text-based task descriptions and trajectory prompts to guide
policy learning. We leverage a large language model (LLM) to process text-based
prompts, utilizing its natural language understanding and extensive knowledge
base to provide rich task-relevant context. Simultaneously, we encode
trajectory prompts using a transformer model, capturing structured behavioral
patterns within the underlying transition dynamics. These prompts serve as
conditional inputs to a context-aware policy-level diffusion model, enabling
the RL agent to generalize effectively to unseen tasks. Our experimental
results demonstrate that LLMDPD outperforms state-of-the-art offline RL methods
on unseen tasks, highlighting its effectiveness in improving generalization and
adaptability in diverse settings.

*Shixiao Liang,Wang Chen,Keke Long,Peng Zhang,Xiaopeng Li,Jintao Ke*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Theory-backed validation of PERL: learning the residual between physics and ground truth reduces neural capacity needed, accelerates training, and lowers data needs; demonstrated via Lipschitz-based analysis and AV trajectory experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Explain observed benefits of PERL and provide formal guarantees under Lipschitz continuity.

Method: Develop a general Lipschitz framework; relate loss bounds to residual learning; prove theorems about parameter efficiency, convergence, and sample complexity; supplement with numerical demonstrations in automated vehicle trajectory prediction.

Result: Theorems justify the three advantages; empirical tests show PERL achieves higher accuracy than pure neural nets with fewer samples.

Conclusion: PERL is not only empirically effective but theoretically sound, enhancing predictive performance in autonomous driving with less data and smaller networks.

Abstract: Intensive studies have been conducted in recent years to integrate neural
networks with physics models to balance model accuracy and interpretability.
One recently proposed approach, named Physics-Enhanced Residual Learning
(PERL), is to use learning to estimate the residual between the physics model
prediction and the ground truth. Numeral examples suggested that integrating
such residual with physics models in PERL has three advantages: (1) a reduction
in the number of required neural network parameters; (2) faster convergence
rates; and (3) fewer training samples needed for the same computational
precision. However, these numerical results lack theoretical justification and
cannot be adequately explained.
  This paper aims to explain these advantages of PERL from a theoretical
perspective. We investigate a general class of problems with Lipschitz
continuity properties. By examining the relationships between the bounds to the
loss function and residual learning structure, this study rigorously proves a
set of theorems explaining the three advantages of PERL.
  Several numerical examples in the context of automated vehicle trajectory
prediction are conducted to illustrate the proposed theorems. The results
confirm that, even with significantly fewer training samples, PERL consistently
achieves higher accuracy than a pure neural network. These results demonstrate
the practical value of PERL in real world autonomous driving applications where
corner case data are costly or hard to obtain. PERL therefore improves
predictive performance while reducing the amount of data required.

### [428] [Optimized Weight Initialization on the Stiefel Manifold for Deep ReLU Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00362)
*Hyungu Lee,Taehyeong Kim,Hayoung Choi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Orthogonal, ReLU-optimized initialization on the Stiefel manifold that preserves pre-activation statistics, prevents dying ReLU, and stabilizes gradient flow in very deep networks; with closed-form solutions and efficient sampling, yielding better empirical performance across MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, tabular data, few-shot settings, and ReLU variants.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current initializations (He, Xavier, orthogonal) preserve variance or promote isometry but don't regulate pre-activation mean or sparsity; their effectiveness deteriorates with depth, causing dying ReLU and gradient instability; need initialization that calibrates activation statistics from initialization time.

Method: Formulate an optimization on the Stiefel manifold to find orthogonal weight matrices tailored for ReLU, derive a family of closed-form solutions, and provide an efficient sampling scheme to initialize layers with preserved scale and calibrated pre-activation statistics.

Result: Theoretical analysis shows reduced dying ReLU probability, slower activation-variance decay, and mitigated gradient vanishing, leading to stable signal and gradient flows in deep architectures.

Conclusion: The proposed initialization outperforms prior methods across diverse datasets and ReLU-family activations, enabling stable training of very deep networks and offering a practical, efficient initialization scheme.

Abstract: Stable and efficient training of ReLU networks with large depth is highly
sensitive to weight initialization. Improper initialization can cause permanent
neuron inactivation dying ReLU and exacerbate gradient instability as network
depth increases. Methods such as He, Xavier, and orthogonal initialization
preserve variance or promote approximate isometry. However, they do not
necessarily regulate the pre-activation mean or control activation sparsity,
and their effectiveness often diminishes in very deep architectures. This work
introduces an orthogonal initialization specifically optimized for ReLU by
solving an optimization problem on the Stiefel manifold, thereby preserving
scale and calibrating the pre-activation statistics from the outset. A family
of closed-form solutions and an efficient sampling scheme are derived.
Theoretical analysis at initialization shows that prevention of the dying ReLU
problem, slower decay of activation variance, and mitigation of gradient
vanishing, which together stabilize signal and gradient flow in deep
architectures. Empirically, across MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, multiple tabular
datasets, few-shot settings, and ReLU-family activations, our method
outperforms previous initializations and enables stable training in deep
networks.

*Jinluan Yang,Ruihao Zhang,Zhengyu Chen,Fei Wu,Kun Kuang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PerturbEmbedding: a unified adversarial perturbation framework for GNNs that perturbs all hidden embeddings and improves robustness and generalization against random and targeted attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GNNs are vulnerable to adversarial perturbations in node features, weights, and structure; prior adversarial training is often dataset/model-specific; there is a need for a unified, broadly applicable defense that enhances robustness and generalization.

Method: Introduce PerturbEmbedding, which perturbs every hidden embedding in GNNs during training and integrates adversarial perturbations with standard training; provides a unified perspective by categorizing perturbations as random (non-targeted) or adversarial (targeted); demonstrates compatibility with various backbone models and perturbation strategies.

Result: PerturbEmbedding significantly improves robustness and generalization across multiple datasets and backbone models, outperforming existing methods; rejecting both random and adversarial perturbations further enhances the backbone performance.

Conclusion: PerturbEmbedding offers a broadly applicable, embedding-level adversarial training framework for GNNs, strengthening defenses against attacks and improving generalization across diverse settings.

Abstract: This paper studies the vulnerability of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to
adversarial attacks on node features and graph structure. Various methods have
implemented adversarial training to augment graph data, aiming to bolster the
robustness and generalization of GNNs. These methods typically involve applying
perturbations to the node feature, weights, or graph structure and subsequently
minimizing the loss by learning more robust graph model parameters under the
adversarial perturbations. Despite the effectiveness of adversarial training in
enhancing GNNs' robustness and generalization abilities, its application has
been largely confined to specific datasets and GNN types. In this paper, we
propose a novel method, PerturbEmbedding, that integrates adversarial
perturbation and training, enhancing GNNs' resilience to such attacks and
improving their generalization ability. PerturbEmbedding performs perturbation
operations directly on every hidden embedding of GNNs and provides a unified
framework for most existing perturbation strategies/methods. We also offer a
unified perspective on the forms of perturbations, namely random and
adversarial perturbations. Through experiments on various datasets using
different backbone models, we demonstrate that PerturbEmbedding significantly
improves both the robustness and generalization abilities of GNNs,
outperforming existing methods. The rejection of both random (non-targeted) and
adversarial (targeted) perturbations further enhances the backbone model's
performance.

### [430] [Curriculum Guided Personalized Subgraph Federated Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00402)
*Minku Kang,Hogun Park*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CUFL is a curriculum-guided personalized subgraph federated learning framework that mitigates data heterogeneity by pacing exposure with curriculum learning and refining client similarity estimation for weighted aggregation, achieving superior results across six datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Subgraph federated learning suffers from severe data heterogeneity and overfitting due to biased subgraphs, which degrades the effectiveness of weighted aggregation. Existing methods fail to adapt to varying subgraph characteristics and may reinforce client biases.

Method: On the client side, CUFL employs Curriculum Learning to select training edges by reconstruction scores, exposing easier, generic cross-client substructures before harder, client-specific ones. This paced exposure reduces early overfitting and smooths personalization. The server-side aggregation is regulated to propagate more client-specific knowledge. Client similarity is improved by estimating similarity using fine-grained structural indicators reconstructed on a random reference graph.

Result: Extensive experiments on six benchmark datasets show that CUFL outperforms relevant baselines, demonstrating the effectiveness of curriculum-guided personalization and refined similarity-based aggregation. Code is available at the provided GitHub URL.

Conclusion: CUFL effectively mitigates data heterogeneity in subgraph FL by pacing personalization through curriculum learning and by refining similarity-based aggregation, enabling robust, personalized GNN performance across diverse subgraphs.

Abstract: Subgraph Federated Learning (FL) aims to train Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)
across distributed private subgraphs, but it suffers from severe data
heterogeneity. To mitigate data heterogeneity, weighted model aggregation
personalizes each local GNN by assigning larger weights to parameters from
clients with similar subgraph characteristics inferred from their current model
states. However, the sparse and biased subgraphs often trigger rapid
overfitting, causing the estimated client similarity matrix to stagnate or even
collapse. As a result, aggregation loses effectiveness as clients reinforce
their own biases instead of exploiting diverse knowledge otherwise available.
To this end, we propose a novel personalized subgraph FL framework called
Curriculum guided personalized sUbgraph Federated Learning (CUFL). On the
client side, CUFL adopts Curriculum Learning (CL) that adaptively selects edges
for training according to their reconstruction scores, exposing each GNN first
to easier, generic cross-client substructures and only later to harder,
client-specific ones. This paced exposure prevents early overfitting to biased
patterns and enables gradual personalization. By regulating personalization,
the curriculum also reshapes server aggregation from exchanging generic
knowledge to propagating client-specific knowledge. Further, CUFL improves
weighted aggregation by estimating client similarity using fine-grained
structural indicators reconstructed on a random reference graph. Extensive
experiments on six benchmark datasets confirm that CUFL achieves superior
performance compared to relevant baselines. Code is available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Identifies anisotropic parameter distributions as a key barrier to low-bit LLM training and presents Metis, a framework that uses spectral decomposition with random embedding, adaptive spectral learning rates, and a dual-range regularizer to compress distributions and stabilize training; FP8 outperforms FP32 baselines and FP4 matches FP32.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Low-bit quantization for LLM training is hindered by a few dominant singular values that produce wide numerical ranges. This biases block-wise quantization, preserving large values while discarding small ones, leading to training instability and degraded performance. A method is needed to disentangle and stabilize distributions to enable robust low-bit training.

Method: Metis combines three components: (i) spectral decomposition with random embedding to separate dominant and long-tail components and compress broad distributions into quantization-friendly ranges; (ii) adaptive learning rates in the spectral domain to amplify underrepresented directions and capture diverse features; (iii) a dual-range regularizer that constrains both numerical precision and parameter-range distribution to ensure stable, unbiased low-bit training.

Result: With Metis, FP8 training surpasses FP32 baselines, and FP4 training achieves accuracy comparable to FP32, enabling robust low-bit LLM training. The authors provide a code implementation at the given GitHub link.

Conclusion: Metis effectively mitigates anisotropic distribution barriers in low-bit LLM training by disentangling spectral components, adjusting learning dynamics in the spectral domain, and constraining parameter ranges, enabling scalable and stable low-bit quantization-enabled training.

Abstract: This work identifies anisotropic parameter distributions as a fundamental
barrier to training large language models (LLMs) with low-bit quantization: a
few dominant singular values create wide numerical ranges that conflict with
the inherent bias of block-wise quantization. This bias disproportionately
preserves high-magnitude values while discarding smaller ones, causing training
instability and low model performance. This work introduces Metis, a training
framework that combines (i) spectral decomposition with random embedding to
efficiently disentangle dominant from long-tail components, compressing broad
distributions into quantization-friendly narrow ranges; (ii) adaptive learning
rates in the spectral domain to amplify underrepresented directions and better
capture diverse features critical for performance; and (iii) a dual-range
regularizer that jointly constrains numerical precision and parameter range
distribution, ensuring stable, unbiased low-bit training. With Metis, FP8
training surpasses FP32 baselines, and FP4 training achieves accuracy
comparable to FP32, paving the way for robust and scalable LLM training under
advanced low-bit quantization. The code implementation for Metis is available

TL;DR: Generalizes restless multi-armed bandits to a multi-action partially observable setting with budget coupling; analyzes Lagrangian bounds and approximation methods (PBVI, online rollout); develops heuristics and discusses Whittle index limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the complexity of optimizing finite-state, finite-action POMDPs under a budget constraint, with applications in public-health interventions and other domains requiring sequential decision-making under partial observability and weak coupling.

Method: Model: independent bandits with finite states/actions; state evolution is action-dependent Markov process; non-observable bandit states, observable feedback signals; objective: long-term discounted reward; budget constraint couples arms. Approach: (1) Lagrangian bound framework for the partially observable restless bandits; (2) compute/approximate Lagrangian bounds using point-based value iteration (PBVI) and online rollout; (3) analyze properties of value functions and provide theoretical insights on PBVI and rollout; (4) study heuristic policies; (5) discuss Whittle index policies and their limitations in this setting.

Result: Gives approximations for Lagrangian bounds via PBVI and online rollout; offers theoretical insights into the value functions and PBVI/rollout performance; evaluates heuristic policies; clarifies limitations of Whittle index in the multi-action PORMAB model.

Conclusion: The work provides practical methods to tackle multi-action PORMABs under budget constraints, highlighting computational challenges and limitations of Whittle index approaches; PBVI and online rollout emerge as viable tools for obtaining bounds and guiding heuristics.

Abstract: Partially observable restless multi-armed bandits have found numerous
applications including in recommendation systems, communication systems, public
healthcare outreach systems, and in operations research. We study multi-action
partially observable restless multi-armed bandits, it is a generalization of
the classical restless multi-armed bandit problem -- 1) each bandit has finite
states, and the current state is not observable, 2) each bandit has finite
actions. In particular, we assume that more than two actions are available for
each bandit. We motivate our problem with the application of public-health
intervention planning. We describe the model and formulate a long term
discounted optimization problem, where the state of each bandit evolves
according to a Markov process, and this evolution is action dependent. The
state of a bandit is not observable but one of finitely many feedback signals
are observable. Each bandit yields a reward, based on the action taken on that
bandit. The agent is assumed to have a budget constraint. The bandits are
assumed to be independent. However, they are weakly coupled at the agent
through the budget constraint.
  We first analyze the Lagrangian bound method for our partially observable
restless bandits. The computation of optimal value functions for finite-state,
finite-action POMDPs is non-trivial. Hence, the computation of Lagrangian
bounds is also challenging. We describe approximations for the computation of
Lagrangian bounds using point based value iteration (PBVI) and online rollout
policy. We further present various properties of the value functions and
provide theoretical insights on PBVI and online rollout policy. We study
heuristic policies for multi-actions PORMAB. Finally, we discuss present
Whittle index policies and their limitations in our model.

### [433] [Memory Limitations of Prompt Tuning in Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00421)
*Maxime Meyer,Mario Michelessa,Caroline Chaux,Vincent Y. F. Tan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Prompt-tuning memorization grows only linearly with prompt length, and transformers have intrinsic memory limits that bound information retention, explaining degradation with longer contexts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Theoretical work on prompt tuning has focused on universal approximation; there is a gap in understanding the memorization capacity and long-context behavior of transformers. This paper provides formal memory bounds and explains observed long-context degradation.

Method: The authors prove a linear upper bound on the amount of information a transformer can memorize as a function of prompt length and provide a formal proof that transformers inherently suffer performance degradation when contexts become longer due to these memory limits.

Result: Two core contributions: (1) memorized information scales at most linearly with prompt length; (2) a formal proof that extended contexts cause performance degradation, reflecting an intrinsic memory limit of transformers independent of context size.

Conclusion: The work reveals fundamental intrinsic memory constraints in transformer architectures for long sequences, informing future design of models and prompting strategies to mitigate memory bottlenecks.

Abstract: Despite the empirical success of prompt tuning in adapting pretrained
language models to new tasks, theoretical analyses of its capabilities remain
limited. Existing theoretical work primarily addresses universal approximation
properties, demonstrating results comparable to standard weight tuning. In this
paper, we explore a different aspect of the theory of transformers: the
memorization capability of prompt tuning. We provide two principal theoretical
contributions. First, we prove that the amount of information memorized by a
transformer cannot scale faster than linearly with the prompt length. Second,
and more importantly, we present the first formal proof of a phenomenon
empirically observed in large language models: performance degradation in
transformers with extended contexts. We rigorously demonstrate that
transformers inherently have limited memory, constraining the amount of
information they can retain, regardless of the context size. This finding
offers a fundamental understanding of the intrinsic limitations of transformer
architectures, particularly their ability to handle long sequences.

*Filip Szatkowski,Patryk Będkowski,Alessio Devoto,Jan Dubiński,Pasquale Minervini,Mikołaj Piórczyński,Simone Scardapane,Bartosz Wójcik*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Input-dependent activation sparsity in LLMs extends beyond ReLU, with FFN layers showing universal sparsity patterns across models, including diffusion LLMs. A general framework to assess sparsity robustness reveals practical guidelines for design and acceleration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ReLU-centric sparsity analyses do not translate to non-ReLU, modern LLM activations. There is no consensus on what to sparsify in LLMs. A model-agnostic framework is needed to study sparsity robustness and to inform efficient, robust, and interpretable model design.

Method: Propose a general framework to quantify and assess sparsity robustness. Conduct a systematic empirical study of activation sparsity in the feed-forward networks (FFNs) of modern LLMs, including diffusion models, across diverse architectures and prompts. Analyze input-dependent sparsity patterns, layer-wise distribution, and activation statistics to identify universal behaviors and model-specific deviations.

Result: Found universal, input-dependent activation sparsity patterns in FFNs that persist across modern LLMs, including diffusion LLMs. These patterns reveal factors governing sparsity and suggest how to exploit it for efficiency (e.g., dynamic computation, selective activation pruning) and robustness. The study provides empirical insights and groundwork for design guidelines.

Conclusion: A model-agnostic framework and cross-model empirical findings consolidate activation sparsity observations in LLMs, enabling more principled design, acceleration, and interpretability. Future work can extend to other modules, activation families, and training regimes to broaden applicability.

Abstract: Input-dependent activation sparsity is a notable property of deep learning
models, which has been extensively studied in networks with ReLU activations
and is associated with efficiency, robustness, and interpretability. However,
the approaches developed for ReLU-based models depend on exact zero activations
and do not transfer directly to modern large language models~(LLMs), which have
abandoned ReLU in favor of other activation functions. As a result, current
work on activation sparsity in LLMs is fragmented, model-specific, and lacks
consensus on which components to target. We propose a general framework to
assess sparsity robustness and present a systematic study of the phenomenon in
the FFN layers of modern LLMs, including diffusion LLMs. Our findings reveal
universal patterns of activation sparsity in LLMs, provide insights into this
phenomenon, and offer practical guidelines for exploiting it in model design
and acceleration.

### [435] [Localizing and Mitigating Memorization in Image Autoregressive Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00488)
*Aditya Kasliwal,Franziska Boenisch,Adam Dziedzic*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Memorization in Image AutoRegressive (IAR) models varies by architecture; memorization localizes early for hierarchical per-resolution designs and late for standard per-token designs; targeted interventions on the top memorizing components can reduce data leakage with minimal impact on image quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address privacy concerns: training-data memorization in IARs can lead to data leakage. Understanding where/how memorization occurs is key to mitigating risks.

Method: Systematically measure fine-grained memorization across architectures: hierarchical per-resolution versus standard per-token IARs; assess at which processing stages memorization concentrates as resolution increases; intervene on the most memorizing components and evaluate impact on data extraction and image quality.

Result: Memorization patterns differ by architecture. In hierarchical per-resolution IARs, memorization emerges early and deepens with higher resolutions; in standard per-token IARs, memorization concentrates in later processing stages. Intervening on the most memorizing components significantly reduces data extraction capability with minimal degradation to image quality.

Conclusion: Provides architecture-aware insights into the internal behavior of image generative models and suggests practical strategies to mitigate privacy risks by targeting memorizing components without heavily sacrificing performance.

Abstract: Image AutoRegressive (IAR) models have achieved state-of-the-art performance
in speed and quality of generated images. However, they also raise concerns
about memorization of their training data and its implications for privacy.
This work explores where and how such memorization occurs within different
image autoregressive architectures by measuring a fine-grained memorization.
The analysis reveals that memorization patterns differ across various
architectures of IARs. In hierarchical per-resolution architectures, it tends
to emerge early and deepen with resolutions, while in IARs with standard
autoregressive per token prediction, it concentrates in later processing
stages. These localization of memorization patterns are further connected to
IARs' ability to memorize and leak training data. By intervening on their most
memorizing components, we significantly reduce the capacity for data extraction
from IARs with minimal impact on the quality of generated images. These
findings offer new insights into the internal behavior of image generative
models and point toward practical strategies for mitigating privacy risks.

### [436] [Graph Convolutional Network With Pattern-Spatial Interactive and Regional Awareness for Traffic Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00515)
*Xinyu Ji,Chengcheng Yan,Jibiao Yuan,Fiefie Zhao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PSIRAGCN proposes a pattern-spatial interactive framework for traffic forecasting, combining global-to-local pattern perspectives with region-aware message-passing to capture spatial-temporal correlations and regional heterogeneity, achieving state-of-the-art results with reasonable cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in existing spatio-temporal models that inadequately fuse traffic patterns with spatial correlations and neglect regional heterogeneity in message passing, hindering forecast accuracy.

Method: A two-module Pattern-Spatial Interactive Fusion framework: a pattern module to capture global-to-local traffic patterns and a spatial module using a regional characteristics bank to drive data-driven, region-aware message passing in a GCN; mutual feedback between pattern and spatial modules.

Result: Empirical evaluation on three real-world traffic datasets shows PSIRAGCN outperforms state-of-the-art baselines while maintaining balanced computational costs.

Conclusion: PSIRAGCN effectively models pattern-spatial interactions and regional heterogeneity, improving forecasting accuracy and efficiency.

Abstract: Traffic forecasting is significant for urban traffic management, intelligent
route planning, and real-time flow monitoring. Recent advances in
spatial-temporal models have markedly improved the modeling of intricate
spatial-temporal correlations for traffic forecasting. Unfortunately, most
previous studies have encountered challenges in effectively modeling
spatial-temporal correlations across various perceptual perspectives, which
have neglected the interactive fusion between traffic patterns and spatial
correlations. Additionally, constrained by spatial heterogeneity, most studies
fail to consider distinct regional heterogeneity during message-passing. To
overcome these limitations, we propose a Pattern-Spatial Interactive and
Regional Awareness Graph Convolutional Network (PSIRAGCN) for traffic
forecasting. Specifically, we propose a pattern-spatial interactive fusion
framework composed of pattern and spatial modules. This framework aims to
capture patterns and spatial correlations by adopting a perception perspective
from the global to the local level and facilitating mutual utilization with
positive feedback. In the spatial module, we designed a graph convolutional
network based on message-passing. The network is designed to leverage a
regional characteristics bank to reconstruct data-driven message-passing with
regional awareness. Reconstructed message passing can reveal the regional
heterogeneity between nodes in the traffic network. Extensive experiments on
three real-world traffic datasets demonstrate that PSIRAGCN outperforms the
State-of-the-art baseline while balancing computational costs.

### [437] [Biological Pathway Informed Models with Graph Attention Networks (GATs)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00524)
*Gavin Wong,Ping Shu Ho,Ivan Au Yeung,Ka Chun Cheung,Simon See*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A gene-level Graph Attention Network outperforms MLP baselines by leveraging pathway topology to predict gene-gene interaction dynamics, with strong generalization to unseen treatments and ability to recover canonical gene interactions from time-series data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current models treat genes as unstructured tokens or drug-pathway bags, ignoring gene-gene topology and dynamic interactions. There is a need to integrate pathway topology into learning to improve predictive accuracy, robustness, and the ability to generate testable biological hypotheses.

Method: Introduce a Graph Attention Network operating at the gene level to model pathway dynamics. Compare against MLP-based and pathway-level models. Validate by: (i) predicting dynamics under unseen treatments with significant MSE reduction, (ii) encoding drug mechanisms via edge interventions to boost robustness, and (iii) showing the model can rediscover known gene-gene interactions (TP53-MDM2-MDM4 loop) from raw time-series mRNA data.

Result: The GAT-based approach achieves an 81% reduction in MSE under unseen treatment conditions compared to baselines. Incorporating edge interventions improves robustness to perturbations. The model can correctly rediscover the five gene-gene interactions in the canonical TP53-MDM2-MDM4 feedback loop from raw time-series data, supporting its potential to generate novel biological hypotheses from experimental data.

Conclusion: Modeling pathways at the gene level with GATs better utilizes topology and gene-gene interactions, leading to improved generalization, robustness, and the ability to recover known biological relationships. This framework can enable hypothesis generation directly from experimental data and supports incorporating mechanistic priors via edge interventions.

Abstract: Biological pathways map gene-gene interactions that govern all human
processes. Despite their importance, most ML models treat genes as unstructured
tokens, discarding known pathway structure. The latest pathway-informed models
capture pathway-pathway interactions, but still treat each pathway as a "bag of
genes" via MLPs, discarding its topology and gene-gene interactions. We propose
a Graph Attention Network (GAT) framework that models pathways at the gene
level. We show that GATs generalize much better than MLPs, achieving an 81%
reduction in MSE when predicting pathway dynamics under unseen treatment
conditions. We further validate the correctness of our biological prior by
encoding drug mechanisms via edge interventions, boosting model robustness.
Finally, we show that our GAT model is able to correctly rediscover all five
gene-gene interactions in the canonical TP53-MDM2-MDM4 feedback loop from raw
time-series mRNA data, demonstrating potential to generate novel biological
hypotheses directly from experimental data.

### [438] [FedThief: Harming Others to Benefit Oneself in Self-Centered Federated Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00540)
*Xiangyu Zhang,Mang Ye*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Self-centered FL attack FedThief degrades global model while boosting attacker ensemble via divergence-aware merging of global and local models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In FL, uploaded updates can't be directly verified, enabling attacks. Real attackers seek competitive advantage by outperforming others, not just disrupting the global model.

Method: FedThief degrades the global model by uploading modified updates during the upload stage; uses divergence-aware ensemble to combine global updates with local knowledge to improve the attacker’s private model, leveraging the divergence metric between private and global models.

Result: Extensive experiments show significant degradation of global model performance and an attacker ensemble that substantially outperforms the global model.

Conclusion: Introduces Self-Centered Federated Learning (SCFL) with the FedThief framework, highlighting a new threat model and the need for defenses against self-serving attacks in federated learning.

Abstract: In federated learning, participants' uploaded model updates cannot be
directly verified, leaving the system vulnerable to malicious attacks. Existing
attack strategies have adversaries upload tampered model updates to degrade the
global model's performance. However, attackers also degrade their own private
models, gaining no advantage. In real-world scenarios, attackers are driven by
self-centered motives: their goal is to gain a competitive advantage by
developing a model that outperforms those of other participants, not merely to
cause disruption. In this paper, we study a novel Self-Centered Federated
Learning (SCFL) attack paradigm, in which attackers not only degrade the
performance of the global model through attacks but also enhance their own
models within the federated learning process. We propose a framework named
FedThief, which degrades the performance of the global model by uploading
modified content during the upload stage. At the same time, it enhances the
private model's performance through divergence-aware ensemble techniques, where
"divergence" quantifies the deviation between private and global models, that
integrate global updates and local knowledge. Extensive experiments show that
our method effectively degrades the global model performance while allowing the
attacker to obtain an ensemble model that significantly outperforms the global
model.

*Lu Han,Mengyan Li,Jiping Qiang,Zhi Su*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Advanced Spectral Clustering (ASC) fuses numerical financial data and textual records to improve credit clustering, yielding higher quality clusters and actionable insights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Heterogeneous data (numbers and text) complicates credit monitoring; integrating both types can improve clustering quality and intervention targeting.

Method: Propose Advanced Spectral Clustering with optimized weight parameter to combine financial and textual similarities; eigenvalue-silhouette optimization for selecting eigenvectors; validated on 1,428 SMEs; robustness across k-means, k-medians, k-medoids; metrics include silhouette, Delta intra/inter, Delta silhouette.

Result: Silhouette score 18% higher than a single-type baseline; 51% of low-risk firms contain 'social recruitment' in text; Delta Intra/Inter < 0.13; Delta Silhouette < 0.02; recruitment-focused SMEs show 30% lower default risk.

Conclusion: ASC bridges spectral clustering theory with heterogeneous data applications, enabling meaningful, interpretable clusters and targeted credit interventions.

Abstract: Heterogeneous data, which encompass both numerical financial variables and
textual records, present substantial challenges for credit monitoring. To
address this issue, we propose Advanced Spectral Clustering (ASC), a method
that integrates financial and textual similarities through an optimized weight
parameter and selects eigenvectors using a novel eigenvalue-silhouette
optimization approach. Evaluated on a dataset comprising 1,428 small and
medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), ASC achieves a Silhouette score that is 18%
higher than that of a single-type data baseline method. Furthermore, the
resulting clusters offer actionable insights; for instance, 51% of low-risk
firms are found to include the term 'social recruitment' in their textual
records. The robustness of ASC is confirmed across multiple clustering
algorithms, including k-means, k-medians, and k-medoids, with
{\Delta}Intra/Inter < 0.13 and {\Delta}Silhouette Coefficient < 0.02. By
bridging spectral clustering theory with heterogeneous data applications, ASC
enables the identification of meaningful clusters, such as recruitment-focused
SMEs exhibiting a 30% lower default risk, thereby supporting more targeted and
effective credit interventions.

*Lu Han,Xiuying Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: IMST combines financial data and text features in a 3-stage pipeline to boost SME credit evaluation, achieving 88.9% accuracy on 1,428 Chinese SMEs and outperforming baseline models with better interpretability and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional decision trees rely on numeric variables and struggle with high-dimensional data and textual information. There is a need to leverage textual data alongside financial features to improve SME credit risk assessment while maintaining interpretability and computational efficiency.

Method: A three-stage framework: (1) convert textual data to numerical matrices via matrix factorization; (2) select salient financial features using Lasso regression; (3) construct a multivariate segmentation tree based on Gini index or Entropy with weakest-link pruning to control model complexity.

Result: On a dataset of 1,428 Chinese SMEs, IMST achieves 88.9% accuracy, surpassing baseline decision trees (87.4%) and traditional models such as logistic regression and SVM, with improved interpretability and computational efficiency due to a streamlined architecture.

Conclusion: IMST demonstrates that integrating textual information with financial features via a factorization-based text representation and a sparse, interpretable multivariate segmentation tree yields higher accuracy and efficiency for SME credit evaluation, suggesting potential applicability to other high-dimensional, text-rich domains.

Abstract: Traditional decision tree models, which rely exclusively on numerical
variables, often encounter difficulties in handling high-dimensional data and
fail to effectively incorporate textual information. To address these
limitations, we propose the Integrated Multivariate Segmentation Tree (IMST), a
comprehensive framework designed to enhance credit evaluation for small and
medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) by integrating financial data with textual
sources. The methodology comprises three core stages: (1) transforming textual
data into numerical matrices through matrix factorization; (2) selecting
salient financial features using Lasso regression; and (3) constructing a
multivariate segmentation tree based on the Gini index or Entropy, with
weakest-link pruning applied to regulate model complexity. Experimental results
derived from a dataset of 1,428 Chinese SMEs demonstrate that IMST achieves an
accuracy of 88.9%, surpassing baseline decision trees (87.4%) as well as
conventional models such as logistic regression and support vector machines
(SVM). Furthermore, the proposed model exhibits superior interpretability and
computational efficiency, featuring a more streamlined architecture and
enhanced risk detection capabilities.

*Can Cui,Zilong Fu,Penghe Huang,Yuanyuan Li,Wu Deng,Dongyan Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A knowledge distillation framework SA-DSD transfers knowledge from Graph Neural Networks to a more efficient FR-KAN+ student, improving accuracy and drastically reducing parameters and inference time for edge deployment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Edge devices require compact, fast models; MLPs struggle to capture GNN neighborhood aggregation. Transferring rich graph knowledge to lightweight networks (KANs) can preserve performance while meeting resource constraints.

Method: SA-DSD uses learnable frequency bases and phase-shift in an improved Fourier-based KAN (FR-KAN+) as the student, introduces a margin-level sampling probability matrix based on teacher–student prediction consistency, and applies an adaptive weighted loss to compensate for the lack of explicit neighborhood aggregation.

Result: SA-DSD yields 3.05–3.62% accuracy gains over three GNN teachers and 15.61% over FR-KAN+; achieves 16.96× fewer parameters and 55.75% faster inference on six real-world datasets.

Conclusion: SA-DSD effectively bridges GNN-to-KAN knowledge distillation, enhancing nonlinear fitting while markedly reducing model size and latency, enabling practical deployment of GNN-derived capabilities on resource-constrained edge devices.

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) is crucial for deploying deep learning models in
resource-constrained edge environments, particularly within the consumer
electronics sector, including smart home devices, wearable technology, and
mobile terminals. These applications place higher demands on model compression
and inference speed, necessitating the transfer of knowledge from Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs) to more efficient Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) models. However,
due to their fixed activation functions and fully connected architecture, MLPs
face challenges in rapidly capturing the complex neighborhood dependencies
learned by GNNs, thereby limiting their performance in edge environments. To
address these limitations, this paper introduces an innovative from GNNs to
Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) knowledge distillation framework-Self
Attention Dynamic Sampling Distillation (SA-DSD). This study improved Fourier
KAN (FR-KAN) and replaced MLP with the improved FR-KAN+ as the student model.
Through the incorporation of learnable frequency bases and phase-shift
mechanisms, along with algorithmic optimization, FR-KAN significantly improves
its nonlinear fitting capability while effectively reducing computational
complexity. Building on this, a margin-level sampling probability matrix, based
on teacher-student prediction consistency, is constructed, and an adaptive
weighted loss mechanism is designed to mitigate performance degradation in the
student model due to the lack of explicit neighborhood aggregation. Extensive
experiments conducted on six real-world datasets demonstrate that SA-DSD
achieves performance improvements of 3.05%-3.62% over three GNN teacher models
and 15.61% over the FR-KAN+ model. Moreover, when compared with key benchmark
models, SA-DSD achieves a 16.96x reduction in parameter count and a 55.75%
decrease in inference time.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantifying event-driven, transient causal interactions in neural data is challenging with traditional methods and there is a lack of accessible Python tools; a user-friendly pipeline is needed.

Method: An end-to-end Python package implementing Granger Causality, Transfer Entropy, and Structural Causal Model-based DCS and rDCS to detect event-driven causal effects in non-stationary signals; open-source and validated.

Result: Successfully detects causality in high-synchrony regimes where traditional methods fail; identifies transient information flow from hippocampal CA3 to CA1 during sharp-wave ripple events in real data.

Conclusion: TranCIT offers a user-friendly, validated solution for investigating transient causal dynamics in complex systems, enabling robust analysis of event-driven neural interactions.

Abstract: Quantifying transient causal interactions from non-stationary neural signals
is a fundamental challenge in neuroscience. Traditional methods are often
inadequate for brief neural events, and advanced, event-specific techniques
have lacked accessible implementations within the Python ecosystem. Here, we
introduce trancit (Transient Causal Interaction Toolbox), an open-source Python
package designed to bridge this gap. TranCIT implements a comprehensive
analysis pipeline, including Granger Causality, Transfer Entropy, and the more
robust Structural Causal Model-based Dynamic Causal Strength (DCS) and relative
Dynamic Causal Strength (rDCS) for accurately detecting event-driven causal
effects. We demonstrate TranCIT's utility by successfully capturing causality
in high-synchrony regimes where traditional methods fail and by identifying the
known transient information flow from hippocampal CA3 to CA1 during sharp-wave
ripple events in real-world data. The package offers a user-friendly, validated
solution for investigating the transient causal dynamics that govern complex
systems.

*Shikun Liu,Deyu Zou,Nima Shoghi,Victor Fung,Kai Liu,Pan Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A study on robust fine-tuning for molecular graph foundation models (MGFMs). Eight fine-tuning methods are categorized into weight-based, representation-based, and partial fine-tuning, and benchmarked on downstream regression and classification tasks with both supervised and self-supervised pretraining under varying labeling settings. The authors propose ROFT-MOL, a robust fine-tuning method that merges simple post-hoc weight interpolation with weight ensemble fine-tuning, achieving improved performance while preserving ease of use.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MGFMs face limited pre-training data and scarce downstream labels, leading to overfitting and poor generalization. There is a need for robust fine-tuning techniques that handle both regression and classification objectives across different pretraining paradigms (supervised and self-supervised).

Method: Classify eight fine-tuning methods into three mechanisms—weight-based, representation-based, and partial fine-tuning—and benchmark them on downstream regression and classification tasks with supervised and self-supervised pre-trained models under diverse labeling settings. Develop ROFT-MOL, a robust fine-tuning approach that combines post-hoc weight interpolation with weight ensemble fine-tuning to achieve better performance with ease of use.

Result: ROFT-MOL delivers improved performance across both regression and classification tasks relative to baseline fine-tuning strategies, while maintaining the simplicity of post-hoc weight interpolation. The evaluation also yields insights into the strengths and limitations of different fine-tuning mechanisms under data scarcity.

Conclusion: A refined robust fine-tuning framework for molecular graph foundation models—ROFT-MOL—effectively balances performance and usability by integrating weight interpolation with ensemble-based fine-tuning, and highlights directions for robust fine-tuning under limited data and diverse task objectives.

Abstract: In the era of foundation models, fine-tuning pre-trained models for specific
downstream tasks has become crucial. This drives the need for robust
fine-tuning methods to address challenges such as model overfitting and sparse
labeling. Molecular graph foundation models (MGFMs) face unique difficulties
that complicate fine-tuning. These models are limited by smaller pre-training
datasets and more severe data scarcity for downstream tasks, both of which
require enhanced model generalization. Moreover, MGFMs must accommodate diverse
objectives, including both regression and classification tasks. To better
understand and improve fine-tuning techniques under these conditions, we
classify eight fine-tuning methods into three mechanisms: weight-based,
representation-based, and partial fine-tuning. We benchmark these methods on
downstream regression and classification tasks across supervised and
self-supervised pre-trained models in diverse labeling settings. This extensive
evaluation provides valuable insights and informs the design of a refined
robust fine-tuning method, ROFT-MOL. This approach combines the strengths of
simple post-hoc weight interpolation with more complex weight ensemble
fine-tuning methods, delivering improved performance across both task types
while maintaining the ease of use inherent in post-hoc weight interpolation.

*Giacomo Acciarini,Simone Mestici,Halil Kelebek,Linnea Wolniewicz,Michael Vergalla,Madhulika Guhathakurta,Umaa Rebbapragada,Bala Poduval,Atılım Güneş Baydin,Frank Soboczenski*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT)–based framework for forecasting sparse ionospheric total electron content (TEC) up to 24 hours ahead, integrating solar irradiance, geomagnetic indices, and GNSS-derived TEC; achieves RMSE ~3.33 TECU and offers attention-based interpretability; released as open-source toolkit 'ionopy'.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate TEC forecasting is challenging due to nonlinear solar–geomagnetic–thermospheric coupling, sparse global measurements, and poor empirical models, especially during strong space weather.

Method: A TFT-based forecasting framework that ingests heterogeneous inputs (solar irradiance, geomagnetic indices, GNSS vertical TEC), with preprocessing and temporal alignment; trained/evaluated on 2010–2025 data; interpretable via attention analysis; open-source implementation 'ionopy'.

Result: The model provides robust TEC forecasts up to 24 hours ahead, achieving RMSE as low as 3.33 TECU; solar EUV irradiance emerges as the strongest predictive signal; attention analysis enables interpretability for operational and scientific use.

Conclusion: Demonstrates accurate, interpretable TEC forecasting under sparse data and space weather conditions; supports operational GNSS and space-weather applications; promotes reproducibility through open-source release.

Abstract: The ionosphere critically influences Global Navigation Satellite Systems
(GNSS), satellite communications, and Low Earth Orbit (LEO) operations, yet
accurate prediction of its variability remains challenging due to nonlinear
couplings between solar, geomagnetic, and thermospheric drivers. Total Electron
Content (TEC), a key ionospheric parameter, is derived from GNSS observations,
but its reliable forecasting is limited by the sparse nature of global
measurements and the limited accuracy of empirical models, especially during
strong space weather conditions. In this work, we present a machine learning
framework for ionospheric TEC forecasting that leverages Temporal Fusion
Transformers (TFT) to predict sparse ionosphere data. Our approach accommodates
heterogeneous input sources, including solar irradiance, geomagnetic indices,
and GNSS-derived vertical TEC, and applies preprocessing and temporal alignment
strategies. Experiments spanning 2010-2025 demonstrate that the model achieves
robust predictions up to 24 hours ahead, with root mean square errors as low as
3.33 TECU. Results highlight that solar EUV irradiance provides the strongest
predictive signals. Beyond forecasting accuracy, the framework offers
interpretability through attention-based analysis, supporting both operational
applications and scientific discovery. To encourage reproducibility and
community-driven development, we release the full implementation as the
open-source toolkit \texttt{ionopy}.

### [446] [Disentangling Slow and Fast Temporal Dynamics in Degradation Inference with Hierarchical Differential Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00639)
*Mengjie Zhao,Olga Fink*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces Hierarchical Controlled Differential Equations (H-CDE) to disentangle degradation from operational dynamics, via slow-degradation and fast-operation CDEs, multi-scale integration, learnable path transformation, and a monotonicity regularizer; shows improved degradation inference over residual baselines across dynamic and steady-state systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Degradation is latent and slowly evolving; operational variability dominates sensor signals; residual-based methods entangle degradation with history and noise, especially in systems with dynamic responses; need a framework that separates slow degradation from fast operation.

Method: Propose H-CDE with two coupled CDE components (slow-degradation and fast-operation). Introduce multi-scale time integration to reduce numerical stiffness, a learnable path transformation to extract degradation drivers and control degradation evolution, and a monotonicity-enforcing activation function to regularize and disentangle degradation. Evaluate on dynamic (bridges) and steady-state (aero-engine) systems, comparing to residual-based baselines.

Result: H-CDE effectively disentangles degradation from operational dynamics, achieving more accurate, robust, and interpretable degradation inferences; outperforms residual-based methods in both dynamic and steady-state settings.

Conclusion: A scalable, principled framework for degradation inference under strong operational variability, applicable to prognostics and condition monitoring; the hierarchical CDE approach addresses stiffness and disentanglement, with broad applicability to engineering systems.

Abstract: Reliable inference of system degradation from sensor data is fundamental to
condition monitoring and prognostics in engineered systems. Since degradation
is rarely observable and measurable, it must be inferred to enable accurate
health assessment and decision-making. This is particularly challenging because
operational variations dominate system behavior, while degradation introduces
only subtle, long-term changes. Consequently, sensor data mainly reflect
short-term operational variability, making it difficult to disentangle the
underlying degradation process. Residual-based methods are widely employed, but
the residuals remain entangled with operational history, often resulting in
noisy and unreliable degradation estimation, particularly in systems with
dynamic responses. Neural Ordinary Equations (NODEs) offer a promising
framework for inferring latent dynamics, but the time-scale separation in
slow-fast systems introduces numerical stiffness and complicates training,
while degradation disentanglement remains difficult. To address these
limitations, we propose a novel Hierarchical Controlled Differential Equation
(H-CDE) framework that incorporates a slow (degradation) and a fast (operation)
CDE component in a unified architecture. It introduces three key innovations: a
multi-scale time integration scheme to mitigate numerical stiffness; a
learnable path transformation that extracts latent degradation drivers to
control degradation evolution; and a novel activation function that enforces
monotonicity on inferred degradation as a regularizer for disentanglement.
Through comprehensive evaluations on both dynamic response (e.g., bridges) and
steady state (e.g., aero-engine) systems, we demonstrate that H-CDE effectively
disentangles degradation from operational dynamics and outperforms
residual-based baselines, yielding more accurate, robust, and interpretable
inference.

### [447] [AMCR: A Framework for Assessing and Mitigating Copyright Risks in Generative Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00641)
*Zhipeng Yin,Zichong Wang,Avash Palikhe,Zhen Liu,Jun Liu,Wenbin Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AMCR is a framework for assessing and mitigating copyright risks in text-to-image generation, featuring prompt restructuring, attention-based infringement detection, and adaptive risk mitigation to maintain image quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generative text-to-image models raise copyright concerns due to reliance on large training data and potential replication of protected elements; existing prompt-based filters miss subtle forms of infringement; need a proactive, systematic safety framework for real-world deployment.

Method: Propose AMCR with three components: (1) restructure risky prompts into safe/non-sensitive forms, (2) use attention-based similarity analysis to detect partial infringements during generation, (3) adaptively mitigate risks during generation to reduce violations while preserving image quality.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate AMCR's effectiveness in revealing and mitigating latent copyright risks and provide practical insights and benchmarks for safer deployment.

Conclusion: AMCR offers a comprehensive, practical approach to copyright risk mitigation in generative models, enabling safer deployment without sacrificing output quality.

Abstract: Generative models have achieved impressive results in text to image tasks,
significantly advancing visual content creation. However, this progress comes
at a cost, as such models rely heavily on large-scale training data and may
unintentionally replicate copyrighted elements, creating serious legal and
ethical challenges for real-world deployment. To address these concerns,
researchers have proposed various strategies to mitigate copyright risks, most
of which are prompt based methods that filter or rewrite user inputs to prevent
explicit infringement. While effective in handling obvious cases, these
approaches often fall short in more subtle situations, where seemingly benign
prompts can still lead to infringing outputs. To address these limitations,
this paper introduces Assessing and Mitigating Copyright Risks (AMCR), a
comprehensive framework which i) builds upon prompt-based strategies by
systematically restructuring risky prompts into safe and non-sensitive forms,
ii) detects partial infringements through attention-based similarity analysis,
and iii) adaptively mitigates risks during generation to reduce copyright
violations without compromising image quality. Extensive experiments validate
the effectiveness of AMCR in revealing and mitigating latent copyright risks,
offering practical insights and benchmarks for the safer deployment of
generative models.

### [448] [Context-Action Embedding Learning for Off-Policy Evaluation in Contextual Bandits](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00648)
*Kushagra Chandak,Vincent Liu,Haanvid Lee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes CAEL-MIPS to learn context–action embeddings that minimize MSE of the MIPS estimator for off-policy evaluation in contextual bandits, outperforming baselines on synthetic and real data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: IPS provides unbiased OPE but has high variance in large or underexplored action spaces; MIPS reduces variance with action embeddings but ignores context and does not minimize MSE. There is a need to jointly optimize context-action representations to minimize MSE.

Method: Introduce CAEL-MIPS, an objective to learn context-action embeddings from offline data by minimizing the MSE of the MIPS estimator; builds on bias-variance analysis of MIPS to derive an MSE-minimizing objective and shows how embeddings are learned.

Result: Empirical studies on synthetic and real-world datasets show CAEL-MIPS achieves lower MSE than baselines, indicating improved OPE performance.

Conclusion: Context-action embedding learning tailored to MIPS can reduce estimator MSE in off-policy evaluation for contextual bandits and is effective in practice, particularly for large or underexplored action spaces.

Abstract: We consider off-policy evaluation (OPE) in contextual bandits with finite
action space. Inverse Propensity Score (IPS) weighting is a widely used method
for OPE due to its unbiased, but it suffers from significant variance when the
action space is large or when some parts of the context-action space are
underexplored. Recently introduced Marginalized IPS (MIPS) estimators mitigate
this issue by leveraging action embeddings. However, these embeddings do not
minimize the mean squared error (MSE) of the estimators and do not consider
context information. To address these limitations, we introduce Context-Action
Embedding Learning for MIPS, or CAEL-MIPS, which learns context-action
embeddings from offline data to minimize the MSE of the MIPS estimator.
Building on the theoretical analysis of bias and variance of MIPS, we present
an MSE-minimizing objective for CAEL-MIPS. In the empirical studies on a
synthetic dataset and a real-world dataset, we demonstrate that our estimator
outperforms baselines in terms of MSE.

*Tin Luu,Binh Nguyen,Man Ngo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: An NCA-inspired imputation method for tabular missing data that shows competitive performance against state-of-the-art approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Missing values in tabular data pose a long-standing challenge; while VAEs/GANs have been explored for imputation, Neural Cellular Automata (NCA) have been overlooked, despite potential modeling advantages.

Method: Adapt and apply an NCA-based model for imputing missing data, with suitable adaptations; train and evaluate on datasets with missingness; compare against existing imputation methods to assess imputation error and downstream task performance.

Result: Experiments indicate the proposed NCA-based imputation method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both imputation error and post-imputation performance.

Conclusion: NCA-based imputation is a viable and competitive approach for missing data in tabular datasets, offering a novel direction beyond traditional generative models.

Abstract: When working with tabular data, missingness is always one of the most painful
problems. Throughout many years, researchers have continuously explored better
and better ways to impute missing data. Recently, with the rapid development
evolution in machine learning and deep learning, there is a new trend of
leveraging generative models to solve the imputation task. While the imputing
version of famous models such as Variational Autoencoders or Generative
Adversarial Networks were investigated, prior work has overlooked Neural
Cellular Automata (NCA), a powerful computational model. In this paper, we
propose a novel imputation method that is inspired by NCA. We show that, with
some appropriate adaptations, an NCA-based model is able to address the missing
data imputation problem. We also provide several experiments to evidence that
our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of imputation error and
post-imputation performance.

Conclusion: IndiaWeatherBench provides a reusable foundation for regional weather forecasting research, enabling fair comparisons and extensibility to other regions through open data and tools.

Abstract: Regional weather forecasting is a critical problem for localized climate
adaptation, disaster mitigation, and sustainable development. While machine
learning has shown impressive progress in global weather forecasting, regional
forecasting remains comparatively underexplored. Existing efforts often use
different datasets and experimental setups, limiting fair comparison and
reproducibility. We introduce IndiaWeatherBench, a comprehensive benchmark for
data-driven regional weather forecasting focused on the Indian subcontinent.
IndiaWeatherBench provides a curated dataset built from high-resolution
regional reanalysis products, along with a suite of deterministic and
probabilistic metrics to facilitate consistent training and evaluation. To
establish strong baselines, we implement and evaluate a range of models across
diverse architectures, including UNets, Transformers, and Graph-based networks,
as well as different boundary conditioning strategies and training objectives.
While focused on India, IndiaWeatherBench is easily extensible to other
geographic regions. We open-source all raw and preprocessed datasets, model
implementations, and evaluation pipelines to promote accessibility and future
development. We hope IndiaWeatherBench will serve as a foundation for advancing
regional weather forecasting research. Code is available at

*Binghang Lu,Changhong Mou,Guang Lin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes an evolutionary multi-objective optimization framework for a Replica-Exchange-based Physics-informed Operator Learning Network to solve parametric PDEs, achieving higher accuracy, noise robustness, and Bayesian uncertainty quantification, with experiments on Burgers and a time-fractional diffusion–wave equation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address core limitations of physics-informed neural networks and operator learning methods: difficulty balancing operator and physics losses, sensitivity to noisy or sparse data, and lack of reliable uncertainty quantification; aim to enable accurate forward/inverse solvers with minimal data.

Method: Integrates three components: (1) evolutionary multi-objective optimization to adaptively balance operator and physics losses along the Pareto front; (2) replica-exchange stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics to enhance global exploration and accelerate convergence; (3) built-in Bayesian uncertainty quantification via stochastic sampling.

Result: The framework consistently outperforms standard operator learning methods in accuracy, robustness to noise, and capability to quantify uncertainty across tested problems.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively tackles loss-balance, robustness, and uncertainty quantification challenges in operator learning for parametric PDEs, offering improved forward/inverse solutions with limited data.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose an evolutionary Multi-objective Optimization for
Replica-Exchange-based Physics-informed Operator learning Network, which is a
novel operator learning network to efficiently solve parametric partial
differential equations. In forward and inverse settings, this operator learning
network only admits minimum requirement of noisy observational data. While
physics-informed neural networks and operator learning approaches such as Deep
Operator Networks and Fourier Neural Operators offer promising alternatives to
traditional numerical solvers, they struggle with balancing operator and
physics losses, maintaining robustness under noisy or sparse data, and
providing uncertainty quantification. The proposed framework addresses these
limitations by integrating: (i) evolutionary multi-objective optimization to
adaptively balance operator and physics-based losses in the Pareto front; (ii)
replica exchange stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics to improve global
parameter-space exploration and accelerate convergence; and (iii) built-in
Bayesian uncertainty quantification from stochastic sampling. The proposed
operator learning method is tested numerically on several different problems
including one-dimensional Burgers equation and the time-fractional mixed
diffusion-wave equation. The results indicate that our framework consistently
outperforms the general operator learning methods in accuracy, noise
robustness, and the ability to quantify uncertainty.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: VECTOR+ is a property-guided, contrastive-learning–driven framework for targeted molecular optimization under low data, achieving novel, synthetically tractable ligands with strong docking and MD stability, outperforming JT-VAE and MolGPT on PD-L1 and kinase targets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome data scarcity in drug discovery to steer generative models toward pharmacologically relevant chemical space; provide interpretable, data-efficient exploration of functional space.

Method: Integrates property-guided representation learning (contrastive) with controllable molecule generation; applicable to regression/classification; evaluates on PD-L1 inhibitor set (296 IC50 values) and kinase inhibitor set (2,056 molecules by binding mode); benchmarks docking; uses MD validation; compares to JT-VAE and MolGPT.

Result: Generates 8,374 candidates; 100 exceed docking threshold of -15.0 kcal/mol; best at -17.6 kcal/mol vs top reference -15.4; preserves biphenyl pharmacophore with novel motifs; MD 250 ns shows ligand RMSD < 2.5 Å; generalizes to kinase inhibitors with stronger docking than brigatinib/sorafenib; outperforms JT-VAE and MolGPT on docking, novelty, uniqueness, Tanimoto similarity.

Conclusion: VECTOR+ is a robust, extensible approach for property-conditioned molecular design in low-data settings, linking contrastive learning and generative modeling for reproducible AI-accelerated discovery; adaptable to broader pharmacological targets.

Abstract: Efficiently steering generative models toward pharmacologically relevant
regions of chemical space remains a major obstacle in molecular drug discovery
under low-data regimes. We present VECTOR+: Valid-property-Enhanced Contrastive
Learning for Targeted Optimization and Resampling, a framework that couples
property-guided representation learning with controllable molecule generation.
VECTOR+ applies to both regression and classification tasks and enables
interpretable, data-efficient exploration of functional chemical space. We
evaluate on two datasets: a curated PD-L1 inhibitor set (296 compounds with
experimental $IC_{50}$ values) and a receptor kinase inhibitor set (2,056
molecules by binding mode). Despite limited training data, VECTOR+ generates
novel, synthetically tractable candidates. Against PD-L1 (PDB 5J89), 100 of
8,374 generated molecules surpass a docking threshold of $-15.0$ kcal/mol, with
the best scoring $-17.6$ kcal/mol compared to the top reference inhibitor
($-15.4$ kcal/mol). The best-performing molecules retain the conserved biphenyl
pharmacophore while introducing novel motifs. Molecular dynamics (250 ns)
confirm binding stability (ligand RMSD < $2.5$ angstroms). VECTOR+ generalizes
to kinase inhibitors, producing compounds with stronger docking scores than
established drugs such as brigatinib and sorafenib. Benchmarking against JT-VAE
and MolGPT across docking, novelty, uniqueness, and Tanimoto similarity
highlights the superior performance of our method. These results position our
work as a robust, extensible approach for property-conditioned molecular design
in low-data settings, bridging contrastive learning and generative modeling for
reproducible, AI-accelerated discovery.

### [453] [DELTA: Variational Disentangled Learning for Privacy-Preserving Data Reprogramming](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00693)
*Arun Vignesh Malarkkan,Haoyue Bai,Anjali Kaushik,Yanjie Fu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A two-phase framework (DELTA) for privacy-preserving feature reprogramming that boosts task accuracy while reducing leakage of sensitive information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world data often contain identifiable or sensitive attributes and are subject to privacy regulations. Traditional feature engineering focuses on utility and can leak private information, necessitating methods that balance performance with privacy.

Method: Phase I uses policy-guided reinforcement learning to discover feature transformations that maximize downstream utility without considering privacy. Phase II uses a variational LSTM seq2seq with a utility-privacy disentangled latent space and adversarial-causal regularization to suppress privacy signals during feature generation.

Result: Evaluated on eight datasets, DELTA improves downstream predictive performance by approximately 9.3% and reduces privacy leakage by about 35%.

Conclusion: DELTA enables robust, privacy-aware data transformation by decoupling utility and privacy signals, yielding improved task performance with reduced privacy leakage.

Abstract: In real-world applications, domain data often contains identifiable or
sensitive attributes, is subject to strict regulations (e.g., HIPAA, GDPR), and
requires explicit data feature engineering for interpretability and
transparency. Existing feature engineering primarily focuses on advancing
downstream task performance, often risking privacy leakage. We generalize this
learning task under such new requirements as Privacy-Preserving Data
Reprogramming (PPDR): given a dataset, transforming features to maximize target
attribute prediction accuracy while minimizing sensitive attribute prediction
accuracy. PPDR poses challenges for existing systems: 1) generating
high-utility feature transformations without being overwhelmed by a large
search space, and 2) disentangling and eliminating sensitive information from
utility-oriented features to reduce privacy inferability. To tackle these
challenges, we propose DELTA, a two-phase variational disentangled generative
learning framework. Phase I uses policy-guided reinforcement learning to
discover feature transformations with downstream task utility, without any
regard to privacy inferability. Phase II employs a variational LSTM seq2seq
encoder-decoder with a utility-privacy disentangled latent space design and
adversarial-causal disentanglement regularization to suppress privacy signals
during feature generation. Experiments on eight datasets show DELTA improves
predictive performance by ~9.3% and reduces privacy leakage by ~35%,
demonstrating robust, privacy-aware data transformation.

*Osama Ahmad,Lukas Wesemann,Fabian Waschkowski,Zubair Khalid*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MAGN introduces an unfolded variational mode decomposition to a mode-adaptive graph network for spatiotemporal forecasting, achieving large speedups and substantial error reductions compared to VMGCN.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional graph neural networks struggle with spectral entanglement and volatile dynamics in spatiotemporal data. Variational mode graph convolutional networks (VMGCN) improve accuracy via signal decomposition but suffer from computational inefficiency and reliance on manual hyperparameters. There is a need for a trainable, efficient decomposition module to enable scalable, accurate forecasting.

Method: Introduce an unfolded variational mode decomposition (UVMD) module that replaces iterative optimization with a fixed-depth neural network, reducing decomposition time. Incorporate mode-specific learnable bandwidth constraints (α_k) to adapt to spatial heterogeneity and prevent spectral overlap, forming the mode adaptive graph network (MAGN) end-to-end.

Result: On LargeST (6,902 sensors, 241M observations), MAGN yields an 85-95% reduction in prediction error compared with VMGCN and achieves substantial performance gains over state-of-the-art baselines; decomposition time is reduced by ~250x for LargeST tests.

Conclusion: MAGN successfully stabilizes and accelerates spatiotemporal forecasting by substituting iterative decomposition with a trainable UVMD module and learnable bandwidths, reducing manual tuning while boosting accuracy; the approach scales to large sensor networks and may generalize to other domains requiring spectral decomposition.

Abstract: Accurate spatiotemporal forecasting is critical for numerous complex systems
but remains challenging due to complex volatility patterns and spectral
entanglement in conventional graph neural networks (GNNs). While
decomposition-integrated approaches like variational mode graph convolutional
network (VMGCN) improve accuracy through signal decomposition, they suffer from
computational inefficiency and manual hyperparameter tuning. To address these
limitations, we propose the mode adaptive graph network (MAGN) that transforms
iterative variational mode decomposition (VMD) into a trainable neural module.
Our key innovations include (1) an unfolded VMD (UVMD) module that replaces
iterative optimization with a fixed-depth network to reduce the decomposition
time (by 250x for the LargeST benchmark), and (2) mode-specific learnable
bandwidth constraints ({\alpha}k ) adapt spatial heterogeneity and eliminate
manual tuning while preventing spectral overlap. Evaluated on the LargeST
benchmark (6,902 sensors, 241M observations), MAGN achieves an 85-95% reduction
in the prediction error over VMGCN and outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.

*Renfei Zhang,Mohit Pandey,Artem Cherkasov,Martin Ester*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: BALD-GFlowNet is a scalable generative active learning method using GFlowNets to sample molecules by BALD reward, achieving pool-size independent scalability while matching BALD performance and increasing molecular diversity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pool-based active learning faces prohibitive computational costs on massive unlabeled datasets, especially in virtual screening of billions of compounds; BALD prioritizes informative samples but remains expensive; there is a need for scalable acquisition strategies.

Method: Replace pool-based acquisition with a GFlowNet that samples objects with probability proportional to BALD reward; BALD-GFlowNet directly samples molecules, avoiding evaluation of the full unlabeled pool; integrates BALD scoring with generative sampling.

Result: In virtual screening experiments, BALD-GFlowNet matches standard BALD performance while generating more structurally diverse molecules; scalability is independent of unlabeled pool size, enabling efficient exploration of large libraries.

Conclusion: BALD-GFlowNet offers a scalable, efficient approach for molecular discovery, enabling BALD-like informativeness with generative sampling; a promising direction for large-scale drug discovery.

Abstract: The scalability of pool-based active learning is limited by the computational
cost of evaluating large unlabeled datasets, a challenge that is particularly
acute in virtual screening for drug discovery. While active learning strategies
such as Bayesian Active Learning by Disagreement (BALD) prioritize informative
samples, it remains computationally intensive when scaled to libraries
containing billions samples. In this work, we introduce BALD-GFlowNet, a
generative active learning framework that circumvents this issue. Our method
leverages Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) to directly sample objects in
proportion to the BALD reward. By replacing traditional pool-based acquisition
with generative sampling, BALD-GFlowNet achieves scalability that is
independent of the size of the unlabeled pool. In our virtual screening
experiment, we show that BALD-GFlowNet achieves a performance comparable to
that of standard BALD baseline while generating more structurally diverse
molecules, offering a promising direction for efficient and scalable molecular
discovery.

*Jingtao Liu,Xinming Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TAAM is a replay-free, resource-efficient continual graph learning framework that uses per-task Neural Synapse Modulators (NSMs) inserted into a frozen GNN backbone to dynamically modulate computation, trained per task and frozen, with a prototype-guided strategy for training and inference. It achieves state-of-the-art performance on six GCIL datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address two main problems in continual graph learning: stability-plasticity dilemma and resource-heavy pre-training; aim to avoid replay and full-network fine-tuning by dynamic, lightweight modulation of a frozen backbone.

Method: Propose Task-Aware Adaptive Modulation (TAAM) using Neural Synapse Modulators (NSMs) inserted into a frozen GNN. Train NSMs per task, then freeze. Use prototype-guided strategy: deep-copy from similar past modulator to initialize a new NSM; during inference, select the most relevant NSM for each task.

Result: Extensive experiments show TAAM outperforms state-of-the-art methods across six GCIL benchmarks; code release promised.

Conclusion: TAAM demonstrates that replay-free, resource-efficient continual graph learning is achievable by learned, task-specific modulators that steer a frozen backbone, offering a new path beyond data replay and full fine-tuning.

Abstract: Continual Graph Learning(CGL)focuses on acquiring new knowledge while
retaining previously learned information, essential for real-world graph
applications. Current methods grapple with two main issues:1) The
Stability-Plasticity Dilemma: Replay-based methods often create an imbalance
between the Dilemma, while incurring significant storage costs.2) The
Resource-Heavy Pre-training: Leading replay-free methods critically depend on
extensively pre-trained backbones, this reliance imposes a substantial resource
burden.In this paper, we argue that the key to overcoming these challenges lies
not in replaying data or fine-tuning the entire network, but in dynamically
modulating the internal computational flow of a frozen backbone. We posit that
lightweight, task-specific modules can effectively steer a GNN's reasoning
process. Motivated by this insight, we propose Task-Aware Adaptive
Modulation(TAAM), a replay-free, resource-efficient approach that charts a new
path for navigating the stability-plasticity dilemma. TAAM's core is its Neural
Synapse Modulators(NSM), which are trained and then frozen for each task to
store expert knowledge. A pivotal prototype-guided strategy governs these
modulators: 1) For training, it initializes a new NSM by deep-copying from a
similar past modulator to boost knowledge transfer. 2) For inference, it
selects the most relevant frozen NSM for each task. These NSMs insert into a
frozen GNN backbone to perform fine-grained, node-attentive modulation of its
internal flow-different from the static perturbations of prior methods.
Extensive experiments show that TAAM comprehensively outperforms
state-of-the-art methods across six GCIL benchmark datasets. The code will be
released upon acceptance of the paper.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Enhanced DST-based attribute fusion classifier with selective Gaussian/GMM membership modeling and a BPA transformation from possibility distributions; also enriches evidential KNN with improved BPA generation. Demonstrates 4.84% average accuracy gain over the best existing evidential classifier with low variance on benchmark datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DST-based attribute fusion classifiers are limited by oversimplified membership functions and underutilization of the belief structure from BPA. A richer uncertainty representation and model selection strategy are needed to improve robustness in real-world multi-attribute classification.

Method: 1) Selective membership modeling using both single Gaussian and Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs); model selection guided by cross-validation and a tailored evaluation metric. 2) Transform possibility distributions into a BPA by combining simple BPAs derived from normalized possibility distributions, enabling richer uncertainty representation. 3) Apply the BPA generation method to evidential K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) to enhance uncertainty-aware decision-making.

Result: The proposed classifier achieves an average accuracy improvement of 4.84% over the best existing evidential classifier with low variance on benchmark datasets, outperforming both evidential and conventional ML classifiers.

Conclusion: The approach demonstrates superior effectiveness and robustness by leveraging a richer belief representation and adaptive membership modeling. It also extends the evidential KNN framework with enhanced BPA-based uncertainty handling, with strong empirical performance on benchmarks.

Abstract: Dempster-Shafer Theory (DST) provides a powerful framework for modeling
uncertainty and has been widely applied to multi-attribute classification
tasks. However, traditional DST-based attribute fusion-based classifiers suffer
from oversimplified membership function modeling and limited exploitation of
the belief structure brought by basic probability assignment (BPA), reducing
their effectiveness in complex real-world scenarios. This paper presents an
enhanced attribute fusion-based classifier that addresses these limitations
through two key innovations. First, we adopt a selective modeling strategy that
utilizes both single Gaussian and Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) for membership
function construction, with model selection guided by cross-validation and a
tailored evaluation metric. Second, we introduce a novel method to transform
the possibility distribution into a BPA by combining simple BPAs derived from
normalized possibility distributions, enabling a much richer and more flexible
representation of uncertain information. Furthermore, we apply the belief
structure-based BPA generation method to the evidential K-Nearest Neighbors
classifier, enhancing its ability to incorporate uncertainty information into
decision-making. Comprehensive experiments on benchmark datasets are conducted
to evaluate the performance of the proposed attribute fusion-based classifier
and the enhanced evidential K-Nearest Neighbors classifier in comparison with
both evidential classifiers and conventional machine learning classifiers. The
results demonstrate that our proposed classifier outperforms the best existing
evidential classifier, achieving an average accuracy improvement of 4.84%,
while maintaining low variance, thus confirming its superior effectiveness and
robustness.

*Arman Gupta,Govind Waghmare,Gaurav Oberoi,Nitish Srivastava*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Two scalable, permutation-equivariant GNNs (Poly and Dir-Poly) leverage high-degree polynomial feature learning and edge directionality to improve node classification on heterophilic graphs; Poly is strong across datasets, Dir-Poly yields state-of-the-art on graphs with directionality; benefits of directionality are dataset-dependent.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Heterophilic graphs violate the local homophily assumption, causing standard GNNs to underperform. Incorporating edge direction and higher-order feature interactions may increase effective homophily and expressive power.

Method: Poly: a polynomially expressive GAT baseline. Dir-Poly: extends Poly by separately aggregating incoming and outgoing edges. Both learn permutation-equivariant high-degree polynomials over input features and are designed to be scalable with no added time complexity.

Result: Poly consistently outperforms existing baselines on five heterophilic datasets. Dir-Poly provides additional gains on graphs with inherent directionality (e.g., Roman Empire), achieving state-of-the-art results. On undirected graphs, artificially introducing directionality does not always help.

Conclusion: Directionality and expressive feature modeling play complementary roles in heterophilic graph learning, with the benefit of directional message passing being dataset/context dependent.

Abstract: In heterophilic graphs, where neighboring nodes often belong to different
classes, conventional Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) struggle due to their
reliance on local homophilous neighborhoods. Prior studies suggest that
modeling edge directionality in such graphs can increase effective homophily
and improve classification performance. Simultaneously, recent work on
polynomially expressive GNNs shows promise in capturing higher-order
interactions among features. In this work, we study the combined effect of edge
directionality and expressive message passing on node classification in
heterophilic graphs. Specifically, we propose two architectures: (1) a
polynomially expressive GAT baseline (Poly), and (2) a direction-aware variant
(Dir-Poly) that separately aggregates incoming and outgoing edges. Both models
are designed to learn permutation-equivariant high-degree polynomials over
input features, while remaining scalable with no added time complexity.
Experiments on five benchmark heterophilic datasets show that our Poly model
consistently outperforms existing baselines, and that Dir-Poly offers
additional gains on graphs with inherent directionality (e.g., Roman Empire),
achieving state-of-the-art results. Interestingly, on undirected graphs,
introducing artificial directionality does not always help, suggesting that the
benefit of directional message passing is context-dependent. Our findings
highlight the complementary roles of edge direction and expressive feature
modeling in heterophilic graph learning.

*Jakob De Moor,Hans Weytjens,Johannes De Smedt*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ProCause enhances the evaluation of Prescriptive Process Monitoring by combining multiple causal inference architectures with both sequential and non-sequential models to handle temporal dependencies, outperforming single-model baselines like TARNet in both simulated and real-world data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Evaluating PresPM is challenging due to missing ground-truth outcomes for intervention actions. RealCause relies on a single CI model (TARNet) and ignores temporal dependencies, limiting reliability. There's a need for a generative, flexible framework that models temporal dynamics and combines multiple CI approaches.

Method: ProCause supports both sequential (e.g., LSTMs) and non-sequential models for estimating intervention outcomes, and integrates multiple CI learners (S-Learner, T-Learner, TARNet, plus an ensemble). It uses a simulator with known ground truths to assess performance and validates findings with real-world data analyses.

Result: An ensemble of CI models provides more consistent and reliable evaluations than any single model, including TARNet. LSTMs offer improvements when temporal dependencies exist. TARNet is not universally the best choice. ProCause yields more robust evaluation results in simulated settings and shows practical effectiveness on real data.

Conclusion: A flexible, generative evaluation framework (ProCause) that incorporates both sequential/non-sequential models and multiple CI architectures improves PresPM evaluation accuracy and reliability, guiding better policy design for real-time interventions.

Abstract: Prescriptive Process Monitoring (PresPM) is the subfield of Process Mining
that focuses on optimizing processes through real-time interventions based on
event log data. Evaluating PresPM methods is challenging due to the lack of
ground-truth outcomes for all intervention actions in datasets. A generative
deep learning approach from the field of Causal Inference (CI), RealCause, has
been commonly used to estimate the outcomes for proposed intervention actions
to evaluate a new policy. However, RealCause overlooks the temporal
dependencies in process data, and relies on a single CI model architecture,
TARNet, limiting its effectiveness. To address both shortcomings, we introduce
ProCause, a generative approach that supports both sequential (e.g., LSTMs) and
non-sequential models while integrating multiple CI architectures (S-Learner,
T-Learner, TARNet, and an ensemble). Our research using a simulator with known
ground truths reveals that TARNet is not always the best choice; instead, an
ensemble of models offers more consistent reliability, and leveraging LSTMs
shows potential for improved evaluations when temporal dependencies are
present. We further validate ProCause's practical effectiveness through a
real-world data analysis, ensuring a more reliable evaluation of PresPM
methods.

*Noorain Mukhtiar,Adnan Mahmood,Quan Z. Sheng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A comprehensive survey of fairness in federated learning, analyzing bias sources, mitigation techniques, evaluation metrics, and future research directions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Federated Learning enables privacy-preserving, collaborative model training across multiple clients, but fairness is hindered by heterogeneity among data, clients, and models, leading to biased predictions, reduced accuracy, and slower convergence.

Method: Systematic literature review and synthesis that categorize bias types (data, client, model), summarize fairness notions and theoretical underpinnings, evaluate mitigation techniques, discuss evaluation metrics, and outline open research directions across multidisciplinary FL applications.

Result: Provides a detailed taxonomy of fairness notions, bias sources, and mitigation strategies; assesses strengths/limitations of existing approaches; surveys evaluation metrics; and highlights gaps and promising future directions for fairer FL.

Conclusion: Achieving fairer FL requires addressing heterogeneity-induced biases; the survey lays a foundational framework, clarifies theoretical and practical aspects, and proposes future research avenues to advance fairness in FL.

Abstract: At the intersection of the cutting-edge technologies and privacy concerns,
Federated Learning (FL) with its distributed architecture, stands at the
forefront in a bid to facilitate collaborative model training across multiple
clients while preserving data privacy. However, the applicability of FL systems
is hindered by fairness concerns arising from numerous sources of heterogeneity
that can result in biases and undermine a system's effectiveness, with skewed
predictions, reduced accuracy, and inefficient model convergence. This survey
thus explores the diverse sources of bias, including but not limited to, data,
client, and model biases, and thoroughly discusses the strengths and
limitations inherited within the array of the state-of-the-art techniques
utilized in the literature to mitigate such disparities in the FL training
process. We delineate a comprehensive overview of the several notions,
theoretical underpinnings, and technical aspects associated with fairness and
their adoption in FL-based multidisciplinary environments. Furthermore, we
examine salient evaluation metrics leveraged to measure fairness
quantitatively. Finally, we envisage exciting open research directions that
have the potential to drive future advancements in achieving fairer FL
frameworks, in turn, offering a strong foundation for future research in this
pivotal area.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: An interpretable ML pipeline (RF, XGBoost, SVM) for driving style classification using CARLA-Drive, achieving 0.92 accuracy and SHAP-based explanations to enable personalized safety recommendations, matching DL performance with greater transparency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve road safety, efficiency, and personalized user experience in automotive AI while addressing the lack of interpretability in deep learning models.

Method: Introduce CARLA-Drive dataset; compare RF, Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and SVM; apply SHAP explanations for interpretability; provide personalized driving safety recommendations; emphasize lightweight and practical deployment.

Result: Achieves 0.92 accuracy on a three-class task with RF and XGBoost; performance comparable to DL models; SHAP provides interpretable insights; suitable for real-world ITS deployment.

Conclusion: Demonstrates that accurate, interpretable ML models can match DL performance in driving style classification and enhance trust and practicality for deployment in intelligent transportation systems.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly used in the automotive industry
for applications such as driving style classification, which aims to improve
road safety, efficiency, and personalize user experiences. While deep learning
(DL) models, such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, excel at this
task, their black-box nature limits interpretability and trust. This paper
proposes a machine learning (ML)-based method that balances high accuracy with
interpretability. We introduce a high-quality dataset, CARLA-Drive, and
leverage ML techniques like Random Forest (RF), Gradient Boosting (XGBoost),
and Support Vector Machine (SVM), which are efficient, lightweight, and
interpretable. In addition, we apply the SHAP (Shapley Additive Explanations)
explainability technique to provide personalized recommendations for safer
driving. Achieving an accuracy of 0.92 on a three-class classification task
with both RF and XGBoost classifiers, our approach matches DL models in
performance while offering transparency and practicality for real-world
deployment in intelligent transportation systems.

*Emmanuel Jehanno,Romain Menegaux,Julien Mairal,Sergei Grudinin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SinkFast: a differentiable Sinkhorn-based loss for molecular assembly that is permutation-invariant and outperforms flow-matching on COD-Cluster17.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Predicting the 3D crystal structures of organic materials remains a challenging problem; existing state-of-the-art flow-matching approaches are computationally expensive. There is a need for an efficient, geometry-aware, permutation-invariant loss.

Method: Introduce a differentiable linear assignment scheme based on the Sinkhorn algorithm to create a permutation-invariant loss over a set of identical rigid molecules; apply this loss to simple regression (SinkFast).

Result: Regression with SinkFast significantly outperforms more complex flow-matching methods on the COD-Cluster17 benchmark.

Conclusion: A simple, differentiable, permutation-invariant Sinkhorn-based loss effectively improves molecular assembly-based crystal structure prediction and offers a lighter alternative to flow-matching approaches.

Abstract: Crystalline structure prediction remains an open challenge in materials
design. Despite recent advances in computational materials science, accurately
predicting the three-dimensional crystal structures of organic materials--an
essential first step for designing materials with targeted properties--remains
elusive. In this work, we address the problem of molecular assembly, where a
set $\mathcal{S}$ of identical rigid molecules is packed to form a crystalline
structure. Existing state-of-the-art models typically rely on computationally
expensive, iterative flow-matching approaches. We propose a novel loss function
that correctly captures key geometric molecular properties while maintaining
permutation invariance over $\mathcal{S}$. We achieve this via a differentiable
linear assignment scheme based on the Sinkhorn algorithm. Remarkably, we show
that even a simple regression using our method {\em SinkFast} significantly
outperforms more complex flow-matching approaches on the COD-Cluster17
benchmark, a curated subset of the Crystallography Open Database (COD).

### [463] [Causal SHAP: Feature Attribution with Dependency Awareness through Causal Discovery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00846)
*Woon Yee Ng,Li Rong Wang,Siyuan Liu,Xiuyi Fan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Causal SHAP combines SHAP with PC discovery and IDA causal strength to separate causal from correlational feature attributions, mitigating SHAP's misattribution due to correlated features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SHAP struggles to distinguish causality from correlation, leading to misleading attributions in high-stakes domains; there is a need for causal-aware explanations, especially in healthcare.

Method: Integrate the PC algorithm for causal discovery with the IDA algorithm to quantify causal strengths, then adjust SHAP-based attributions to reflect causal relationships—reducing scores for non-causal correlated features while preserving SHAP-like properties.

Result: Empirical validation on synthetic and real-world datasets shows attribution reductions for merely correlated features and improved differentiation between causal and correlated features, supporting practical utility in XAI.

Conclusion: Provides a practical, causal-aware attribution framework that preserves SHAP's useful properties while addressing its causal limitations, with particular value for healthcare and other high-stakes domains.

Abstract: Explaining machine learning (ML) predictions has become crucial as ML models
are increasingly deployed in high-stakes domains such as healthcare. While
SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) is widely used for model interpretability,
it fails to differentiate between causality and correlation, often
misattributing feature importance when features are highly correlated. We
propose Causal SHAP, a novel framework that integrates causal relationships
into feature attribution while preserving many desirable properties of SHAP. By
combining the Peter-Clark (PC) algorithm for causal discovery and the
Intervention Calculus when the DAG is Absent (IDA) algorithm for causal
strength quantification, our approach addresses the weakness of SHAP.
Specifically, Causal SHAP reduces attribution scores for features that are
merely correlated with the target, as validated through experiments on both
synthetic and real-world datasets. This study contributes to the field of
Explainable AI (XAI) by providing a practical framework for causal-aware model
explanations. Our approach is particularly valuable in domains such as
healthcare, where understanding true causal relationships is critical for
informed decision-making.

*Xinzhe Zheng,Zhen-Qun Yang,Jiannong Cao,Jiabei Cheng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Semi-supervised multi-modal TalentPredictor predicts seven talent types in secondary students using offline data, achieving 0.908 accuracy and ROC-AUC; addresses early talent identification beyond academics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Identify diverse non-academic talents early; current talent ID methods rely on manual processes and focus on academic achievement, delaying intervention; opportunity for early support in secondary education.

Method: Proposes TalentPredictor, a semi-supervised multi-modal neural network integrating Transformer, LSTM, and ANN; clusters award records into talent categories; extracts features from students' learning behaviors; trained on 1,041 offline local secondary students.

Result: Achieves 0.908 classification accuracy and 0.908 ROC-AUC on the offline dataset.

Conclusion: Demonstrates potential of machine learning to identify diverse talents early in student development and enable timely interventions.

Abstract: Talent identification plays a critical role in promoting student development.
However, traditional approaches often rely on manual processes or focus
narrowly on academic achievement, and typically delaying intervention until the
higher education stage. This oversight overlooks diverse non-academic talents
and misses opportunities for early intervention. To address this gap, this
study introduces TalentPredictor, a novel semi-supervised multi-modal neural
network that combines Transformer, LSTM, and ANN architectures. This model is
designed to predict seven different talent types--academic, sport, art,
leadership, service, technology, and others--in secondary school students
within an offline educational setting. Drawing on existing offline educational
data from 1,041 local secondary students, TalentPredictor overcomes the
limitations of traditional talent identification methods. By clustering various
award records into talent categories and extracting features from students'
diverse learning behaviors, it achieves high prediction accuracy (0.908
classification accuracy, 0.908 ROCAUC). This demonstrates the potential of
machine learning to identify diverse talents early in student development.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the need for interpretable explanations in tabular data (finance/social sciences) and extends diffusion-based counterfactuals beyond computer vision, handling categorical features.

Method: Proposes a guided reverse process for categorical features via an approximation to the Gumbel-softmax distribution; analyzes the effect of temperature τ; derives a theoretical bound between Gumbel-softmax and the proposed distribution; evaluates on large-scale credit lending and other tabular datasets.

Result: Outperforms popular baselines in interpretability, diversity, instability, and validity; produces robust and realistic counterfactual explanations; demonstrates effectiveness on credit lending and other tabular datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed method provides more robust and realistic counterfactual explanations for tabular data and contributes theoretical insight through a distribution bound, with demonstrated superiority over existing baselines in finance-related datasets.

Abstract: Counterfactual explanations methods provide an important tool in the field of
{interpretable machine learning}. Recent advances in this direction have
focused on diffusion models to explain a deep classifier. However, these
techniques have predominantly focused on problems in computer vision. In this
paper, we focus on tabular data typical in finance and the social sciences and
propose a novel guided reverse process for categorical features based on an
approximation to the Gumbel-softmax distribution. Furthermore, we study the
effect of the temperature $\tau$ and derive a theoretical bound between the
Gumbel-softmax distribution and our proposed approximated distribution. We
perform experiments on several large-scale credit lending and other tabular
datasets, assessing their performance in terms of the quantitative measures of
interpretability, diversity, instability, and validity. These results indicate
that our approach outperforms popular baseline methods, producing robust and
realistic counterfactual explanations.

TL;DR: GP-guided auto-encoder for counterfactuals with a density estimator and regularization-rate selection, yielding diverse, in-distribution counterfactuals with fewer parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Explainable ML in high-stakes settings requires counterfactual explanations that are both in-distribution and diverse, while avoiding overfitting; leverages Gaussian processes to shape the auto-encoder and density estimation to guide sampling.

Method: Construct an auto-encoder architecture guided by a Gaussian process; introduce a novel density estimator to identify in-distribution samples; develop an algorithm to select the optimal regularization rate of the density estimator while searching for counterfactuals; evaluate on large-scale tabular datasets and compare with other auto-encoder-based methods.

Result: The method can generate diversified and in-distribution counterfactual samples and demonstrates competitive performance against existing auto-encoder-based approaches on large tabular datasets.

Conclusion: A GP-guided auto-encoder with a density estimator and regularization-rate selection effectively produces diverse, in-distribution counterfactual explanations with fewer parameters, addressing overfitting and scalability concerns in explainable ML.

Abstract: Explainable machine learning has attracted much interest in the community
where the stakes are high. Counterfactual explanations methods have become an
important tool in explaining a black-box model. The recent advances have
leveraged the power of generative models such as an autoencoder. In this paper,
we propose a novel method using a Gaussian process to construct the
auto-encoder architecture for generating counterfactual samples. The resulting
model requires fewer learnable parameters and thus is less prone to
overfitting. We also introduce a novel density estimator that allows for
searching for in-distribution samples. Furthermore, we introduce an algorithm
for selecting the optimal regularization rate on density estimator while
searching for counterfactuals. We experiment with our method in several
large-scale tabular datasets and compare with other auto-encoder-based methods.
The results show that our method is capable of generating diversified and
in-distribution counterfactual samples.

*Aman Sharma,Saeed Najafi,Parsa Farinneya,Benyamin Jamialahmadi,Marzieh S. Tahaei,Yuhe Fan,Mehdi Rezagholizadeh,Boxing Chen,Aref Jafari*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DTRNet speeds up Transformers by routing only a small subset of tokens to full attention while keeping lightweight updates for the rest.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reduce the quadratic cost of self-attention in Transformers, enabling efficient processing of long sequences without sacrificing accuracy.

Method: Introduce Dynamic Token Routing Network (DTRNet) that preserves the MLP module and routes only about 10% of tokens through full attention per layer. The remaining tokens receive linear updates, effectively decoupling token updates from attention. DTRNet compares against routing-based layer-skipping methods like MoD and D-LLM and demonstrates reduced FLOPs with maintained performance.

Result: DTRNet achieves comparable performance to a full Transformer at markedly lower FLOPs by routing fewer tokens to full attention (~10%). It outperforms routing-based methods in accuracy and memory at matched FLOPs, and its efficiency scales with sequence length, yielding larger FLOP reductions on long-context inputs.

Conclusion: Decoupling token updates from attention significantly reduces the quadratic component of Transformer computation, providing a simple, efficient, and scalable alternative for long-context processing.

Abstract: Transformers achieve state-of-the-art results across many tasks, but their
uniform application of quadratic self-attention to every token at every layer
makes them computationally expensive. We introduce DTRNet (Dynamic Token
Routing Network), an improved Transformer architecture that allows tokens to
dynamically skip the quadratic cost of cross-token mixing while still receiving
lightweight linear updates. By preserving the MLP module and reducing the
attention cost for most tokens to linear, DTRNet ensures that every token is
explicitly updated while significantly lowering overall computation. This
design offers an efficient and effective alternative to standard dense
attention. Once trained, DTRNet blocks routes only ~10% of tokens through
attention at each layer while maintaining performance comparable to a full
Transformer. It consistently outperforms routing-based layer skipping methods
such as MoD and D-LLM in both accuracy and memory at matched FLOPs, while
routing fewer tokens to full attention. Its efficiency gains, scales with
sequence length, offering significant reduction in FLOPs for long-context
inputs. By decoupling token updates from attention mixing, DTRNet substantially
reduces the quadratic share of computation, providing a simple, efficient, and
scalable alternative to Transformers.

### [468] [Superposition in Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00928)
*Lukas Pertl,Han Xuanyuan,Pietro Liò*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper analyzes how GNN architectural choices (width, pooling, depth) shape distributed latent representations, focusing on feature superposition and overlap in GCN/GIN/GAT, and shows how topology and pooling affect axis alignment, with implications for interpretable design.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Interpreting GNNs is difficult because message passing blends signals; the study seeks to quantify how multiple features share latent directions and how architecture controls this geometry.

Method: Controlled experiments across GCN, GIN, and GAT. Features are extracted as (i) graph-level class-conditional centroids and (ii) node-level linear-probe directions. Geometry is analyzed with simple, basis-invariant diagnostics to measure overlap and alignment.

Result: Width affects overlap with a phase-like pattern; topology can imprint overlap on node features; pooling partially remixes node signals into task-relevant graph axes; sharper pooling increases axis alignment and reduces channel sharing; shallow models can converge to metastable low-rank embeddings.

Conclusion: Representational geometry links to design choices (width, pooling, final activations) and suggests practical routes for more interpretable GNNs by controlling how signals align in latent space.

Abstract: Interpreting graph neural networks (GNNs) is difficult because message
passing mixes signals and internal channels rarely align with human concepts.
We study superposition, the sharing of directions by multiple features,
directly in the latent space of GNNs. Using controlled experiments with
unambiguous graph concepts, we extract features as (i) class-conditional
centroids at the graph level and (ii) linear-probe directions at the node
level, and then analyze their geometry with simple basis-invariant diagnostics.
Across GCN/GIN/GAT we find: increasing width produces a phase pattern in
overlap; topology imprints overlap onto node-level features that pooling
partially remixes into task-aligned graph axes; sharper pooling increases axis
alignment and reduces channel sharing; and shallow models can settle into
metastable low-rank embeddings. These results connect representational geometry
with concrete design choices (width, pooling, and final-layer activations) and
suggest practical approaches for more interpretable GNNs.

### [469] [SCOUT: Toward Sub-Quadratic Attention via Segment Compression for Optimized Utility in Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00935)
*Aref Jafari,Yuhe Fan,Benyamin Jamialahmadi,Parsa Farinneya,Boxing Chen,Marzieh S. Tahaei*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SCOUT is a hybrid Transformer that compresses token history per fixed segments and attends to a small set of compressed checkpoint tokens, combining linear local mixers (Mamba/SWA) with sparse attention to achieve sub-quadratic complexity while preserving expressivity. It outperforms strong long-sequence baselines under the same budget and matches full-attention transformers on key tasks at large scales, with higher throughput than state-of-the-art models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the quadratic attention bottleneck in Transformers for long sequences, while maintaining performance; linear models (Mamba/SWA) are efficient but risk losing distant information, so a method that preserves historic detail with controlled compression is sought.

Method: 1) Enrich each token via a local linear mixer (Mamba or SWA) to integrate recent context. 2) Segment history into fixed-size chunks and locally compress tokens within each segment. 3) Have each token attend sparsely to a small number of compressed checkpoint tokens that summarize the input history, instead of attending to all prior tokens. 4) Analyze computational/memory efficiency and evaluate on long-context language modeling and reasoning tasks, comparing Mamba and SWA variants.

Result: SCOUT with both Mamba and SWA mixers outperforms strong long-sequence baselines under the same computational budget, matches full-attention Transformers on language modeling and common-sense reasoning tasks at scales of 400M and 1.3B parameters, and achieves higher end-to-end throughput than SOTA models while delivering comparable results on long-sequence benchmarks.

Conclusion: SCOUT offers a practical path to scalable long-context modeling by blending local mixing with segment-level compression and sparse attention to history summaries, achieving sub-quadratic growth and near full-attention performance; it preserves expressivity with only modest memory overhead compared to purely linear models, and opens avenues for further exploration across tasks and mixers.

Abstract: Transformers have demonstrated strong performance across a wide range of
sequence modeling tasks, but their quadratic attention complexity limits
scalability to long sequences. Linear models such as Mamba and sliding-window
attention (SWA) address this by mixing tokens through recurrent or localized
operations with fixed-size memory, achieving efficient inference. However,
these methods risk degrading performance on long sequences due to their
inability to retain detailed information from distant tokens. We propose SCOUT
(Segment Compression for Optimized Utility in Transformers), a hybrid
architecture that compresses tokens locally within fixed-size segments and
applies attention only over these compressed representations. Each token
embedding is first enriched via a linear local mixer, Mamba or SWA, that
integrates recent context. Then, instead of attending to all previous tokens,
each token sparsely attends to a small number of compressed checkpoint tokens
that summarize the input history. This design retains much of the expressivity
of full attention while substantially reducing the computational and memory
cost. By attending to compressed history rather than all previous tokens, SCOUT
incurs slightly higher memory than purely linear models, but its growth rate
remains sub-quadratic and far more scalable than that of full Transformers. We
analyze SCOUT's computational and memory efficiency and evaluate it empirically
on long-context language modeling and reasoning tasks. SCOUT with both Mamba
and SWA mixers outperforms strong long-sequence baselines under the same
computational budget, matches full-attention Transformers on language modeling
and common-sense reasoning tasks at 400M and 1.3B scales. Moreover, our SCOUT
achieves higher end-to-end throughput than SOTA models, while delivering
comparable results on long sequence benchmarks.

*Arjun Basandrai,Shourya Jain,K. Ilanthenral*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ART introduces an adaptive, class-wise resampling scheme that uses periodic class macro F1 scores to rebalance data, outperforming standard resampling and algorithm-level methods with significant gains on tabular datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional resampling uses fixed distributions and ignores shifts in class-wise learning difficulty, which can hinder performance on imbalanced tasks.

Method: Adaptive Resampling-based Training (ART) periodically updates the resampling distribution based on class-wise macro F1 scores, addressing underperforming classes at the class level rather than relying on instance-level difficulty.

Result: ART consistently outperforms SMOTE, NearMiss, and Cost-sensitive Learning on binary and multi-class tasks across varying imbalance, with statistically significant gains on tabular data (p<0.05) and an average macro F1 improvement of 2.64 percentage points; results on text/image tasks remain favorable.

Conclusion: Class-level adaptive resampling via ART yields stronger and more reliable macro F1 performance across diverse tasks, making it a robust choice for imbalanced classification.

Abstract: Traditional resampling methods for handling class imbalance typically uses
fixed distributions, undersampling the majority or oversampling the minority.
These static strategies ignore changes in class-wise learning difficulty, which
can limit the overall performance of the model.
  This paper proposes an Adaptive Resampling-based Training (ART) method that
periodically updates the distribution of the training data based on the
class-wise performance of the model. Specifically, ART uses class-wise macro F1
scores, computed at fixed intervals, to determine the degree of resampling to
be performed.
  Unlike instance-level difficulty modeling, which is noisy and
outlier-sensitive, ART adapts at the class level. This allows the model to
incrementally shift its attention towards underperforming classes in a way that
better aligns with the optimization objective.
  Results on diverse benchmarks, including Pima Indians Diabetes and Yeast
dataset demonstrate that ART consistently outperforms both resampling-based and
algorithm-level methods, including Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique
(SMOTE), NearMiss Undersampling, and Cost-sensitive Learning on binary as well
as multi-class classification tasks with varying degrees of imbalance.
  In most settings, these improvements are statistically significant. On
tabular datasets, gains are significant under paired t-tests and Wilcoxon tests
(p < 0.05), while results on text and image tasks remain favorable. Compared to
training on the original imbalanced data, ART improves macro F1 by an average
of 2.64 percentage points across all tested tabular datasets. Unlike existing
methods, whose performance varies by task, ART consistently delivers the
strongest macro F1, making it a reliable choice for imbalanced classification.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: An online decentralized federated multi-task learning algorithm that uses cyber-physical trust signals to weight neighbor models, enabling personalization and resiliency when Byzantine clients dominate honest ones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses high data heterogeneity in federated learning and the need for model personalization in online, decentralized settings. Traditional Byzantine-resilient FL fails when Byzantine clients are not in the minority, but real systems can exploit cyber-physical cues to predict behavior and weight trusted information.

Method: Proposes an online decentralized federated multi-task learning algorithm that assigns a trust probability to neighbor models in each iteration using cyber-physical properties (e.g., received signal strength or side information) and uses these trust weights to combine local models for multi-task learning.

Result: Simulation results show the algorithm achieves performance close to a Byzantine-free setting, indicating strong resiliency and personalization even when Byzantine clients dominate.

Conclusion: Leveraging cyber-physical trust signals in online decentralized federated multi-task learning enables resiliency against dominating Byzantine clients while maintaining personalization, as demonstrated in simulations.

Abstract: Multi-task learning is an effective way to address the challenge of model
personalization caused by high data heterogeneity in federated learning.
However, extending multi-task learning to the online decentralized federated
learning setting is yet to be explored. The online decentralized federated
learning setting considers many real-world applications of federated learning,
such as autonomous systems, where clients communicate peer-to-peer and the data
distribution of each client is time-varying. A more serious problem in
real-world applications of federated learning is the presence of Byzantine
clients. Byzantine-resilient approaches used in federated learning work only
when the number of Byzantine clients is less than one-half the total number of
clients. Yet, it is difficult to put a limit on the number of Byzantine clients
within a system in reality. However, recent work in robotics shows that it is
possible to exploit cyber-physical properties of a system to predict clients'
behavior and assign a trust probability to received signals. This can help to
achieve resiliency in the presence of a dominating number of Byzantine clients.
Therefore, in this paper, we develop an online decentralized federated
multi-task learning algorithm to provide model personalization and resiliency
when the number of Byzantine clients dominates the number of honest clients.
Our proposed algorithm leverages cyber-physical properties, such as the
received signal strength in wireless systems or side information, to assign a
trust probability to local models received from neighbors in each iteration.
Our simulation results show that the proposed algorithm performs close to a
Byzantine-free setting.

TL;DR: Mixture of Expert Prompt Tuning (MEPT) uses a Mixture of Experts of prompt modules to adapt to non-stationary data distributions, improving fine-tuning efficiency and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Rigid fine-tuning parameter spaces limit flexible activation of neural pathways for diverse and evolving data; a dynamic, data-driven approach is needed to better align with target manifolds.

Method: Integrate multiple prompt experts within a Mixture of Experts framework to adaptively learn and route across diverse data distributions; reduce activated prompts; provide theoretical grounding in manifold learning and validate via neural activation pathway visualizations; release code.

Result: MEPT outperforms state-of-the-art parameter-efficient baselines on SuperGLUE, showing a mean accuracy improvement of about 1.94% and a substantial reduction in activated prompts by ~79.25%; supported by manifold-learning insights and activation visualizations.

Conclusion: MEPT offers an effective and efficient manifold-mapping framework for pretrain-then-finetune, with theoretical backing and practical efficiency; code is publicly available.

Abstract: Considering deep neural networks as manifold mappers, the
pretrain-then-fine-tune paradigm can be interpreted as a two-stage process:
pretrain establishes a broad knowledge base, and fine-tune adjusts the model
parameters to activate specific neural pathways to align with the target
manifold. Although prior fine-tuning approaches demonstrate success, their
rigid parameter space limits their ability to dynamically activate appropriate
neural pathways, rendering them ill-equipped to adapt flexibly to the diverse
and evolving data distributions. In light of this view, we propose a novel
approach, Mixture of Expert Prompt Tuning (MEPT), as an effective and efficient
manifold-mapping framework. MEPT leverages the Mixture of Experts architecture
by integrating multiple prompt experts to adaptively learn diverse and
non-stationary data distributions. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that MEPT
outperforms several state-of-the-art parameter efficient baselines on
SuperGLUE, achieving notable improvements in mean accuracy (e.g., 1.94%) while
significantly reducing activated prompts by 79.25%. The effectiveness of MEPT
is further supported by theoretical insights from manifold learning and
validated through neural activation pathway visualization results. Our code is
avaliable at https://github.com/runtsang/MEPT.

### [473] [Any-Order Flexible Length Masked Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01025)
*Jaeyeon Kim,Lee Cheuk-Kit,Carles Domingo-Enrich,Yilun Du,Sham Kakade,Timothy Ngotiaoco,Sitan Chen,Michael Albergo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FlexMDMs extend Masked Diffusion Models to variable-length sequences by inserting and unmasking tokens, preserving any-order inference. They match MDM perplexity, better model length statistics, and show significant gains in planning tasks, with feasible retrofit of pretrained MDMs using modest compute.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MDMs lack token insertions and are limited to fixed-length generations, hindering noncausal or length-flexible tasks. FlexMDMs aim to enable variable-length generation while keeping the parallel, any-order advantages of MDMs and allow leveraging existing MDMs.

Method: Extend the stochastic interpolant framework to discrete diffusion with insertable mask tokens. Generate sequences by inserting masks and unmasking them, thereby modeling flexible lengths. Demonstrate compatibility with pretrained MDMs via fine-tuning (e.g., LLaDA-8B) on modest compute (3 days on 16 H100s).

Result: Empirically, FlexMDMs match MDMs in perplexity and exhibit higher fidelity in modeling length statistics. On a synthetic maze planning task, they achieve about 60% higher success rate than MDM baselines. Retrofitting pretrained MDMs into FlexMDMs shows strong gains: GSM8K math performance improves from 58% to 67%, and code infilling from 52% to 65%.

Conclusion: FlexMDMs successfully restore a key limitation of MDMs (fixed length) by enabling flexible-length generation via mask insertion/unmasking, while retaining the benefits of any-order inference. They offer a practical path to leverage existing MDMs with modest compute to improve math and coding tasks.

Abstract: Masked diffusion models (MDMs) have recently emerged as a promising
alternative to autoregressive models over discrete domains. MDMs generate
sequences in an any-order, parallel fashion, enabling fast inference and strong
performance on non-causal tasks. However, a crucial limitation is that they do
not support token insertions and are thus limited to fixed-length generations.
To this end, we introduce Flexible Masked Diffusion Models (FlexMDMs), a
discrete diffusion paradigm that simultaneously can model sequences of flexible
length while provably retaining MDMs' flexibility of any-order inference.
Grounded in an extension of the stochastic interpolant framework, FlexMDMs
generate sequences by inserting mask tokens and unmasking them. Empirically, we
show that FlexMDMs match MDMs in perplexity while modeling length statistics
with much higher fidelity. On a synthetic maze planning task, they achieve
$\approx 60 \%$ higher success rate than MDM baselines. Finally, we show
pretrained MDMs can easily be retrofitted into FlexMDMs: on 16 H100s, it takes
only three days to fine-tune LLaDA-8B into a FlexMDM, achieving superior
performance on math (GSM8K, $58\% \to 67\%$) and code infilling performance
($52\% \to 65\%$).

### [474] [Learning to Coordinate: Distributed Meta-Trajectory Optimization Via Differentiable ADMM-DDP](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01630)
*Bingheng Wang,Yichao Gao,Tianchen Sun,Lin Zhao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Meta-learned hyperparameters for distributed ADMM-DDP (L2C) enable end-to-end differentiable, fast gradient computation and robust multi-agent coordination; demonstrated on cooperative aerial transport with up to 88% faster gradients.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hyperparameter tuning in distributed trajectory optimization is tightly coupled, task-specific, and hard to generalize across different agent configurations; there is a need for adaptive, fast, and provable optimization pipelines.

Method: Introduce Learning to Coordinate (L2C), a meta-learning framework where lightweight agent-wise neural networks output ADMM-DDP hyperparameters. The framework differentiates end-to-end through the distributed optimization, reuses DDP components (Riccati recursions, feedback gains) for efficient meta-gradient computation, and frames the gradient as the solution to distributed matrix-valued LQR problems coordinated via a convexifying auxiliary ADMM. Training accelerates via iteration truncation and meta-learning of ADMM penalties for rapid residual reduction, with Lipschitz-bounded gradient error guarantees.

Result: L2C yields dynamically feasible trajectories in high-fidelity simulation (IsaacSIM) for cooperative aerial transport, dynamically reconfigures quadrotor formations for safe 6-DoF load manipulation in tight spaces, and robustly handles varying team sizes and task conditions. It achieves up to 88% faster gradient computation compared with state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: L2C provides a general, efficient approach to learning hyperparameters for distributed trajectory optimization, enabling faster end-to-end training, robust multi-agent coordination, and better generalization across task variations.

Abstract: Distributed trajectory optimization via ADMM-DDP is a powerful approach for
coordinating multi-agent systems, but it requires extensive tuning of tightly
coupled hyperparameters that jointly govern local task performance and global
coordination. In this paper, we propose Learning to Coordinate (L2C), a general
framework that meta-learns these hyperparameters, modeled by lightweight
agent-wise neural networks, to adapt across diverse tasks and agent
configurations. L2C differentiates end-to-end through the ADMM-DDP pipeline in
a distributed manner. It also enables efficient meta-gradient computation by
reusing DDP components such as Riccati recursions and feedback gains. These
gradients correspond to the optimal solutions of distributed matrix-valued LQR
problems, coordinated across agents via an auxiliary ADMM framework that
becomes convex under mild assumptions. Training is further accelerated by
truncating iterations and meta-learning ADMM penalty parameters optimized for
rapid residual reduction, with provable Lipschitz-bounded gradient errors. On a
challenging cooperative aerial transport task, L2C generates dynamically
feasible trajectories in high-fidelity simulation using IsaacSIM, reconfigures
quadrotor formations for safe 6-DoF load manipulation in tight spaces, and
adapts robustly to varying team sizes and task conditions, while achieving up
to $88\%$ faster gradient computation than state-of-the-art methods.

### [475] [Reinforcement Learning Driven Generalizable Feature Representation for Cross-User Activity Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01031)
*Xiaozhou Ye,Kevin I-Kai Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes TPRL-DG: a reinforcement learning-based, temporal-preserving domain generalization framework for HAR that uses a Transformer autoregressive generator to craft temporal tokens, optimizing a multi-objective reward without target labels, achieving superior cross-user generalization on DSADS and PAMAP2.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cross-user variability in HAR arises from diverse motion patterns, sensor placements, and physiological traits, causing poor generalization for conventional supervised learning. Existing domain generalization methods often ignore temporal dependencies or rely on domain-specific labels.

Method: TPRL-DG treats feature extraction as sequential decision-making via reinforcement learning. It uses a Transformer-based autoregressive generator to produce temporal tokens that capture user-invariant activity dynamics. A multi-objective reward balances class discrimination with cross-user invariance, and the reward design is label-free (no target-user annotations).

Result: On DSADS and PAMAP2, TPRL-DG surpasses state-of-the-art methods in cross-user generalization, achieving higher accuracy without per-user calibration.

Conclusion: TPRL-DG learns robust, user-invariant temporal patterns, enabling scalable HAR systems for personalized healthcare, adaptive fitness tracking, and context-aware environments.

Abstract: Human Activity Recognition (HAR) using wearable sensors is crucial for
healthcare, fitness tracking, and smart environments, yet cross-user
variability -- stemming from diverse motion patterns, sensor placements, and
physiological traits -- hampers generalization in real-world settings.
Conventional supervised learning methods often overfit to user-specific
patterns, leading to poor performance on unseen users. Existing domain
generalization approaches, while promising, frequently overlook temporal
dependencies or depend on impractical domain-specific labels. We propose
Temporal-Preserving Reinforcement Learning Domain Generalization (TPRL-DG), a
novel framework that redefines feature extraction as a sequential
decision-making process driven by reinforcement learning. TPRL-DG leverages a
Transformer-based autoregressive generator to produce temporal tokens that
capture user-invariant activity dynamics, optimized via a multi-objective
reward function balancing class discrimination and cross-user invariance. Key
innovations include: (1) an RL-driven approach for domain generalization, (2)
autoregressive tokenization to preserve temporal coherence, and (3) a
label-free reward design eliminating the need for target user annotations.
Evaluations on the DSADS and PAMAP2 datasets show that TPRL-DG surpasses
state-of-the-art methods in cross-user generalization, achieving superior
accuracy without per-user calibration. By learning robust, user-invariant
temporal patterns, TPRL-DG enables scalable HAR systems, facilitating
advancements in personalized healthcare, adaptive fitness tracking, and
context-aware environments.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes MatPROV, a PROV-DM–based, graph‑structured dataset of synthesis procedures extracted from literature using LLMs, addressing rigid linear schemas and enabling machine‑interpretable, provenance‑rich synthesis knowledge for automated planning and optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Synthesis procedures strongly affect material properties, and data-driven discovery requires structured, expressive representations. Existing approaches rely on rigid schemas and assume linear sequences, failing to capture real-world complexity and causality in synthesis workflows.

Method: Adopts PROV-DM, a provenance standard, to model synthesis procedures as graphs. Constructs MatPROV, a PROV-DM‑compliant dataset of procedures extracted from literature using large language models, encoding materials, operations, and conditions as directed graphs to reflect causal relationships.

Result: MatPROV provides flexible, graph-based representations that capture structural complexities and causal links among materials, operations, and conditions, enabling machine-interpretable synthesis knowledge and intuitive visualization for downstream tasks.

Conclusion: Using PROV-DM to model synthesis procedures overcomes limitations of rigid schemas, enabling automated synthesis planning and optimization and spurring future research in machine-guided materials synthesis.

Abstract: Synthesis procedures play a critical role in materials research, as they
directly affect material properties. With data-driven approaches increasingly
accelerating materials discovery, there is growing interest in extracting
synthesis procedures from scientific literature as structured data. However,
existing studies often rely on rigid, domain-specific schemas with predefined
fields for structuring synthesis procedures or assume that synthesis procedures
are linear sequences of operations, which limits their ability to capture the
structural complexity of real-world procedures. To address these limitations,
we adopt PROV-DM, an international standard for provenance information, which
supports flexible, graph-based modeling of procedures. We present MatPROV, a
dataset of PROV-DM-compliant synthesis procedures extracted from scientific
literature using large language models. MatPROV captures structural
complexities and causal relationships among materials, operations, and
conditions through visually intuitive directed graphs. This representation
enables machine-interpretable synthesis knowledge, opening opportunities for
future research such as automated synthesis planning and optimization.

*Yuhong Zhang,Xusheng Zhu,Yuchen Xu,ChiaEn Lu,Hsinyu Shih,Gert Cauwenberghs,Tzyy-Ping Jung*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Multimodal EEG motion artifact removal using a fine-tuned LaBraM large model with IMU data improves robustness against motion artifacts compared with ASR-ICA.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EEG-based BCIs suffer from motion-related artifacts; existing artifact-removal methods mostly rely on single-modality signals and fail to capture motion dynamics captured by IMUs.

Method: Fine-tuned large brain model (LaBraM) with correlation attention mapping that leverages spatial relationships in IMU data to identify motion artifacts in EEG. The model contains ~9.2 million parameters and was trained on 5.9 hours of synchronized EEG-IMU data (vs. 2500 hours used for the base model). It is evaluated against Artifact Subspace Reconstruction (ASR) and Independent Component Analysis (ICA) across multiple time scales and motion activities.

Result: Incorporating IMU reference signals significantly improves robustness to motion artifacts across diverse motion scenarios compared with the ASR-ICA benchmark.

Conclusion: Integrating EEG with IMU data using a fine-tuned large-model approach yields superior motion artifact removal for EEG-based BCIs, highlighting the value of multimodal information and transfer from large pretrained models.

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) is a non-invasive method for measuring brain
activity with high temporal resolution; however, EEG signals often exhibit low
signal-to-noise ratios because of contamination from physiological and
environmental artifacts. One of the major challenges hindering the real-world
deployment of brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) involves the frequent occurrence
of motion-related EEG artifacts. Most prior studies on EEG motion artifact
removal rely on single-modality approaches, such as Artifact Subspace
Reconstruction (ASR) and Independent Component Analysis (ICA), without
incorporating simultaneously recorded modalities like inertial measurement
units (IMUs), which directly capture the extent and dynamics of motion. This
work proposes a fine-tuned large brain model (LaBraM)-based correlation
attention mapping method that leverages spatial channel relationships in IMU
data to identify motion-related artifacts in EEG signals. The fine-tuned model
contains approximately 9.2 million parameters and uses 5.9 hours of EEG and IMU
recordings for training, just 0.2346\% of the 2500 hours used to train the base
model. We compare our results against the established ASR-ICA benchmark across
varying time scales and motion activities, showing that incorporating IMU
reference signals significantly improves robustness under diverse motion
scenarios.

*Madhav Kanda,Shubham Ugare,Sasa Misailovic*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RefineStat uses semantic constraints and diagnostic-aware refinement to guide small language models in synthesizing probabilistic programs that are both syntactically correct and statistically reliable, achieving competitive performance with some closed-source models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Probabilistic programming presents a huge search space with strict domain-specific constraints; small language models frequently produce syntactic and semantic errors, particularly flawed inference constructs. Domain-aware debugging strategies are needed to improve reliability and usefulness of generated code.

Method: RefineStat enforces semantic constraints to ensure synthesized probabilistic programs have valid distributions and well-formed parameters. It then applies diagnostic-aware refinement by resampling prior or likelihood components when reliability checks fail, iterating until checks pass.

Result: Evaluated on multiple probabilistic-programming code-generation tasks using smaller language models. The framework yields programs that are both syntactically sound and statistically reliable, often matching or surpassing those from closed-source large language models (e.g., OpenAI o3).

Conclusion: Incorporating domain-specific semantic constraints and diagnostic-driven refinement enables reliable probabilistic program synthesis with smaller models, reducing dependence on larger black-box LLMs and improving practical applicability.

Abstract: Probabilistic programming offers a powerful framework for modeling
uncertainty, yet statistical model discovery in this domain entails navigating
an immense search space under strict domain-specific constraints. When small
language models are tasked with generating probabilistic programs, they
frequently produce outputs that suffer from both syntactic and semantic errors,
such as flawed inference constructs. Motivated by probabilistic programmers'
domain expertise and debugging strategies, we introduce RefineStat, a language
model--driven framework that enforces semantic constraints ensuring synthesized
programs contain valid distributions and well-formed parameters, and then
applies diagnostic-aware refinement by resampling prior or likelihood
components whenever reliability checks fail. We evaluate RefineStat on multiple
probabilistic-programming code-generation tasks using smaller language models
(SLMs) and find that it produces programs that are both syntactically sound and
statistically reliable, often matching or surpassing those from closed-source
large language models (e.g., OpenAI o3).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understand how depth in randomized feature constructions affects sample complexity and establish a depth separation between deep random-kernel networks and shallow models.

Method: Define random-kernel networks where depth arises from deterministic kernel composition, with randomness confined to the outermost layer; prove a depth-separation theorem in terms of Monte Carlo sample complexity.

Result: Deeper networks can approximate certain functions with fewer Monte Carlo samples than any shallow counterpart.

Conclusion: Depth in random-kernel networks yields improved sample efficiency and motivates further study of depth-separated performance in randomized feature models.

Abstract: We introduce random-kernel networks, a multilayer extension of random feature

TL;DR: CCE: a Bayesian confidence-consistency metric for time series anomaly evaluation; introduces RankEval benchmark; claims bounded, Lipschitz robust, linear-time; open-source.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current time-series anomaly-detection metrics often lack discriminative power, suffer from strong hyperparameter dependence, are sensitive to perturbations, and incur high computational costs. A unified, robust, and efficient evaluation that accounts for both prediction confidence and uncertainty is needed.

Method: Compute uncertainty of anomaly scores using Bayesian estimation to derive global and event-level confidence and consistency scores. Combine these into a concise CCE metric. Develop RankEval as a standardized benchmark pipeline to compare metric ranking capabilities. Provide theoretical guarantees (boundedness, Lipschitz robustness) and linear-time complexity. Implementations are open-source.

Result: CCE is strictly bounded, Lipschitz robust to score perturbations, and runs in linear time O(n). RankEval enables standardized, reproducible evaluation of metrics for ranking performance. Both CCE and RankEval are open-source.

Conclusion: CCE offers a robust, interpretable, and efficient evaluation framework for time-series anomaly detection, addressing key limitations of existing metrics. The accompanying RankEval benchmark facilitates objective comparisons, promoting reproducibility and wider adoption.

Abstract: Time Series Anomaly Detection metrics serve as crucial tools for model
evaluation. However, existing metrics suffer from several limitations:
insufficient discriminative power, strong hyperparameter dependency,
sensitivity to perturbations, and high computational overhead. This paper
introduces Confidence-Consistency Evaluation (CCE), a novel evaluation metric
that simultaneously measures prediction confidence and uncertainty consistency.
By employing Bayesian estimation to quantify the uncertainty of anomaly scores,
we construct both global and event-level confidence and consistency scores for
model predictions, resulting in a concise CCE metric. Theoretically and
experimentally, we demonstrate that CCE possesses strict boundedness, Lipschitz
robustness against score perturbations, and linear time complexity
$\mathcal{O}(n)$. Furthermore, we establish RankEval, a benchmark for comparing
the ranking capabilities of various metrics. RankEval represents the first
standardized and reproducible evaluation pipeline that enables objective
comparison of evaluation metrics. Both CCE and RankEval implementations are
fully open-source.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Self-supervised goal-oriented semantic communication (SC-GIR) learns invariant latent representations to compress images for task-driven transmission, enabling efficient communication while preserving downstream task performance (e.g., classification). 


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current goal-oriented semantic communication approaches rely on joint transceiver training and labeled data, which leads to redundant data exchange and task-specificity, hindering task-agnostic utility and scalability. There is a need for task-agnostic, data-efficient methods that can preserve essential information for diverse downstream tasks.

Method: SC-GIR is a framework that uses self-supervised learning to extract invariant representations from source images. It employs covariance-based contrastive learning to obtain meaningful, semantically dense latent representations that are robust across tasks. The compressed latent codes are transmitted for machine-to-machine tasks and evaluated on various image datasets with lossy compression, followed by goal-oriented AI tasks on the receiver side.

Result: SC-GIR outperforms baseline schemes by about 10% and achieves over 85% classification accuracy for compressed data across different SNR levels, demonstrating effective learning of compact, informative latent representations suitable for goal-oriented tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed SC-GIR framework demonstrates that self-supervised, invariant latent representations can enable efficient, task-agnostic semantic communication for image transmission, yielding significant gains in downstream task performance and robustness to channel conditions.

Abstract: Goal-oriented semantic communication (SC) aims to revolutionize communication
systems by transmitting only task-essential information. However, current
approaches face challenges such as joint training at transceivers, leading to
redundant data exchange and reliance on labeled datasets, which limits their
task-agnostic utility. To address these challenges, we propose a novel
framework called Goal-oriented Invariant Representation-based SC (SC-GIR) for
image transmission. Our framework leverages self-supervised learning to extract
an invariant representation that encapsulates crucial information from the
source data, independent of the specific downstream task. This compressed
representation facilitates efficient communication while retaining key features
for successful downstream task execution. Focusing on machine-to-machine tasks,
we utilize covariance-based contrastive learning techniques to obtain a latent
representation that is both meaningful and semantically dense. To evaluate the
effectiveness of the proposed scheme on downstream tasks, we apply it to
various image datasets for lossy compression. The compressed representations
are then used in a goal-oriented AI task. Extensive experiments on several
datasets demonstrate that SC-GIR outperforms baseline schemes by nearly 10%,,
and achieves over 85% classification accuracy for compressed data under
different SNR conditions. These results underscore the effectiveness of the
proposed framework in learning compact and informative latent representations.

*Guangli Li,Canbiao Wu,Zhehao Zhou,Na Tian,Zhen Liang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MATL-DC introduces a multi-domain aggregation transfer learning framework for EEG emotion recognition that operates with unseen target domains using domain-class prototypes, achieving competitive accuracy on SEED datasets and robust to label noise via pairwise learning; code available on GitHub.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the reliance of transfer learning in EEG emotion recognition on available source-target data and enable effective recognition when the target domain is completely unseen during training.

Method: A feature decoupling module separates domain-related and class-related features from shallow features. A multi-domain aggregation mechanism forms a superdomain from aggregated domain features. Within each superdomain, class prototypes are extracted. Pairwise learning converts the classification task into a similarity task between sample pairs to mitigate label noise. The model is trained on multiple source domains with an unseen target during training, and inference uses domain-class prototypes.

Result: On SEED, SEED-IV, and SEED-V, MATL-DC achieves 84.70%, 68.11%, and 61.08% accuracy, respectively, and shows comparable or superior performance to methods requiring both source and target data. Source code: https://github.com/WuCB-BCI/MATL-DC.

Conclusion: MATL-DC demonstrates effective transfer learning for EEG emotion recognition with unseen targets, offering robustness to label noise and practical applicability, with reproducible results via open-source code.

Abstract: Emotion recognition based on electroencephalography (EEG) signals is
increasingly becoming a key research hotspot in affective Brain-Computer
Interfaces (aBCIs). However, the current transfer learning model greatly
depends on the source domain and target domain data, which hinder the practical
application of emotion recognition. Therefore, we propose a Multi-domain
Aggregation Transfer Learning framework for EEG emotion recognition with
Domain-Class prototype under unseen targets (MATL-DC). We design the feature
decoupling module to decouple class-invariant domain features from
domain-invariant class features from shallow features. In the model training
stage, the multi-domain aggregation mechanism aggregates the domain feature
space to form a superdomain, which enhances the characteristics of emotional
EEG signals. In each superdomain, we further extract the class prototype
representation by class features. In addition, we adopt the pairwise learning
strategy to transform the sample classification problem into the similarity
problem between sample pairs, which effectively alleviates the influence of
label noise. It is worth noting that the target domain is completely unseen
during the training process. In the inference stage, we use the trained
domain-class prototypes for inference, and then realize emotion recognition. We
rigorously validate it on the publicly available databases (SEED, SEED-IV and
SEED-V). The results show that the accuracy of MATL-DC model is 84.70\%,
68.11\% and 61.08\%, respectively. MATL-DC achieves comparable or even better
performance than methods that rely on both source and target domains. The

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Extends performative prediction to nonlinear settings via kernelized maximum-margin loss, introduces a discrepancy-based shift measure, derives stability conditions for linear and nonlinear cases, and presents an algorithm with empirical gains over baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Performative prediction studies how model predictions can shift the data distribution, but existing work relies on strong, often linear or bounded-gradient assumptions and underexplore nonlinear real-world data. A nonlinear, stable framework is needed.

Method: Formulate performative loss with a maximum-margin objective; extend to nonlinear spaces using kernel methods; quantify distribution shift by discrepancy of prediction errors across distributions; derive linear and nonlinear performative-stability conditions; develop an algorithm that guarantees stability.

Result: Theoretical conditions for performative stability in both linear and nonlinear settings are established; an algorithm achieving stability is proposed; experiments on synthetic and real datasets show superior performance to baselines in both linear and nonlinear regimes.

Conclusion: A unified nonlinear extendable framework for performative prediction with stability guarantees is achieved, enabling robust performance under distribution shifts induced by predictions, validated by theory and experiments.

Abstract: Performative prediction is an emerging paradigm in machine learning that
addresses scenarios where the model's prediction may induce a shift in the
distribution of the data it aims to predict. Current works in this field often
rely on uncontrollable assumptions, such as bounded gradients of performative
loss, and primarily focus on linear cases in their examples and evaluations to
maintain consistency between theoretical guarantees and empirical validations.
However, such linearity rarely holds in real-world applications, where the data
usually exhibit complex nonlinear characteristics. In this paper, we relax
these out-of-control assumptions and present a novel design that generalizes
performative prediction to nonlinear cases while preserving essential
theoretical properties. Specifically, we formulate the loss function of
performative prediction using a maximum margin approach and extend it to
nonlinear spaces through kernel methods. To quantify the data distribution
shift, we employ the discrepancy between prediction errors on these two
distributions as an indicator, which characterizes the impact of the
performative effect on specific learning tasks. By doing so, we can derive, for
both linear and nonlinear cases, the conditions for performative stability, a
critical and desirable property in performative contexts. Building on these
theoretical insights, we develop an algorithm that guarantees the performative
stability of the predictive model. We validate the effectiveness of our method
through experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets with both linear and
nonlinear data distributions, demonstrating superior performance compared to
state-of-the-art baselines.

*Yassine Abbahaddou,Fragkiskos D. Malliaros,Johannes F. Lutzeyer,Michalis Vazirgiannis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Adaptive Depth Message Passing GNN (ADMP-GNN) enables per-node dynamic depth in the message-passing process, improving node classification performance compared to fixed-depth GNNs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GNNs traditionally use a fixed number of message-passing layers for all nodes, but real-world data shows that different nodes benefit from different depths; a one-size-fits-all depth is suboptimal.

Method: Introduce ADMP-GNN, a framework that dynamically adjusts the number of message-passing layers for each node. It is compatible with any message-passing model and likely uses a per-node halting or gating mechanism to determine the appropriate depth for each node during inference/training.

Result: Experiments on real-world and synthetic datasets show improved node classification performance over baseline fixed-depth GNNs.

Conclusion: Adaptive, node-specific depth in message passing is beneficial and can be generalized to a broad class of MP-GNNs, offering a new direction for making GNN computation more data- and node-aware.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have proven to be highly effective in various
graph learning tasks. A key characteristic of GNNs is their use of a fixed
number of message-passing steps for all nodes in the graph, regardless of each
node's diverse computational needs and characteristics. Through empirical
real-world data analysis, we demonstrate that the optimal number of
message-passing layers varies for nodes with different characteristics. This
finding is further supported by experiments conducted on synthetic datasets. To
address this, we propose Adaptive Depth Message Passing GNN (ADMP-GNN), a novel
framework that dynamically adjusts the number of message passing layers for
each node, resulting in improved performance. This approach applies to any
model that follows the message passing scheme. We evaluate ADMP-GNN on the node
classification task and observe performance improvements over baseline GNN
models.

*Zihao Wang,Yunjie Li,Lingmin Zan,Zheng Gong,Mengtao Zhu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: StoxLSTM extends xLSTM by incorporating stochastic latent variables to form a state-space model, improving capturing of complex temporal dynamics and boosting forecasting accuracy on diverse time-series datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the representational capacity and forecasting robustness of xLSTM in real-world time series with unknown, hierarchical dynamics by adding stochastic latent dynamics within a state-space framework.

Method: Introduce stochastic latent variables into xLSTM to create a stochastic recurrent block-based architecture that models latent dynamic evolution in a state-space formulation, resulting in StoxLSTM.

Result: Empirical evaluations on public benchmark datasets from multiple domains show StoxLSTM consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, with improved robustness and generalization.

Conclusion: StoxLSTM effectively extends xLSTM with stochastic latent dynamics, enabling better capture of complex temporal patterns and yielding superior forecasting performance across diverse datasets.

Abstract: The Extended Long Short-Term Memory (xLSTM) network has attracted widespread
research interest due to its enhanced capability to model complex temporal
dependencies in diverse time series applications. Despite its success, there is
still potential to further improve its representational capacity and
forecasting performance, particularly on challenging real-world datasets with
unknown, intricate, and hierarchical dynamics. In this work, we propose a
stochastic xLSTM, termed StoxLSTM, that improves the original architecture into
a state space modeling framework by incorporating stochastic latent variables
within xLSTM. StoxLSTM models the latent dynamic evolution through specially
designed recurrent blocks, enabling it to effectively capture the underlying
temporal patterns and dependencies. Extensive experiments on publicly available
benchmark datasets from multiple research communities demonstrate that StoxLSTM
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines with better robustness and
stronger generalization ability.

### [488] [Preserving Vector Space Properties in Dimensionality Reduction: A Relationship Preserving Loss Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01198)
*Eddi Weinwurm,Alexander Kovalenko*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A Relationship Preserving Loss (RPL) preserves vector-space relationships during dimensionality reduction by matching relationship matrices (e.g., Gram, cosine) between high- and low-dimensional embeddings, enabling non-linear projections with theoretical error bounds; early results show dimension reduction with largely preserved downstream performance and broad applicability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dimensionality reduction often distorts orthogonality and linear independence, undermining tasks like cross-modal retrieval, clustering, and classification; a loss that preserves inter-point relationships can maintain geometry in embeddings.

Method: Introduce RPL, a loss that minimizes discrepancies between relationship matrices computed on high-dimensional data and low-dimensional embeddings; supports non-linear neural projections; underpinned by matrix perturbation theory error bounds.

Result: Initial experiments indicate RPL reduces embedding dimensionality while largely preserving downstream task performance, suggesting effective preservation of key vector-space properties.

Conclusion: RPL can be applied beyond dimensionality reduction to cross-domain alignment, transfer learning, knowledge distillation, fairness/invariance, dehubbing, graph/manifold learning, and federated learning, wherever geometric consistency of distributed embeddings is required.

Abstract: Dimensionality reduction can distort vector space properties such as
orthogonality and linear independence, which are critical for tasks including
cross-modal retrieval, clustering, and classification. We propose a
Relationship Preserving Loss (RPL), a loss function that preserves these
properties by minimizing discrepancies between relationship matrices (e.g.,
Gram or cosine) of high-dimensional data and their low-dimensional embeddings.
RPL trains neural networks for non-linear projections and is supported by error
bounds derived from matrix perturbation theory. Initial experiments suggest
that RPL reduces embedding dimensions while largely retaining performance on
downstream tasks, likely due to its preservation of key vector space
properties. While we describe here the use of RPL in dimensionality reduction,
this loss can also be applied more broadly, for example to cross-domain
alignment and transfer learning, knowledge distillation, fairness and
invariance, dehubbing, graph and manifold learning, and federated learning,
where distributed embeddings must remain geometrically consistent.

*Yixiong Ren,Wenkang Du,Jianhui Zhou,Haiping Huang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Geometry-aware, layer-wise local training shapes representations to boost intra-class compactness and inter-class separation, achieving manifold smoothness and adversarial robustness, explained by an energy-Hebbian model, with potential for continual learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Balancing training accuracy and adversarial robustness is challenging. The work seeks to uncover physical principles of learning by aligning biological and artificial systems, and to improve robustness and continual learning by shaping the geometry of latent representations.

Method: Introduce a geometry-aware framework that uses layer-wise local training to sculpt internal representations. It enforces intra-class compactness and inter-class separation, promoting manifold smoothness. An energy model with Hebbian coupling between hidden units is used to explain performance and guide learning.

Result: Demonstrates adversarial robustness against white- and black-box attacks and links performance to an energy-based Hebbian mechanism. The approach also enables assimilation of new information with reduced representation interference.

Conclusion: Provides insight into the physics of learning and potential alignment between biological and artificial intelligence systems. The framework supports robust, continual learning by shaping representation geometry.

Abstract: How to balance training accuracy and adversarial robustness has become a
challenge since the birth of deep learning. Here, we introduce a geometry-aware
deep learning framework that leverages layer-wise local training to sculpt the
internal representations of deep neural networks. This framework promotes
intra-class compactness and inter-class separation in feature space, leading to
manifold smoothness and adversarial robustness against white or black box
attacks. The performance can be explained by an energy model with Hebbian
coupling between elements of the hidden representation. Our results thus shed
light on the physics of learning in the direction of alignment between
biological and artificial intelligence systems. Using the current framework,
the deep network can assimilate new information into existing knowledge
structures while reducing representation interference.

### [490] [What Expressivity Theory Misses: Message Passing Complexity for GNNs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01254)
*Niklas Kemper,Tom Wollschläger,Stephan Günnemann*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Expressivity alone is insufficient to analyze GNNs; the paper proposes Message Passing Complexity (MPC), a continuous metric that links architectural difficulty of solving tasks to practical constraints while preserving core WL impossibility results, and validates MPC empirically to better explain GNN success and failure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Expressivity theory is binary and often misaligned with real-world tasks; higher expressivity beyond the basic WL test is unnecessary for many tasks, and idealized assumptions overlook practical limits like over-squashing. A continuous, task-aware measure is needed to better predict practical GNN performance.

Method: Define MPC as a continuous measure of the difficulty for a GNN architecture to solve a given task via message passing. Show that MPC preserves (and extends) WL impossibility results while incorporating practical constraints. Validate MPC by correlating its predictions with empirical performance on fundamental GNN tasks and analyze architectural successes and failures.

Result: MPC’s theoretical predictions correlate with empirical performance, explaining why certain architectures succeed or fail and demonstrating that MPC narrows the gap between expressivity theory and practical GNN capabilities.

Conclusion: MPC offers a more nuanced framework than expressivity theory for understanding and improving GNN architectures, acknowledging practical limitations like over-squashing and aligning theory with observed performance.

Abstract: Expressivity theory, characterizing which graphs a GNN can distinguish, has
become the predominant framework for analyzing GNNs, with new models striving
for higher expressivity. However, we argue that this focus is misguided: First,
higher expressivity is not necessary for most real-world tasks as these tasks
rarely require expressivity beyond the basic WL test. Second, expressivity
theory's binary characterization and idealized assumptions fail to reflect
GNNs' practical capabilities. To overcome these limitations, we propose Message
Passing Complexity (MPC): a continuous measure that quantifies the difficulty
for a GNN architecture to solve a given task through message passing. MPC
captures practical limitations like over-squashing while preserving the
theoretical impossibility results from expressivity theory, effectively
narrowing the gap between theory and practice. Through extensive validation on
fundamental GNN tasks, we show that MPC's theoretical predictions correlate
with empirical performance, successfully explaining architectural successes and
failures. Thereby, MPC advances beyond expressivity theory to provide a more
powerful and nuanced framework for understanding and improving GNN
architectures.

*Andrea Fox,Francesco De Pellegrini,Eitan Altman*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Decentralized CMDP with a shared constraint vector enables lightweight coordination for safe MARL in edge offloading, outperforming centralized and independent baselines, especially at scale.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Edge computing requires fast, local decision-making under shared resource constraints. Existing MARL approaches often rely on centralized critics or frequent communication, which fail under limited observability and communication.

Method: A decentralized framework where each agent solves a constrained MDP (CMDP) and coordinates implicitly via a shared constraint vector that is updated infrequently. The approach uses safe reinforcement learning to satisfy both local and global objectives, demonstrated on an offloading scenario to prevent node/resource overload.

Result: Theoretical guarantees are established under mild assumptions, and experiments show improved performance over centralized and independent baselines, with stronger gains in large-scale settings.

Conclusion: The proposed lightweight, decentralized coordination mechanism enables scalable, safe MARL in resource-constrained edge systems, achieving alignment with global resource usage while minimizing communication.

Abstract: In edge computing systems, autonomous agents must make fast local decisions
while competing for shared resources. Existing MARL methods often resume to
centralized critics or frequent communication, which fail under limited
observability and communication constraints. We propose a decentralized
framework in which each agent solves a constrained Markov decision process
(CMDP), coordinating implicitly through a shared constraint vector. For the
specific case of offloading, e.g., constraints prevent overloading shared
server resources. Coordination constraints are updated infrequently and act as
a lightweight coordination mechanism. They enable agents to align with global
resource usage objectives but require little direct communication. Using safe
reinforcement learning, agents learn policies that meet both local and global
goals. We establish theoretical guarantees under mild assumptions and validate
our approach experimentally, showing improved performance over centralized and
independent baselines, especially in large-scale settings.

*Stefano Fioravanti,Matteo Zavatteri,Roberto Confalonieri,Kamyar Zeinalipour,Paolo Frazzetto,Alessandro Sperduti,Nicolò Navarin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Iterative, tailored few-shot example selection improves LLM generalization on compositional reasoning tasks and out-of-distribution problems, with some models benefiting from simpler prompts rather than data-expected complex prompts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with systematic generalization and compositional reasoning under distribution shifts; there is a need for strategies to enhance in-context learning to generalize beyond training-like patterns.

Method: Introduce an iterative example-selection prompting framework that builds a task-specific, optimized set of few-shot examples and couples it with explicit reasoning instructions; validate on algebraic expression simplification under non-standard operation priorities.

Result: LLMs show limited proficiency in the targeted mathematical tasks; the iterative shot-selection with explicit reasoning improves reasoning performance; intriguingly, some models generalize better when prompted with simpler, rather than more complex, examples aligned with the test distribution.

Conclusion: Iterative, task-tailored in-context prompts can bolster generalization of LLMs in challenging reasoning tasks, but model capabilities remain limited; prompt design, including example complexity, significantly impacts performance and may favor simpler explanations in some cases.

Abstract: LLMs face significant challenges in systematic generalization, particularly
when dealing with reasoning tasks requiring compositional rules and handling
out-of-distribution examples. To address these challenges, we introduce an
in-context learning methodology that improves the generalization capabilities
of general purpose LLMs. Our approach employs an iterative example selection
strategy, which incrementally constructs a tailored set of few-shot examples
optimized to enhance model's performance on a given task. As a proof of
concept, we apply this methodology to the resolution of algebraic expressions
involving non-standard simplification rules, according to which the priority of
addition and multiplication is changed.
  Our findings indicate that LLMs exhibit limited proficiency in these
mathematical tasks. We further demonstrate that LLMs reasoning benefits from
our iterative shot selection prompting strategy integrated with explicit
reasoning instructions. Crucially, our experiments reveal that some LLMs
achieve better generalization performances when prompted with simpler few-shot
examples rather than complex ones following the test data distribution.

### [493] [Building surrogate models using trajectories of agents trained by Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01285)
*Julen Cestero,Marco Quartulli,Marcello Restelli*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This work introduces RL-policy-driven sampling to improve surrogate modeling in expensive, deterministic simulators with large state spaces. By combining samples from random, expert, and maximum-entropy exploration policies, the approach outperforms standard strategies (Latin Hypercube Sampling, Active Learning, Kriging) across datasets, enabling more effective surrogate-aided RL on complex simulators.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sample efficiency in surrogate modeling under costly simulations, especially in environments with large state spaces; existing sampling strategies underperform in these regimes.

Method: Train RL policies to sample state spaces; compare surrogate-building strategies against Latin Hypercube sampling, Active Learning, and Kriging; cross-validate across datasets; propose a mixed dataset comprising random, expert, and entropy-maximizing exploration samples.

Result: Mixed sampling dataset yields best performance across all datasets; demonstrates improved state-space representation and surrogate accuracy; suggests the method outperforms current approaches and enables surrogate-aided RL on complex simulators.

Conclusion: The proposed RL-based sampling method advances state-of-the-art in surrogate modeling for expensive simulations and facilitates applying surrogate-aided RL to complex deterministic simulators.

Abstract: Sample efficiency in the face of computationally expensive simulations is a
common concern in surrogate modeling. Current strategies to minimize the number
of samples needed are not as effective in simulated environments with wide
state spaces. As a response to this challenge, we propose a novel method to
efficiently sample simulated deterministic environments by using policies
trained by Reinforcement Learning. We provide an extensive analysis of these
surrogate-building strategies with respect to Latin-Hypercube sampling or
Active Learning and Kriging, cross-validating performances with all sampled
datasets. The analysis shows that a mixed dataset that includes samples
acquired by random agents, expert agents, and agents trained to explore the
regions of maximum entropy of the state transition distribution provides the
best scores through all datasets, which is crucial for a meaningful state space
representation. We conclude that the proposed method improves the
state-of-the-art and clears the path to enable the application of
surrogate-aided Reinforcement Learning policy optimization strategies on
complex simulators.

### [494] [Equivariant U-Shaped Neural Operators for the Cahn-Hilliard Phase-Field Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01293)
*Xiao Xue,M. F. P. ten Eikelder,Tianyue Yang,Yiqing Li,Kan He,Shuo Wang,Peter V. Coveney*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: An equivariant U-shaped neural operator (E-UNO) learns Cahn-Hilliard phase-field evolution from short histories, integrating global spectral convolution with a multi-resolution U-shaped architecture to capture multiscale dynamics and symmetries; it outperforms FNO and U-UNO baselines and generalizes with less data, offering a physically consistent surrogate for phase-field systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need for data-driven solvers that (i) accurately predict phase-field dynamics across diverse initial conditions and geometries, (ii) capture multiscale features, (iii) respect underlying physical symmetries (e.g., translation invariance) in Cahn–Hilliard phase-field models.

Method: Develop E-UNO by combining global spectral convolution with a multi-resolution U-shaped architecture and enforcing translation equivariance to align with physics; learn evolution from short histories of past dynamics; encode symmetry and scale hierarchy.

Result: E-UNO outperforms standard Fourier neural operator (FNO) and U-shaped neural operator baselines, especially for fine-scale and high-frequency structures; it generalizes better with less training data and yields physically consistent dynamics.

Conclusion: E-UNO provides an efficient, symmetry-aware surrogate for complex phase-field systems and demonstrates the value of encoding symmetry and multiscale structure in neural operators.

Abstract: Phase separation in binary mixtures, governed by the Cahn-Hilliard equation,
plays a central role in interfacial dynamics across materials science and soft
matter. While numerical solvers are accurate, they are often computationally
expensive and lack flexibility across varying initial conditions and
geometries. Neural operators provide a data-driven alternative by learning
solution operators between function spaces, but current architectures often
fail to capture multiscale behavior and neglect underlying physical symmetries.
Here we show that an equivariant U-shaped neural operator (E-UNO) can learn the
evolution of the phase-field variable from short histories of past dynamics,
achieving accurate predictions across space and time. The model combines global
spectral convolution with a multi-resolution U-shaped architecture and
regulates translation equivariance to align with the underlying physics. E-UNO
outperforms standard Fourier neural operator and U-shaped neural operator
baselines, particularly on fine-scale and high-frequency structures. By
encoding symmetry and scale hierarchy, the model generalizes better, requires
less training data, and yields physically consistent dynamics. This establishes
E-UNO as an efficient surrogate for complex phase-field systems.

### [495] [Towards Trustworthy Vital Sign Forecasting: Leveraging Uncertainty for Prediction Intervals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01319)
*Li Rong Wang,Thomas C. Henderson,Yew Soon Ong,Yih Yng Ng,Xiuyi Fan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Two RUE-based methods for calibrated prediction intervals (Gaussian copula and KNN) to quantify uncertainty in vital-sign forecasts; performance depends on sampling frequency: Gaussian copula better for low-frequency data; KNN better for high-frequency data; overall promising for clinical interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clinicians need calibrated, interpretable prediction intervals to distinguish meaningful anomalies from model noise in vital-sign forecasting; reliable uncertainty quantification is essential for trust and decision-making.

Method: Derive prediction intervals from the Reconstruction Uncertainty Estimate (RUE) using two approaches: (1) a parametric Gaussian copula assumption enabling closed-form PI computation; (2) a non-parametric KNN-based estimation of the conditional error distribution from similar validation instances.

Result: Evaluated on two public datasets with minute-level (high-frequency) and hour-level (low-frequency) sampling. The Gaussian copula PIs outperform conformal prediction baselines on low-frequency data, while the KNN PIs perform best on high-frequency data; overall RUE-derived PIs provide interpretable, uncertainty-aware vital-sign forecasts.

Conclusion: RUE-derived PIs offer calibrated, interpretable uncertainty quantification for vital-sign forecasting. Data frequency influences the preferred PI method; this work supports clinical deployment by improving trust in forecasted alerts.

Abstract: Vital signs, such as heart rate and blood pressure, are critical indicators
of patient health and are widely used in clinical monitoring and
decision-making. While deep learning models have shown promise in forecasting
these signals, their deployment in healthcare remains limited in part because
clinicians must be able to trust and interpret model outputs. Without reliable
uncertainty quantification -- particularly calibrated prediction intervals
(PIs) -- it is unclear whether a forecasted abnormality constitutes a
meaningful warning or merely reflects model noise, hindering clinical
decision-making. To address this, we present two methods for deriving PIs from
the Reconstruction Uncertainty Estimate (RUE), an uncertainty measure
well-suited to vital-sign forecasting due to its sensitivity to data shifts and
support for label-free calibration. Our parametric approach assumes that
prediction errors and uncertainty estimates follow a Gaussian copula
distribution, enabling closed-form PI computation. Our non-parametric approach,
based on k-nearest neighbours (KNN), empirically estimates the conditional
error distribution using similar validation instances. We evaluate these
methods on two large public datasets with minute- and hour-level sampling,
representing high- and low-frequency health signals. Experiments demonstrate
that the Gaussian copula method consistently outperforms conformal prediction
baselines on low-frequency data, while the KNN approach performs best on
high-frequency data. These results underscore the clinical promise of
RUE-derived PIs for delivering interpretable, uncertainty-aware vital sign
forecasts.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DEPO is a data-efficient policy optimization pipeline for RLVR that achieves strong data efficiency by offline sample curation (diversity, influence, difficulty), online sample-level explorability gating, and replay for under-explored samples. It outperforms existing offline/online data selection methods and achieves notable speed-ups with only 20% of the data (1.85x on AIME24, 1.66x on AIME25 vs GRPO on full data).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Scaling reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) for reasoning tasks is costly due to extensive rollout computations and the need for large datasets. There is a demand for data-efficient strategies that maintain or improve performance while reducing training time and data requirements.

Method: Offline phase: curate a high-quality subset of training samples guided by diversity, influence, and appropriate difficulty. Online RLVR training: introduce a sample-level explorability metric to dynamically filter samples with low exploration potential to cut rollout costs. Replay mechanism to revisit under-explored samples to ensure adequate training and better convergence.

Result: DEPO consistently outperforms existing methods in both offline and online data selection scenarios across five reasoning benchmarks. With only 20% of the training data, DEPO yields speed-ups of 1.85x on AIME24 and 1.66x on AIME25 compared to GRPO trained on the full dataset.

Conclusion: By integrating offline diverse/difficult sample selection, online exploration-based filtering, and replay for under-explored data, DEPO enables data-efficient policy optimization for RLVR, reducing training costs while preserving or enhancing convergence and performance.

Abstract: Recent advances in large reasoning models have leveraged reinforcement
learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) to improve reasoning capabilities.
However, scaling these methods typically requires extensive rollout computation
and large datasets, leading to high training costs and low data efficiency. To
mitigate this issue, we propose DEPO, a Data-Efficient Policy Optimization
pipeline that combines optimized strategies for both offline and online data
selection. In the offline phase, we curate a high-quality subset of training
samples based on diversity, influence, and appropriate difficulty. During
online RLVR training, we introduce a sample-level explorability metric to
dynamically filter samples with low exploration potential, thereby reducing
substantial rollout computational costs. Furthermore, we incorporate a replay
mechanism for under-explored samples to ensure adequate training, which
enhances the model's final convergence performance. Experiments across five
reasoning benchmarks show that DEPO consistently outperforms existing methods
in both offline and online data selection scenarios. Notably, using only 20% of
the training data, our approach achieves a 1.85 times speed-up on AIME24 and a
1.66 times speed-up on AIME25 compared to GRPO trained on the full dataset.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Flexible pretraining framework (FMAE) for battery management that handles missing data channels and cross-snippet correlations, achieving state-of-the-art across multiple tasks and datasets with data-efficient inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Scalability bottleneck in industrial battery management: task-specific models require large, diverse data and extensive engineering due to different data types, scales, and channels across tasks. A unified, data-efficient approach that works with incomplete data is highly desirable.

Method: Proposes Flexible Masked Autoencoder (FMAE) as a pretraining framework that masks data channels to simulate missing information, learns unified representations across heterogeneous battery data, and captures inter-correlations across data snippets, enabling transfer to multiple tasks with minimal task-specific data/engineering.

Result: FMAE consistently outperforms task-specific methods across five battery management tasks and eleven datasets. For remaining life prediction tasks, it uses 50x less inference data while achieving state-of-the-art results. It remains effective when real-world data lack information (e.g., system voltage), with marginal performance impact, comparable to best hand-crafted features.

Conclusion: FMAE offers a practical, flexible, and data-efficient approach for multi-task battery management, reducing the need for task-specific models and large labeled datasets while maintaining strong performance.

Abstract: Industrial-scale battery management involves various types of tasks, such as
estimation, prediction, and system-level diagnostics. Each task employs
distinct data across temporal scales, sensor resolutions, and data channels.
Building task-specific methods requires a great deal of data and engineering
effort, which limits the scalability of intelligent battery management. Here we
present the Flexible Masked Autoencoder (FMAE), a flexible pretraining
framework that can learn with missing battery data channels and capture
inter-correlations across data snippets. FMAE learns unified battery
representations from heterogeneous data and can be adopted by different tasks
with minimal data and engineering efforts. Experimentally, FMAE consistently
outperforms all task-specific methods across five battery management tasks with
eleven battery datasets. On remaining life prediction tasks, FMAE uses 50 times
less inference data while maintaining state-of-the-art results. Moreover, when
real-world data lack certain information, such as system voltage, FMAE can
still be applied with marginal performance impact, achieving comparable results
with the best hand-crafted features. FMAE demonstrates a practical route to a
flexible, data-efficient model that simplifies real-world multi-task management
of dynamical systems.

### [498] [Globally aware optimization with resurgence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01329)
*Wei Bu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A framework that uses resurgence theory and Borel analysis of a perturbative partition function Z(g) to extract global information from divergent series, yielding critical objective values that guide local optimizers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Local gradient methods lack global information about the objective landscape, making them sensitive to initialization and prone to suboptimal convergence. The paper proposes leveraging global information encoded in divergent asymptotic series to obtain principled global guidance.

Method: Compute Z(g)=∫ e^{-L(θ)/g} dθ for small g; extract its asymptotic series, perform a Borel transform, and locate singularities in the Borel plane. Each singularity corresponds to a critical objective value of L. Use these target values to steer local optimization (e.g., learning-rate adaptation, escaping basins).

Result: The authors claim a one-to-one correspondence between Borel plane singularities and critical objective values, providing theoretically grounded global targets that guide optimization beyond local gradients.

Conclusion: If practical, this resurgence-based framework could offer principled global information to augment local optimizers, potentially improving convergence and robustness. Real-world applicability depends on the ability to compute/approximate Z(g) and accurately identify Borel singularities in high dimensions.

Abstract: Modern optimization faces a fundamental challenge: local gradient-based
methods provide no global information about the objective function $L$
landscape, often leading to suboptimal convergence and sensitivity to
initialization. We introduce a novel optimization framework that leverages
resurgence theory from complex analysis to extract global structural
information from divergent asymptotic series. Our key insight is that the
factorially divergent perturbative expansions of parameter space partition
functions encode precise information about all critical objective function
value in the landscape through their Borel transform singularities.
  The algorithm works by computing the statistical mechanical partition
function $Z(g) = \int e^{-L(\theta)/g} d\theta$ for small coupling $g\ll 1$,
extracting its asymptotic series coefficients, and identifying Borel plane
singularities that correspond one-to-one with critical objective function
values. These target values provide global guidance to local optimizers,
enabling principled learning rate adaptation and escape from suboptimal
regions. Unlike heuristic adaptive methods, targets are theoretically grounded
in the geometry of the optimization landscape.

*Jaeho Choi,Hyeri Kim,Kwang-Ho Kim,Jaesung Lee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A simple penalty-based QUBO reformulation yields a differentiable advanced torrential (AT) loss that addresses CSI’s poor performance during extended dry spells, improving precipitation forecasting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CSI-based losses can be ineffective when precipitation remains below threshold for long periods. There is a need for a loss function that remains informative across dry spells and improves ML-based precipitation forecasts.

Method: Introduce a penalty expression and reinterpret it as a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) problem. Relax the QUBO into a differentiable advanced torrential (AT) loss via an approximation. Evaluate via Lipschitz constant analyses, forecast performance, consistency experiments, and ablation studies with an operational model.

Result: The AT loss demonstrates superiority across the evaluation metrics, showing improved forecast performance and stability in comparisons and ablation studies.

Conclusion: The AT loss provides a simple, effective alternative to CSI-based optimization for precipitation forecasting and demonstrates robust performance in both controlled evaluations and with an operational model.

Abstract: Accurate precipitation forecasting is becoming increasingly important in the
context of climate change. In response, machine learning-based approaches have
recently gained attention as an emerging alternative to traditional methods
such as numerical weather prediction and climate models. Nonetheless, many
recent approaches still rely on off-the-shelf loss functions, and even the more
advanced ones merely involve optimization processes based on the critical
success index (CSI). The problem, however, is that CSI may become ineffective
during extended dry periods when precipitation remains below the threshold,
rendering it less than ideal as a criterion for optimization. To address this
limitation, we introduce a simple penalty expression and reinterpret it as a
quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) formulation. Ultimately, the
resulting QUBO formulation is relaxed into a differentiable advanced torrential
(AT) loss function through an approximation process. The proposed AT loss
demonstrates its superiority through the Lipschitz constant, forecast
performance evaluations, consistency experiments, and ablation studies with the

### [500] [Causal Sensitivity Identification using Generative Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01352)
*Soma Bandyopadhyay,Sudeshna Sarkar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A generative, CVAE-based approach to causal impact analysis that identifies causally sensitive features via interventions and evaluates counterfactuals, improving prediction tasks and reducing confounding, demonstrated on GeoLife trajectories and an Asia Bayesian network.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable causal interpretation and bias reduction in predictive models by explicitly distinguishing features that causally influence the outcome from those that do not, and by evaluating how changes in causes affect effects through counterfactuals.

Method: Use interventional analysis to identify causally sensitive features that influence the predicted outcome; use counterfactuals to assess how changes in the causes affect the outcome. Leverage a Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) as a generative predictor to model the data and capture causal relationships, thereby reducing confounding bias and enabling causal impact identification. Validate on spatiotemporal trajectory prediction (GeoLife) and a benchmark Asia Bayesian network.

Result: Demonstrates the ability to identify causal impact and improve predictive performance, achieving more accurate next-location recommendations on GeoLife and favorable results on the Asia Bayesian network benchmark, while reducing confounding bias.

Conclusion: The CVAE-based causal impact framework provides a scalable method to perform causal analysis within generative prediction models, effectively identifying causal features and counterfactual effects, with empirical validation on large-scale real-world and benchmark datasets.

Abstract: In this work, we propose a novel generative method to identify the causal
impact and apply it to prediction tasks. We conduct causal impact analysis
using interventional and counterfactual perspectives. First, applying
interventions, we identify features that have a causal influence on the
predicted outcome, which we refer to as causally sensitive features, and
second, applying counterfactuals, we evaluate how changes in the cause affect
the effect. Our method exploits the Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE)
to identify the causal impact and serve as a generative predictor. We are able
to reduce confounding bias by identifying causally sensitive features. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of our method by recommending the most likely
locations a user will visit next in their spatiotemporal trajectory influenced
by the causal relationships among various features. Experiments on the
large-scale GeoLife [Zheng et al., 2010] dataset and the benchmark Asia
Bayesian network validate the ability of our method to identify causal impact
and improve predictive performance.

### [501] [DPF-CM: A Data Processing Framework with Privacy-Preserving Vector Databases for Chinese Medical LLMs Training and Deployment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01354)
*Wei Huang,Anda Cheng,Zhao Zhang,Yinggui Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DPF-CM provides a holistic, two-module framework for Chinese medical LLMs, combining data processing (with chained context-learning and ensemble data filtering) and privacy-preserving deployment (PPVD). It delivers state-of-the-art open-source accuracy and reduces training-data privacy leakage by 27%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current open-source Chinese medical LLM pipelines focus on training methodologies but neglect end-to-end data processing and privacy considerations in deployment. There is a need to improve data quality, instruction content, and privacy safeguards in open-source pipelines.

Method: Module 1 data processing: a specialized training data pipeline that (a) uses a chained examples context-learning strategy to generate question-oriented instructions, and (b) employs an ensemble-based filtering mechanism that averages multiple reward models to suppress noisy samples. Module 2 privacy-preserving deployment: Privacy Preserving Vector Database (PPVD) with four stages—model memory search, high-risk database construction, secure database construction, and match-and-replace—to minimize privacy leakage during inference.

Result: Empirical results show significant gains in model accuracy, achieving state-of-the-art performance among open-source Chinese medical LLMs, and a 27% reduction in training data privacy leakage.

Conclusion: DPF-CM offers a practical, end-to-end blueprint for robust open-source Chinese medical LLMs, addressing both data quality and privacy. Its modular design enables adoption and adaptation in related domains and languages.

Abstract: Current open-source training pipelines for Chinese medical language models
predominantly emphasize optimizing training methodologies to enhance the
performance of large language models (LLMs), yet lack comprehensive exploration
into training data processing. To address this gap, we propose DPF-CM, a
holistic Data Processing Framework for Chinese Medical LLMs training and
deployment. DPF-CM comprises two core modules. The first module is a data
processing pipeline tailored for model training. Beyond standard data
processing operations, we (1) introduce a chained examples context-learning
strategy to generate question-oriented instructions to mitigate the lack of
instruction content, and (2) implement an ensemble-based filtering mechanism
for preference data curation that averages multiple reward models to suppress
noisy samples. The second module focuses on privacy preservation during model
deployment. To prevent privacy risks from the inadvertent exposure of training
data, we propose a Privacy Preserving Vector Database (PPVD) approach, which
involves model memory search, high-risk database construction, secure database
construction, and match-and-replace, four key stages to minimize privacy
leakage during inference collectively. Experimental results show that DPF-CM
significantly improves model accuracy, enabling our trained Chinese medical LLM
to achieve state-of-the-art performance among open-source counterparts.
Moreover, the framework reduces training data privacy leakage by 27%.

*Jiarui Cao,Zhiyang Zhang,Heming Wang,Jun Xu,Ling Lan,Ran Gu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CbLDM: a conditional latent diffusion model to recover nanostructures from PDFs, using a conditional prior for p(z|x) and Laplacian-based reconstruction, achieving higher accuracy than prior methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To solve the nanostructure inverse problem and understand the relationship between properties and structure by leveraging PDFs and conditional generation.

Method: Develop CbLDM, a conditional latent diffusion model; reduce diffusion sampling steps; estimate conditional posterior p(z|x) via a conditional prior; replace distance matrix with Laplacian for reconstruction; compare against existing models.

Result: CbLDM achieves significantly higher prediction accuracy than existing models on the nanostructure inverse problem.

Conclusion: CbLDM demonstrates the feasibility and effectiveness of conditional latent diffusion approaches in nanostructure reconstruction and may generalize to other continuous conditional generation tasks.

Abstract: Nowadays, the nanostructure inverse problem is an attractive problem that
helps researchers to understand the relationship between the properties and the
structure of nanomaterials. This article focuses on the problem of using PDF to
recover the nanostructure, which this article views as a conditional generation
problem. This article propose a deep learning model CbLDM, Condition-based
Latent Diffusion Model. Based on the original latent diffusion model, the
sampling steps of the diffusion model are reduced and the sample generation
efficiency is improved by using the conditional prior to estimate conditional
posterior distribution, which is the approximated distribution of p(z|x). In
addition, this article uses the Laplacian matrix instead of the distance matrix
to recover the nanostructure, which can reduce the reconstruction error.
Finally, this article compares CbLDM with existing models which were used to
solve the nanostructure inverse problem, and find that CbLDM demonstrates
significantly higher prediction accuracy than these models, which reflects the
ability of CbLDM to solve the nanostructure inverse problem and the potential
to cope with other continuous conditional generation tasks.

### [503] [Learn to Jump: Adaptive Random Walks for Long-Range Propagation through Graph Hierarchies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01381)
*Joël Mathys,Federico Errica*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a hierarchical graph approach with adaptive random walks using learnable transition probabilities to favor either the original graph or hierarchical shortcuts. Demonstrates that hierarchy-aware walks can match or exceed the performance of longer walks on the original graph on a synthetic long-range task, suggesting efficient long-range dependency capture in large graphs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Message-passing architectures often fail to model long-range dependencies efficiently. The method aims to leverage hierarchical graph structures and controllable walks to propagate information across distant nodes with fewer steps.

Method: Introduce learnable transition probabilities that decide whether a random walk should stay on the original graph or traverse hierarchical shortcuts. Use adaptive random walks on a hierarchical graph to capture long-range dependencies. Evaluate on a synthetic long-range task by comparing hierarchy-preferring walks to standard long walks on the original graph.

Result: Walks that prefer the hierarchical shortcuts achieve the same performance as longer walks on the original graph and can surpass traditional theoretical bounds that apply when only original topology is used.

Conclusion: Hierarchical shortcuts with adaptive random walks offer a promising and efficient direction for processing large graphs, enabling effective long-range dependency capture without requiring excessively long walks.

Abstract: Message-passing architectures struggle to sufficiently model long-range
dependencies in node and graph prediction tasks. We propose a novel approach
exploiting hierarchical graph structures and adaptive random walks to address
this challenge. Our method introduces learnable transition probabilities that
decide whether the walk should prefer the original graph or travel across
hierarchical shortcuts. On a synthetic long-range task, we demonstrate that our
approach can exceed the theoretical bound that constrains traditional
approaches operating solely on the original topology. Specifically, walks that
prefer the hierarchy achieve the same performance as longer walks on the
original graph. These preliminary findings open a promising direction for
efficiently processing large graphs while effectively capturing long-range
dependencies.

*Armin Hadžić,Milan Papez,Tomáš Pevný*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A simple subset-based distillation of VQ-VAE to a tractable probabilistic circuit preserves expressiveness and enables efficient inference, yielding competitive density estimation and conditional generation results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the perceived intractability of probabilistic inference in discrete latent-space models like VQ-VAE by exploiting underutilization of latent space and distilling to a tractable representation.

Method: Select high-probability latent variables from the VQ-VAE, construct a probabilistic circuit for the distilled model, ensuring maintained expressiveness and tractable inference.

Result: Experiments show competitive density estimation and conditional generation, challenging the view of VQ-VAE as inherently intractable.

Conclusion: The distilled probabilistic circuit provides a tractable, expressive surrogate for VQ-VAE, enabling practical inference and challenging assumptions about the intractability of discrete latent-space models.

Abstract: Deep generative models with discrete latent space, such as the
Vector-Quantized Variational Autoencoder (VQ-VAE), offer excellent data
generation capabilities, but, due to the large size of their latent space,
their probabilistic inference is deemed intractable. We demonstrate that the
VQ-VAE can be distilled into a tractable model by selecting a subset of latent
variables with high probabilities. This simple strategy is particularly
efficient, especially if the VQ-VAE underutilizes its latent space, which is,
indeed, very often the case. We frame the distilled model as a probabilistic
circuit, and show that it preserves expressiveness of the VQ-VAE while
providing tractable probabilistic inference. Experiments illustrate competitive
performance in density estimation and conditional generation tasks, challenging
the view of the VQ-VAE as an inherently intractable model.

### [505] [Evaluating the stability of model explanations in instance-dependent cost-sensitive credit scoring](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01409)
*Matteo Ballegeer,Matthias Bogaert,Dries F. Benoit*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: IDCS classifiers boost cost-efficiency but yield unstable explanations (SHAP/LIME) under class imbalance; highlights a trade-off between cost optimization and interpretability in credit scoring.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the gap in understanding how instance-dependent, cost-sensitive loss functions affect the stability of model explanations, amid regulatory pressure for transparent credit scoring.

Method: Evaluate IDCS classifiers on four public credit datasets; assess discriminatory power and cost-efficiency; introduce a cross-dataset comparability metric; analyze SHAP and LIME stability under resampling-driven class imbalance.

Result: IDCS improves cost-efficiency but leads to significantly less stable SHAP/LIME explanations compared to traditional models, especially as class imbalance increases.

Conclusion: There is a critical trade-off between cost optimization and explainability; regulatory demands require stabilizing explanations for IDCS; further work needed to address stability issues to preserve trust in cost-efficient credit scoring.

Abstract: Instance-dependent cost-sensitive (IDCS) classifiers offer a promising
approach to improving cost-efficiency in credit scoring by tailoring loss
functions to instance-specific costs. However, the impact of such loss
functions on the stability of model explanations remains unexplored in
literature, despite increasing regulatory demands for transparency. This study
addresses this gap by evaluating the stability of Local Interpretable
Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME) and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP)
when applied to IDCS models. Using four publicly available credit scoring
datasets, we first assess the discriminatory power and cost-efficiency of IDCS
classifiers, introducing a novel metric to enhance cross-dataset comparability.
We then investigate the stability of SHAP and LIME feature importance rankings
under varying degrees of class imbalance through controlled resampling. Our
results reveal that while IDCS classifiers improve cost-efficiency, they
produce significantly less stable explanations compared to traditional models,
particularly as class imbalance increases, highlighting a critical trade-off
between cost optimization and interpretability in credit scoring. Amid
increasing regulatory scrutiny on explainability, this research underscores the
pressing need to address stability issues in IDCS classifiers to ensure that
their cost advantages are not undermined by unstable or untrustworthy
explanations.

*Qiyun Cheng,Md Hossain Sahadath,Huihua Yang,Shaowu Pan,Wei Ji*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MD-PNOP is a physics-preserving framework that uses neural operators to refine PDE solutions offline, enabling extrapolative speedups for parametric PDE solvers without retraining and achieving ~50% time reduction while maintaining full-order accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Speed up large-scale parametric PDE studies and design optimization while strictly enforcing governing equations and preserving interpretability; address extrapolation limits of neural operators by enabling generalization from a single trained parameter setting.

Method: Treat the residual from parameter deviation as an additional source term. Train a neural operator (e.g., DeepONet or FNO) at one parameter setting and embed its predictions into iterative solvers as better initial guesses. This offline refinement reduces iterations while preserving physics; architecture-agnostic and demonstrated on Boltzmann transport equations for neutron transport with various parameter distributions.

Result: Consistent ~50% reduction in wall-clock time with full-order fidelity across fixed-source, single-group eigenvalue, and multigroup coupled eigenvalue problems; the approach generalizes to heterogeneous, sinusoidal, and discontinuous parameter distributions without retraining.

Conclusion: MD-PNOP offers a physics-consistent, data-efficient route to accelerate parametric PDE solvers. It enables extrapolative generalization of neural operators trained at a single parameter setting and integrates seamlessly with existing solvers, potentially broadening the applicability of operator learning in computational physics.

Abstract: The computational overhead of traditional numerical solvers for partial
differential equations (PDEs) remains a critical bottleneck for large-scale
parametric studies and design optimization. We introduce a Minimal-Data
Parametric Neural Operator Preconditioning (MD-PNOP) framework, which
establishes a new paradigm for accelerating parametric PDE solvers while
strictly preserving physical constraints. The key idea is to recast the
residual from parameter deviation as additional source term, where any trained
neural operator can be used to refine the solution in an offline fashion. This
directly addresses the fundamental extrapolation limitation of neural
operators, enabling extrapolative generalization of any neural operator trained
at a single parameter setting across a wide range of configurations without any
retraining. The neural operator predictions are then embedded into iterative
PDE solvers as improved initial guesses, thereby reducing convergence
iterations without sacrificing accuracy. Unlike purely data-driven approaches,
MD-PNOP guarantees that the governing equations remain fully enforced,
eliminating concerns about loss of physics or interpretability. The framework
is architecture-agnostic and is demonstrated using both Deep Operator Networks
(DeepONet) and Fourier Neural Operators (FNO) for Boltzmann transport equation
solvers in neutron transport applications. We demonstrated that neural
operators trained on a single set of constant parameters successfully
accelerate solutions with heterogeneous, sinusoidal, and discontinuous
parameter distributions. Besides, MD-PNOP consistently achieves ~50% reduction
in computational time while maintaining full order fidelity for fixed-source,
single-group eigenvalue, and multigroup coupled eigenvalue problems.

*Nikola Milosevic,Nico Scherf*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A geometric framework unifies reward maximization, safe exploration, and intrinsic motivation as optimization over the space of achievable long-term behavior in RL; classical policy optimization methods (mirror descent, natural policy gradient, TRPO) generalize within this lens to nonlinear utilities and convex constraints, capturing robustness, safety, exploration, and diversity, with open geometric/deep-RL challenges ahead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reinforcement learning often treats reward maximization, safe exploration, and intrinsic motivation as separate objectives. A single geometric view over long-term achievable behavior can unify these goals, enable principled trade-offs, and extend optimization methods to handle nonlinear utilities and convex constraints.

Method: Propose a unified geometric framework on the space of achievable long-term behavior in an environment. Within this framework, interpret reward, safety, and intrinsic motivation as instances of a single optimization problem. Show that classical policy optimization methods—policy mirror descent, natural policy gradient, and trust-region algorithms—naturally generalize to nonlinear utilities and convex constraints. Demonstrate how robustness, safety, exploration, and diversity objectives arise under this perspective.

Result: The framework provides a cohesive lens that recovers and generalizes established RL optimization methods for a wide class of objectives, including nonlinear utilities and convex constraints. It clarifies how robustness, safety, exploration, and diversity can be integrated within a single geometric view, and offers a structured path for combining these objectives in deep RL.

Conclusion: The work highlights open challenges at the interface of geometry and deep RL and calls for further research to develop and apply the geometric perspective to more complex, deep RL settings.

Abstract: Reward maximization, safe exploration, and intrinsic motivation are often
studied as separate objectives in reinforcement learning (RL). We present a
unified geometric framework, that views these goals as instances of a single
optimization problem on the space of achievable long-term behavior in an
environment. Within this framework, classical methods such as policy mirror
descent, natural policy gradient, and trust-region algorithms naturally
generalize to nonlinear utilities and convex constraints. We illustrate how
this perspective captures robustness, safety, exploration, and diversity
objectives, and outline open challenges at the interface of geometry and deep
RL.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Experimental protocols for optimizer comparisons are inconsistent, hindering fair comparisons. A standardized benchmark is needed to guide practitioners and direct future research.

Method: Systematic evaluation of recent optimization techniques across standardized LLM pretraining setups, varying model size, batch size, and training duration; careful tuning of each method; release of code for reproducibility.

Result: Practical recommendations on which optimizer suits each scenario; identification of promising research directions; demonstration of reproducibility through code release.

Conclusion: Benchmarking and reproducibility are essential for advancing optimization methods in LLM pretraining; the study provides a reference for practitioners and researchers and a foundation for rigorous future work.

Abstract: The recent development of Large Language Models (LLMs) has been accompanied
by an effervescence of novel ideas and methods to better optimize the loss of

convergence to removing reliance on certain hyperparameters. However, the
diverse experimental protocols used to validate these claims make direct
comparisons between methods challenging. This study presents a comprehensive
evaluation of recent optimization techniques across standardized LLM
pretraining scenarios, systematically varying model size, batch size, and
training duration. Through careful tuning of each method, we provide guidance
to practitioners on which optimizer is best suited for each scenario. For
researchers, our work highlights promising directions for future optimization
research. Finally, by releasing our code and making all experiments fully
reproducible, we hope our efforts can help the development and rigorous
benchmarking of future methods.

### [509] [Hierarchical Motion Captioning Utilizing External Text Data Source](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01471)
*Clayton Leite,Yu Xiao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Incorporates large language models to generate detailed low-level annotations for high-level motion captions and uses a retrieval-based alignment with external text to improve motion-to-text captioning, achieving substantial gains over SOTA on three datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the lack of low-level motion descriptions and limited high-level captions in motion-text datasets by enriching annotations and leveraging external textual knowledge.

Method: 1) Use LLMs to produce detailed low-level descriptions for each high-level caption; 2) retrain motion-to-text models with refined annotations to produce captions with low-level detail; 3) apply a retrieval-based mechanism to align detailed captions with candidate high-level captions from external text sources, combining with motion features to generate precise high-level captions.

Result: Empirical evaluation on HumanML3D, KIT, and BOTH57M shows improvements in BLEU-1, BLEU-4, CIDEr, and ROUGE-L over state-of-the-art M2T-Interpretable, with gains ranging from 6% to 50%.

Conclusion: Leveraging external textual knowledge and hierarchical annotation substantially boosts motion captioning accuracy, including movements not covered in existing datasets.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel approach to enhance existing motion captioning
methods, which directly map representations of movement to high-level
descriptive captions (e.g., ``a person doing jumping jacks"). The existing
methods require motion data annotated with high-level descriptions (e.g.,
``jumping jacks"). However, such data is rarely available in existing
motion-text datasets, which additionally do not include low-level motion
descriptions. To address this, we propose a two-step hierarchical approach.
First, we employ large language models to create detailed descriptions
corresponding to each high-level caption that appears in the motion-text
datasets (e.g., ``jumping while synchronizing arm extensions with the opening
and closing of legs" for ``jumping jacks"). These refined annotations are used
to retrain motion-to-text models to produce captions with low-level details.
Second, we introduce a pioneering retrieval-based mechanism. It aligns the
detailed low-level captions with candidate high-level captions from additional
text data sources, and combine them with motion features to fabricate precise
high-level captions. Our methodology is distinctive in its ability to harness
knowledge from external text sources to greatly increase motion captioning
accuracy, especially for movements not covered in existing motion-text
datasets. Experiments on three distinct motion-text datasets (HumanML3D, KIT,
and BOTH57M) demonstrate that our method achieves an improvement in average
performance (across BLEU-1, BLEU-4, CIDEr, and ROUGE-L) ranging from 6% to 50%
compared to the state-of-the-art M2T-Interpretable.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PAFlow is a target-aware flow-based generative model for structure-based drug design that uses prior interaction guidance and an atom-number predictor to align chemistry with pocket geometry, achieving state-of-the-art binding affinity on CrossDocked2020.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address unstable probability dynamics and size-geometry mismatch in existing SBDD generative models, which cause inconsistent quality and off-target effects.

Method: Uses an efficient flow matching framework with a novel conditional flow matching for discrete atom types; incorporates a protein-ligand interaction predictor to guide the generation toward higher-affinity regions; introduces an atom number predictor based on protein pocket geometry to better match generated molecule size to targets.

Result: On CrossDocked2020, PAFlow achieves state-of-the-art binding affinity with Avg. Vina Score up to -8.31 while maintaining favorable molecular properties.

Conclusion: Target-aware flow-based generation with interaction guidance and adaptive molecule sizing advances SBDD, potentially reducing off-targets and improving quality and affinity of generated molecules.

Abstract: Structure-based drug design (SBDD), aiming to generate 3D molecules with high
binding affinity toward target proteins, is a vital approach in novel drug
discovery. Although recent generative models have shown great potential, they
suffer from unstable probability dynamics and mismatch between generated
molecule size and the protein pockets geometry, resulting in inconsistent
quality and off-target effects. We propose PAFlow, a novel target-aware
molecular generation model featuring prior interaction guidance and a learnable
atom number predictor. PAFlow adopts the efficient flow matching framework to
model the generation process and constructs a new form of conditional flow
matching for discrete atom types. A protein-ligand interaction predictor is
incorporated to guide the vector field toward higher-affinity regions during
generation, while an atom number predictor based on protein pocket information
is designed to better align generated molecule size with target geometry.
Extensive experiments on the CrossDocked2020 benchmark show that PAFlow
achieves a new state-of-the-art in binding affinity (up to -8.31 Avg. Vina
Score), simultaneously maintains favorable molecular properties.

### [511] [Unsupervised Identification and Replay-based Detection (UIRD) for New Category Anomaly Detection in ECG Signal](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01512)
*Zhangyue Shi,Zekai Wang,Yuxuan Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a pseudo-replay based semi-supervised continual learning framework for ECG anomaly detection to handle class imbalance and data storage limits, combining unsupervised GAN-based novelty detection with pseudo data replay to retain prior knowledge while detecting new anomalies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ECG anomaly detection suffers from class imbalance and rapid growth of data; storing all historical samples for continual learning is impractical; need a method that detects novel patterns while preserving performance on known classes and reduces storage.

Method: A two-component framework: (1) unsupervised identification using GAN-based approach to detect novel patterns; (2) pseudo-replay learning: a generator synthesizes pseudo-data representing previously learned classes for integration during training on new tasks, enabling detection of both old and new anomalies without storing raw data.

Result: Validated on four public ECG datasets; results show effective identification of novel anomalies and maintenance of strong detection performance on existing ECG signals; demonstrates promise for anomaly detection under class-imbalance and storage constraints.

Conclusion: The pseudo-replay semi-supervised continual learning framework offers a viable solution for ECG anomaly detection under practical constraints, combining novelty detection with memory-efficient rehearsal to manage evolving data distributions.

Abstract: In clinical practice, automatic analysis of electrocardiogram (ECG) is widely
applied to identify irregular heart rhythms and other electrical anomalies of
the heart, enabling timely intervention and potentially improving clinical
outcomes. However, due to the limited samples in certain types of ECG signals,
the class imbalance issues pose a challenge for ECG-based detection. In
addition, as the volume of patient data grows, long-term storage of all
historical data becomes increasingly burdensome as training samples to
recognize new patterns and classify existing ECG signals accurately. Therefore,
to enhance the performance of anomaly detection while addressing storage
limitations, we propose a pseudo-replay based semi-supervised continual
learning framework, which consists of two components: unsupervised
identification and replay-based detection. For unsupervised identification, an
unsupervised generative adversarial network (GAN)-based framework is integrated
to detect novel patterns. Besides, instead of directly storing all historical
data, a pseudo replay-based learning strategy is proposed which utilizes a
generator to learn the data distribution for each individual task. When a new
task arises, the generator synthesizes pseudo data representative of previous
learnt classes, enabling the model to detect both the existed patterns and the
newly presented anomalies. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is
validated in four public ECG datasets, which leverages supervised
classification problems for anomaly detection. The experimental results show
that the developed approach is very promising in identifying novel anomalies
while maintaining good performance on detecting existing ECG signals.

*Mingzhi Dai,Weiwei Cai,Xiang Feng,Huiqun Yu,Weibin Guo,Miao Guo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DE-BP (differential evolution-optimized backpropagation neural network) accurately predicts microbial composition in activated sludge (AS) across global WWTPs. A novel clustering method, DPNG-EPMC, analyzes WWTPs by feature attributes. SiTime-GAN generates synthetic microbial compositions and features. Together, they reveal factors shaping AS communities and enable data-driven microbiome engineering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Microbiomes drive biogeochemical cycles and engineering of ecosystems (soil, wastewater, human gut). Improving microbiome control in WWTPs can enhance treatment efficiency and ecological understanding.

Method: 1) Train a differential evolution-optimized backpropagation neural network (DE-BP) to predict microbial composition in activated sludge from WWTPs worldwide. 2) Apply a novel clustering algorithm—Direction Nonlinear Emotional Preference Migration Clustering (DPNG-EPMC)—to cluster WWTPs by multiple feature attributes. 3) Use a Similar Time GAN (SiTime-GAN) to synthesize new microbial compositions and feature data.

Result: DE-BP achieves superior predictive performance for microbial composition. DPNG-EPMC provides a meaningful clustering of WWTPs across feature attributes. SiTime-GAN yields valuable incremental synthetic data, expanding the dataset for modeling.

Conclusion: Integrating DE-BP, DPNG-EPMC, and SiTime-GAN advances understanding of factors shaping activated sludge communities and offers tools for improved microbiome engineering and data augmentation in WWTP contexts.

Abstract: Microbiomes not only underpin Earth's biogeochemical cycles but also play
crucial roles in both engineered and natural ecosystems, such as the soil,
wastewater treatment, and the human gut. However, microbiome engineering faces
significant obstacles to surmount to deliver the desired improvements in
microbiome control. Here, we use the backpropagation neural network (BPNN),
optimized through differential evolution (DE-BP), to predict the microbial
composition of activated sludge (AS) systems collected from wastewater
treatment plants (WWTPs) located worldwide. Furthermore, we introduce a novel
clustering algorithm termed Directional Position Nonlinear Emotional Preference
Migration Behavior Clustering (DPNG-EPMC). This method is applied to conduct a
clustering analysis of WWTPs across various feature attributes. Finally, we
employ the Similar Time Generative Adversarial Networks (SiTime-GAN), to
synthesize novel microbial compositions and feature attributes data. As a
result, we demonstrate that the DE-BP model can provide superior predictions of
the microbial composition. Additionally, we show that the DPNG-EPMC can be
applied to the analysis of WWTPs under various feature attributes. Finally, we
demonstrate that the SiTime-GAN model can generate valuable incremental
synthetic data. Our results, obtained through predicting the microbial
community and conducting analysis of WWTPs under various feature attributes,
develop an understanding of the factors influencing AS communities.

*Jiao Chen,Jiayi He,Fangfang Chen,Zuohong Lv,Jianhua Tang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FoRo is a forward-only, gradient-free continual learning method that uses CMA-ES-based prompt tuning and a nonlinear projection + recursive least squares knowledge encoding to incrementally update classifiers on pre-trained models, reducing forgetting and resource usage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Catastrophic forgetting in continual learning with pre-trained models and the inefficiency of gradient-based fine-tuning in resource-constrained settings; a non-backprop, efficient alternative is sought.

Method: Insert input-layer prompt embeddings optimized via CMA-ES; create a knowledge encoding matrix through nonlinear random projection and recursive least squares, enabling incremental classifier updates without revisiting prior data; forward-only learning.

Result: Significant reduction in average forgetting and improved accuracy; lower memory usage and shorter run time across long task sequences.

Conclusion: FoRo presents a promising direction for efficient continual learning with pre-trained models, particularly in real-world multimedia applications where computation and memory constraints are critical.

Abstract: Catastrophic forgetting remains a central challenge in continual learning
(CL) with pre-trained models. While existing approaches typically freeze the
backbone and fine-tune a small number of parameters to mitigate forgetting,
they still rely on iterative error backpropagation and gradient-based
optimization, which can be computationally intensive and less suitable for
resource-constrained environments. To address this, we propose FoRo, a
forward-only, gradient-free continual learning method. FoRo consists of a
lightweight prompt tuning strategy and a novel knowledge encoding mechanism,
both designed without modifying the pre-trained model. Specifically, prompt
embeddings are inserted at the input layer and optimized using the Covariance
Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES), which mitigates distribution
shifts and extracts high-quality task representations. Subsequently,
task-specific knowledge is encoded into a knowledge encoding matrix via
nonlinear random projection and recursive least squares, enabling incremental
updates to the classifier without revisiting prior data. Experiments show that
FoRo significantly reduces average forgetting and improves accuracy. Thanks to
forward-only learning, FoRo reduces memory usage and run time while maintaining
high knowledge retention across long task sequences. These results suggest that
FoRo could serve as a promising direction for exploring continual learning with
pre-trained models, especially in real-world multimedia applications where both
efficiency and effectiveness are critical.

### [514] [Graph Contrastive Learning versus Untrained Baselines: The Role of Dataset Size](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01541)
*Smayan Khanna,Doruk Efe Gökmen,Risi Kondor,Vincenzo Vitelli*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GCL’s claimed advantages are not universal; performance is highly dataset-size and task-dependent. On standard benchmarks, untrained baselines can match or beat GCL; on ogbg-molhiv, GCL helps only after thousands of graphs and then plateaus; on synthetic data, GCL scales roughly with log of the dataset size and the gap to untrained models depends on task difficulty. This calls for benchmarks that account for dataset size and methods that avoid performance plateaus.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To critically evaluate whether Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) truly outperforms simple or untrained baselines and to understand how dataset size and task difficulty shape its effectiveness.

Method: Empirical comparison across multiple datasets: standard graph benchmarks, the large molecular dataset ogbg-molhiv, and synthetic datasets. The study compares GCL against untrained GNNs, simple MLPs, and handcrafted statistics, and analyzes performance as a function of dataset size and task complexity.

Result: On standard datasets, untrained baselines rival or exceed GCL. On ogbg-molhiv, GCL lags at small scales but surpasses untrained baselines after a few thousand graphs and then plateaus. On synthetic data, GCL accuracy grows roughly with log(number of graphs) and the performance gap relative to untrained models varies with task complexity.

Conclusion: Benchmarking GCL requires accounting for dataset size and task difficulty; researchers should design GCL methods to avoid plateaued gains and focus on data-efficient benefits, ensuring claims of superiority are justified across realistic data regimes.

Abstract: Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) has emerged as a leading paradigm for self-
supervised learning on graphs, with strong performance reported on standardized
datasets and growing applications ranging from genomics to drug discovery. We
ask a basic question: does GCL actually outperform untrained baselines? We find
that GCL's advantage depends strongly on dataset size and task difficulty. On
standard datasets, untrained Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), simple multilayer
perceptrons, and even handcrafted statistics can rival or exceed GCL. On the
large molecular dataset ogbg-molhiv, we observe a crossover: GCL lags at small
scales but pulls ahead beyond a few thousand graphs, though this gain
eventually plateaus. On synthetic datasets, GCL accuracy approximately scales
with the logarithm of the number of graphs and its performance gap (compared
with untrained GNNs) varies with respect to task complexity. Moving forward, it
is crucial to identify the role of dataset size in benchmarks and applications,
as well as to design GCL algorithms that avoid performance plateaus.

### [515] [Feynman-Kac-Flow: Inference Steering of Conditional Flow Matching to an Energy-Tilted Posterior](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01543)
*Konstantin Mark,Leonard Galustian,Maximilian P. -P. Kovar,Esther Heid*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces Feynman-Kac steering for Conditional Flow Matching (CFM) to steer samples via an energy potential, enabling tilted distributions and chiral transition-state generation; provides code.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extend steering techniques from diffusion models to flow-matching generative models, enabling targeted sample generation and respecting geometric/handedness constraints in chemical reactions.

Method: Derive and apply Feynman-Kac steering for CFM by tilting outputs with an energy potential; evaluate on synthetic high-dimensional tasks and chemical reaction transition states; release open-source implementation.

Result: Demonstrates that Feynman-Kac steering can steer CFM to tilted distributions and generate correct chiral transition states, improving sample quality under constraints; code available.

Conclusion: Feynman-Kac steering is a viable approach for steering flow-matching models; broadens applicability to constrained generative tasks; potential impact on chemistry and related fields.

Abstract: Conditional Flow Matching(CFM) represents a fast and high-quality approach to
generative modelling, but in many applications it is of interest to steer the
generated samples towards precise requirements. While steering approaches like
gradient-based guidance, sequential Monte Carlo steering or Feynman-Kac
steering are well established for diffusion models, they have not been extended
to flow matching approaches yet. In this work, we formulate this requirement as
tilting the output with an energy potential. We derive, for the first time,
Feynman-Kac steering for CFM. We evaluate our approach on a set of synthetic
tasks, including the generation of tilted distributions in a high-dimensional
space, which is a particularly challenging case for steering approaches. We
then demonstrate the impact of Feynman-Kac steered CFM on the previously
unsolved challenge of generated transition states of chemical reactions with
the correct chirality, where the reactants or products can have a different
handedness, leading to geometric constraints of the viable reaction pathways
connecting reactants and products. Code to reproduce this study is avaiable
open-source at https://github.com/heid-lab/fkflow.

### [516] [Model Unmerging: Making Your Models Unmergeable for Secure Model Sharing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01548)
*Zihao Wang,Enneng Yang,Lu Yin,Shiwei Liu,Li Shen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MergeLock is an active protective mechanism that disrupts model parameters to prevent unauthorized model merging. It uses random invertible transformations on the QK and VO branches in Transformer models, exploiting attentional symmetry to keep outputs unchanged while moving the model away from other finetuned models’ shared parameter space. It degrades merged model performance significantly (often >95%) and resists low-cost restoration, with experiments across vision and language tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As more finetuned expert models become publicly available, unauthorized model merging poses risks to developers' rights and user privacy. Existing detection methods fail to prevent illegal merging; there is a need for an active protection mechanism that can render merging ineffective.

Method: Apply two pairs of random invertible matrices to the Query-Key (QK) and Value-Output (VO) branches of Transformer-based models. Leveraging the symmetry of attention, these transforms keep the model’s output unchanged while pushing its parameters away from the shared space used by other finetuned models, thereby making merged models unmergeable.

Result: Merged models involving a MergeLock-protected model experience substantial performance degradation (over 95% in many cases). Moreover, such protected models are difficult to recover through low-cost restoration methods, indicating robustness against unauthorized merging.

Conclusion: MergeLock provides an effective active defense against unauthorized model merging, demonstrated across vision and language tasks, and is resistant to simple restoration approaches. The approach highlights a new direction for safeguarding model IP and user privacy during multi-task model construction.

Abstract: Model merging leverages multiple finetuned expert models to construct a
multi-task model with low cost, and is gaining increasing attention. However,
as a growing number of finetuned models become publicly available, concerns
about the safety of model merging have emerged. Unauthorized merging may
infringe on developers' rights and risk leaking sensitive personal information.
Most existing methods focus on detecting whether a merged model originates from
a specific source model, but fail to effectively prevent illegal merging. In
this paper, we propose MergeLock, an active protection mechanism that disrupts
model parameters to render them unmergeable, thereby directly preventing
unauthorized model merging. Specifically, leveraging the inherent symmetry of
the attention mechanism in Transformer-based models, we randomly sample two
pairs of invertible matrices and apply them to the Query-Key (QK) and
Value-Output (VO) branches. This transformation keeps the model's output
unchanged while pushing it away from the shared parameter space of other
finetuned models. Extensive experiments across both vision and language tasks
demonstrate that MergeLock can degrade the performance of merged models by over
95% when a protected model is involved in most cases, demonstrating its
effectiveness. Moreover, we further demonstrate that merged models protected by
MergeLock cannot be effectively recovered using low-cost restoration methods,
further enhancing robustness against unauthorized merging. The code is
available at https://github.com/hetailang/Merge-Lock.

### [517] [Direct Profit Estimation Using Uplift Modeling under Clustered Network Interference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01558)
*Bram van den Akker*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A practical, interference-aware uplift modeling framework using differentiable AddIPW as the learning objective to optimize incremental profit, showing strong gains over interference-naive methods and enabling profit-centric incentive personalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Interference among items violates SUTVA in uplift modeling, undermining the effectiveness of promotions in recommender systems. Existing AddIPW techniques are not yet leveraged in uplift literature, and there is a need to optimize policies under interference to improve profitability.

Method: Model uses AddIPW as a differentiable learning objective for gradient-based optimization. It integrates with response transformation techniques to directly optimize economic outcomes like incremental profit, and evaluates performance via simulations that vary interference strength.

Result: The interference-aware approach significantly outperforms interference-naive baselines, with gains increasing as interference effects grow. Profit-centric uplift strategies within this framework identify higher-impact interventions.

Conclusion: The paper provides a practical pathway to more profitable incentive personalization by bridging AddIPW-based interference handling with uplift modeling, enabling direct optimization of economic outcomes in interference-prone environments.

Abstract: Uplift modeling is a key technique for promotion optimization in recommender
systems, but standard methods typically fail to account for interference, where
treating one item affects the outcomes of others. This violation of the Stable
Unit Treatment Value Assumption (SUTVA) leads to suboptimal policies in
real-world marketplaces. Recent developments in interference-aware estimators
such as Additive Inverse Propensity Weighting (AddIPW) have not found their way
into the uplift modeling literature yet, and optimising policies using these
estimators is not well-established. This paper proposes a practical methodology
to bridge this gap. We use the AddIPW estimator as a differentiable learning
objective suitable for gradient-based optimization. We demonstrate how this
framework can be integrated with proven response transformation techniques to
directly optimize for economic outcomes like incremental profit. Through
simulations, we show that our approach significantly outperforms
interference-naive methods, especially as interference effects grow.
Furthermore, we find that adapting profit-centric uplift strategies within our
framework can yield superior performance in identifying the highest-impact
interventions, offering a practical path toward more profitable incentive
personalization.

*Louis Simon,Mohamed Chetouani*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces Ema2Vec, a time-embedding method to handle irregularly spaced ecological momentary assessments (EMAs) for longitudinal stress prediction, outperforming fixed-window baselines and non-time-aware sequence models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address missing data and irregular timing in EMA-based longitudinal monitoring of affect, mood disorders, and stress, by capturing time dependencies in sequences.

Method: Proposes Ema2Vec time embeddings designed for irregularly spaced self-reports; evaluates on a longitudinal stress prediction task and compares against fixed-size daily-window baselines and models trained directly on longitudinal sequences without time-aware representations.

Result: Ema2Vec outperforms standard stress prediction baselines and irregular-data handling approaches, demonstrating the value of time-aware representations in irregularly sampled longitudinal data.

Conclusion: Incorporating time embeddings is beneficial for modeling irregular, longitudinal EMA data; Ema2Vec provides an effective approach for stress prediction and similar tasks.

Abstract: The widespread adoption of mobile and wearable sensing technologies has
enabled continuous and personalized monitoring of affect, mood disorders, and
stress. When combined with ecological self-report questionnaires, these systems
offer a powerful opportunity to explore longitudinal modeling of human
behaviors. However, challenges arise from missing data and the irregular timing
of self-reports, which make challenging the prediction of human states and
behaviors. In this study, we investigate the use of time embeddings to capture
time dependencies within sequences of Ecological Momentary Assessments (EMA).
We introduce a novel time embedding method, Ema2Vec, designed to effectively
handle irregularly spaced self-reports, and evaluate it on a new task of
longitudinal stress prediction. Our method outperforms standard stress
prediction baselines that rely on fixed-size daily windows, as well as models
trained directly on longitudinal sequences without time-aware representations.
These findings emphasize the importance of incorporating time embeddings when
modeling irregularly sampled longitudinal data.

### [519] [One-Shot Clustering for Federated Learning Under Clustering-Agnostic Assumption](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01587)
*Maciej Krzysztof Zuziak,Roberto Pellungrini,Salvatore Rinzivillo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: One-Shot Clustered Federated Learning (OCFL) automatically detects when to cluster by measuring gradient cosine distance and a temperature-based convergence metric, enabling effective CFL without hyperparameter tuning, with strong empirical results and explanations via GradCAM.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clustering in Clustered Federated Learning (CFL) is sensitive to when and how to cluster, often requiring manual tuning. This work seeks a clustering-agnostic, automatic signal to trigger clustering, improving practicality and personalization while reducing hyperparameter dependence, and exploring explainability.

Method: Proposes OCFL, a clustering-agnostic algorithm that uses the cosine distance between client gradients and a temperature measure signaling convergence to determine the earliest clustering moment. Evaluates one-shot clustering strategies across 40 tasks on 5 benchmark datasets. Also analyzes density-based clustering effectiveness on gradients to distinguish loss surfaces from different distributions and inspects local explanations with GradCAM to relate personalization to explainability.

Result: OCFL demonstrates strong performance in automated CFL without hyperparameter adjustment. Density-based gradient clustering effectively differentiates neural loss surfaces across data distributions. GradCAM-based analyses provide insights into the trade-off between personalization and explainability, supporting the practical feasibility of gradient-based CFL.

Conclusion: OCFL is an effective, automated, clustering-agnostic approach for CFL that reduces manual tuning, validates gradient- and density-based clustering for CFL, and offers explainability insights through GradCAM analyses.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a widespread and well-adopted paradigm of
decentralised learning that allows training one model from multiple sources
without the need to transfer data between participating clients directly. Since
its inception in 2015, it has been divided into numerous subfields that deal
with application-specific issues, such as data heterogeneity or resource
allocation. One such sub-field, Clustered Federated Learning (CFL), deals with
the problem of clustering the population of clients into separate cohorts to
deliver personalised models. Although a few remarkable works have been
published in this domain, the problem remains largely unexplored, as its basic
assumptions and settings differ slightly from those of standard FL. In this
work, we present One-Shot Clustered Federated Learning (OCFL), a
clustering-agnostic algorithm that can automatically detect the earliest
suitable moment for clustering. Our algorithm is based on computing the cosine
distance between the gradients of the clients and a temperature measure that
detects when the federated model starts to converge. We empirically evaluate
our methodology by testing various one-shot clustering algorithms for over
forty different tasks on five benchmark datasets. Our experiments showcase the
good performance of our approach when used to perform CFL in an automated
manner without the need to adjust hyperparameters. We also revisit the
practical feasibility of CFL algorithms based on the gradients of the clients,
providing firm evidence of the high efficiency of density-based clustering
methods when used to differentiate between the loss surfaces of neural networks
trained on different distributions. Moreover, by inspecting the feasibility of
local explanations generated with the help of GradCAM, we can provide more
insights into the relationship between personalisation and the explainability
of local predictions.

### [520] [Entropy-Driven Curriculum for Multi-Task Training in Human Mobility Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01613)
*Tianye Fang,Xuanshu Luo,Martin Werner*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A unified training framework that combines entropy-driven curriculum learning with multi-task objectives (location, distance, direction) for mobility prediction, achieving state-of-the-art metrics and faster convergence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the diverse complexity of mobility data that causes inefficient training and underfitting, and to move beyond predicting only the next location by incorporating distance and direction as auxiliary targets for more realistic mobility modeling.

Method: Entropy-driven curriculum learning based on Lempel-Ziv compression to quantify trajectory predictability and gradually increase task difficulty; multi-task learning jointly optimizes location prediction with auxiliary estimates of movement distance and direction.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art GEO-BLEU (0.354) and DTW (26.15) on HuMob Challenge with up to 2.92× faster convergence compared to training without curriculum learning.

Conclusion: The proposed framework improves convergence speed and predictive accuracy by aligning training complexity with trajectory predictability and by leveraging auxiliary tasks that promote realistic mobility patterns.

Abstract: The increasing availability of big mobility data from ubiquitous portable
devices enables human mobility prediction through deep learning approaches.
However, the diverse complexity of human mobility data impedes model training,
leading to inefficient gradient updates and potential underfitting. Meanwhile,
exclusively predicting next locations neglects implicit determinants, including
distances and directions, thereby yielding suboptimal prediction results. This
paper presents a unified training framework that integrates entropy-driven
curriculum and multi-task learning to address these challenges. The proposed
entropy-driven curriculum learning strategy quantifies trajectory
predictability based on Lempel-Ziv compression and organizes training from
simple to complex for faster convergence and enhanced performance. The
multi-task training simultaneously optimizes the primary location prediction
alongside auxiliary estimation of movement distance and direction for learning
realistic mobility patterns, and improve prediction accuracy through
complementary supervision signals. Extensive experiments conducted in
accordance with the HuMob Challenge demonstrate that our approach achieves
state-of-the-art performance on GEO-BLEU (0.354) and DTW (26.15) metrics with
up to 2.92-fold convergence speed compared to training without curriculum
learning.

### [521] [Effects of Distributional Biases on Gradient-Based Causal Discovery in the Bivariate Categorical Case](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01621)
*Tim Schwabe,Moritz Lange,Laurenz Wiskott,Maribel Acosta*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Gradient-based causal discovery is vulnerable to two distributional biases (Marginal Distribution Asymmetry and Marginal Distribution Shift Asymmetry) that skew learned factorizations. Using synthetic Dirichlet-prior data, the authors show these biases arise in simple models that learn marginal or conditional distributions, and demonstrate control strategies. Removing competition between possible causal factorizations improves robustness; some existing methods remain robust under such modification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how distributional biases in data affect gradient-based causal discovery and to identify conditions under which these methods can be biased, as well as practical ways to mitigate such biases.

Method: The authors identify two biases in a bivariate categorical setup with Dirichlet priors. They analyze two simple gradient-based models that derive causal factorizations by learning marginal or conditional distributions. They illustrate how these models are susceptible to the biases and explore ways to control them. They also empirically evaluate two related existing approaches to assess robustness when competition between causal factorizations is eliminated.

Result: Biases can occur even in controlled synthetic data. Biases can be controlled, and eliminating competition between possible causal factorizations can make models robust to these biases. An empirical evaluation of related approaches suggests robustness improves when factorization competition is removed.

Conclusion: Gradient-based causal discovery can be sensitive to distributional biases, but robustness can be achieved by careful design choices that reduce competition between factorizations and by controlling priors; the work points to bias-aware strategies for more reliable causal factorization learning.

Abstract: Gradient-based causal discovery shows great potential for deducing causal
structure from data in an efficient and scalable way. Those approaches however
can be susceptible to distributional biases in the data they are trained on. We
identify two such biases: Marginal Distribution Asymmetry, where differences in
entropy skew causal learning toward certain factorizations, and Marginal
Distribution Shift Asymmetry, where repeated interventions cause faster shifts
in some variables than in others. For the bivariate categorical setup with
Dirichlet priors, we illustrate how these biases can occur even in controlled
synthetic data. To examine their impact on gradient-based methods, we employ
two simple models that derive causal factorizations by learning marginal or
conditional data distributions - a common strategy in gradient-based causal
discovery. We demonstrate how these models can be susceptible to both biases.
We additionally show how the biases can be controlled. An empirical evaluation
of two related, existing approaches indicates that eliminating competition
between possible causal factorizations can make models robust to the presented
biases.

*Tristan Deleu,Padideh Nouri,Yoshua Bengio,Doina Precup*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RTB in GFlowNets is equivalent to Trust-PCL KL-regularized RL; this unifies RTB under KL-regularized RL theory and shows KL-regularized RL achieves similar gains on an RTB example.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clarify theoretical placement of RTB, link GFlowNets with maximum-entropy RL, and assess whether RTB's performance is unique or replicable by KL-regularized RL methods.

Method: Prove equivalence between RTB and Trust-PCL; discuss relation to max-entropy RL; re-examine RTB example and compare KL-regularized RL methods' performance.

Result: Proved equivalence; positioned RTB within KL-regularized RL framework; demonstrated comparable performance of KL-regularized RL to RTB on a representative example.

Conclusion: RTB is encompassed by KL-regularized RL; this provides theoretical grounding and suggests similar performance can be achieved by existing KL-regularized RL approaches, offering a new perspective on RTB's claimed advantages.

Abstract: Recent progress in generative modeling has highlighted the importance of
Reinforcement Learning (RL) for fine-tuning, with KL-regularized methods in
particular proving to be highly effective for both autoregressive and diffusion
models. Complementing this line of work, the Relative Trajectory Balance (RTB)
objective was recently introduced in the context of Generative Flow Networks
(GFlowNets) to serve the same role of improving fine-tuning in sequential
generative models. Building on prior work linking GFlowNets and maximum-entropy
RL, we establish in this paper an equivalence between RTB and Trust-PCL, an
off-policy RL method with KL regularization. This equivalence situates RTB
within the broader theoretical landscape of KL-regularized RL, and clarifies
its relationship to earlier methods. Leveraging this insight, we revisit an
illustrative example from the RTB paper and show that KL-regularized RL methods
achieve comparable performance, offering an alternative perspective to what was
previously reported.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Multimodal cognitive load detection is advanced with a new real-world gaming dataset built on the n-back task; multimodal models outperform unimodal baselines, but cross-domain transfer shows significant degradation, highlighting challenges to universal cognitive load estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses limited generalizability and robustness of cognitive load models by extending benchmarks to real-world tasks and multiple modalities, and by evaluating cross-domain transfer.

Method: Create a new multimodal dataset extending cognitive load benchmarks with a real-world gaming scenario using the n-back paradigm. Annotate task load with objective performance, NASA-TLX, and task-level design. Train and evaluate end-to-end models (xLSTM, ConvNeXt, Transformer) across modalities and domains to assess predictive performance and cross-domain generalization.

Result: Multimodal approaches consistently outperform unimodal baselines; model performance and the impact of specific modalities vary by application subset; models trained on one domain show reduced performance when transferred to new applications.

Conclusion: Provides robust baselines and actionable insights for developing more generalizable cognitive load detection systems, advancing research and practical adoption in HCI and adaptive systems.

Abstract: Task load detection is essential for optimizing human performance across
diverse applications, yet current models often lack generalizability beyond
narrow experimental domains. While prior research has focused on individual
tasks and limited modalities, there remains a gap in evaluating model
robustness and transferability in real-world scenarios. This paper addresses
these limitations by introducing a new multimodal dataset that extends
established cognitive load detection benchmarks with a real-world gaming
application, using the $n$-back test as a scientific foundation. Task load
annotations are derived from objective performance, subjective NASA-TLX
ratings, and task-level design, enabling a comprehensive evaluation framework.
State-of-the-art end-to-end model, including xLSTM, ConvNeXt, and Transformer
architectures are systematically trained and evaluated on multiple modalities
and application domains to assess their predictive performance and cross-domain
generalization. Results demonstrate that multimodal approaches consistently
outperform unimodal baselines, with specific modalities and model architectures
showing varying impact depending on the application subset. Importantly, models
trained on one domain exhibit reduced performance when transferred to novel
applications, underscoring remaining challenges for universal cognitive load
estimation. These findings provide robust baselines and actionable insights for
developing more generalizable cognitive load detection systems, advancing both
research and practical implementation in human-computer interaction and
adaptive systems.

*Sachin Goyal,David Lopez-Paz,Kartik Ahuja*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Distilled pretraining improves test-time scaling in LLMs but harms in-context learning; a bigram-model sandbox helps identify the underlying factor and informs practical pretraining design choices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how distillation—recently revived in LLM pretraining—affects test-time scaling and in-context learning, and to derive actionable guidelines for practitioners.

Method: Empirical study of distillation in large-language-model pretraining (e.g., Llama-3.2, Gemma) focusing on test-time scaling and in-context learning; ablations to identify causal factors; a sandbox experiment with a bigram model to isolate the core mechanism behind observed effects.

Result: Distillation yields notably better test-time scaling but degrades in-context learning, particularly the induction-head mechanism; the bigram sandbox supports a common factor underlying these effects; results inform pretraining design choices to balance these trade-offs.

Conclusion: Distillation offers a trade-off: gains in test-time scaling at the cost of certain in-context learning abilities. Practitioners should align distillation use with their goals and consider design adjustments to mitigate in-context-learning losses.

Abstract: In the past year, distillation has seen a renewed prominence in large
language model (LLM) pretraining, exemplified by the Llama-3.2 and Gemma model
families. While distillation has historically been shown to improve statistical
modeling, its effects on new paradigms that are key to modern LLMs, such as
test-time scaling and in-context learning, remain underexplored. In this work,
we make three main contributions. First, we show that pretraining with
distillation yields models that exhibit remarkably better test-time scaling.
Second, we observe that this benefit comes with a trade-off: distillation
impairs in-context learning capabilities, particularly the one modeled via
induction heads. Third, to demystify these findings, we study distilled
pretraining in a sandbox of a bigram model, which helps us isolate the common
principal factor behind our observations. Finally, using these insights, we
shed light on various design choices for pretraining that should help
practitioners going forward.

### [525] [Efficient Transformer-Inspired Variants of Physics-Informed Deep Operator Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01679)
*Zhi-Feng Wei,Wenqian Chen,Panos Stinis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Transformer-inspired cross-conditioned DeepONet variants can match or exceed the accuracy of modified DeepONet while improving training efficiency across four PDE benchmarks (advection, diffusion-reaction, Burgers', KdV). Effectiveness depends on the equation's characteristics; validated with nonparametric statistics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the accuracy and training efficiency of operator-learning DeepONets while preserving the vanilla simplicity, by introducing transformer-like bidirectional cross-conditioning between branch and trunk networks.

Method: Propose a series of Transformer-inspired DeepONet variants that enable bidirectional cross-conditioning. Inject query-point information into the branch network and input-function information into the trunk network, in a non-intrusive manner. Evaluate on four PDE benchmarks (advection, diffusion-reaction, Burgers', KdV). Compare against vanilla and modified DeepONets. Use rigorous statistical analyses (Wilcoxon signed-rank test, Glass’s delta, Spearman rank correlation) to assess robustness.

Result: For each equation, at least one variant matches or surpasses the accuracy of the modified DeepONet, while offering improved training efficiency. The best-performing variant for a given equation aligns with the equation’s underlying characteristics, indicating cross-conditioning effectiveness is problem-dependent.

Conclusion: Cross-conditioning between branch and trunk networks provides a robust, non-intrusive way to enhance DeepONet performance in an equation-dependent manner. The approach preserves the simplicity of vanilla DeepONet while achieving accuracy comparable to or better than the modified version, with validation across multiple PDEs using rigorous nonparametric statistics.

Abstract: Operator learning has emerged as a promising tool for accelerating the
solution of partial differential equations (PDEs). The Deep Operator Networks
(DeepONets) represent a pioneering framework in this area: the "vanilla"
DeepONet is valued for its simplicity and efficiency, while the modified
DeepONet achieves higher accuracy at the cost of increased training time. In
this work, we propose a series of Transformer-inspired DeepONet variants that
introduce bidirectional cross-conditioning between the branch and trunk
networks in DeepONet. Query-point information is injected into the branch
network and input-function information into the trunk network, enabling dynamic
dependencies while preserving the simplicity and efficiency of the "vanilla"
DeepONet in a non-intrusive manner. Experiments on four PDE benchmarks --
advection, diffusion-reaction, Burgers', and Korteweg-de Vries equations --
show that for each case, there exists a variant that matches or surpasses the
accuracy of the modified DeepONet while offering improved training efficiency.
Moreover, the best-performing variant for each equation aligns naturally with
the equation's underlying characteristics, suggesting that the effectiveness of
cross-conditioning depends on the characteristics of the equation and its
underlying physics. To ensure robustness, we validate the effectiveness of our
variants through a range of rigorous statistical analyses, among them the
Wilcoxon Two One-Sided Test, Glass's Delta, and Spearman's rank correlation.

*Sherry Yang,Joy He-Yueya,Percy Liang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Smaller RL-tuned models can beat larger prompting-based agents. The paper introduces duration-aware gradient updates for asynchronous RL with variable-action durations and environment instrumentation to provide partial credit via a separate LM that inserts log statements. On MLEBench/Kaggle tasks, a 2.5B-3B model trained with RL outperforms a large prompting-based agent by ~22% on average across 12 tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current ML engineering agents rely on prompting powerful LMs, which do not improve with experience. The authors aim to enable learning from experience by combining RL with weaker models to achieve better results and data-efficiency.

Method: 1) Distributed asynchronous RL with duration-aware gradient updates to handle variable-action durations, emphasizing high-cost/high-reward actions. 2) Environment instrumentation using a separate static language model to insert print statements into programs, enabling partial-credit rewards based on experimental progress.

Result: RL training on a much smaller model (Qwen2.5-3B) outperforms prompting a larger model (Claude-3.5-Sonnet) with scaffolds by an average of 22% across 12 Kaggle tasks on MLEBench.

Conclusion: RL-enabled agents with smaller models, augmented by duration-aware updates and partial-credit signals from environment instrumentation, can surpass larger static-model agents in ML engineering tasks, improving learning efficiency and performance.

Abstract: Existing agents for solving tasks such as ML engineering rely on prompting
powerful language models. As a result, these agents do not improve with more
experience. In this paper, we show that agents backed by weaker models that
improve via reinforcement learning (RL) can outperform agents backed by much
larger, but static models. We identify two major challenges with RL in this
setting. First, actions can take a variable amount of time (e.g., executing
code for different solutions), which leads to asynchronous policy gradient
updates that favor faster but suboptimal solutions. To tackle variable-duration
actions, we propose duration- aware gradient updates in a distributed
asynchronous RL framework to amplify high-cost but high-reward actions. Second,
using only test split performance as a reward provides limited feedback. A
program that is nearly correct is treated the same as one that fails entirely.
To address this, we propose environment instrumentation to offer partial
credit, distinguishing almost-correct programs from those that fail early
(e.g., during data loading). Environment instrumentation uses a separate static
language model to insert print statement to an existing program to log the
agent's experimental progress, from which partial credit can be extracted as
reward signals for learning. Our experimental results on MLEBench suggest that
performing gradient updates on a much smaller model (Qwen2.5-3B) trained with
RL outperforms prompting a much larger model (Claude-3.5-Sonnet) with agent
scaffolds, by an average of 22% across 12 Kaggle tasks.

### [527] [Robust Anomaly Detection through Multi-Modal Autoencoder Fusion for Small Vehicle Damage Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01719)
*Sara Khan,Mehmed Yüksel,Frank Kirchner*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A multi-modal anomaly-detection framework using windshield-mounted IMU and microphone data with autoencoder ensembles for real-time wear/damage detection in fleets; achieves ROC-AUC 92% on robust evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome labor-intensive manual inspections and limitations of image-based damage detection, particularly underbody damage and real-time performance constraints in rental/car-sharing fleets.

Method: Developed multiple multi-modal autoencoder variants fusing IMU and audio signals from a windshield-mounted device; compared unimodal, multi-modal, and state-of-the-art baselines; used ensemble pooling to fuse modalities and optimize real-time performance.

Result: Ensemble multi-modal model achieved ROC-AUC of 92%, outperforming baselines and unimodal variants, demonstrating real-world applicability and real-time capability.

Conclusion: Proposes a practical, resource-efficient approach for wear/damage detection with potential extensions to automotive safety systems (e.g., airbags) and augmented sensor fusion for autonomous vehicles.

Abstract: Wear and tear detection in fleet and shared vehicle systems is a critical
challenge, particularly in rental and car-sharing services, where minor damage,
such as dents, scratches, and underbody impacts, often goes unnoticed or is
detected too late. Currently, manual inspection methods are the default
approach but are labour intensive and prone to human error. In contrast,
state-of-the-art image-based methods struggle with real-time performance and
are less effective at detecting underbody damage due to limited visual access
and poor spatial coverage. This work introduces a novel multi-modal
architecture based on anomaly detection to address these issues. Sensors such
as IMUs and microphones are integrated into a compact device mounted on the
vehicle's windshield. This approach supports real-time damage detection while
avoiding the need for highly resource-intensive sensors. We developed multiple
variants of multi-modal autoencoder-based architectures and evaluated them
against unimodal and state-of-the-art methods. Our ensemble pooling multi-modal
model achieved the highest performance, with a Receiver Operating
Characteristic-Area Under Curve (ROC-AUC) of 92%, demonstrating its
effectiveness in real-world applications. This approach can also be extended to
other applications, such as improving automotive safety - where it can
integrate with airbag systems for efficient deployment - and helping autonomous
vehicles by complementing other sensors in collision detection.

*Georgios Papoudakis,Thomas Coste,Jianye Hao,Jun Wang,Kun Shao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SoLS is a new off-policy RL algorithm that updates positive, high-return samples directly (no regularization) and applies conservative, regularised updates for negative samples, augmented by Successful Transition Replay (STR). It substantially improves sample efficiency for fine-tuning foundation-model policies in mobile UI navigation, outperforming baselines by at least 17% on AndroidWorld with far lower compute than GPT-4o-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Policy learning with foundation models in multi-turn tasks is hampered by sparse rewards and unstable policy gradient updates. The authors observe that positive samples with high returns often do not require policy regularisation, while negative samples can degrade performance, motivating a selective update strategy.

Method: Propose Succeed or Learn Slowly (SoLS), an off-policy actor-critic algorithm that performs direct policy updates for positive samples and conservative, regularised updates for negative samples. Enhanced with Successful Transition Replay (STR) to prioritise learning from successful interactions. Evaluated on the AndroidWorld benchmark for mobile app control tasks.

Result: SoLS significantly outperforms existing methods (at least 17% relative gain) including prompt-engineering and RL approaches, while using substantially less computational resources than GPT-4o-based methods, with 5-60x faster inference.

Conclusion: SoLS (+ STR) offers a sample-efficient, safer fine-tuning approach for foundation-model-based UI navigation in mobile apps, delivering strong performance gains and reduced compute; the approach shows promise for broader off-policy RL with foundation-model policies.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) using foundation models for policy approximations
in multi-turn tasks remains challenging. We identify two main limitations
related to sparse reward settings and policy gradient updates, based on which
we formulate a key insight: updates from positive samples with high returns
typically do not require policy regularisation, whereas updates from negative
samples, reflecting undesirable behaviour, can harm model performance. This
paper introduces Succeed or Learn Slowly (SoLS), a novel off-policy RL
algorithm evaluated on mobile app control tasks. SoLS improves sample
efficiency when fine-tuning foundation models for user interface navigation via
a modified off-policy actor-critic approach, applying direct policy updates for
positive samples and conservative, regularised updates for negative ones to
prevent model degradation. We augment SoLS with Successful Transition Replay
(STR), which prioritises learning from successful interactions, further
improving sample efficiency. We evaluate SoLS on the AndroidWorld benchmark,
where it significantly outperforms existing methods (at least 17% relative
increase), including prompt-engineering and RL approaches, while requiring
substantially fewer computational resources than GPT-4o-based methods with
5-60x faster inference.

### [529] [Convolutional Monge Mapping between EEG Datasets to Support Independent Component Labeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01721)
*Austin Meek,Carlos H. Mendoza-Cardenas,Austin J. Brockmeier*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Extends CMMN spectral normalization for EEG with two spectrum-reference strategies (channel-averaged l1 barycenter; subject-to-subject closest spectrum) to yield space-time separable filters that map datasets with different channel counts, improving IC classification (brain vs non-brain).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EEG is prone to artifacts and device/context variability; spectral normalization can improve robustness of ML pipelines, including IC artifact removal and labeling across datasets.

Method: Propose two approaches to compute the target spectrum for CMMN: (1) channel-averaged and l1-normalized barycenter; (2) subject-to-subject mapping to the closest spectrum. Derive space-time separable filters enabling cross-channel mapping; apply filters in an IC classification task to distinguish brain from non-brain ICs.

Result: The approach yields significant improvement in recognizing brain versus non-brain independent components, demonstrating effective cross-dataset channel mapping and improved artifact-related IC labeling.

Conclusion: Extending CMMN with spectral normalization reduces inter-device/context variability in EEG and enhances automated IC labeling and artifact removal, with potential clinical impact for epilepsy, psychosis, and other neuropathologies.

Abstract: EEG recordings contain rich information about neural activity but are subject
to artifacts, noise, and superficial differences due to sensors, amplifiers,
and filtering. Independent component analysis and automatic labeling of
independent components (ICs) enable artifact removal in EEG pipelines.
Convolutional Monge Mapping Normalization (CMMN) is a recent tool used to
achieve spectral conformity of EEG signals, which was shown to improve deep
neural network approaches for sleep staging. Here we propose a novel extension
of the CMMN method with two alternative approaches to computing the source
reference spectrum the target signals are mapped to: (1) channel-averaged and
$l_1$-normalized barycenter, and (2) a subject-to-subject mapping that finds
the source subject with the closest spectrum to the target subject. Notably,
our extension yields space-time separable filters that can be used to map
between datasets with different numbers of EEG channels. We apply these filters
in an IC classification task, and show significant improvement in recognizing
brain versus non-brain ICs.
  Clinical relevance - EEG recordings are used in the diagnosis and monitoring
of multiple neuropathologies, including epilepsy and psychosis. While EEG
analysis can benefit from automating artifact removal through independent
component analysis and labeling, differences in recording equipment and context
(the presence of noise from electrical wiring and other devices) may impact the
performance of machine learning models, but these differences can be minimized
by appropriate spectral normalization through filtering.

*Lucas Mansilla,Rodrigo Echeveste,Camila Gonzalez,Diego H. Milone,Enzo Ferrante*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: BM-CL: a continual-learning-based bias mitigation framework that treats reducing unfairness as a domain-incremental learning task to avoid leveling-down.”


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bias in ML causes disparities; traditional bias mitigation often improves one group at the expense of others (leveling-down). A framework that preserves prior knowledge while improving outcomes for disadvantaged groups is needed; continual learning offers mechanisms to balance knowledge and fairness over time.

Method: Frame bias mitigation as a continual learning problem equivalent to domain-incremental learning; leverage techniques such as Learning without Forgetting (LwF) and Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC) to incrementally adjust fairness objectives without forgetting beneficial knowledge; apply to image datasets with diverse bias sources.

Result: Empirical evaluation on synthetic and real-world biased image datasets shows reduced bias while preserving performance for advantaged groups, indicating mitigation with minimal forgetting of original knowledge.

Conclusion: BM-CL bridges fairness and continual learning, providing a promising avenue for developing ML systems that are both fair and effective, by treating bias mitigation as an incremental, knowledge-preserving process.

Abstract: Biases in machine learning pose significant challenges, particularly when
models amplify disparities that affect disadvantaged groups. Traditional bias
mitigation techniques often lead to a {\itshape leveling-down effect}, whereby
improving outcomes of disadvantaged groups comes at the expense of reduced
performance for advantaged groups. This study introduces Bias Mitigation
through Continual Learning (BM-CL), a novel framework that leverages the
principles of continual learning to address this trade-off. We postulate that
mitigating bias is conceptually similar to domain-incremental continual
learning, where the model must adjust to changing fairness conditions,
improving outcomes for disadvantaged groups without forgetting the knowledge
that benefits advantaged groups. Drawing inspiration from techniques such as
Learning without Forgetting and Elastic Weight Consolidation, we reinterpret
bias mitigation as a continual learning problem. This perspective allows models
to incrementally balance fairness objectives, enhancing outcomes for
disadvantaged groups while preserving performance for advantaged groups.
Experiments on synthetic and real-world image datasets, characterized by
diverse sources of bias, demonstrate that the proposed framework mitigates
biases while minimizing the loss of original knowledge. Our approach bridges
the fields of fairness and continual learning, offering a promising pathway for
developing machine learning systems that are both equitable and effective.

### [531] [Communication-Aware Knowledge Distillation for Federated LLM Fine-Tuning over Wireless Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01750)
*Xinlu Zhang,Na Yan,Yang Su,Yansha Deng,Toktam Mahmoodi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: An adaptive federated distillation framework for LLMs that uses Top-k logit sparsification, adaptive aggregation, and LoRA-based hidden-layer projection, achieving ~50% communication savings with improved performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Federated learning for large language models (LLMs) promises privacy via local training, but traditional parameter-sharing incurs heavy communication and struggles with heterogeneous architectures. Federated distillation reduces bandwidth by exchanging logits, yet logits are high-dimensional for LLMs, creating bottlenecks on bandwidth-limited clients.

Method: 1) Adaptive Top-k logit selection that sparsifies logits in real time based on current communication conditions. 2) Adaptive logits aggregation to align dimensionality and mitigate the artificial/uninformative effects of zero-padding from sparsification. 3) LoRA-adapted hidden-layer projection incorporated into the distillation loss to enrich representations while further reducing communication.

Result: Experimental evaluation shows superior performance against baseline methods and roughly 50% reduction in communication overhead.

Conclusion: The proposed adaptive federated distillation framework effectively lowers communication costs while maintaining or improving distillation quality, and adapts to bandwidth constraints and model heterogeneity.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) for large language models (LLMs) offers a
privacy-preserving scheme, enabling clients to collaboratively fine-tune
locally deployed LLMs or smaller language models (SLMs) without exchanging raw
data. While parameter-sharing methods in traditional FL models solves number of
technical challenges, they still incur high communication overhead and struggle
with adapting to heterogeneous model architectures. Federated distillation, a
framework for mutual knowledge transfer via shared logits, typically offers
lower communication overhead than parameter-sharing methods. However,
transmitting logits from LLMs remains challenging for bandwidth-limited clients
due to their high dimensionality. In this work, we focus on a federated LLM
distillation with efficient communication overhead. To achieve this, we first
propose an adaptive Top-k logit selection mechanism, dynamically sparsifying
logits according to real-time communication conditions. Then to tackle the
dimensional inconsistency introduced by the adaptive sparsification, we design
an adaptive logits aggregation scheme, effectively alleviating the artificial
and uninformative inputs introduced by conventional zero-padding methods.
Finally, to enhance the distillation effect, we incorporate LoRA-adapted
hidden-layer projection from LLM into the distillation loss, reducing the
communication overhead further while providing richer representation.
Experimental results demonstrate that our scheme achieves superior performance
compared to baseline methods while effectively reducing communication overhead
by approximately 50%.

### [532] [Toward a Unified Benchmark and Taxonomy of Stochastic Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01793)
*Aryan Amit Barsainyan,Jing Yu Lim,Dianbo Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A new benchmark STORI (STOchastic-ataRI) and a stochasticity taxonomy for RL environments to systematically evaluate agents under uncertainty.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RL benchmarks underrepresent stochasticity and partial observability; model-based RL with world models struggles in true stochastic/PO environments; a unified taxonomy and benchmark are needed for rigorous, comparative evaluation of robustness under uncertainty.

Method: Introduce STORI benchmark with diverse stochastic effects and propose a taxonomy of stochasticity in RL environments; provide a unified framework for analyzing and comparing RL approaches under uncertainty.

Result: STORI offers a structured benchmark to rigorously assess RL methods under varied forms of stochasticity and provides a unified framework to analyze and compare approaches, addressing a gap in current evaluation practices.

Conclusion: STORI and the stochasticity taxonomy fill a gap in systematic RL evaluation under real-world uncertainty, enabling more robust development and fair comparisons of learning methods.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents have achieved strong results on benchmarks
such as Atari100k, yet they remain limited in robustness to real-world
conditions. Model-Based RL approaches that rely on learned World Models often
struggle in environments with true stochasticity and partial observability,
despite their theoretical grounding in POMDPs. Current benchmarks rarely
capture these challenges, focusing instead on deterministic or overly
simplified settings, and the lack of a clear taxonomy of stochasticity further
hampers systematic evaluation. To address this gap, we introduce STORI
(STOchastic-ataRI), a benchmark that incorporates diverse stochastic effects
and enables rigorous assessment of RL methods under varied forms of
uncertainty. In addition, we propose a taxonomy of stochasticity in RL
environments, providing a unified framework for analyzing and comparing
approaches.

*Trusting Inekwe,Emmanuel Agu,Winnie Mkandawire,Andres Colubri*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes MBT-CB, a multi-target Bayesian Transformer for predicting four CVD biomarkers (LDL-C, HbA1c, BMI, SysBP) from EHR data during COVID-19, outperforming baselines and providing uncertainty estimates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: COVID-19 disrupted care and changed patient behavior, affecting CVD biomarkers; there is a need for multi-target, uncertainty-aware ML models that capture inter-biomarker relationships and temporal dynamics from EHRs.

Method: MBT-CB is a Multi-target Bayesian Transformer built on a pre-trained BERT-based transformer, employing Bayesian Variational Inference to estimate predictive uncertainty, embeddings to capture temporal relationships, and a DeepMTR component to model inter-biomarker dependencies. Evaluated on retrospective EHR data from 3,390 CVD patient records (304 unique patients) in Central Massachusetts during the pandemic.

Result: MBT-CB outperformed a wide range of baselines including other BERT-based models, achieving MAE 0.00887, RMSE 0.0135, and MSE 0.00027, while effectively capturing data/model uncertainty and the temporal/inter-relations among biomarkers.

Conclusion: MBT-CB demonstrates superior multi-target biomarker prediction and uncertainty quantification, with potential to improve CVD management and clinical decision-making during pandemics.

Abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic disrupted healthcare systems worldwide,
disproportionately impacting individuals with chronic conditions such as
cardiovascular disease (CVD). These disruptions -- through delayed care and
behavioral changes, affected key CVD biomarkers, including LDL cholesterol
(LDL-C), HbA1c, BMI, and systolic blood pressure (SysBP). Accurate modeling of
these changes is crucial for predicting disease progression and guiding
preventive care. However, prior work has not addressed multi-target prediction
of CVD biomarker from Electronic Health Records (EHRs) using machine learning
(ML), while jointly capturing biomarker interdependencies, temporal patterns,
and predictive uncertainty. In this paper, we propose MBT-CB, a Multi-target
Bayesian Transformer (MBT) with pre-trained BERT-based transformer framework to
jointly predict LDL-C, HbA1c, BMI and SysBP CVD biomarkers from EHR data. The
model leverages Bayesian Variational Inference to estimate uncertainties,
embeddings to capture temporal relationships and a DeepMTR model to capture
biomarker inter-relationships. We evaluate MBT-CT on retrospective EHR data
from 3,390 CVD patient records (304 unique patients) in Central Massachusetts
during the Covid-19 pandemic. MBT-CB outperformed a comprehensive set of
baselines including other BERT-based ML models, achieving an MAE of 0.00887,
RMSE of 0.0135 and MSE of 0.00027, while effectively capturing data and model
uncertainty, patient biomarker inter-relationships, and temporal dynamics via
its attention and embedding mechanisms. MBT-CB's superior performance
highlights its potential to improve CVD biomarker prediction and support
clinical decision-making during pandemics.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces the TSAIA Benchmark to evaluate LLMs as time-series AI assistants across 33 real-world tasks; features a dynamic question generator and task-specific metrics; evaluated eight LLMs; reveals current limitations in assembling complex TS workflows; resources released (dataset and code).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs hold promise for time-series analysis, but there is no rigorous, standardized benchmark to assess their capability to perform complex, multi-step, domain-specific time-series reasoning in real-world settings.

Method: Surveyed 20+ papers to identify 33 real-world task formulations; designed TSAIA with tasks like constraint-aware forecasting and calibrated anomaly detection; implemented a dynamic, extensible question generator; defined task-specific success criteria and tailored inference-quality metrics; evaluated eight SOTA LLMs under a unified protocol.

Result: A comprehensive benchmark for LLM-based time-series analysis is established; eight LLMs were evaluated; results highlight limitations in composing complex TS workflows; the benchmark and code are publicly released for ongoing expansion and assessment.

Conclusion: Specialized methodologies and domain-adaptation are needed to leverage LLMs for time-series tasks; TSAIA provides a rigorous, extensible framework for evaluating and guiding future research in this area.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has sparked growing
interest in their application to time series analysis tasks. However, their
ability to perform complex reasoning over temporal data in real-world
application domains remains underexplored. To move toward this goal, a first
step is to establish a rigorous benchmark dataset for evaluation. In this work,
we introduce the TSAIA Benchmark, a first attempt to evaluate LLMs as
time-series AI assistants. To ensure both scientific rigor and practical
relevance, we surveyed over 20 academic publications and identified 33
real-world task formulations. The benchmark encompasses a broad spectrum of
challenges, ranging from constraint-aware forecasting to anomaly detection with
threshold calibration: tasks that require compositional reasoning and
multi-step time series analysis. The question generator is designed to be
dynamic and extensible, supporting continuous expansion as new datasets or task
types are introduced. Given the heterogeneous nature of the tasks, we adopt
task-specific success criteria and tailored inference-quality metrics to ensure
meaningful evaluation for each task. We apply this benchmark to assess eight
state-of-the-art LLMs under a unified evaluation protocol. Our analysis reveals
limitations in current models' ability to assemble complex time series analysis
workflows, underscoring the need for specialized methodologies for
domain-specific adaptation. Our benchmark is available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a reinforcement learning framework to route vessels across multiple origin–destination pairs in dynamic waterways using AIS-derived traffic graphs and wind data, with PPO, action masking, and shaping rewards improving policy performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address generalization across many OD pairs and exploitation of large-scale data-driven traffic graphs in maritime routing under dynamic environmental conditions.

Method: A PPO-based RL approach with recurrent networks, continuous observations and multi-discrete actions. Uses invalid-action masking, exploration strategies, and a reward balancing fuel, time, wind resistance, and route diversity. Data from AIS-derived traffic graphs and ERA5 winds, tested in the Gulf of St. Lawrence.

Result: Action masking yields clear improvement in policy performance; adding positive shaping rewards to penalty-based feedback yields additional gains; demonstrates feasibility across hex grid resolutions and multiple OD pairs.

Conclusion: The framework enables scalable, data-driven vessel routing in complex waterways and highlights the importance of action masking and shaping rewards for effective learning; potential for broader maritime deployment.

Abstract: Routing vessels through narrow and dynamic waterways is challenging due to
changing environmental conditions and operational constraints. Existing
vessel-routing studies typically fail to generalize across multiple
origin-destination pairs and do not exploit large-scale, data-driven traffic
graphs. In this paper, we propose a reinforcement learning solution for big
maritime data that can learn to find a route across multiple origin-destination
pairs while adapting to different hexagonal grid resolutions. Agents learn to
select direction and speed under continuous observations in a multi-discrete
action space. A reward function balances fuel efficiency, travel time, wind
resistance, and route diversity, using an Automatic Identification System
(AIS)-derived traffic graph with ERA5 wind fields. The approach is demonstrated
in the Gulf of St. Lawrence, one of the largest estuaries in the world. We
evaluate configurations that combine Proximal Policy Optimization with
recurrent networks, invalid-action masking, and exploration strategies. Our
experiments demonstrate that action masking yields a clear improvement in
policy performance and that supplementing penalty-only feedback with positive
shaping rewards produces additional gains.

*Weicao Deng,Sangwoo Park,Min Li,Osvaldo Simeone*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Efficient enhanced in-context learning-based full conformal prediction (E-ICL+FCP) that uses a permutation-invariant Transformer ICL model with a CP-aware loss to simulate retraining, preserving coverage while reducing computation, outperforming SCP and FCP baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conformal prediction provides distribution-free coverage; Split CP (SCP) suffers from data inefficiency due to dataset partitioning, while full CP (FCP) has prohibitive retraining cost. Meta-learning and ICL help but are not tailored to CP; need a method that combines coverage with practicality.

Method: Train a permutation-invariant Transformer-based ICL model with a CP-aware loss; simulate multiple retrained FCP models without actual retraining to form an effective FCP-like ensemble, thereby preserving coverage while reducing inefficiency and computational overhead.

Result: Experiments on synthetic and real tasks show that E-ICL+FCP achieves a superior efficiency-coverage trade-off compared to existing SCP and FCP baselines.

Conclusion: E-ICL+FCP provides reliable uncertainty quantification with efficient full conformal prediction, bridging the gap between SCP’s data inefficiency and FCP’s retraining cost through CP-aware ICL.

Abstract: Reliable uncertainty quantification is critical for trustworthy AI. Conformal
Prediction (CP) provides prediction sets with distribution-free coverage
guarantees, but its two main variants face complementary limitations. Split CP
(SCP) suffers from data inefficiency due to dataset partitioning, while full CP
(FCP) improves data efficiency at the cost of prohibitive retraining
complexity. Recent approaches based on meta-learning or in-context learning
(ICL) partially mitigate these drawbacks. However, they rely on training
procedures not specifically tailored to CP, which may yield large prediction
sets. We introduce an efficient FCP framework, termed enhanced ICL-based FCP
(E-ICL+FCP), which employs a permutation-invariant Transformer-based ICL model
trained with a CP-aware loss. By simulating the multiple retrained models
required by FCP without actual retraining, E-ICL+FCP preserves coverage while
markedly reducing both inefficiency and computational overhead. Experiments on
synthetic and real tasks demonstrate that E-ICL+FCP attains superior
efficiency-coverage trade-offs compared to existing SCP and FCP baselines.

### [537] [GradES: Significantly Faster Training in Transformers with Gradient-Based Early Stopping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01842)
*Qifu Wen,Xi Zeng,Zihan Zhou,Shuaijun Liu,Mehdi Hosseinzadeh,Reza Rawassizadeh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GradES is a gradient-based component-level early stopping method for transformers that freezes projection and FFN matrices when their gradients converge, speeding up training and improving generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Global early stopping based on validation loss is expensive for large transformers because it requires repeated full validation passes. Fine-tuning shows that different transformer components converge at different rates, so a more granular approach could save compute without sacrificing performance.

Method: During training, GradES monitors gradient magnitudes for attention projection matrices and FFN weight matrices. If a matrix's gradients fall below a threshold tau, that matrix is frozen from further updates. This allows slow-converging components to keep learning while fast-converging ones stop updating, avoiding costly validation passes.

Result: Training time is reduced by a factor of 1.57 to 7.22x. Generalization improves with early prevention of overfitting, yielding about 1.2% higher average accuracy.

Conclusion: A fine-grained, gradient-based early stopping strategy at the component level can dramatically reduce training compute for large transformers while improving generalization, making it a practical tool for efficient fine-tuning.

Abstract: Early stopping monitors global validation loss and halts all parameter
updates simultaneously, which is computationally costly for large transformers
due to the extended time required for validation inference. We propose GradES,
a novel gradient-based early stopping approach that operates within transformer
components (attention projections and Feed-Forward layer matrices). We found
that different components converge at varying rates during fine-tuning. GradES
tracks the magnitude of gradients in backpropagation for these matrices during
training. When a projection matrix's gradients fall below a convergence
threshold $\tau$, we exclude that projection matrix from further updates
individually, eliminating costly validation passes while allowing slow
converging matrices to continue learning. By strategically freezing parameters
when their gradients converge, GradES speeds up training time by
1.57--7.22$\times$ while simultaneously enhancing generalization through early
prevention of overfitting, resulting in 1.2% higher average accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable reliable, interpretable features derived directly from neural network weights and improve data efficiency, addressing shortcomings of existing weight-based analyses that hurt performance or require more data.

Method: Introduce SQS as an activation function designed for GLUs to learn interpretable features from weights. The approach aims to preserve competitive performance while enabling weight-based interpretability.

Result: Experimental results show that SQS achieves performance competitive with state-of-the-art activation functions and simultaneously enables weight-based interpretability.

Conclusion: SQS offers a computationally efficient path to weight-based interpretability in neural networks without sacrificing accuracy, potentially improving mechanistic insights into model behavior.

Abstract: Understanding the inner workings of machine learning models is critical for
ensuring their reliability and robustness. Whilst many techniques in
mechanistic interpretability focus on activation driven analyses, being able to
derive meaningful features directly from the weights of a neural network would
provide greater guarantees and more computational efficiency. Existing
techniques for analyzing model features through weights suffer from drawbacks
such as reduced performance and data inefficiency. In this paper, we introduce
Signed Quadratic Shrink (SQS), an activation function designed to allow Gated
Linear Units (GLUs) to learn interpretable features without these drawbacks.
Our experimental results show that SQS achieves performance competitive with

TL;DR: PPO-based RL enables semi-on-demand SAV feeder with zonal dispatch, yielding 16% more passengers than a fixed route at 13% higher generalized costs; RL fine-tuning adds a further 2.4% ridership at 1.4% higher costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address first-/last-mile accessibility in low-density areas by combining fixed-route efficiency with demand-responsive flexibility using SAVs and reinforcement learning.

Method: Agent-based simulations on a real-world Munich bus route; deep RL using Proximal Policy Optimization to assign SAVs to subdivided flexible-route zones in response to real-time demand; vehicles depart terminus, follow fixed stops, then offer on-demand pickups within a flexible area.

Result: After RL training, semi-on-demand with dynamic zonal control serves 16% more passengers at 13% higher generalized costs; RL control yields 2.4% more passengers at 1.4% higher costs.

Conclusion: Demonstrates the feasibility and potential of integrating SAV feeders and ML techniques into public transit, providing groundwork for addressing first-/last-mile challenges in multimodal mobility and informing future autonomous demand-responsive transit research.

Abstract: This paper develops a semi-on-demand transit feeder service using shared
autonomous vehicles (SAVs) and zonal dispatching control based on reinforcement
learning (RL). This service combines the cost-effectiveness of fixed-route
transit with the adaptability of demand-responsive transport to improve
accessibility in lower-density areas. Departing from the terminus, SAVs first
make scheduled fixed stops, then offer on-demand pick-ups and drop-offs in a
pre-determined flexible-route area. Our deep RL model dynamically assigns
vehicles to subdivided flexible-route zones in response to real-time demand
fluctuations and operations, using a policy gradient algorithm - Proximal
Policy Optimization. The methodology is demonstrated through agent-based
simulations on a real-world bus route in Munich, Germany. Results show that
after efficient training of the RL model, the semi-on-demand service with
dynamic zonal control serves 16% more passengers at 13% higher generalized
costs on average compared to traditional fixed-route service. The efficiency
gain brought by RL control brings 2.4% more passengers at 1.4% higher costs.
This study not only showcases the potential of integrating SAV feeders and
machine learning techniques into public transit, but also sets the groundwork
for further innovations in addressing first-mile-last-mile problems in
multimodal transit systems.

### [540] [Deep Reinforcement Learning for Real-Time Drone Routing in Post-Disaster Road Assessment Without Domain Knowledge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01886)
*Huatian Gong,Jiuh-Biing Sheu,Zheng Wang,Xiaoguang Yang,Ran Yan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: An attention-based encoder-decoder model with deep reinforcement learning enables real-time drone routing for post-disaster road damage assessment, achieving fast inference and improved route quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Rapid post-disaster road damage assessment is essential for emergency response, but traditional optimization methods are slow and require domain-specific algorithm design, limiting responsiveness in time-sensitive scenarios.

Method: Introduce an attention-based encoder-decoder model (AEDM) trained with deep reinforcement learning to generate high-quality drone assessment routes. Transform link-based routing problems into equivalent node-based formulations, and use synthetic road networks to address data scarcity. Train with policy optimization with multiple optima (POMO) and multi-task learning to handle diverse parameter settings.

Result: AEDM outperforms commercial solvers by 16–69% in solution quality and achieves real-time inference in 1–2 seconds, versus 100–2,000 seconds for traditional methods. It generalizes well across problem scales, drone counts, and time constraints, performing strongly on unseen distributions and real-world road networks.

Conclusion: AEDM balances computational efficiency with solution quality, making it well-suited for time-critical disaster response where rapid, reliable routing decisions are critical.

Abstract: Rapid post-disaster road damage assessment is critical for effective
emergency response, yet traditional optimization methods suffer from excessive
computational time and require domain knowledge for algorithm design, making
them unsuitable for time-sensitive disaster scenarios. This study proposes an
attention-based encoder-decoder model (AEDM) for real-time drone routing
decision in post-disaster road damage assessment. The method employs deep
reinforcement learning to determine high-quality drone assessment routes
without requiring algorithmic design knowledge. A network transformation method
is developed to convert link-based routing problems into equivalent node-based
formulations, while a synthetic road network generation technique addresses the
scarcity of large-scale training datasets. The model is trained using policy
optimization with multiple optima (POMO) with multi-task learning capabilities
to handle diverse parameter combinations. Experimental results demonstrate two
key strengths of AEDM: it outperforms commercial solvers by 16--69\% in
solution quality and achieves real-time inference (1--2 seconds) versus
100--2,000 seconds for traditional methods. The model exhibits strong
generalization across varying problem scales, drone numbers, and time
constraints, consistently outperforming baseline methods on unseen parameter
distributions and real-world road networks. The proposed method effectively
balances computational efficiency with solution quality, making it particularly
suitable for time-critical disaster response applications where rapid
decision-making is essential for saving lives.

### [541] [Predicting NCAP Safety Ratings: An Analysis of Vehicle Characteristics and ADAS Features Using Machine Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01897)
*Raunak Kunwar,Aera Kim LeBoulluec*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A data-driven study on NCAP ratings shows that both standard vehicle attributes (curb weight, model year) and ADAS features collectively predict the likelihood of achieving a 5-star NCAP rating, with Random Forest and Gradient Boosting delivering top performance (approx 89% accuracy, AUC ~0.959).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand empirical interactions between ADAS technologies and traditional vehicle attributes in predicting top safety ratings using large-scale NCAP data, informing consumers and regulators.

Method: Dataset ~5,128 variants from NCAP (2011-2025). Compared four ML models (logistic regression, random forest, gradient boosting, SVC) via 5-fold stratified CV. Hyperparameter tuning for RF and gradient boosting with RandomizedSearchCV. Assessed feature importance.

Result: RF and gradient boosting performed best; RF achieved 89.18% accuracy and AUC 0.9586. Curb weight and model year dominate feature importance (>55% of RF relevance). ADAS features also contributed meaningfully.

Conclusion: ML on NCAP data demonstrates that established vehicle parameters and ADAS features jointly influence top safety ratings; ADAS features add predictive value beyond basic attributes, illustrating how combined factors shape NCAP outcomes.

Abstract: Vehicle safety assessment is crucial for consumer information and regulatory
oversight. The New Car Assessment Program (NCAP) assigns standardized safety
ratings, which traditionally emphasize passive safety measures but now include
active safety technologies such as Advanced Driver-Assistance Systems (ADAS).
It is crucial to understand how these various systems interact empirically.
This study explores whether particular ADAS features like Forward Collision
Warning, Lane Departure Warning, Crash Imminent Braking, and Blind Spot
Detection, together with established vehicle attributes (e.g., Curb Weight,
Model Year, Vehicle Type, Drive Train), can reliably predict a vehicle's
likelihood of earning the highest (5-star) overall NCAP rating. Using a
publicly available dataset derived from NCAP reports that contain approximately
5,128 vehicle variants spanning model years 2011-2025, we compared four
different machine learning models: logistic regression, random forest, gradient
boosting, and support vector classifier (SVC) using a 5-fold stratified
cross-validation approach. The two best-performing algorithms (random forest
and gradient boost) were hyperparameter optimized using RandomizedSearchCV.
Analysis of feature importance showed that basic vehicle characteristics,
specifically curb weight and model year, dominated predictive capability,
contributing more than 55% of the feature relevance of the Random Forest model.
However, the inclusion of ADAS features also provided meaningful predictive
contributions. The optimized Random Forest model achieved robust results on a
held-out test set, with an accuracy of 89.18% and a ROC AUC of 0.9586. This
research reveals the use of machine learning to analyze large-scale NCAP data
and highlights the combined predictive importance of both established vehicle
parameters and modern ADAS features to achieve top safety ratings.

### [542] [VISP: Volatility Informed Stochastic Projection for Adaptive Regularization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01903)
*Tanvir Islam*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: VISP is an adaptive regularization method that uses gradient volatility to scale a stochastic projection, selectively regularizing high-volatility gradients to improve generalization on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and SVHN; it analyzes volatility dynamics and projection spectra to show stabilized representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional regularization (uniform noise/dropout) can mis-regularize or under-regularize; a data-driven, gradient-informed approach may better stabilize training and reduce overfitting.

Method: Compute gradient volatility from gradient statistics during training and use it to scale a stochastic projection matrix that injects noise into inputs and hidden units in a selective, dynamic manner.

Result: VISP yields consistent generalization improvements over baselines and fixed-noise methods across MNIST, CIFAR-10, and SVHN; analyses indicate stabilized network dynamics, robust feature representations, and informative spectral properties of the projection matrix.

Conclusion: Volatility-informed stochastic projection offers a flexible, effective regularization framework that enhances generalization and representation robustness, with potential applicability to broader architectures and datasets.

Abstract: We propose VISP: Volatility Informed Stochastic Projection, an adaptive
regularization method that leverages gradient volatility to guide stochastic
noise injection in deep neural networks. Unlike conventional techniques that
apply uniform noise or fixed dropout rates, VISP dynamically computes
volatility from gradient statistics and uses it to scale a stochastic
projection matrix. This mechanism selectively regularizes inputs and hidden
nodes that exhibit higher gradient volatility while preserving stable
representations, thereby mitigating overfitting. Extensive experiments on
MNIST, CIFAR-10, and SVHN demonstrate that VISP consistently improves
generalization performance over baseline models and fixed-noise alternatives.
In addition, detailed analyses of the evolution of volatility, the spectral
properties of the projection matrix, and activation distributions reveal that
VISP not only stabilizes the internal dynamics of the network but also fosters
a more robust feature representation.

*Jifan Zhang,Michelle M. Li,Elena Zheleva*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GraCE-VAE enables identifiability of causal disentanglement in non-i.i.d. data by fusing discrepancy-based VAEs with GNNs on network-structured context, with theoretical guarantees and empirical validation on genetic perturbation data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extend identifiability of causal disentanglement from i.i.d. data to non-i.i.d. settings where network-structured context is available, addressing limitations of prior work.

Method: Propose GraCE-VAE, a framework that combines discrepancy-based variational autoencoders with graph neural networks to jointly recover the latent causal graph and intervention effects under soft interventions, leveraging observational and interventional data.

Result: The paper shows that identifiability results from the i.i.d. setting extend to the non-i.i.d. GraCE-VAE setup, and empirically outperforms baselines on three genetic perturbation datasets.

Conclusion: Structured network context enables improved causal disentanglement under soft interventions; the GraCE-VAE framework provides identifiability guarantees and a practical method for non-i.i.d. data, with potential applications in genetics.

Abstract: Causal disentanglement from soft interventions is identifiable under the
assumptions of linear interventional faithfulness and availability of both
observational and interventional data. Previous research has looked into this
problem from the perspective of i.i.d. data. Here, we develop a framework,
GraCE-VAE, for non-i.i.d. settings, in which structured context in the form of
network data is available. GraCE-VAE integrates discrepancy-based variational
autoencoders with graph neural networks to jointly recover the true latent
causal graph and intervention effects. We show that the theoretical results of
identifiability from i.i.d. data hold in our setup. We also empirically
evaluate GraCE-VAE against state-of-the-art baselines on three genetic
perturbation datasets to demonstrate the impact of leveraging structured
context for causal disentanglement.

### [544] [A Continuous Encoding-Based Representation for Efficient Multi-Fidelity Multi-Objective Neural Architecture Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01943)
*Zhao Wei,Chin Chun Ooi,Yew-Soon Ong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Adaptive multi-fidelity, multi-objective NAS using Co-Kriging with clustering-based local infill sampling and a continuous encoding for U-Net cell connections; achieves lower computational cost while matching/exceeding state-of-the-art on several benchmarks and uncovers architectural design principles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation:  NAS is effective for architecture design but extremely compute-intensive, especially for multi-objective optimization. There is a need to reduce cost while preserving performance and to extract general architectural insights.

Method:  Proposes an adaptive Co-Kriging-assisted multi-fidelity NAS framework with a clustering-based local multi-fidelity infill sampling strategy. Introduces a novel continuous encoding to represent connections of nodes within a generalized cell-based U-Net backbone to reduce search dimensionality.

Result:  The method outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods under limited computational budget on three numerical benchmarks (2D Darcy flow regression and CHASE_DB1 biomedical image segmentation). It also yields a wind velocity regression model for urban modelling with good predictive performance and lower computational complexity. Analysis shows NAS independently identified underlying principles similar to those reported in literature, such as allowing each cell to incorporate information from prior cells.

Conclusion:  The proposed approach is effective for cost-efficient, multi-objective NAS and reveals transferable architectural principles for U-Net-like backbones, suggesting broader applicability and insight into design choices that generalize beyond the evaluated tasks.

Abstract: Neural architecture search (NAS) is an attractive approach to automate the
design of optimized architectures but is constrained by high computational
budget, especially when optimizing for multiple, important conflicting
objectives. To address this, an adaptive Co-Kriging-assisted multi-fidelity
multi-objective NAS algorithm is proposed to further reduce the computational
cost of NAS by incorporating a clustering-based local multi-fidelity infill
sampling strategy, enabling efficient exploration of the search space for
faster convergence. This algorithm is further accelerated by the use of a novel
continuous encoding method to represent the connections of nodes in each cell
within a generalized cell-based U-Net backbone, thereby decreasing the search
dimension (number of variables). Results indicate that the proposed NAS
algorithm outperforms previously published state-of-the-art methods under
limited computational budget on three numerical benchmarks, a 2D Darcy flow
regression problem and a CHASE_DB1 biomedical image segmentation problem. The
proposed method is subsequently used to create a wind velocity regression model
with application in urban modelling, with the found model able to achieve good
prediction with less computational complexity. Further analysis revealed that
the NAS algorithm independently identified principles undergirding superior
U-Net architectures in other literature, such as the importance of allowing
each cell to incorporate information from prior cells.

*Long Jiang,Yang Yang,Ting Fong May Chui,Morgan Thornwell,Hoshin Vijai Gupta*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A three-phase distillation framework unites process-based ecohydrological models with ML and AI, using behavioral, structural, and cognitive distillation to improve efficiency, scalability, and predictive capability, demonstrated on the Samish watershed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bridge physics-based realism and data-driven efficiency under climate change and anthropogenic pressures; enhance interpretability, transferability, and decision-support for ecohydrological systems.

Method: Phase I: Behavioral distillation—surrogate learning and simplification; Phase II: Structural distillation—reformulates equations as modular GNN components for multiscale integration; Phase III: Cognitive distillation—embed expert reasoning via Eyes-Brain-Hands-Mouth architecture; Demonstration on Samish watershed showing outputs replication, improved accuracy, scenario support.

Result: Framework can reproduce process-based outputs, improves predictive accuracy, supports scenario-based decision-making; scalable and transferable to other domains.

Conclusion: Offers a pathway to next-generation intelligent ecohydrological modeling, enabling integration of physics, ML, and AI; potential extension to other process-based fields.

Abstract: Simulating ecohydrological processes is essential for understanding complex
environmental systems and guiding sustainable management amid accelerating
climate change and human pressures. Process-based models provide physical
realism but can suffer from structural rigidity, high computational costs, and
complex calibration, while machine learning (ML) methods are efficient and
flexible yet often lack interpretability and transferability. We propose a
unified three-phase framework that integrates process-based models with ML and
progressively embeds them into artificial intelligence (AI) through knowledge
distillation. Phase I, behavioral distillation, enhances process models via
surrogate learning and model simplification to capture key dynamics at lower
computational cost. Phase II, structural distillation, reformulates process
equations as modular components within a graph neural network (GNN), enabling
multiscale representation and seamless integration with ML models. Phase III,
cognitive distillation, embeds expert reasoning and adaptive decision-making
into intelligent modeling agents using the Eyes-Brain-Hands-Mouth architecture.
Demonstrations for the Samish watershed highlight the framework's applicability
to ecohydrological modeling, showing that it can reproduce process-based model
outputs, improve predictive accuracy, and support scenario-based
decision-making. The framework offers a scalable and transferable pathway
toward next-generation intelligent ecohydrological modeling systems, with the
potential extension to other process-based domains.

### [546] [Semantic and episodic memories in a predictive coding model of the neocortex](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01987)
*Lucie Fontaine,Frédéric Alexandre*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A predictive coding model of the neocortex can recall episode-specific details but only when trained on a small number of examples; with more data, such recall is lost, suggesting episodic memory may emerge from semantic learning and highlighting the need for hippocampal-like sparse representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To test whether predictive coding in a neocortex model can support episodic recall and to clarify its relationship with semantic memory within the complementary learning systems framework.

Method: Implement a predictive coding neocortex model and evaluate its ability to recall specifics of individual experiences. Train with a small vs. large number of exemplars, assess recall of individual cases, and examine generalization. Compare dense, overlapping representations with the role of sparse, pattern-separated representations typical of the hippocampus.

Result: The model can recall specifics of individual examples only when trained on a limited number of examples; it overfits and fails to generalize when exposed to more data. With more training data, recall capability diminishes, indicating episodic recall can arise from semantic learning.

Conclusion: Episodic-like recall in the neocortex appears constrained to small data regimes; robust episodic memory likely requires the hippocampus' sparse, pattern-separated representations alongside semantic-based learning, aligning with the complementary learning systems view.

Abstract: Complementary Learning Systems theory holds that intelligent agents need two
learning systems. Semantic memory is encoded in the neocortex with dense,
overlapping representations and acquires structured knowledge. Episodic memory
is encoded in the hippocampus with sparse, pattern-separated representations
and quickly learns the specifics of individual experiences. Recently, this
duality between semantic and episodic memories has been challenged by
predictive coding, a biologically plausible neural network model of the
neocortex which was shown to have hippocampus-like abilities on
auto-associative memory tasks. These results raise the question of the episodic
capabilities of the neocortex and their relation to semantic memory. In this
paper, we present such a predictive coding model of the neocortex and explore
its episodic capabilities. We show that this kind of model can indeed recall
the specifics of individual examples but only if it is trained on a small
number of examples. The model is overfitted to these exemples and does not
generalize well, suggesting that episodic memory can arise from semantic
learning. Indeed, a model trained with many more examples loses its recall
capabilities. This work suggests that individual examples can be encoded
gradually in the neocortex using dense, overlapping representations but only in
a limited number, motivating the need for sparse, pattern-separated
representations as found in the hippocampus.

### [547] [ACA-Net: Future Graph Learning for Logistical Demand-Supply Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01997)
*Jiacheng Shi,Haibin Wei,Jiang Wang,Xiaowei Xu,Longzhi Du,Taixu Jiang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel two-graph spatiotemporal model (ongoing and global graphs) with adaptive future graph learning and ACA-Net cross-attention improves logistical demand-supply forecasting for on-demand food delivery, outperforming long-time-series methods and validated in real-world settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Forecasting future order distribution is crucial for efficient scheduling in on-demand food delivery. Existing spatial-temporal long-series methods struggle due to the time-series-insensitive and highly random nature of future demand, indicating a need for more efficient and robust modeling.

Method: Introduce ongoing and global graphs to represent current and global distributions. Propose a graph learning network with adaptive future graph learning and an innovative cross-attention mechanism (ACA-Net) to extract and learn robust future order distribution information for logistical demand-supply pressure forecasting.

Result: The proposed method achieves superior forecasting performance compared with traditional spatial-temporal long-series methods and is validated in real-world production environments.

Conclusion: The approach effectively learns future order distribution and improves logistical demand-supply forecasting outcomes for on-demand food delivery, enabling better scheduling decisions.

Abstract: Logistical demand-supply forecasting that evaluates the alignment between
projected supply and anticipated demand, is essential for the efficiency and
quality of on-demand food delivery platforms and serves as a key indicator for
scheduling decisions. Future order distribution information, which reflects the
distribution of orders in on-demand food delivery, is crucial for the
performance of logistical demand-supply forecasting. Current studies utilize
spatial-temporal analysis methods to model future order distribution
information from serious time slices. However, learning future order
distribution in online delivery platform is a time-series-insensitive problem
with strong randomness. These approaches often struggle to effectively capture
this information while remaining efficient. This paper proposes an innovative
spatiotemporal learning model that utilizes only two graphs (ongoing and
global) to learn future order distribution information, achieving superior
performance compared to traditional spatial-temporal long-series methods. The
main contributions are as follows: (1) The introduction of ongoing and global
graphs in logistical demand-supply pressure forecasting compared to traditional
long time series significantly enhances forecasting performance. (2) An
innovative graph learning network framework using adaptive future graph
learning and innovative cross attention mechanism (ACA-Net) is proposed to
extract future order distribution information, effectively learning a robust
future graph that substantially improves logistical demand-supply pressure
forecasting outcomes. (3) The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated
in real-world production environments.

### [548] [Bouncy particle sampler with infinite exchanging parallel tempering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02003)
*Yohei Saito,Shun Kimura,Koujin Takeda*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces parallel-tempered BPS (PT-BPS) and an infinite-exchange-rate variant for posterior sampling, showing improved performance on multimodal distributions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bayesian inference requires sampling from complex posteriors. While HMC is powerful, it requires careful tuning and can be tricky for mixed continuous/discrete spaces; the bouncy particle sampler (BPS) offers easier parameter settings. Parallel tempering (PT) can help explore multimodal posteriors, motivating its integration with BPS.

Method: Integrate parallel tempering into the BPS framework and derive an algorithm with the inverse-temperature exchange rate set to infinity. Conduct numerical simulations to evaluate performance on multimodal distributions and compare to baseline samplers.

Result: The PT-BPS framework enhances convergence and exploration of multimodal targets. The infinite-exchange-rate variant delivers strong mixing and effective exploration, as demonstrated by the numerical simulations.

Conclusion: Parallel tempering significantly improves BPS performance for multimodal posterior sampling; the infinite exchange-rate variant is particularly effective. PT-BPS presents a promising alternative to conventional methods (e.g., HMC/MCMC) with easier parameter tuning, warranting further study on broader Bayesian applications.

Abstract: Bayesian inference is useful to obtain a predictive distribution with a small
generalization error. However, since posterior distributions are rarely
evaluated analytically, we employ the variational Bayesian inference or
sampling method to approximate posterior distributions. When we obtain samples
from a posterior distribution, Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) has been widely
used for the continuous variable part and Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) for
the discrete variable part. Another sampling method, the bouncy particle
sampler (BPS), has been proposed, which combines uniform linear motion and
stochastic reflection to perform sampling. BPS was reported to have the
advantage of being easier to set simulation parameters than HMC. To accelerate
the convergence to a posterior distribution, we introduced parallel tempering
(PT) to BPS, and then proposed an algorithm when the inverse temperature
exchange rate is set to infinity. We performed numerical simulations and
demonstrated its effectiveness for multimodal distribution.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces second-order TPDEGs for continuous product-graph neural networks, enabling preservation of high-frequency information and efficient spectral decomposition via separable cosine kernels, with stability and oversmoothing analyses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of first-order continuous TPDEGs and discrete graph filtering in multi-domain (product) graphs; need to capture complex multi-scale and heterophilic structures.

Method: Propose So-TPDEGs leveraging separable cosine kernels on Cartesian product graphs to enable efficient spectral decomposition; design second-order continuous product-graph neural networks; provide theoretical analyses on stability under graph perturbations and over-smoothing with respect to spectrum.

Result: Theoretical contributions establishing rigorous analyses of stability and oversmoothing; a robust foundation for continuous graph learning; practical potential across domains.

Conclusion: Advances continuous graph learning on product graphs by enabling second-order dynamics and preserving high-frequency information, suitable for multi-domain data.

Abstract: Processing data that lies on multiple interacting (product) graphs is
increasingly important in practical applications, yet existing methods are
mostly restricted to discrete graph filtering. Tensorial partial differential
equations on graphs (TPDEGs) offer a principled framework for modeling such
multidomain data in a continuous setting. However, current continuous
approaches are limited to first-order derivatives, which tend to dampen
high-frequency signals and slow down information propagation. This makes these
TPDEGs-based approaches less effective for capturing complex, multi-scale, and
heterophilic structures. In this paper, we introduce second-order TPDEGs
(So-TPDEGs) and propose the first theoretically grounded framework for
second-order continuous product graph neural networks. Our approach leverages
the separability of cosine kernels in Cartesian product graphs to implement
efficient spectral decomposition, while naturally preserving high-frequency
information. We provide rigorous theoretical analyses of stability under graph
perturbations and over-smoothing behavior regarding spectral properties. Our
theoretical results establish a robust foundation for advancing continuous
graph learning across multiple practical domains.

### [550] [Genetic Programming with Model Driven Dimension Repair for Learning Interpretable Appointment Scheduling Rules](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02034)
*Huan Zhang,Yang Wang,Ya-Hui Jia,Yi Mei*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A dimensionally aware genetic programming approach with a dimension repair MILP to evolve interpretable and high-performance appointment rules (ARs) for clinics, outperforming manual ARs and prior methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the interpretability and trust of GP-evolved ARs by enforcing dimensional consistency with domain knowledge, addressing a key limitation of standard GP in healthcare scheduling.

Method: Develop a dimensionally aware GP algorithm that incorporates a dimension repair procedure to ensure dimensional consistency. The repair is formulated as a mixed-integer linear program (MILP). The method temporarily allows dimension inconsistencies during search to explore more AR structures and then restores consistency without large structural changes. Applied to expression trees representing ARs and evaluated on simulated clinics against manual ARs and existing dimensionally aware GP methods.

Result: The approach evolved high-quality ARs that significantly outperformed manually designed ARs and existing state-of-the-art dimensionally aware GP methods both in objective performance and in dimensional consistency; a semantic analysis of the evolved ARs provided insights for interpretable AR design.

Conclusion: Dimension repair enables broader, more expressive AR search while maintaining domain-consistent outputs, yielding interpretable, high-performing ARs and offering design insights for future AR development.

Abstract: Appointment scheduling is a great challenge in healthcare operations
management. Appointment rules (AR) provide medical practitioners with a simple
yet effective tool to determine patient appointment times. Genetic programming
(GP) can be used to evolve ARs. However, directly applying GP to design ARs may
lead to rules that are difficult for end-users to interpret and trust. A key
reason is that GP is unaware of the dimensional consistency, which ensures that
the evolved rules align with users' domain knowledge and intuitive
understanding. In this paper, we develop a new dimensionally aware GP algorithm
with dimension repair to evolve ARs with dimensional consistency and high
performance. A key innovation of our method is the dimension repair procedure,
which optimizes the dimensional consistency of an expression tree while
minimizing structural changes and ensuring that its output dimension meets the
problem's requirements. We formulate the task as a mixed-integer linear
programming model that can be efficiently solved using common mathematical
programming methods. With the support of the dimension repair procedure, our
method can explore a wider range of AR structures by temporarily breaking the
dimensional consistency of individuals, and then restoring it without altering
their overall structure, thereby identifying individuals with greater potential
advantages. We evaluated the proposed method in a comprehensive set of
simulated clinics. The experimental results demonstrate that our approach
managed to evolve high-quality ARs that significantly outperform not only the
manually designed ARs but also existing state-of-the-art dimensionally aware GP
methods in terms of both objective values and dimensional consistency. In
addition, we analyzed the semantics of the evolved ARs, providing insight into
the design of more effective and interpretable ARs.

### [551] [Fantastic Pretraining Optimizers and Where to Find Them](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02046)
*Kaiyue Wen,David Hall,Tengyu Ma,Percy Liang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Systematic study questions the claimed speedups of alternative optimizers over AdamW in LM pretraining; fair tuning and full-training, multi-scale evaluation reduce observed gains to ~1.1x for 1.2B models. Matrix-based preconditioners help but gains decline with model size; premature checkpoint comparisons can mislead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fair, scalable comparisons of optimizers are needed to guide practical LM pretraining, addressing issues of unequal hyperparameter tuning and narrow evaluation setups.

Method: Ten optimizers examined across four model scales (0.1B–1.2B params) and data-to-model ratios (1–8x Chinchilla). Hyperparameters tuned per optimizer; evaluations conducted at training end across scales; analysis of speedups and preconditioning strategies.

Result: Optimal hyperparameters differ by optimizer; speedups over well-tuned baselines are smaller than claimed and shrink with model size (≈1.4x at 0.1B to ≈1.1x at 1.2B). Rankings can flip during training due to learning rate decay; fastest optimizers (Muon, Soap) use matrix-based preconditioners, but gains diminish with scale.

Conclusion: Fair, informative optimizer comparisons require rigorous per-optimizer tuning and end-of-training evaluation across multiple scales; matrix-based preconditioners offer gains but are increasingly limited for larger models, guiding careful optimizer selection and evaluation practices.

Abstract: AdamW has long been the dominant optimizer in language model pretraining,
despite numerous claims that alternative optimizers offer 1.4 to 2x speedup. We
posit that two methodological shortcomings have obscured fair comparisons and
hindered practical adoption: (i) unequal hyperparameter tuning and (ii) limited
or misleading evaluation setups. To address these two issues, we conduct a
systematic study of ten deep learning optimizers across four model scales
(0.1B-1.2B parameters) and data-to-model ratios (1-8x the Chinchilla optimum).
We find that fair and informative comparisons require rigorous hyperparameter
tuning and evaluations across a range of model scales and data-to-model ratios,
performed at the end of training. First, optimal hyperparameters for one
optimizer may be suboptimal for another, making blind hyperparameter transfer
unfair. Second, the actual speedup of many proposed optimizers over well-tuned
baselines is lower than claimed and decreases with model size to only 1.1x for
1.2B parameter models. Thirdly, comparing intermediate checkpoints before
reaching the target training budgets can be misleading, as rankings between two
optimizers can flip during training due to learning rate decay. Through our
thorough investigation, we find that all the fastest optimizers such as Muon
and Soap, use matrices as preconditioners -- multiplying gradients with
matrices rather than entry-wise scalars. However, the speedup of matrix-based
optimizers is inversely proportional to model scale, decreasing from 1.4x over
AdamW for 0.1B parameter models to merely 1.1x for 1.2B parameter models.

*Yi Yin,Guangquan Zhang,Hua Zuo,Jie Lu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A bilevel privacy-utility framework for private data publication that guides data generation with a discriminator to preserve downstream task fidelity while using a curvature-based privacy metric to steer data toward low-curvature regions, thereby reducing MIA risk. It alternates optimization to improve both privacy and utility, outperforming baselines in sample quality, diversity, and privacy resistance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sharing datasets privately is essential due to privacy risks like membership inference attacks (MIA). Traditional privacy techniques (perturbation, generalization, synthetic data) often degrade accuracy, specificity, and diversity, limiting downstream performance. A principled balance between privacy and utility remains challenging.

Method: Propose a bilevel optimization framework. The upper level uses a discriminator-guided generation process to map perturbed latent variables to high-quality samples preserving utility for downstream tasks. The lower level introduces a local extrinsic curvature measure on the data manifold as a quantitative privacy metric for MIA vulnerability; samples are perturbed toward low-curvature regions to suppress distinctive feature combinations that leak information. The two objectives are optimized alternately to balance privacy and utility.

Result: Experimental evaluations show that the method enhances resistance to MIA in downstream tasks and surpasses existing methods in sample quality and diversity.

Conclusion: The framework provides a geometric foundation for targeted privacy protection, achieving a synergistic balance between privacy and utility and outperforming baselines in privacy resistance and data quality.

Abstract: Machine learning models require datasets for effective training, but directly
sharing raw data poses significant privacy risk such as membership inference
attacks (MIA). To mitigate the risk, privacy-preserving techniques such as data
perturbation, generalization, and synthetic data generation are commonly
utilized. However, these methods often degrade data accuracy, specificity, and
diversity, limiting the performance of downstream tasks and thus reducing data
utility. Therefore, striking an optimal balance between privacy preservation
and data utility remains a critical challenge.
  To address this issue, we introduce a novel bilevel optimization framework
for the publication of private datasets, where the upper-level task focuses on
data utility and the lower-level task focuses on data privacy. In the
upper-level task, a discriminator guides the generation process to ensure that
perturbed latent variables are mapped to high-quality samples, maintaining
fidelity for downstream tasks. In the lower-level task, our framework employs
local extrinsic curvature on the data manifold as a quantitative measure of
individual vulnerability to MIA, providing a geometric foundation for targeted
privacy protection. By perturbing samples toward low-curvature regions, our
method effectively suppresses distinctive feature combinations that are
vulnerable to MIA. Through alternating optimization of both objectives, we
achieve a synergistic balance between privacy and utility. Extensive
experimental evaluations demonstrate that our method not only enhances
resistance to MIA in downstream tasks but also surpasses existing methods in
terms of sample quality and diversity.

*Haiwen Guan,Troy Arcomano,Ashesh Chattopadhyay,Romit Maulik*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LUCIE-3D is a lightweight 3D climate emulator using a SFNO backbone trained on ERA5 data across eight vertical levels, with CO2 forcing and optional SST coupling, achieving realistic climate means, variability, long-term trends, and key dynamical modes with efficient training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fill the need for fast, stable, and physically consistent 3D climate emulators that resolve vertical structure and coupled dynamics, enabling rapid experimentation, sensitivity tests, and paleoclimate studies.

Method: A Spherical Fourier Neural Operator (SFNO) backbone trained on 30 years of ERA5 reanalysis data across eight σ-levels. Atmospheric CO2 is included as a forcing variable, and prescribed SST can be integrated to simulate coupled ocean–atmosphere dynamics. Evaluation targets climatology, variability, long-term climate change signals, and dynamical processes (Kelvin waves, MJO, annular modes) as well as extreme-event statistics.

Result: LUCIE-3D reproduces climatological means and variability, and long-term signals such as surface warming and stratospheric cooling under increasing CO2. It captures key dynamical processes (equatorial Kelvin waves, Madden–Julian Oscillation, annular modes) and shows credible extreme-event statistics. Training requires under five hours on four GPUs, despite being longer than the 2D version.

Conclusion: The model offers stability, physical consistency, and accessibility, making it a valuable tool for rapid experimentation, ablation studies, and exploring coupled climate dynamics, with promising applications in paleoclimate research and future Earth-system emulation.

Abstract: We introduce LUCIE-3D, a lightweight three-dimensional climate emulator
designed to capture the vertical structure of the atmosphere, respond to
climate change forcings, and maintain computational efficiency with long-term
stability. Building on the original LUCIE-2D framework, LUCIE-3D employs a
Spherical Fourier Neural Operator (SFNO) backbone and is trained on 30 years of
ERA5 reanalysis data spanning eight vertical {\sigma}-levels. The model
incorporates atmospheric CO2 as a forcing variable and optionally integrates
prescribed sea surface temperature (SST) to simulate coupled ocean--atmosphere
dynamics. Results demonstrate that LUCIE-3D successfully reproduces
climatological means, variability, and long-term climate change signals,
including surface warming and stratospheric cooling under increasing CO2
concentrations. The model further captures key dynamical processes such as
equatorial Kelvin waves, the Madden--Julian Oscillation, and annular modes,
while showing credible behavior in the statistics of extreme events. Despite
requiring longer training than its 2D predecessor, LUCIE-3D remains efficient,
training in under five hours on four GPUs. Its combination of stability,
physical consistency, and accessibility makes it a valuable tool for rapid
experimentation, ablation studies, and the exploration of coupled climate
dynamics, with potential applications extending to paleoclimate research and
future Earth system emulation.

*Srinivas Anumasa,Barath Chandran. C,Tingting Chen,Dianbo Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A diffusion-based generative model for sparse, high-dimensional protein data that uses kernel density estimation (KDE) to estimate a per-sample noise scale and trains with data-dependent sigma, improving sample quality by incorporating local data geometry.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Protein data are high-dimensional and unevenly distributed, with many regions of varying sparsity. Standard diffusion models use a global noise schedule and ignore data-dependent density, potentially hindering coverage of sparse regions. A data-aware approach could better capture local structure and improve generation.

Method: Apply KDE as a preprocessing step to estimate a per-sample noise scale σ for each data point. Train a score-based diffusion model using these data-dependent σ values, integrating local geometry into the denoising process (Data-Dependent Smoothing Walk-Jump framework).

Result: Empirical evaluations show consistent improvements across multiple metrics on sparse, high-dimensional protein data, indicating that data-aware sigma prediction enhances generative modeling in such domains.

Conclusion: Incorporating data-dependent noise scales via KDE and per-sample sigma in diffusion models improves generation in sparse, high-dimensional settings by leveraging local data geometry.

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as a powerful class of generative models by
learning to iteratively reverse the noising process. Their ability to generate
high-quality samples has extended beyond high-dimensional image data to other
complex domains such as proteins, where data distributions are typically sparse
and unevenly spread. Importantly, the sparsity itself is uneven. Empirically,
we observed that while a small fraction of samples lie in dense clusters, the
majority occupy regions of varying sparsity across the data space. Existing
approaches largely ignore this data-dependent variability. In this work, we
introduce a Data-Dependent Smoothing Walk-Jump framework that employs kernel
density estimation (KDE) as a preprocessing step to estimate the noise scale
$\sigma$ for each data point, followed by training a score model with these
data-dependent $\sigma$ values. By incorporating local data geometry into the
denoising process, our method accounts for the heterogeneous distribution of
protein data. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that our approach yields
consistent improvements across multiple metrics, highlighting the importance of
data-aware sigma prediction for generative modeling in sparse, high-dimensional
settings.

*Jian Chen,Jinbao Tian,Yunqi Xu,Zhou Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ABEX-RAT combines abstractive-expansive data augmentation with random adversarial training to tackle class-imbalance in occupational accident report classification, achieving SOTA macro-F1 on the OSHA dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Class imbalance in real-world occupational accident datasets causes poor performance on rare but severe incident types; need efficient alternatives to brute-force fine-tuning.

Method: ABEX two-step ABEX pipeline: LLM distills core incident semantics; generative model creates diverse synthetic samples for underrepresented classes; train a lightweight classifier with RAT perturbations for robustness with low overhead.

Result: On OSHA dataset, macro-F1 90.32%, outperforming SOTA and fine-tuned large-model baselines.

Conclusion: The synergistic ABEX-RAT approach is effective and efficient for imbalanced, specialized classification tasks and offers a scalable alternative to heavy fine-tuning; code available.

Abstract: The automatic classification of occupational accident reports is a critical
research area for enhancing workplace safety and enabling large-scale risk
analysis. However, the severe class imbalance inherent in these real-world
datasets often compromises the performance of analytical models, particularly
for rare but severe incident types, hindering the development of reliable
automated systems. To address this challenge, we propose ABEX-RAT, a novel and
efficient framework that synergizes generative data augmentation with robust
adversarial training. Our approach first employs a twostep
abstractive-expansive (ABEX) pipeline, which leverages a large language model
to distill core incident semantics and then uses a generative model to create
diverse, highquality synthetic samples for underrepresented classes.
Subsequently, a lightweight classifier is trained on the augmented data using a
computationally efficient random adversarial training (RAT) protocol, which
stochastically applies perturbations to enhance model generalization and
robustness without significant overhead. Experimental results on the public
OSHA dataset demonstrate that our method achieves new state-of-the-art
performance, reaching a macro-F1 score of 90.32% and significantly
outperforming previous SOTA and fine-tuned large model baselines. Our work
validates that this synergistic strategy is a highly effective and efficient
alternative to brute-force fine-tuning for specialized, imbalanced
classification tasks. The code is publicly available

*Long Shi,Yunshan Ye,Wenjie Wang,Tao Lei,Yu Zhao,Gang Kou,Badong Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes CIML, an information-theoretic multi-view learning framework leveraging both common and unique information (not just redundancy) to produce a predictive joint representation, with theoretical guarantees and strong empirical results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multi-view learning often relies on the multi-view redundancy assumption, claiming that common information across views suffices for prediction. This ignores potentially predictive unique information in each view. A framework that utilizes both common and unique information could improve performance and robustness.

Method: CIML learns a common representation by maximizing Gacs-Korner common information and then compressing it via the Information Bottleneck to obtain task-relevant features. For each view, it learns a compressed unique representation via the IB objective while minimizing mutual information between unique and common representations and among different unique representations.

Result: Theoretically proves that the learned joint representation is predictive sufficient for the downstream task. Empirically demonstrates superiority over state-of-the-art methods across datasets. Code is released.

Conclusion: CIML discards the strict multi-view redundancy assumption and provides a principled IB-based framework that exploits both common and unique information to enhance multi-view learning, supported by theory and strong empirical results.

Abstract: Information theory has inspired numerous advancements in multi-view learning.
Most multi-view methods incorporating information-theoretic principles rely an
assumption called multi-view redundancy which states that common information
between views is necessary and sufficient for down-stream tasks. This
assumption emphasizes the importance of common information for prediction, but
inherently ignores the potential of unique information in each view that could
be predictive to the task. In this paper, we propose a comprehensive
information-theoretic multi-view learning framework named CIML, which discards
the assumption of multi-view redundancy. Specifically, CIML considers the
potential predictive capabilities of both common and unique information based
on information theory. First, the common representation learning maximizes
Gacs-Korner common information to extract shared features and then compresses
this information to learn task-relevant representations based on the
Information Bottleneck (IB). For unique representation learning, IB is employed
to achieve the most compressed unique representation for each view while
simultaneously minimizing the mutual information between unique and common
representations, as well as among different unique representations.
Importantly, we theoretically prove that the learned joint representation is
predictively sufficient for the downstream task. Extensive experimental results
have demonstrated the superiority of our model over several state-of-art
methods. The code is released on CIML.

*Touayouch Brahim,Fosse Loïc,Damnati Géraldine,Lecorvé Gwénolé*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A model-merging framework for multitask learning that uses Jensen-Shannon divergence to fuse models trained on different tasks without extra labeled data, balancing task importance and maintaining strong performance as the number of tasks grows.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tackling task interference in multi-task learning and model merging as the task count increases, by enabling effective fusion of task-specific models without additional labels.

Method: Merge task-specific models by guiding the fusion with Jensen-Shannon divergence, automatically balancing task importance and without requiring extra labeled data.

Result: The method remains robust as the number of tasks grows and consistently outperforms prior work, preserving strong performance across all tasks.

Conclusion: JS-divergence-guided model merging provides a scalable, label-free approach to multi-task model fusion that mitigates interference and scales to many tasks.

Abstract: Multi-task learning (MTL) is often achieved by merging datasets before
fine-tuning, but the growing availability of fine-tuned models has led to new
approaches such as model merging via task arithmetic. A major challenge in this
setting is task interference, which worsens as the number of tasks increases.
We propose a method that merges models trained on different tasks into a single
model, maintaining strong performance across all tasks. Our approach leverages
Jensen-Shannon divergence to guide the merging process without requiring
additional labelled data, and automatically balances task importance. Unlike
existing methods, our approach remains robust as the number of tasks grows and
consistently outperforms prior work.

TL;DR: Differentiable EM for latent-variable models enabling a differentiable MW2 distance between GMMs; compares differentiation strategies and adds theoretical guarantees plus an unbalanced variant; demonstrated across imaging tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EM is a cornerstone but is typically treated as a non-differentiable black box, hindering end-to-end gradient-based learning. Making EM differentiable enables integrating EM-based models and distances (MW2) into modern ML pipelines.

Method: Investigates multiple differentiation strategies for EM, from full automatic differentiation to approximations; applies these strategies to compute the Mixture Wasserstein distance MW2 between GMMs; proves a stability result supporting MW2 with EM; introduces an unbalanced MW2 variant.

Result: Benchmarks show trade-offs in accuracy and computational cost across differentiation methods; MW2 becomes a differentiable loss suitable for imaging ML tasks; numerical experiments (barycenters, color/style transfer, image generation, texture synthesis) demonstrate versatility and effectiveness; stability result provides theoretical justification for using MW2 with EM.

Conclusion: Differentiable EM broadens the applicability of MW2 as a differentiable objective in end-to-end learning, with a new unbalanced MW2 expanding its reach; the work combines theory, methodology, and practical demonstrations across diverse tasks.

Abstract: The Expectation-Maximisation (EM) algorithm is a central tool in statistics
and machine learning, widely used for latent-variable models such as Gaussian
Mixture Models (GMMs). Despite its ubiquity, EM is typically treated as a
non-differentiable black box, preventing its integration into modern learning
pipelines where end-to-end gradient propagation is essential. In this work, we
present and compare several differentiation strategies for EM, from full
automatic differentiation to approximate methods, assessing their accuracy and
computational efficiency. As a key application, we leverage this differentiable
EM in the computation of the Mixture Wasserstein distance $\mathrm{MW}_2$
between GMMs, allowing $\mathrm{MW}_2$ to be used as a differentiable loss in
imaging and machine learning tasks. To complement our practical use of
$\mathrm{MW}_2$, we contribute a novel stability result which provides
theoretical justification for the use of $\mathrm{MW}_2$ with EM, and also
introduce a novel unbalanced variant of $\mathrm{MW}_2$. Numerical experiments
on barycentre computation, colour and style transfer, image generation, and
texture synthesis illustrate the versatility and effectiveness of the proposed
approach in different settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current malware graph datasets oversimplify to single-level graphs, missing semantic links between high-level functional interactions and low-level instruction logic; a large-scale hierarchical dataset is needed.

Method: Construct a two-level representation (CFGs within FCGs), resulting in a public dataset of 200M CFGs inside 595K FCGs, plus tooling; perform large-scale analysis to reveal structural properties.

Result: Ships the largest public hierarchical graph dataset for malware analysis; demonstrates distinct structural properties between benign and malicious software; provides a foundational benchmark.

Conclusion: HiGraph establishes a foundational resource for hierarchical malware graph analysis and detectors that exploit cross-level structure; dataset and tools are publicly available.

Abstract: The advancement of graph-based malware analysis is critically limited by the
absence of large-scale datasets that capture the inherent hierarchical
structure of software. Existing methods often oversimplify programs into single
level graphs, failing to model the crucial semantic relationship between
high-level functional interactions and low-level instruction logic. To bridge
this gap, we introduce \dataset, the largest public hierarchical graph dataset
for malware analysis, comprising over \textbf{200M} Control Flow Graphs (CFGs)
nested within \textbf{595K} Function Call Graphs (FCGs). This two-level
representation preserves structural semantics essential for building robust
detectors resilient to code obfuscation and malware evolution. We demonstrate
HiGraph's utility through a large-scale analysis that reveals distinct
structural properties of benign and malicious software, establishing it as a
foundational benchmark for the community. The dataset and tools are publicly

*Chanakya Varude,Jay Chaudhary,Siddharth Kaushik,Prasanna Chaporkar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Threshold-based bandit problem: select arms by relation to a threshold tau under a monotone mean structure. Variants include first above tau, kth above/below tau, or closest to tau. Derives asymptotic regret lower bounds depending only on arms adjacent to tau; proposes optimal algorithms validated by Monte Carlo simulations; applications span networks, dosing, energy, and recommendations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many decision problems require choosing actions relative to a predefined threshold (e.g., CQI in networks, clinical dosing, energy management, recommendations). A threshold constraint can focus exploration on arms near tau, improving efficiency and relevance of decisions.

Method: Assume a monotone structure of arm means and define objective variants (first above tau, kth above/below, or closest to tau). Derive asymptotic regret lower bounds that depend only on neighboring arms around tau. Propose algorithms that exploit monotonicity and threshold structure; validate optimality via Monte Carlo simulations.

Result: The regret lower bounds depend only on arms adjacent to the threshold. The proposed algorithms achieve asymptotic optimality (matching lower bounds) and perform well in Monte Carlo simulations.

Conclusion: Threshold-constrained bandits extend classical bandit theory by incorporating threshold criteria, enabling efficient decision-making in practical applications where an action must be evaluated relative to a threshold.

Abstract: In multi-armed bandit problems, the typical goal is to identify the arm with
the highest reward. This paper explores a threshold-based bandit problem,
aiming to select an arm based on its relation to a prescribed threshold \(\tau
\). We study variants where the optimal arm is the first above \(\tau\), the
\(k^{th}\) arm above or below it, or the closest to it, under a monotonic
structure of arm means. We derive asymptotic regret lower bounds, showing
dependence only on arms adjacent to \(\tau\). Motivated by applications in
communication networks (CQI allocation), clinical dosing, energy management,
recommendation systems, and more. We propose algorithms with optimality
validated through Monte Carlo simulations. Our work extends classical bandit
theory with threshold constraints for efficient decision-making.

TL;DR: A zero-shot test-time scaling VPR framework using guidance-based prompts for direct similarity scoring, enabling real-time adaptation with no extra training and large efficiency gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VPR methods rely on heavy foundation/MLLMs and fine-tuning, causing high compute and limited cross-domain transfer; a training-free, fast, generalizable approach is needed.

Method: Test-Time Scaling (TTS) with guidance-based prompts that elicit length-controlled JSON from MLLMs, enabling direct similarity scoring; structured prompts produce JSON outputs; Uncertainty-Aware Self-Consistency (UASC) enables adaptation without training; no two-stage processing.

Result: Significant cross-domain VPR improvements; up to 210x computational efficiency gains; real-time, zero-shot adaptability; better generalization across diverse environments.

Conclusion: Demonstrates the viability of zero-shot, prompt-guided VPR with TTS and UASC; reduces training costs and enhances generalization; potential extension to other cross-domain vision-language tasks.

Abstract: Visual Place Recognition (VPR) has evolved from handcrafted descriptors to
deep learning approaches, yet significant challenges remain. Current
approaches, including Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) and Multimodal Large
Language Models (MLLMs), enhance semantic understanding but suffer from high
computational overhead and limited cross-domain transferability when
fine-tuned. To address these limitations, we propose a novel zero-shot
framework employing Test-Time Scaling (TTS) that leverages MLLMs'
vision-language alignment capabilities through Guidance-based methods for
direct similarity scoring. Our approach eliminates two-stage processing by
employing structured prompts that generate length-controllable JSON outputs.
The TTS framework with Uncertainty-Aware Self-Consistency (UASC) enables
real-time adaptation without additional training costs, achieving superior
generalization across diverse environments. Experimental results demonstrate
significant improvements in cross-domain VPR performance with up to 210$\times$

*Kim Hammar,Rolf Stadler*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Online active causal learning of IT system models using Gaussian processes; Bayesian-optimal interventions with low interference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need to automate and optimize IT system management by learning causal relations from data without heavy domain expertise; handle complexity and dynamism of modern IT systems.

Method: Iterative online learning using Gaussian process regression to model causal functions; rollout-based intervention policy to collect measurements; active causal learning to select interventions; proven Bayesian optimality.

Result: Experimental validation on a testbed showing accurate causal model identification and low operational interference.

Conclusion: Presents the first principled online, data-driven method for IT system causal identification, enabling effective interventions and improved automation.

Abstract: Identifying a causal model of an IT system is fundamental to many branches of
systems engineering and operation. Such a model can be used to predict the
effects of control actions, optimize operations, diagnose failures, detect
intrusions, etc., which is central to achieving the longstanding goal of
automating network and system management tasks. Traditionally, causal models
have been designed and maintained by domain experts. This, however, proves
increasingly challenging with the growing complexity and dynamism of modern IT
systems. In this paper, we present the first principled method for online,
data-driven identification of an IT system in the form of a causal model. The
method, which we call active causal learning, estimates causal functions that
capture the dependencies among system variables in an iterative fashion using
Gaussian process regression based on system measurements, which are collected
through a rollout-based intervention policy. We prove that this method is
optimal in the Bayesian sense and that it produces effective interventions.
Experimental validation on a testbed shows that our method enables accurate
identification of a causal system model while inducing low interference with
system operations.

*Aymene Mohammed Bouayed,Samuel Deslauriers-Gauthier,Adrian Iaccovelli,David Naccache*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Conditional-t3VAE equalizes latent-space allocation across classes by using a per-class joint Student's t prior over latent and outputs and a gamma-divergence based objective, yielding fairer, more diverse generation under severe class imbalance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Global priors in VAEs reflect class frequencies, causing underrepresentation of tail classes and reduced generative fairness on imbalanced data.

Method: Propose a Conditional-t3VAE with a per-class Student's t joint prior over latent and output variables, preventing dominance by majority classes. Optimize with a closed-form objective derived from the gamma-power divergence; derive an equal-weight latent mixture for class-balanced generation.

Result: On SVHN-LT, CIFAR100-LT, and CelebA, Conditional-t3VAE achieves lower FID scores than t^3VAE and Gaussian-based VAEs, especially under severe imbalance. Per-class F1 also improves versus conditional Gaussian VAE across highly imbalanced settings; Gaussian baselines help only under mild imbalance (rho ≲ 3).

Conclusion: Equitable latent-space allocation across classes improves generative fairness and diversity in VAEs trained on imbalanced data; conditional-t3VAE effectively mitigates dominance by majority classes and is particularly beneficial under extreme imbalance.

Abstract: Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) with global priors mirror the training set's
class frequency in latent space, underrepresenting tail classes and reducing
generative fairness on imbalanced datasets. While $t^3$VAE improves robustness
via heavy-tailed Student's t-distribution priors, it still allocates latent
volume proportionally to the class frequency.In this work, we address this
issue by explicitly enforcing equitable latent space allocation across classes.
To this end, we propose Conditional-$t^3$VAE, which defines a per-class
\mbox{Student's t} joint prior over latent and output variables, preventing
dominance by majority classes. Our model is optimized using a closed-form
objective derived from the $\gamma$-power divergence. Moreover, for
class-balanced generation, we derive an equal-weight latent mixture of
Student's t-distributions. On SVHN-LT, CIFAR100-LT, and CelebA,
Conditional-$t^3$VAE consistently achieves lower FID scores than both $t^3$VAE
and Gaussian-based VAE baselines, particularly under severe class imbalance. In
per-class F1 evaluations, Conditional-$t^3$VAE also outperforms the conditional
Gaussian VAE across all highly imbalanced settings. While Gaussian-based models
remain competitive under mild imbalance ratio ($\rho \lesssim 3$), our approach
substantially improves generative fairness and diversity in more extreme
regimes.

*Pieter Smet*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Simulating ML predictions to study how prediction error affects solution quality in Predict-Then-Optimize; extends to multiclass; finds non-trivial relationships; informs design of ML-driven decisions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Uncertainty in optimization and lack of empirical evidence on how predictive accuracy translates to near-optimal solutions in complex, constrained problems; simulation provides a flexible experimental framework without training real models.

Method: Extend a binary-classifier simulator with a new multiclass prediction simulator; conduct computational study; apply to a Predict-Then-Optimize algorithm for a machine scheduling problem; compare simulated vs actual predictions; analyze impact of prediction error on optimality.

Result: Prediction-style simulations can approximate classifier performance with reasonable accuracy, though variability exists; the relationship between prediction error and optimality is non-trivial.

Conclusion: Simulation-based evaluation is valuable for designing and evaluating decision systems relying on ML predictions; careful consideration of prediction error effects is needed, especially in constrained scheduling contexts.

Abstract: Uncertainty in optimization is often represented as stochastic parameters in
the optimization model. In Predict-Then-Optimize approaches, predictions of a
machine learning model are used as values for such parameters, effectively
transforming the stochastic optimization problem into a deterministic one. This
two-stage framework is built on the assumption that more accurate predictions
result in solutions that are closer to the actual optimal solution. However,
providing evidence for this assumption in the context of complex, constrained
optimization problems is challenging and often overlooked in the literature.
Simulating predictions of machine learning models offers a way to
(experimentally) analyze how prediction error impacts solution quality without
the need to train real models. Complementing an algorithm from the literature
for simulating binary classification, we introduce a new algorithm for
simulating predictions of multiclass classifiers. We conduct a computational
study to evaluate the performance of these algorithms, and show that classifier
performance can be simulated with reasonable accuracy, although some
variability is observed. Additionally, we apply these algorithms to assess the
performance of a Predict-Then-Optimize algorithm for a machine scheduling
problem. The experiments demonstrate that the relationship between prediction
error and how close solutions are to the actual optimum is non-trivial,
highlighting important considerations for the design and evaluation of
decision-making systems based on machine learning predictions.

*Afif Boudaoud,Alexandru Calotoiu,Marcin Copik,Torsten Hoefler*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DaCe AD is a general, no-code automatic differentiation engine for HPC that optimizes memory usage by ILP-based planning of storing vs recomputing intermediates, achieving large performance gains ( >90x on average over JAX on NPBench).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AD frameworks struggle with limited language support, require code modifications, underperform on scientific codes, and rely on a naive store-all approach for gradient data. There is a need for a memory-aware, language-agnostic AD solution that integrates well with scientific computing and ML in simulations.

Method: Introduce DaCe AD, an automatic differentiation engine that requires no code changes. It uses an integer linear programming (ILP) based optimization to balance storing and recomputing intermediates under a memory constraint, and demonstrates generality by applying to NPBench HPC benchmarks.

Result: DaCe AD outperforms JAX, a state-of-the-art general AD framework, by more than 92x on average on NPBench benchmarks without any code modifications.

Conclusion: DaCe AD provides a general, efficient AD solution for scientific computing with a memory-aware, no-code approach, addressing key limitations of existing frameworks and enabling faster gradient computation in HPC contexts.

Abstract: Automatic differentiation (AD) is a set of techniques that systematically
applies the chain rule to compute the gradients of functions without requiring
human intervention. Although the fundamentals of this technology were
established decades ago, it is experiencing a renaissance as it plays a key
role in efficiently computing gradients for backpropagation in machine learning
algorithms. AD is also crucial for many applications in scientific computing
domains, particularly emerging techniques that integrate machine learning
models within scientific simulations and schemes. Existing AD frameworks have
four main limitations: limited support of programming languages, requiring code
modifications for AD compatibility, limited performance on scientific computing
codes, and a naive store-all solution for forward-pass data required for
gradient calculations. These limitations force domain scientists to manually
compute the gradients for large problems. This work presents DaCe AD, a
general, efficient automatic differentiation engine that requires no code
modifications. DaCe AD uses a novel ILP-based algorithm to optimize the
trade-off between storing and recomputing to achieve maximum performance within
a given memory constraint. We showcase the generality of our method by applying
it to NPBench, a suite of HPC benchmarks with diverse scientific computing

TL;DR: Introduces a dynamic verification framework and a 32B medical LLM Baichuan-M2 trained with reinforcement learning; achieves strong performance on HealthBench Hard, surpassing many rivals, highlighting the importance of interactive verification for clinical deployment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Static medical benchmarks (e.g., USMLE) do not capture the interactive, dynamic nature of real-world clinical decision-making, leading to a gap between benchmark performance and practical clinical utility.

Method: A dynamic verification framework with two components: a Patient Simulator that creates realistic clinical environments using de-identified medical records, and a Clinical Rubrics Generator that dynamically provides multi-dimensional evaluation metrics. Trains Baichuan-M2 (32B) via a multi-stage reinforcement learning pipeline using an improved Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Evaluation performed on HealthBench.

Result: Baichuan-M2 outperforms all open-source models and most advanced closed-source counterparts on HealthBench Hard, achieving a score above 32 (a level previously achieved only by GPT-5).

Conclusion: Robust dynamic verifier systems are essential to align LLM capabilities with practical clinical applications, establishing a new Pareto front in performance vs. model size for medical AI deployment.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) advance in conversational and reasoning
capabilities, their practical application in healthcare has become a critical
research focus. However, there is a notable gap between the performance of
medical LLMs on static benchmarks such as USMLE and their utility in real-world
clinical decision-making. This discrepancy arises because traditional exams
fail to capture the dynamic, interactive nature of medical consultations. To
address this challenge, we introduce a novel dynamic verification framework
that moves beyond static answer verifier, establishing a large-scale,
high-fidelity interactive reinforcement learning system. Our framework
comprises two key components: a Patient Simulator that creates realistic
clinical environments using de-identified medical records, and a Clinical
Rubrics Generator that dynamically produces multi-dimensional evaluation
metrics. Building on this foundation, we develop Baichuan-M2, a 32B-parameter
medical augmented reasoning model trained through a multi-stage reinforcement
learning strategy with an improved Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)
algorithm. Evaluated on HealthBench, Baichuan-M2 outperforms all other
open-source models and most advanced closed-source counterparts, achieving a
score above 32 on the challenging HealthBench Hard benchmark-previously
exceeded only by GPT-5. Our work demonstrates that robust dynamic verifier
system is essential for aligning LLM capabilities with practical clinical
applications, establishing a new Pareto front in the performance-parameter
trade-off for medical AI deployment.

*Binqing Wu,Jianlong Huang,Zongjiang Shang,Ling Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ST-Hyper introduces a triple-module approach (STPM for multi ST-scales feature extraction, AHM for sparse high-order dependency modeling, and tri-phase hypergraph propagation) to capture cross-scale spatio-temporal dynamics in multivariate time series, achieving state-of-the-art forecasting performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MTS methods struggle to model dependencies across combined spatial-temporal scales (ST-scales). There is a need to capture high-order, cross-scale relationships to improve forecasting accuracy.

Method: ST-Hyper comprises (1) Spatial-Temporal Pyramid Modeling (STPM) to extract features at multiple ST-scales, (2) Adaptive Hypergraph Modeling (AHM) to learn a sparse hypergraph representing high-order dependencies, and (3) tri-phase hypergraph propagation to integrate multi-scale spatial-temporal information. The approach is evaluated on six real-world MTS datasets.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance, with average MAE reductions of 3.8% for long-term forecasting and 6.8% for short-term forecasting across datasets.

Conclusion: Modeling high-order dependencies across multiple ST-scales via adaptive sparse hypergraphs and tri-phase propagation yields superior multivariate time series forecasting performance.

Abstract: In multivariate time series (MTS) forecasting, many deep learning based
methods have been proposed for modeling dependencies at multiple spatial
(inter-variate) or temporal (intra-variate) scales. However, existing methods
may fail to model dependencies across multiple spatial-temporal scales
(ST-scales, i.e., scales that jointly consider spatial and temporal scopes). In
this work, we propose ST-Hyper to model the high-order dependencies across
multiple ST-scales through adaptive hypergraph modeling. Specifically, we
introduce a Spatial-Temporal Pyramid Modeling (STPM) module to extract features
at multiple ST-scales. Furthermore, we introduce an Adaptive Hypergraph
Modeling (AHM) module that learns a sparse hypergraph to capture robust
high-order dependencies among features. In addition, we interact with these
features through tri-phase hypergraph propagation, which can comprehensively
capture multi-scale spatial-temporal dynamics. Experimental results on six
real-world MTS datasets demonstrate that ST-Hyper achieves the state-of-the-art
performance, outperforming the best baselines with an average MAE reduction of
3.8\% and 6.8\% for long-term and short-term forecasting, respectively.

### [568] [VariAntNet: Learning Decentralized Control of Multi-Agent Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02271)
*Yigal Koifman,Erez Koifman,Eran Iceland,Ariel Barel,Alfred M. Bruckstein*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A deep learning-based decentralized control model, VariAntNet, enables cohesive swarm behavior for simple agents in disaster scenarios, achieving faster convergence than an analytical solution while sustaining connectivity, with a discussed speed-vs-cohesion trade-off.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of maintaining cohesion in anonymous, zero-communication swarms operating in complex, time-critical disaster environments, and to overcome limitations of slow analytical solutions by leveraging neural networks and differentiable loss functions that use the Laplacian of the visibility graph.

Method: Introduce VariAntNet, a neural network that processes unordered, variable-sized local observations; uses geometric feature extraction; trained with a novel differentiable multi-objective loss anchored in the visibility graph Laplacian to promote swarm cohesiveness; evaluated on gathering with bearing-only and limited-range sensing.

Result: Outperforms existing analytical solution, achieving more than double convergence rate (significantly faster) while preserving high connectivity across different swarm sizes.

Conclusion: ML-based decentralized control is viable for time-critical disaster operations; the approach provides substantial speed gains with a controllable trade-off (accepting some agent losses for faster convergence); highlights a practical bridge between ML techniques and classical swarm theory; calls attention to trade-offs in emergency response.

Abstract: A simple multi-agent system can be effectively utilized in disaster response
applications, such as firefighting. Such a swarm is required to operate in
complex environments with limited local sensing and no reliable inter-agent
communication or centralized control. These simple robotic agents, also known
as Ant Robots, are defined as anonymous agents that possess limited sensing
capabilities, lack a shared coordinate system, and do not communicate
explicitly with one another. A key challenge for simple swarms lies in
maintaining cohesion and avoiding fragmentation despite limited-range sensing.
Recent advances in machine learning offer effective solutions to some of the
classical decentralized control challenges. We propose VariAntNet, a deep
learning-based decentralized control model designed to facilitate agent
swarming and collaborative task execution. VariAntNet includes geometric
features extraction from unordered, variable-sized local observations. It
incorporates a neural network architecture trained with a novel,
differentiable, multi-objective, mathematically justified loss function that
promotes swarm cohesiveness by utilizing the properties of the visibility graph
Laplacian matrix. VariAntNet is demonstrated on the fundamental multi-agent
gathering task, where agents with bearing-only and limited-range sensing must
gather at some location. VariAntNet significantly outperforms an existing
analytical solution, achieving more than double the convergence rate while
maintaining high swarm connectivity across varying swarm sizes. While the
analytical solution guarantees cohesion, it is often too slow in practice. In
time-critical scenarios, such as emergency response operations where lives are
at risk, slower analytical methods are impractical and justify the loss of some
agents within the swarm. This paper presents and analyzes this trade-off in
detail.

### [569] [Calibration through the Lens of Indistinguishability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02279)
*Parikshit Gopalan,Lunjia Hu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Calibration is framed as indistinguishability between the predictor's probabilistic world and the real world; the paper surveys definitions/metrics of calibration and their implications for decision-making.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise of probabilistic predictions in ML necessitates rigorous definitions of calibration error and an understanding of what calibration means for downstream decisions.

Method: Survey of recent work; unify calibration through a view of indistinguishability using distinguishers or statistical measures; categorize and relate various calibration error metrics.

Result: Offers a unifying viewpoint that calibration measures quantify how well the predictor's world can be told apart from reality; synthesizes definitions and metrics, clarifies their decision-relevant interpretations, and outlines practical guidance and challenges.

Conclusion: Calibration is fundamentally about indistinguishability; the choice of discrimination class shapes the notion of calibration; further work is needed to connect calibration measures to decision outcomes and to develop robust, task-reappropriate metrics.

Abstract: Calibration is a classical notion from the forecasting literature which aims
to address the question: how should predicted probabilities be interpreted? In
a world where we only get to observe (discrete) outcomes, how should we
evaluate a predictor that hypothesizes (continuous) probabilities over possible
outcomes? The study of calibration has seen a surge of recent interest, given
the ubiquity of probabilistic predictions in machine learning. This survey
describes recent work on the foundational questions of how to define and
measure calibration error, and what these measures mean for downstream decision
makers who wish to use the predictions to make decisions. A unifying viewpoint
that emerges is that of calibration as a form of indistinguishability, between
the world hypothesized by the predictor and the real world (governed by nature
or the Bayes optimal predictor). In this view, various calibration measures
quantify the extent to which the two worlds can be told apart by certain
classes of distinguishers or statistical measures.

### [570] [Balanced Multimodal Learning: An Unidirectional Dynamic Interaction Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02281)
*Shijie Wang,Li Zhang,Xinyan Liang,Yuhua Qian,Shen Hu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes Unidirectional Dynamic Interaction (UDI): a sequential, non-joint-loss training paradigm for multimodal learning that trains an anchor modality to convergence and uses its representations to guide other modalities via unsupervised loss, with dynamic interaction adjustments to prevent modality dominance and improve cross-modal learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Joint multimodal losses often cause modality imbalance where strong modalities overwhelm weaker ones, limiting exploitation of individual and cross-modal information. There is a need for a proactive strategy that decouples modalities and facilitates directed information flow.

Method: UDI trains an anchor modality to convergence, then guides other modalities through unsupervised loss informed by the learned anchor representations. It decouples modality optimization and dynamically adjusts interactions between modalities to enable each to contribute optimally without domination.

Result: Experimental results claim that UDI outperforms existing methods in handling modality imbalance and improves performance on multimodal learning tasks.

Conclusion: A proactive, sequential training approach can prevent modality domination, enhance cross-modal feature learning, and improve multimodal task performance by decoupling optimization and enabling directed information flow.

Abstract: Multimodal learning typically utilizes multimodal joint loss to integrate
different modalities and enhance model performance. However, this joint
learning strategy can induce modality imbalance, where strong modalities
overwhelm weaker ones and limit exploitation of individual information from
each modality and the inter-modality interaction information.Existing
strategies such as dynamic loss weighting, auxiliary objectives and gradient
modulation mitigate modality imbalance based on joint loss. These methods
remain fundamentally reactive, detecting and correcting imbalance after it
arises, while leaving the competitive nature of the joint loss untouched. This
limitation drives us to explore a new strategy for multimodal imbalance
learning that does not rely on the joint loss, enabling more effective
interactions between modalities and better utilization of information from
individual modalities and their interactions. In this paper, we introduce
Unidirectional Dynamic Interaction (UDI), a novel strategy that abandons the
conventional joint loss in favor of a proactive, sequential training scheme.
UDI first trains the anchor modality to convergence, then uses its learned
representations to guide the other modality via unsupervised loss. Furthermore,
the dynamic adjustment of modality interactions allows the model to adapt to
the task at hand, ensuring that each modality contributes optimally. By
decoupling modality optimization and enabling directed information flow, UDI
prevents domination by any single modality and fosters effective cross-modal
feature learning. Our experimental results demonstrate that UDI outperforms
existing methods in handling modality imbalance, leading to performance
improvement in multimodal learning tasks.

*Xi Chen,Yuze Chen,Yuan Zhou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AdaSwitch is a learning-augmented online decision-making framework with a bounded-influence property that uses sequence-based predictions to achieve near-offline performance when predictions are accurate, and retains classical competitive guarantees when predictions are highly inaccurate; it applies across lead-time quotation, the k-server problem, and online allocation of reusable resources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Online decisions under uncertainty with imperfect predictions require leveraging forecasts while remaining robust to errors. There is a need for a general framework that converts predictions into near-optimal actions without sacrificing worst-case guarantees.

Method: Introduce a bounded-influence framework that limits how past decisions and requests can affect future rewards. Propose the AdaSwitch meta-algorithm that uses predictions to guide actions while preserving worst-case guarantees. The framework is general and instantiated for lead-time quotation, the k-server problem, and online allocation of reusable resources.

Result: Theoretical guarantees show near offline benchmark performance when predictions are accurate, and preservation of classical competitive ratios under highly inaccurate predictions. The framework is applicable to multiple online decision problems with irrevocable actions, demonstrating flexibility and robustness in learning-augmented online decision-making.

Conclusion: AdaSwitch offers a flexible, robust approach to learning-augmented online decision-making, bridging predictive and worst-case performance. It enables broad applications and invites further work on tighter bounds, empirical validation, and extensions to other online settings.

Abstract: We study a class of multi-period online decision-making problems with
sequence-based predictions, which may be generated by machine learning models
but whose accuracy is not guaranteed. In each period, the decision-maker
observes the realized request and must take an irrevocable action that yields a
reward or incurs a cost, without knowledge of future arrivals. We introduce a
bounded-influence framework, in which past decisions and requests exert only
limited impact on the future optimal reward. Within this framework, we propose
the AdaSwitch meta-algorithm, which exploits predictions to attain performance
close to the offline benchmark when predictions are accurate, while preserving
classical competitive-ratio guarantees under highly inaccurate predictions. Our
framework and meta-algorithm apply to diverse settings, including lead-time
quotation in processing systems, the $k$-server problem, and online allocation
of reusable resources. These applications illustrate the flexibility and broad
applicability of our approach to learning-augmented online decision-making.

### [572] [Extrapolated Markov Chain Oversampling Method for Imbalanced Text Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02332)
*Aleksi Avela,Pauliina Ilmonen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces a Markov chain–based oversampling method for imbalanced text classification, enabling minority feature-space growth by partial borrowing of transition information from both minority and majority classes, achieving competitive results especially under severe imbalance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Imbalanced text classification often suffers from biased performance and existing general oversampling methods may not handle the expanding vocabulary that accompanies growing text datasets; a method tailored to text data and that allows the minority feature space to expand is needed.

Method: A novel Markov chain based oversampling approach estimates transition probabilities from minority-class data but partially from the majority class, enabling the minority feature space to grow during oversampling.

Result: Empirical evaluation against prominent oversampling baselines on real datasets shows the proposed method achieving highly competitive results, particularly when class imbalance is severe.

Conclusion: A Markov chain–based text oversampling method is effective for imbalanced text classification, addressing vocabulary growth concerns and performing well under severe imbalance.

Abstract: Text classification is the task of automatically assigning text documents
correct labels from a predefined set of categories. In real-life (text)
classification tasks, observations and misclassification costs are often
unevenly distributed between the classes - known as the problem of imbalanced
data. Synthetic oversampling is a popular approach to imbalanced
classification. The idea is to generate synthetic observations in the minority
class to balance the classes in the training set. Many general-purpose
oversampling methods can be applied to text data; however, imbalanced text data
poses a number of distinctive difficulties that stem from the unique nature of
text compared to other domains. One such factor is that when the sample size of
text increases, the sample vocabulary (i.e., feature space) is likely to grow
as well. We introduce a novel Markov chain based text oversampling method. The
transition probabilities are estimated from the minority class but also partly
from the majority class, thus allowing the minority feature space to expand in
oversampling. We evaluate our approach against prominent oversampling methods
and show that our approach is able to produce highly competitive results
against the other methods in several real data examples, especially when the
imbalance is severe.

TL;DR: RDIT improves probabilistic time series forecasting by combining a strong point estimator with residual-based conditional diffusion in a plug-and-play framework, achieving better CRPS and coverage with fast inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate, uncertainty-aware time series forecasts are critical; existing methods struggle with distribution modeling and training-evaluation misalignment. The authors unexpectedly show that augmenting a strong point estimator with a zero-mean Gaussian whose std matches training error can yield state-of-the-art PTSF performance.

Method: Introduce RDIT, a plug-and-play framework that fuses point estimation with residual-based conditional diffusion using a bidirectional Mamba network. The authors prove that CRPS can be minimized by selecting an optimal Gaussian standard deviation and derive algorithms to achieve distribution matching.

Result: Empirical evaluations on eight multivariate datasets across diverse forecasting horizons show that RDIT achieves lower CRPS, faster inference, and improved coverage compared with strong baselines.

Conclusion: RDIT provides an effective, plug-and-play approach for probabilistic time series forecasting by aligning point estimates with diffusion-based residuals to optimize distributional metrics like CRPS, delivering improved accuracy, calibration, and efficiency across multiple datasets.

Abstract: Probabilistic Time Series Forecasting (PTSF) plays a critical role in domains
requiring accurate and uncertainty-aware predictions for decision-making.
However, existing methods offer suboptimal distribution modeling and suffer
from a mismatch between training and evaluation metrics. Surprisingly, we found
that augmenting a strong point estimator with a zero-mean Gaussian, whose
standard deviation matches its training error, can yield state-of-the-art
performance in PTSF. In this work, we propose RDIT, a plug-and-play framework
that combines point estimation and residual-based conditional diffusion with a
bidirectional Mamba network. We theoretically prove that the Continuous Ranked
Probability Score (CRPS) can be minimized by adjusting to an optimal standard
deviation and then derive algorithms to achieve distribution matching.
Evaluations on eight multivariate datasets across varied forecasting horizons
demonstrate that RDIT achieves lower CRPS, rapid inference, and improved
coverage compared to strong baselines.

*Dongseok Kim,Wonjun Jeong,Gisung Oh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A framework for Federated Learning as a strategic system with incentives, introducing two indices to separate genuine performance improvements from metric gaming, plus a practical checklist, audit-allocation algorithm, and simulations validating the approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Federated Learning performance depends on participants' covert actions; metrics can be gamed. A principled framework is needed to align incentives with true practice and to prevent metric gaming.

Method: Develop an analytical framework with two indices (behavioral incentives and collective performance loss) to interpret operational choices (rule design, disclosure level, evaluation methods, aggregator switching). Derive thresholds, auto-switch rules, and early warning signals; provide a practical audit-resource allocation algorithm and performance guarantee; validate through simulations across diverse environments; release procedures for reproducibility.

Result: The framework differentiates genuine performance-enhancing behaviors from metric gaming, offers a practical checklist and audit-resource approach, and is supported by simulations showing predicted patterns under real-world variability; reproducible procedures and design guidelines demonstrate robustness.

Conclusion: The approach yields design principles and operational guidelines that lower incentives for metric gaming while sustaining and expanding stable cooperation in Federated Learning, with robust applicability under realistic assumptions.

Abstract: The success of Federated Learning depends on the actions that participants
take out of sight. We model Federated Learning not as a mere optimization task
but as a strategic system entangled with rules and incentives. From this
perspective, we present an analytical framework that makes it possible to
clearly identify where behaviors that genuinely improve performance diverge
from those that merely target metrics. We introduce two indices that
respectively quantify behavioral incentives and collective performance loss,
and we use them as the basis for consistently interpreting the impact of
operational choices such as rule design, the level of information disclosure,
evaluation methods, and aggregator switching. We further summarize thresholds,
auto-switch rules, and early warning signals into a checklist that can be
applied directly in practice, and we provide both a practical algorithm for
allocating limited audit resources and a performance guarantee. Simulations
conducted across diverse environments consistently validate the patterns
predicted by our framework, and we release all procedures for full
reproducibility. While our approach operates most strongly under several
assumptions, combining periodic recalibration, randomization, and
connectivity-based alarms enables robust application under the variability of
real-world operations. We present both design principles and operational
guidelines that lower the incentives for metric gaming while sustaining and
expanding stable cooperation.

*Haji Gul,Abdul Ghani Naim,Ajaz Ahmad Bhat*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CSG is not a reliable dataset complexity measure for KG link prediction: it is highly sensitive to the embedding-space parameter K and shows weak/no correlation with standard metrics like MRR, undermining claims of stability and class-scaling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Assess the validity and robustness of the Cumulative Spectral Gradient (CSG) as a classifier-agnostic complexity proxy for knowledge-graph link prediction, particularly its purported scaling with class count and correlation with downstream performance.

Method: Empirical evaluation on standard KG link prediction benchmarks (e.g., FB15k-237, WN18RR) across two hyperparameters: M (Monte Carlo samples per class) and K (number of nearest neighbors in embedding space). Compare CSG values with established metrics (e.g., MRR) and analyze sensitivity and scalability across datasets.

Result: CSG behavior is highly sensitive to K and does not inherently scale with the number of target classes. CSG values show weak or no correlation with MRR. Across FB15k-237, WN18RR, and other standard datasets, CSG’s claimed stability and generalization predictive power fail in KG link prediction.

Conclusion: CSG is not a robust, classifier-agnostic complexity measure for KG link prediction. The findings motivate the development of more robust complexity metrics that are stable with respect to hyperparameters and more predictive of downstream performance.

Abstract: Accurate estimation of dataset complexity is crucial for evaluating and
comparing link prediction models for knowledge graphs (KGs). The Cumulative
Spectral Gradient (CSG) metric derived from probabilistic divergence between
classes within a spectral clustering framework was proposed as a dataset
complexity measure that (1) naturally scales with the number of classes and (2)
correlates strongly with downstream classification performance. In this work,
we rigorously assess CSG behavior on standard knowledge graph link prediction
benchmarks a multi class tail prediction task, using two key parameters
governing its computation, M, the number of Monte Carlo sampled points per
class, and K, the number of nearest neighbors in the embedding space. Contrary
to the original claims, we find that (1) CSG is highly sensitive to the choice
of K and therefore does not inherently scale with the number of target classes,
and (2) CSG values exhibit weak or no correlation with established performance
metrics such as mean reciprocal rank (MRR). Through experiments on FB15k 237,
WN18RR, and other standard datasets, we demonstrate that CSG purported
stability and generalization predictive power break down in link prediction
settings. Our results highlight the need for more robust, classifier agnostic
complexity measures in KG link prediction evaluation.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Fisher information flow through ANNs for parameter estimation can serve as a model-free guide to training: maximize FI transmission for best performance; exceeding this point causes FI loss and overfitting; provides a practical stopping criterion demonstrated on imaging data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understand how parameter-relevant information propagates inside neural networks during estimation tasks, and develop a data-driven stopping rule that does not rely on a separate validation set.

Method: Monitor and quantify the flow of Fisher information from input to output layers in an ANN trained for parameter estimation, identify the point of maximal FI transmission as the optimal performance, and show that further training reduces FI and degrades accuracy. Validate on data from a realistic imaging experiment.

Result: Estimation performance aligns with maximal FI transmission; training beyond this point leads to FI loss and overfitting; the FI-based criterion provides an effective, model-free stopping rule; demonstrated in a realistic imaging scenario.

Conclusion: Tracking FI in ANNs offers a practical method to optimize estimation performance and determine training cessation without a validation set, with applicability to real experimental data.

Abstract: The estimation of continuous parameters from measured data plays a central
role in many fields of physics. A key tool in understanding and improving such
estimation processes is the concept of Fisher information, which quantifies how
information about unknown parameters propagates through a physical system and
determines the ultimate limits of precision. With Artificial Neural Networks
(ANNs) gradually becoming an integral part of many measurement systems, it is
essential to understand how they process and transmit parameter-relevant
information internally. Here, we present a method to monitor the flow of Fisher
information through an ANN performing a parameter estimation task, tracking it
from the input to the output layer. We show that optimal estimation performance
corresponds to the maximal transmission of Fisher information, and that
training beyond this point results in information loss due to overfitting. This
provides a model-free stopping criterion for network training-eliminating the
need for a separate validation dataset. To demonstrate the practical relevance
of our approach, we apply it to a network trained on data from an imaging
experiment, highlighting its effectiveness in a realistic physical setting.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Models MoE caching as a layered paging problem, derives lower bounds, introduces a layer-based LRU policy, and shows it outperforms classic paging in simulations on synthetic data and MoE traces.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address memory/cache efficiency in mixture-of-experts LLMs by exploiting the layered architecture and ensuring frequently used experts stay in fast cache; existing paging policies may not leverage this structure.

Method: Formulate expert caching as a paging problem with layer-aware structure. Prove lower bounds on competitive ratio for deterministic and randomized policies. Propose a layer-based extension of LRU (LLRU) tailored to the problem. Validate via extensive simulations on synthetic datasets and real MoE usage traces.

Result: Lower bounds indicate limits for general policies, with LRU-like strategies achieving good competitive performance under mild assumptions. The proposed layer-based LRU consistently outperforms standard LRU and classic paging policies in simulations and actual traces.

Conclusion: A tailored layer-aware caching policy for MoE-based LLMs can deliver practical performance gains while maintaining favorable theoretical guarantees, bridging theory and practice for memory management in MoE architectures.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
a variety of tasks. One of the main challenges towards the successful
deployment of LLMs is memory management, since they typically involve billions
of parameters. To this end, architectures based on Mixture-of-Experts have been
proposed, which aim to reduce the size of the parameters that are activated
when producing a token. This raises the equally critical issue of efficiently
managing the limited cache of the system, in that frequently used experts
should be stored in the fast cache rather than in the slower secondary memory.
  In this work, we introduce and study a new paging problem that models expert
management optimization. Our formulation captures both the layered architecture
of LLMs and the requirement that experts are cached efficiently. We first
present lower bounds on the competitive ratio of both deterministic and
randomized algorithms, which show that under mild assumptions, LRU-like
policies have good theoretical competitive performance. We then propose a
layer-based extension of LRU that is tailored to the problem at hand.
  Extensive simulations on both synthetic datasets and actual traces of MoE
usage show that our algorithm outperforms policies for the classic paging
problem, such as the standard LRU.

TL;DR: Proposes a nonlinear mirror-descent preconditioning for meta-learning by learning a distance-generating function via a neural network; achieves convergence and improved sample efficiency, with faster per-task adaptation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Meta-learning aims to transfer task-invariant knowledge to new tasks with limited data. A major challenge is sample-efficient adaptation; preconditioning helps speed up per-task training, but linear preconditioning struggles with complex loss geometries, necessitating a more flexible distance metric.

Method: Introduce a versatile distance-generating function that induces a nonlinear mirror map to capture diverse loss geometries. Parameterize this function with an expressive neural network, ensuring it remains a valid distance. Use it within a preconditioning framework for meta-learning and provide convergence analysis for this and other preconditioning-based meta-learning approaches.

Result: Analytical results show convergence of the proposed method and all preconditioning-based meta-learning methods (i.e., they converge). With gradient-norm target ε, the convergence rate is O(ε^{-2}), on par with standard gradient-based meta-learning. Empirical results on few-shot learning benchmarks demonstrate superior performance and rapid per-task convergence, reducing the number of adaptation steps and enabling scalability to large meta-learning models.

Conclusion: A neural-network-based distance generator for preconditioning in meta-learning yields both theoretical guarantees and practical benefits, improving sample efficiency and rapid adaptation without sacrificing convergence rate, and scales to large models.

Abstract: Utilizing task-invariant knowledge acquired from related tasks as prior
information, meta-learning offers a principled approach to learning a new task
with limited data records. Sample-efficient adaptation of this prior
information is a major challenge facing meta-learning, and plays an important
role because it facilitates training the sought task-specific model with just a
few optimization steps. Past works deal with this challenge through
preconditioning that speeds up convergence of the per-task training. Though
effective in representing locally quadratic loss curvatures, simple linear
preconditioning can be hardly potent with complex loss geometries. Instead of
relying on a quadratic distance metric, the present contribution copes with
complex loss metrics by learning a versatile distance-generating function,
which induces a nonlinear mirror map to effectively capture and optimize a wide
range of loss geometries. With suitable parameterization, this generating
function is effected by an expressive neural network that is provably a valid
distance. Analytical results establish convergence of not only the proposed
method, but also all meta-learning approaches based on preconditioning. To
attain gradient norm less than $\epsilon$, the convergence rate of
$\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-2})$ is on par with standard gradient-based
meta-learning methods. Numerical tests on few-shot learning datasets
demonstrate the superior empirical performance of the novel algorithm, as well
as its rapid per-task convergence, which markedly reduces the number of
adaptation steps, hence also accommodating large-scale meta-learning models.

*Bingcong Li,Yilang Zhang,Georgios B. Giannakis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Stabilize SAM adversaries with VASSO to improve generalization while maintaining computation efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAM improves generalization by considering sharpness of the loss landscape, but adversaries can be too 'friendly', limiting generalization. The work proposes stabilizing adversaries via variance suppression (VASSO).

Method: Introduce VASSO as a general strategy to provably stabilize adversaries and apply it on top of SAM, including a computationally efficient SAM variant.

Result: Empirical validation on extensive vision and language tasks shows improved generalization and a favorable generalization-computation tradeoff.

Conclusion: VASSO provides a general stabilization mechanism for adversaries; when integrated with SAM, it yields better generalization with controlled compute.

Abstract: Sharpness-aware minimization (SAM) has well-documented merits in enhancing
generalization of deep neural network models. Accounting for sharpness in the
loss function geometry, where neighborhoods of `flat minima' heighten
generalization ability, SAM seeks `flat valleys' by minimizing the maximum loss
provoked by an adversarial perturbation within the neighborhood. Although
critical to account for sharpness of the loss function, in practice SAM suffers
from `over-friendly adversaries,' which can curtail the outmost level of
generalization. To avoid such `friendliness,' the present contribution fosters
stabilization of adversaries through variance suppression (VASSO). VASSO offers
a general approach to provably stabilize adversaries. In particular, when
integrating VASSO with SAM, improved generalizability is numerically validated
on extensive vision and language tasks. Once applied on top of a
computationally efficient SAM variant, VASSO offers a desirable
generalization-computation tradeoff.

TL;DR: Decision Transformer (DT) framed return-conditioned learning for notification policy, outperforming offline RL (CQL) in real-world deployment by improving relevance and user engagement with reduced fatigue; +0.72% more sessions at LinkedIn.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address complex, sequential decision-making for notifications under constraints (utility, user fatigue) and overcome practical issues of offline RL methods like CQL (instability, distribution shifts, reproducibility, explainability) in high-dimensional, real-world settings.

Method: A DT-based framework that treats policy learning as return-conditioned supervised learning, with a multi-reward design for non-episodic tasks, a quantile regression approach for return-to-go conditioning, and production-ready, circular buffer-based sequence processing for near-real-time inference.

Result: Offline and online experiments in a deployed notification system show improved notification utility and overall session activity while minimizing user fatigue; +0.72% increase in sessions compared to a multi-objective CQL-based agent at LinkedIn.

Conclusion: DT-based policy learning offers robustness, scalability, and modeling flexibility for notification optimization in real-world settings, addressing key challenges of offline RL in high-dimensional pipelines and delivering tangible engagement gains.

Abstract: Notifications are an important communication channel for delivering timely
and relevant information. Optimizing their delivery involves addressing complex
sequential decision-making challenges under constraints such as message utility
and user fatigue. Offline reinforcement learning (RL) methods, such as
Conservative Q-Learning (CQL), have been applied to this problem but face
practical challenges at scale, including instability, sensitivity to
distribution shifts, limited reproducibility, and difficulties with
explainability in high-dimensional recommendation settings. We present a
Decision Transformer (DT) based framework that reframes policy learning as
return-conditioned supervised learning, improving robustness, scalability, and
modeling flexibility. Our contributions include a real-world comparison with
CQL, a multi-reward design suitable for non-episodic tasks, a quantile
regression approach to return-to-go conditioning, and a production-ready system
with circular buffer-based sequence processing for near-real-time inference.
Extensive offline and online experiments in a deployed notification system show
that our approach improves notification utility and overall session activity
while minimizing user fatigue. Compared to a multi-objective CQL-based agent,
the DT-based approach achieved a +0.72% increase in sessions for notification
decision-making at LinkedIn by making notification recommendation more
relevant.

### [582] [Exploring Variational Graph Autoencoders for Distribution Grid Data Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02469)
*Syed Zain Abbas,Ehimare Okoyomon*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: VGAEs can generate synthetic distribution grids, with dataset-dependent fidelity; simple decoders underperform, while GCN-based decoders do well on ENGAGE but falter on DINGO, highlighting the need for more expressive models and robust evaluation; code and analyses are released for benchmarking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Public power-system data for ML research is scarce. Synthetic grid generation via variational graph autoencoders (VGAEs) on open datasets (ENGAGE and DINGO) is explored to assess realism of generated networks using structural and spectral metrics.

Method: Train and evaluate four decoder variants of VGAEs on two open datasets (ENGAGE and DINGO), comparing generated grids to the originals using structural and spectral metrics to assess topology fidelity and identify artifacts.

Result: Simple decoders fail to capture realistic topologies. GCN-based decoders achieve strong fidelity on ENGAGE but perform poorly on the more complex DINGO, producing artifacts like disconnected components and repeated motifs.

Conclusion: VGAEs show promise for grid synthesis but have limitations; more expressive generative models and robust evaluation are needed. The authors provide open-source models and analyses to support benchmarking.

Abstract: To address the lack of public power system data for machine learning research
in energy networks, we investigate the use of variational graph autoencoders
(VGAEs) for synthetic distribution grid generation. Using two open-source
datasets, ENGAGE and DINGO, we evaluate four decoder variants and compare
generated networks against the original grids using structural and spectral
metrics. Results indicate that simple decoders fail to capture realistic
topologies, while GCN-based approaches achieve strong fidelity on ENGAGE but
struggle on the more complex DINGO dataset, producing artifacts such as
disconnected components and repeated motifs. These findings highlight both the
promise and limitations of VGAEs for grid synthesis, underscoring the need for
more expressive generative models and robust evaluation. We release our models
and analysis as open source to support benchmarking and accelerate progress in
ML-driven power system research.

### [583] [SimpleTIR: End-to-End Reinforcement Learning for Multi-Turn Tool-Integrated Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02479)
*Zhenghai Xue,Longtao Zheng,Qian Liu,Yingru Li,Xiaosen Zheng,Zejun Ma,Bo An*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SimpleTIR stabilizes multi-turn Tool-Integrated Reasoning by filtering out void turns, preventing distribution drift and large gradients in RL training; it delivers state-of-the-art math reasoning (AIME24) from a Qwen2.5-7B base (22.1 → 50.5) without supervised fine-tuning, and promotes diverse reasoning like self-correction and cross-validation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-turn Tool-Integrated Reasoning (TIR) with reinforcement learning suffers training instability due to distributional drift caused by external tool feedback, which produces low-probability tokens and escalating gradients.

Method: A plug-and-play approach that detects and removes trajectories with void turns (turns that produce neither a code block nor a final answer) from policy updates, thereby blocking harmful high-magnitude gradients and stabilizing learning dynamics without requiring supervised fine-tuning.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging math reasoning benchmarks, notably raising AIME24 score from a text-only baseline of 22.1 to 50.5 when starting from the Qwen2.5-7B base model.

Conclusion: SimpleTIR effectively stabilizes multi-turn TIR RL training by filtering problematic trajectories, enabling diverse and sophisticated reasoning patterns (e.g., self-correction, cross-validation) without supervised fine-tuning.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can significantly improve their reasoning
capabilities by interacting with external tools, a paradigm known as
Tool-Integrated Reasoning (TIR). However, extending TIR to multi-turn scenarios
using Reinforcement Learning (RL) is often hindered by training instability and
performance collapse. We identify that such instability is primarily caused by
a distributional drift from external tool feedback, leading to the generation
of low-probability tokens. This issue compounds over successive turns, causing
catastrophic gradient norm explosions that derail the training process. To
address this challenge, we introduce SimpleTIR , a plug-and-play algorithm that
stabilizes multi-turn TIR training. Its core strategy is to identify and filter
out trajectories containing void turns, i.e., turns that yield neither a code
block nor a final answer. By removing these problematic trajectories from the
policy update, SimpleTIR effectively blocks the harmful, high-magnitude
gradients, thus stabilizing the learning dynamics. Extensive experiments show
that SimpleTIR achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging math
reasoning benchmarks, notably elevating the AIME24 score from a text-only
baseline of 22.1 to 50.5 when starting from the Qwen2.5-7B base model.
Furthermore, by avoiding the constraints of supervised fine-tuning, SimpleTIR
encourages the model to discover diverse and sophisticated reasoning patterns,
such as self-correction and cross-validation.

### [584] [HydroGAT: Distributed Heterogeneous Graph Attention Transformer for Spatiotemporal Flood Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02481)
*Aishwarya Sarkar,Autrin Hakimi,Xiaoqiong Chen,Hai Huang,Chaoqun Lu,Ibrahim Demir,Ali Jannesari*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HydroGAT delivers accurate, scalable spatiotemporal flood forecasting by modeling a heterogeneous basin graph; it yields high NSE/KGE, low bias, and interpretable attention maps, with a distributed training pipeline enabling high-resolution basin-scale learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate flood forecasting requires capturing local temporal drivers and river network topology. Traditional CNNs/RNNs ignore topology; GNNs trained on fine graphs scale poorly; existing methods separate spatial and temporal modeling, limiting performance. A unified, scalable approach is needed.

Method: Construct a heterogeneous basin graph with land and river pixels as nodes connected by hydrological flow directions and inter-catchment links. Propose HydroGAT, a spatiotemporal network that adaptively weighs local temporal importance and upstream influence using attention on the graph. Evaluate on two Midwestern basins against five baselines; implement a distributed data-parallel pipeline on 64 GPUs; provide interpretable attention maps.

Result: Achieves higher predictive accuracy (NSE up to 0.97, KGE up to 0.96) and low bias (PBIAS within ±5%) for hourly discharge predictions; attention maps reveal sparse, structured inter-catchment influences; demonstrates near-linear scaling with GPUs (up to 15x speedup) on 64 GPUs; code available.

Conclusion: HydroGAT successfully fuses topological and temporal information for flood forecasting, delivering accurate, scalable, and interpretable predictions; the distributed training pipeline enables high-resolution basin-scale applications and reproducibility.

Abstract: Accurate flood forecasting remains a challenge for water-resource management,
as it demands modeling of local, time-varying runoff drivers (e.g.,
rainfall-induced peaks, baseflow trends) and complex spatial interactions
across a river network. Traditional data-driven approaches, such as
convolutional networks and sequence-based models, ignore topological
information about the region. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) propagate
information exactly along the river network, which is ideal for learning
hydrological routing. However, state-of-the-art GNN-based flood prediction
models collapse pixels to coarse catchment polygons as the cost of training
explodes with graph size and higher resolution. Furthermore, most existing
methods treat spatial and temporal dependencies separately, either applying
GNNs solely on spatial graphs or transformers purely on temporal sequences,
thus failing to simultaneously capture spatiotemporal interactions critical for
accurate flood prediction. We introduce a heterogenous basin graph where every
land and river pixel is a node connected by physical hydrological flow
directions and inter-catchment relationships. We propose HydroGAT, a
spatiotemporal network that adaptively learns local temporal importance and the
most influential upstream locations. Evaluated in two Midwestern US basins and
across five baseline architectures, our model achieves higher NSE (up to 0.97),
improved KGE (up to 0.96), and low bias (PBIAS within $\pm$5%) in hourly
discharge prediction, while offering interpretable attention maps that reveal
sparse, structured intercatchment influences. To support high-resolution
basin-scale training, we develop a distributed data-parallel pipeline that
scales efficiently up to 64 NVIDIA A100 GPUs on NERSC Perlmutter supercomputer,
demonstrating up to 15x speedup across machines. Our code is available at

*Charles Pert,Dalal Alrajeh,Alessandra Russo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Trains RNNs to imitate Büchi automata behavior for omega-regular languages derived from LTL; demonstrates strong generalization to sequences up to 8× longer than training data, with 92.6% tasks perfect or near-perfect, suggesting neural approaches can complement neurosymbolic verification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Büchi automata are fundamental for recognizing omega-regular languages from LTL specifications but do not scale well. Investigating whether neural networks can generalize to omega-regular tasks could offer scalable, neurosymbolic verification approaches.

Method: Train recurrent neural networks on ultimately periodic omega-word sequences to replicate target Büchi automata behavior. Evaluate generalization on out-of-distribution sequences derived from LTL formulas corresponding to deterministic automata of varying structural complexity (3 to >100 states). Assess accuracy on sequences up to 8× longer than training data.

Result: RNNs achieve high accuracy on their target omega-regular languages when evaluated on sequences up to eight times longer than training; 92.6% of tasks achieve perfect or near-perfect generalization.

Conclusion: This study demonstrates the feasibility of learning complex omega-regular languages with neural models and supports their role as components in neurosymbolic verification methods, enabling scalable handling of omega-regular properties.

Abstract: B\"uchi automata (BAs) recognize $\omega$-regular languages defined by formal
specifications like linear temporal logic (LTL) and are commonly used in the
verification of reactive systems. However, BAs face scalability challenges when
handling and manipulating complex system behaviors. As neural networks are
increasingly used to address these scalability challenges in areas like model
checking, investigating their ability to generalize beyond training data
becomes necessary. This work presents the first study investigating whether
recurrent neural networks (RNNs) can generalize to $\omega$-regular languages
derived from LTL formulas. We train RNNs on ultimately periodic $\omega$-word
sequences to replicate target BA behavior and evaluate how well they generalize
to out-of-distribution sequences. Through experiments on LTL formulas
corresponding to deterministic automata of varying structural complexity, from
3 to over 100 states, we show that RNNs achieve high accuracy on their target
$\omega$-regular languages when evaluated on sequences up to $8 \times$ longer
than training examples, with $92.6\%$ of tasks achieving perfect or
near-perfect generalization. These results establish the feasibility of neural
approaches for learning complex $\omega$-regular languages, suggesting their
potential as components in neurosymbolic verification methods.

### [586] [MoPEQ: Mixture of Mixed Precision Quantized Experts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02512)
*Krishna Teja Chitty-Venkata,Jie Ye,Murali Emani*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes MoPEQ, a post-training quantization method for mixture-of-experts (MoE) in vision-language models that assigns per-expert bitwidths (2–4 bits) using Hessian trace sensitivity rather than activation frequency, to achieve memory reductions with competitive accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MoEs in large LLMs/VLMs have high compute and memory demands, and uniform-precision quantization wastes capacity. A per-expert, sensitivity-aware quantization could significantly reduce memory while preserving performance. Hessian-based sensitivity may better reflect importance than activation frequency.

Method: Post-Training Quantization (MoPEQ) assigns optimal bit widths to each expert by estimating sensitivity via Hessian trace approximation. Experts are clustered to maintain performance while reducing memory. Evaluates layer-wise and model-wide precision allocations (2,3,4 bits) on VLMEvalKit datasets using state-of-the-art VLMs Deepseek-VL2 (tiny, small, base) and MolmoE models, comparing against uniform-precision baselines.

Result: MoPEQ achieves competitive accuracy with substantial memory-footprint reductions compared with uniform precision baselines. The study analyzes the impact of expert activation frequency vs Hessian-based sensitivity at both layer-wise and model-wide levels across 2, 3, and 4-bit allocations, demonstrating robustness of per-expert mixed precision quantization for VLM MoEs.

Conclusion: Per-expert Hessian-based sensitivity, combined with clustering, enables effective mixed-precision quantization for MoEs in VLMs, yielding meaningful memory savings with minimal loss of accuracy across diverse models and bitwidth settings.

Abstract: Large Language and Vision Models using a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)
architecture pose significant challenges for deployment due to their
computational and memory demands. Mixed Precision Quantization assigns
different precisions to different layers of an LLM/VLM based on layer
sensitivity and importance within the model. In this work, we propose a Post
Training Quantization algorithm, MoPEQ, that assigns optimal bit width to each
expert. Our method balances accuracy and model size by analyzing each expert's
sensitivity using Hessian trace approximation instead of relying on the
activation frequency of the expert. This per-expert granularity approach
clusters similar experts to maintain model performance while reducing memory
requirements. The experimental results on VLMEvalKit benchmark datasets using
State-of-the-art VLMs Deepseek-VL2 -tiny, -small, -base, and MolmoE models
demonstrate that our mixed precision quantized MoEs achieve competitive
accuracy with substantial improvements in memory footprint compared to
uniform-precision baseline methods. We perform a comprehensive study to analyze
the impact of expert activation frequency and sensitivity using Hessian trace
approximation at both layer-wise and model-wide expert precision allocation of
2, 3, and 4 bits to provide a thorough understanding of mixed precision
quantization of VLM-MoEs.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a variational-inequality (VI) approach based on Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equations to fine-tune diffusion processes. Shows sharp statistical rates for learned value functions and policies with function-class complexity, and argues that fine-tuning can be achieved via supervised regression rather than generic RL.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To achieve sample-efficient, theoretically grounded fine-tuning of diffusion processes by exploiting HJB structure, avoiding the inefficiency of general RL, and obtaining sharp rates that depend on function-class complexity and approximation error.

Method: Develop a new class of algorithms that solve a variational inequality derived from the HJB equations using general value function approximation. The analysis yields explicit statistical rates for both the value function and the control policy, in terms of the complexity and approximation error of the function class.

Result: The approach yields sharp, problem-dependent statistical rates for learned value functions and policies. It demonstrates that fine-tuning can be effectively performed via supervised regression with faster rates compared to generic RL settings.

Conclusion: Framing diffusion process fine-tuning as a VI problem grounded in HJB theory enables sample-efficient learning, bridging optimal control and RL, and providing concrete rate guarantees that depend on function-class complexity and approximation error.

Abstract: We study the problem of learning the optimal control policy for fine-tuning a
given diffusion process, using general value function approximation. We develop
a new class of algorithms by solving a variational inequality problem based on
the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equations. We prove sharp statistical rates
for the learned value function and control policy, depending on the complexity
and approximation errors of the function class. In contrast to generic
reinforcement learning problems, our approach shows that fine-tuning can be
achieved via supervised regression, with faster statistical rate guarantees.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Federated learning faces high communication costs. Over-the-air transmission can reduce this cost, but introduces channel noise and hardware constraints. There is a need for algorithms that adapt to stochastic gradient noise while being implementable on physical channels.

Method: Introduce a new class of adaptive federated SGD algorithms designed for operation over physical channels, explicitly accounting for channel noise and hardware constraints; provide theoretical convergence guarantees.

Result: Theoretical convergence rates that are adaptive to the stochastic gradient noise level; empirical validation via simulations on deep learning models showing practical effectiveness.

Conclusion: Adaptive over-the-air federated SGD is feasible and effective under realistic channel conditions, offering reduced communication costs without sacrificing convergence reliability.

Abstract: In federated learning, communication cost can be significantly reduced by
transmitting the information over the air through physical channels. In this
paper, we propose a new class of adaptive federated stochastic gradient descent
(SGD) algorithms that can be implemented over physical channels, taking into
account both channel noise and hardware constraints. We establish theoretical
guarantees for the proposed algorithms, demonstrating convergence rates that
are adaptive to the stochastic gradient noise level. We also demonstrate the
practical effectiveness of our algorithms through simulation studies with deep
learning models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Surrogate benchmarks are proposed to enable low-cost hyperparameter optimization for model merging by building data-driven surrogate models over two search spaces to predict merging performance and simulate optimization dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hyperparameter tuning in model merging is computationally expensive, especially for large language models. There is a need for fast, comparable benchmarking and algorithm development tools.

Method: Define two search spaces for merging hyperparameters, collect data samples, and fit surrogate models that predict merged-model performance from hyperparameters. Use these surrogates to evaluate and simulate optimization algorithms.

Result: The surrogate benchmarks accurately predict the performance of merged models and can emulate the behavior of optimization algorithms at a much lower cost.

Conclusion: Surrogate benchmarks are effective for accelerating research in hyperparameter optimization for model merging, enabling rapid development, comparison, and fair benchmarking of optimization methods.

Abstract: Model merging techniques aim to integrate the abilities of multiple models
into a single model. Most model merging techniques have hyperparameters, and
their setting affects the performance of the merged model. Because several
existing works show that tuning hyperparameters in model merging can enhance
the merging outcome, developing hyperparameter optimization algorithms for
model merging is a promising direction. However, its optimization process is
computationally expensive, particularly in merging LLMs. In this work, we
develop surrogate benchmarks for optimization of the merging hyperparameters to
realize algorithm development and performance comparison at low cost. We define
two search spaces and collect data samples to construct surrogate models to
predict the performance of a merged model from a hyperparameter. We demonstrate
that our benchmarks can predict the performance of merged models well and
simulate optimization algorithm behaviors.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Dynamic guardian models evaluate text against user-defined policies, enabling domain-specific moderation beyond static harm categories. They can provide fast policy-violation detection and optional chain-of-thought reasoning, matching static guards on static harms and approaching frontier reasoning models for free-form policies with lower latency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the rigidity of static guardrails by introducing adaptable guardians that can enforce diverse, user-specified policies across different application domains.

Method: Introduce dynamic guardian models that score content based on user-defined policies. They can operate in fast detection mode or with chain-of-thought reasoning to justify outputs. Comparative evaluation shows parity with static models on static harms and comparable accuracy to advanced reasoning models on free-form policies, with reduced computation time.

Result: Dynamic guardians achieve similar accuracy to static guardians for predefined harms and exhibit accuracy close to frontier reasoning models when detecting violations of free-form policies, all while operating faster than full-fledged reasoning systems.

Conclusion: Dynamic, policy-driven guardian models offer flexible, domain-adaptive moderation that preserves accuracy for known harms and provides efficient handling of custom policies, with the option to generate justificatory reasoning.

Abstract: Guardian models are used to supervise and moderate the outputs of user-facing
chatbots, enforcing guardrails and detecting bad behaviors. Standard guardian
models like LlamaGuard detect predefined, static categories of harms. We
propose dynamic guardian models that evaluate text based on user-defined
policies, making them useful for different application domains that are not
addressed by standard guardian models. Our dynamic guardian models can be used
for fast detection of policy violations or with chain-of-thought reasoning that
articulates and justifies the model outputs. Our dynamic guardian models match
static models in detection accuracy for static harm categories while
identifying violations of free-form policies with accuracy comparable to
frontier reasoning models in a fraction of the time.

*Eric J. Michaud,Liv Gorton,Tom McGrath*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SAEs exhibit multiple scaling regimes when allocated capacity, analyzed via a capacity-allocation model; notably, feature manifolds can cause pathological underutilization of latents, with preliminary questions about its occurrence in practice.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understand how SAE performance and latent-feature utilization scale with model capacity and data structure, leveraging a capacity-allocation framework from the neural scaling literature to account for multi-dimensional feature manifolds.

Method: Adapt a capacity-allocation model to SAEs to derive scaling regimes and examine the influence of feature manifolds on the number of learned latent features.

Result: The model reveals distinct scaling regimes; in one regime, feature manifolds have a pathological effect, driving SAEs to learn far fewer features than available latents; preliminary discussion on whether this regime occurs in real data.

Conclusion: SAE scaling behavior is regime-dependent, with a potential pathological regime driven by feature manifolds; further empirical validation is needed to assess practical relevance and to guide SAE design.

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) model the activations of a neural network as
linear combinations of sparsely occurring directions of variation (latents).
The ability of SAEs to reconstruct activations follows scaling laws w.r.t. the
number of latents. In this work, we adapt a capacity-allocation model from the
neural scaling literature (Brill, 2024) to understand SAE scaling, and in
particular, to understand how "feature manifolds" (multi-dimensional features)
influence scaling behavior. Consistent with prior work, the model recovers
distinct scaling regimes. Notably, in one regime, feature manifolds have the
pathological effect of causing SAEs to learn far fewer features in data than
there are latents in the SAE. We provide some preliminary discussion on whether
or not SAEs are in this pathological regime in the wild.
