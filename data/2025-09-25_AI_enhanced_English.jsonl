We present Human-Like Inverse Kinematics\n(HL-IK), a lightweight IK framework that preserves EE tracking while shaping\nwhole-arm configurations to appear human-like, without full-body sensing at\nruntime. The key idea is a learned elbow prior: using large-scale human motion\ndata retargeted to the robot, we train a FiLM-modulated spatio-temporal\nattention network (FiSTA) to predict the next-step elbow pose from the EE\ntarget and a short history of EE-elbow states.This prediction is incorporated\nas a small residual alongside EE and smoothness terms in a standard\nLevenberg-Marquardt optimizer, making HL-IK a drop-in addition to numerical IK\nstacks. Over 183k simulation steps, HL-IK reduces arm-similarity position and\ndirection error by 30.6% and 35.4% on average, and by 42.2% and 47.4% on the\nmost challenging trajectories. Hardware teleoperation on a robot distinct from\nsimulation further confirms the gains in anthropomorphism. HL-IK is simple to\nintegrate, adaptable across platforms via our pipeline, and adds minimal\ncomputation, enabling human-like motions for humanoid robots.
