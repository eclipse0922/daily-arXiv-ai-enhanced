Finally, we find many\ninteresting properties of test-time RL for VLMs: for example, even in extremely\ndata-constrained scenarios, where adaptation is performed on a single randomly\nchosen unlabeled test example, TTRV still yields non-trivial improvements of up\nto 5.5% in recognition tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "A test-time reinforcement learning method (TTRV) for vision-language models that adapts at inference without labeled data, using GRPO-based rewards tied to the base model's outputs and entropy control.
