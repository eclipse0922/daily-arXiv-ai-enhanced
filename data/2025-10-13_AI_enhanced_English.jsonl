Recently, Data-enabled Predictive\nControl (DeePC) has emerged as a promising model-free approach that bypasses\nexplicit system identification by directly leveraging input-output data. While\nDeePC has shown success in other domains, its application to soft robots\nremains underexplored, particularly for three-dimensional (3D) soft robotic\nsystems. This paper addresses this gap by developing and experimentally\nvalidating an effective DeePC framework on a 3D, cable-driven soft arm.\nSpecifically, we design and fabricate a soft robotic arm with a thick tubing\nbackbone for stability, a dense silicone body with large cavities for strength\nand flexibility, and rigid endcaps for secure termination. Using this platform,\nwe implement DeePC with singular value decomposition (SVD)-based dimension\nreduction for two key control tasks: fixed-point regulation and trajectory\ntracking in 3D space.

Given a private distribution $P \\in \\mathcal{P}$, the goal is to\ngenerate a single sample from a distribution that remains close to $P$ in\n$f$-divergence while satisfying the constraints of LDP. This task captures the\nfundamental challenge of producing realistic-looking data under strong privacy\nguarantees. While prior work by Park et al. (NeurIPS'24) focuses on global\nminimax-optimality across a class of distributions, we take a local\nperspective. Specifically, we examine the minimax risk in a neighborhood around\na fixed distribution $P_0$, and characterize its exact value, which depends on\nboth $P_0$ and the privacy level. Our main result shows that the local minimax\nrisk is determined by the global minimax risk when the distribution class\n$\\mathcal{P}$ is restricted to a neighborhood around $P_0$. To establish this,\nwe (1) extend previous work from pure LDP to the more general functional LDP\nframework, and (2) prove that the globally optimal functional LDP sampler\nyields the optimal local sampler when constrained to distributions near $P_0$.\nBuilding on this, we also derive a simple closed-form expression for the\nlocally minimax-optimal samplers which does not depend on the choice of\n$f$-divergence. We further argue that this local framework naturally models\nprivate sampling with public data, where the public data distribution is\nrepresented by $P_0$.
