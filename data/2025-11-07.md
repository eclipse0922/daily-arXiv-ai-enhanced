### [1] [LoRA-Edge: Tensor-Train-Assisted LoRA for Practical CNN Fine-Tuning on Edge Devices](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03765)
*Hyunseok Kwak,Kyeongwon Lee,Jae-Jin Lee,Woojoo Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LoRA-Edge is a tensor-train–assisted, parameter-efficient fine-tuning method for on-device CNNs in HAR that preserves inference cost while achieving near-full fine-tuning accuracy with ~1.5% of parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Domain shift in edge HAR requires adapting models on-device, but full fine-tuning is infeasible under tight memory, compute, and energy budgets; a structure-preserving, parameter-efficient approach is needed.

Method: Apply Tensor-Train SVD (TT-SVD) to pre-trained conv layers, selectively update only the output-side TT core with zero-initialization to keep the auxiliary path inactive at start, then fuse updates back into dense kernels to keep inference cost unchanged.

Result: Achieves accuracy within 4.7% of full fine-tuning while updating at most 1.49% of parameters; consistently outperforms previous PEFT baselines under similar budgets; on Jetson Orin Nano, TT-SVD initialization and selective-core training yield 1.4–3.8× faster convergence to target F1.

Conclusion: Structure-aligned, parameter-efficient on-device CNN adaptation is practical for edge platforms.

Abstract: On-device fine-tuning of CNNs is essential to withstand domain shift in edge
applications such as Human Activity Recognition (HAR), yet full fine-tuning is
infeasible under strict memory, compute, and energy budgets. We present
LoRA-Edge, a parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) method that builds on
Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) with tensor-train assistance. LoRA-Edge (i) applies
Tensor-Train Singular Value Decomposition (TT-SVD) to pre-trained convolutional
layers, (ii) selectively updates only the output-side core with
zero-initialization to keep the auxiliary path inactive at the start, and (iii)
fuses the update back into dense kernels, leaving inference cost unchanged.
This design preserves convolutional structure and reduces the number of
trainable parameters by up to two orders of magnitude compared to full
fine-tuning. Across diverse HAR datasets and CNN backbones, LoRA-Edge achieves
accuracy within 4.7% of full fine-tuning while updating at most 1.49% of
parameters, consistently outperforming prior parameter-efficient baselines
under similar budgets. On a Jetson Orin Nano, TT-SVD initialization and
selective-core training yield 1.4-3.8x faster convergence to target F1.
LoRA-Edge thus makes structure-aligned, parameter-efficient on-device CNN
adaptation practical for edge platforms.

### [2] [SILVI: Simple Interface for Labeling Video Interactions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03819)
*Ozan Kanbertay,Richard Vogg,Elif Karakoc,Peter M. Kappeler,Claudia Fichtel,Alexander S. Ecker*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SILVI is an open-source labeling tool that integrates annotation of behaviors with localization of individuals to capture interactions in video data, filling a gap between labeling-only and localization-only tools, and enabling structured outputs for CV models; it can also be used for human interactions requiring dynamic scene graphs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a gap: existing tools either label without localization or localize without capturing interactions; studying social/individualized animal behavior requires simultaneous labeling of actions and interactions; bridging behavioral ecology with computer vision.

Method: Developed SILVI, an open-source labeling software that supports both behavioral labeling and localization, enabling annotation of behaviors and interactions directly in video, generating structured outputs for CV training/validation; designed to connect ecological analysis with CV and facilitate future automated methods.

Result: SILVI exists with documentation and download; enables annotated datasets with both behavior and interaction labels; produces outputs suitable for training CV models; opens possibilities beyond animals.

Conclusion: SILVI is a versatile tool for annotating interactions in video data, potentially extending to human interactions and dynamic scene graphs; it lowers the barrier to creating rich datasets combining behavior and spatial relations, fostering advancements in automated fine-grained behavioral analysis.

Abstract: Computer vision methods are increasingly used for the automated analysis of
large volumes of video data collected through camera traps, drones, or direct
observations of animals in the wild. While recent advances have focused
primarily on detecting individual actions, much less work has addressed the
detection and annotation of interactions -- a crucial aspect for understanding
social and individualized animal behavior. Existing open-source annotation
tools support either behavioral labeling without localization of individuals,
or localization without the capacity to capture interactions. To bridge this
gap, we present SILVI, an open-source labeling software that integrates both
functionalities. SILVI enables researchers to annotate behaviors and
interactions directly within video data, generating structured outputs suitable
for training and validating computer vision models. By linking behavioral
ecology with computer vision, SILVI facilitates the development of automated
approaches for fine-grained behavioral analyses. Although developed primarily
in the context of animal behavior, SILVI could be useful more broadly to
annotate human interactions in other videos that require extracting dynamic
scene graphs. The software, along with documentation and download instructions,
is available at: https://gitlab.gwdg.de/kanbertay/interaction-labelling-app.

### [3] [Noise Injection: Improving Out-of-Distribution Generalization for Limited Size Datasets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03855)
*Duong Mai,Lawrence Hall*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Noise injection during training using Gaussian, Speckle, Poisson, and Salt & Pepper noise improves prognostic robustness of COVID-19 CXR classifiers, narrowing the ID–OOD performance gap from ~0.10–0.20 to ~0.01–0.06 across metrics; code publicly available.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DL models for chest X-ray COVID-19 detection generalize poorly across new devices/populations due to reliance on source-specific artifacts. The goal is to reduce distribution shift and improve cross-domain robustness.

Method: Train models with fundamental noise injection techniques (Gaussian, Speckle, Poisson, Salt & Pepper) during training. Evaluate on ID and OOD data across ten random seeds, reporting AUC, F1, accuracy, recall, and specificity.

Result: The ID–OOD gap in performance shrinks from about 0.10–0.20 to 0.01–0.06, consistent across key metrics (AUC, F1, accuracy, recall, specificity) when averaging over ten seeds.

Conclusion: Simple noise-injection during training is an effective and scalable approach to enhance cross-domain generalization for medical image classification tasks like COVID-19 detection in CXRs; the authors provide public code.

Abstract: Deep learned (DL) models for image recognition have been shown to fail to
generalize to data from different devices, populations, etc. COVID-19 detection
from Chest X-rays (CXRs), in particular, has been shown to fail to generalize
to out-of-distribution (OOD) data from new clinical sources not covered in the
training set. This occurs because models learn to exploit shortcuts -
source-specific artifacts that do not translate to new distributions - rather
than reasonable biomarkers to maximize performance on in-distribution (ID)
data. Rendering the models more robust to distribution shifts, our study
investigates the use of fundamental noise injection techniques (Gaussian,
Speckle, Poisson, and Salt and Pepper) during training. Our empirical results
demonstrate that this technique can significantly reduce the performance gap
between ID and OOD evaluation from 0.10-0.20 to 0.01-0.06, based on results
averaged over ten random seeds across key metrics such as AUC, F1, accuracy,
recall and specificity. Our source code is publicly available at

### [4] [Investigating Robot Control Policy Learning for Autonomous X-ray-guided Spine Procedures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03882)
*Florence Klitzner,Blanca Inigo,Benjamin D. Killeen,Lalithkumar Seenivasan,Michelle Song,Axel Krieger,Mathias Unberath*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Imitation policy learning for bi-plane X-ray guided cannula insertion in spine procedures, using a realistic in silico sandbox; achieved 68.5% first-attempt success, generalized to fractures; plausible real-X-ray rollouts despite simulation training; limitations include entry-point precision and need for frequent feedback; potential for CT-free spinal navigation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Imitation learning in video-based robotics has renewed interest, but its applicability to X-ray-guided procedures is unclear due to the complexity of interpreting multi-view X-rays. The work investigates opportunities and challenges for imitation policy learning in bi-plane-guided cannula insertion, aiming toward CT-free intra-operative spinal navigation.

Method: Develop a scalable, highly realistic in silico sandbox to simulate X-ray-guided spine procedures. curate a dataset of correct trajectories with corresponding bi-planar X-ray sequences that mimic provider stepwise alignment. Train imitation learning policies for planning and open-loop control to iteratively align a cannula using only visual information, evaluating both simulation rollouts and real X-ray data.

Result: Policy succeeded on the first attempt in 68.5% of cases, maintaining safe intrapedicular trajectories across vertebral levels. Generalized to complex anatomy, including fractures, and remained robust to varied initializations. Rollouts on real bi-planar X-rays produced plausible trajectories despite training exclusively in simulation.

Conclusion: Preliminary results are promising for lightweight, CT-free robotic intra-operative spinal navigation. Limitations include entry-point precision and the need for more frequent feedback for full closed-loop control. With stronger priors and domain knowledge, these models may form a foundation for future CT-free spinal navigation.

Abstract: Imitation learning-based robot control policies are enjoying renewed interest
in video-based robotics. However, it remains unclear whether this approach
applies to X-ray-guided procedures, such as spine instrumentation. This is
because interpretation of multi-view X-rays is complex. We examine
opportunities and challenges for imitation policy learning in bi-plane-guided
cannula insertion. We develop an in silico sandbox for scalable, automated
simulation of X-ray-guided spine procedures with a high degree of realism. We
curate a dataset of correct trajectories and corresponding bi-planar X-ray
sequences that emulate the stepwise alignment of providers. We then train
imitation learning policies for planning and open-loop control that iteratively
align a cannula solely based on visual information. This precisely controlled
setup offers insights into limitations and capabilities of this method. Our
policy succeeded on the first attempt in 68.5% of cases, maintaining safe
intra-pedicular trajectories across diverse vertebral levels. The policy
generalized to complex anatomy, including fractures, and remained robust to
varied initializations. Rollouts on real bi-planar X-rays further suggest that
the model can produce plausible trajectories, despite training exclusively in
simulation. While these preliminary results are promising, we also identify
limitations, especially in entry point precision. Full closed-look control will
require additional considerations around how to provide sufficiently frequent
feedback. With more robust priors and domain knowledge, such models may provide
a foundation for future efforts toward lightweight and CT-free robotic
intra-operative spinal navigation.

### [5] [Desert Waste Detection and Classification Using Data-Based and Model-Based Enhanced YOLOv12 DL Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03888)
*Abdulmumin Sa'ad,Sulaimon Oyeniyi Adebayo,Abdul Jabbar Siddiqui*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A lightweight, real-time waste-detection model for desert environments using a pruned YOLOv12 with Self-Adversarial Training and targeted augmentations, achieving better precision, recall, and mAP on DroneTrashNet while remaining deployment-friendly on drones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the global waste surge and the need for automated, robust waste detection in remote/desert environments, including organic/hazardous waste, where traditional methods are labor-intensive and datasets are skewed toward urban/recyclables.

Method: Develop a pruned, lightweight YOLOv12 backbone optimized for speed and small size, integrate Self-Adversarial Training (SAT) with specialized data augmentation, and evaluate on the DroneTrashNet dataset, benchmarking against other lightweight YOLO variants.

Result: Significant improvements in precision, recall, and mean average precision (mAP); low latency and compact model size enabling deployment on resource-constrained aerial drones; competitive or superior performance compared with state-of-the-art lightweight YOLO models on desert waste detection.

Conclusion: Combining data-centric augmentation and model-centric pruning/SAT yields robust, real-time waste detection in desert environments, offering a practical path to scalable drone-based waste monitoring.

Abstract: The global waste crisis is escalating, with solid waste generation expected
to increase by 70% by 2050. Traditional waste collection methods, particularly
in remote or harsh environments like deserts, are labor-intensive, inefficient,
and often hazardous. Recent advances in computer vision and deep learning have
opened the door to automated waste detection systems, yet most research focuses
on urban environments and recyclable materials, overlooking organic and
hazardous waste and underexplored terrains such as deserts. In this work, we
propose an enhanced real-time object detection framework based on a pruned,
lightweight version of YOLOv12 integrated with Self-Adversarial Training (SAT)
and specialized data augmentation strategies. Using the DroneTrashNet dataset,
we demonstrate significant improvements in precision, recall, and mean average
precision (mAP), while achieving low latency and compact model size suitable
for deployment on resource-constrained aerial drones. Benchmarking our model
against state-of-the-art lightweight YOLO variants further highlights its
optimal balance of accuracy and efficiency. Our results validate the
effectiveness of combining data-centric and model-centric enhancements for
robust, real-time waste detection in desert environments.

### [6] [Improving Diagnostic Performance on Small and Imbalanced Datasets Using Class-Based Input Image Composition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03891)
*Hlali Azzeddine,Majid Ben Yakhlef,Soulaiman El Hazzat*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Class-Based Image Composition creates Composite Input Images by fusing multiple same-class images (CoImg) to boost intra-class variance and information density, improving performance on small/imbalanced datasets; demonstrated on OCTDL with strong gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tackle small, imbalanced datasets and poor input quality that lead to high false predictions in deep learning for medical imaging; improve discriminative power for subtle disease patterns.

Method: Reformat training inputs into 3x1 composite images by fusing multiple same-class OCT scans; create a balanced Co-OCTDL version; train a VGG16 with identical architecture/hyperparameters for fair comparison; evaluate against baseline on original data.

Result: Significant performance gains: near-perfect accuracy 99.6%, F1 0.995, AUC 0.9996; substantially reduced false positives.

Conclusion: CoImg representations can markedly improve deep learning performance on weak datasets by increasing information density and intra-class variance, suggesting robustness to class imbalance and small sample sizes.

Abstract: Small, imbalanced datasets and poor input image quality can lead to high
false predictions rates with deep learning models. This paper introduces
Class-Based Image Composition, an approach that allows us to reformulate
training inputs through a fusion of multiple images of the same class into
combined visual composites, named Composite Input Images (CoImg). That enhances
the intra-class variance and improves the valuable information density per
training sample and increases the ability of the model to distinguish between
subtle disease patterns. Our method was evaluated on the Optical Coherence
Tomography Dataset for Image-Based Deep Learning Methods (OCTDL) (Kulyabin et
al., 2024), which contains 2,064 high-resolution optical coherence tomography
(OCT) scans of the human retina, representing seven distinct diseases with a
significant class imbalance. We constructed a perfectly class-balanced version
of this dataset, named Co-OCTDL, where each scan is resented as a 3x1 layout
composite image. To assess the effectiveness of this new representation, we
conducted a comparative analysis between the original dataset and its variant
using a VGG16 model. A fair comparison was ensured by utilizing the identical
model architecture and hyperparameters for all experiments. The proposed
approach markedly improved diagnostic results.The enhanced Dataset achieved
near-perfect accuracy (99.6%) with F1-score (0.995) and AUC (0.9996), compared
to a baseline model trained on raw dataset. The false prediction rate was also
significantly lower, this demonstrates that the method can producehigh-quality
predictions even for weak datasets affected by class imbalance or small sample
size.

### [7] [I Detect What I Don't Know: Incremental Anomaly Learning with Stochastic Weight Averaging-Gaussian for Oracle-Free Medical Imaging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03912)
*Nand Kumar Yadav,Rodrigue Rizk,William CW Chen,KC Santosh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Unsupervised, incremental normality learning for medical imaging using a frozen backbone with adapters, a coreset of embeddings, and dual gates to safely admit new normal samples, yielding large ROC-AUC gains under label scarcity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tackle unknown anomaly detection in medical imaging where labeled anomalies are scarce and expert supervision is costly by building a safe, unsupervised method that incrementally expands the normal sample set without anomaly labels.

Method: Start from a small set of verified normal images. Freeze a pretrained vision backbone and attach tiny convolutional adapters for domain adaptation. As unlabeled data arrive, update adapters with lightweight training, extract embeddings, and store them in a compact coreset for fast k-NN scoring. Admit new samples into the normal memory only if (a) their distance to the coreset is within a calibrated z-score threshold, and (b) their SWAG-based epistemic uncertainty stays below a seed-calibrated bound. This dual-gate mechanism prevents drift without using generative reconstruction or replay buffers.

Result: Empirically, the approach steadily refines the notion of normality and achieves substantial gains: COVID-CXR ROC-AUC 0.9489→0.9982; Pneumonia CXR ROC-AUC 0.6834→0.8968; Brain MRI ND-5 ROC-AUC 0.6041→0.7269 (PR-AUC 0.7539→0.8211).

Conclusion: The framework provides an efficient, safe, and scalable solution for label-scarce medical imaging anomaly detection by incrementally expanding trusted normals with dual-safety gates, avoiding generative methods, and leveraging lightweight adapters and a coreset-based k-NN score.

Abstract: Unknown anomaly detection in medical imaging remains a fundamental challenge
due to the scarcity of labeled anomalies and the high cost of expert
supervision. We introduce an unsupervised, oracle-free framework that
incrementally expands a trusted set of normal samples without any anomaly
labels. Starting from a small, verified seed of normal images, our method
alternates between lightweight adapter updates and uncertainty-gated sample
admission. A frozen pretrained vision backbone is augmented with tiny
convolutional adapters, ensuring rapid domain adaptation with negligible
computational overhead. Extracted embeddings are stored in a compact coreset
enabling efficient k-nearest neighbor anomaly (k-NN) scoring. Safety during
incremental expansion is enforced by dual probabilistic gates, a sample is
admitted into the normal memory only if its distance to the existing coreset
lies within a calibrated z-score threshold, and its SWAG-based epistemic
uncertainty remains below a seed-calibrated bound. This mechanism prevents
drift and false inclusions without relying on generative reconstruction or
replay buffers. Empirically, our system steadily refines the notion of
normality as unlabeled data arrive, producing substantial gains over baselines.
On COVID-CXR, ROC-AUC improves from 0.9489 to 0.9982 (F1: 0.8048 to 0.9746); on
Pneumonia CXR, ROC-AUC rises from 0.6834 to 0.8968; and on Brain MRI ND-5,
ROC-AUC increases from 0.6041 to 0.7269 and PR-AUC from 0.7539 to 0.8211. These
results highlight the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed framework
for real-world, label-scarce medical imaging applications.

### [8] [Adaptive Temporal Refinement: Continuous Depth Allocation and Distance Regression for Efficient Action Localization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03943)
*Ibne Farabi Shihab,Sanjeda Akter,Anuj Sharma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Two complementary contributions for temporal action localization: Boundary Distance Regression (BDR) for precise boundary regression using signed distance; Adaptive Temporal Refinement (ATR) for dynamic, differentiable compute allocation, yielding better accuracy and efficiency; validated across multiple benchmarks with distillation-assisted training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods use uniform computation across boundaries; boundary difficulty varies, causing inefficiency and suboptimal boundaries.

Method: BDR replaces classification with signed-distance regression to produce precise boundary localization; minimal code retrofit. ATR uses continuous depth selection tau in [0,1], differentiable, enabling end-to-end optimization without RL.

Result: BDR yields 43% sharper boundary peaks and 1.8-3.1% mAP@0.7 improvements across architectures. ATR achieves 56.5% mAP@0.7 at 162G FLOPs vs 53.6% at 198G for uniform processing (18% less compute), with 2.9% absolute mAP gain and 4.2% for short actions. Knowledge distillation allows lightweight students to reach 99% of baseline performance. Validated on four benchmarks with statistical testing.

Conclusion: Boundary-aware localization and adaptive computation improve accuracy and efficiency in temporal action localization; results robust across benchmarks; training cost can be mitigated via distillation.

Abstract: Temporal action localization requires precise boundary detection; however,
current methods apply uniform computation despite significant variations in
difficulty across boundaries. We present two complementary contributions.
First, Boundary Distance Regression (BDR) provides information-theoretically
optimal localization through signed-distance regression rather than
classification, achieving 43\% sharper boundary peaks. BDR retrofits to
existing methods with approximately 50 lines of code, yielding consistent 1.8
to 3.1\% mAP@0.7 improvements across diverse architectures. Second, Adaptive
Temporal Refinement (ATR) allocates computation via continuous depth selection
$\tau \in [0,1]$, enabling end-to-end differentiable optimization without
reinforcement learning. On THUMOS14, ATR achieves 56.5\% mAP@0.7 at 162G FLOPs,
compared to 53.6\% at 198G for uniform processing, providing a 2.9\%
improvement with 18\% less compute. Gains scale with boundary heterogeneity,
showing 4.2\% improvement on short actions. Training cost is mitigated via
knowledge distillation, with lightweight students retaining 99\% performance at
baseline cost. Results are validated across four benchmarks with rigorous
statistical testing.

### [9] [Improving Multi-View Reconstruction via Texture-Guided Gaussian-Mesh Joint Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03950)
*Zhejia Cai,Puhua Jiang,Shiwei Mao,Hongkun Cao,Ruqi Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Unified Gaussian-guided mesh optimization that jointly updates mesh geometry and vertex colors to achieve photometric-consistent, regularized 3D reconstructions from multi-view images, enabling downstream editing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current pipelines often decouple geometry and appearance (MV-S, NVS), which hinders downstream editing; a unified geometry-appearance optimization can improve fidelity and editability.

Method: Gaussian-guided differentiable rendering enabling simultaneous optimization of mesh geometry (vertex positions and faces) and vertex colors, guided by photometric consistency from input images and geometric regularization from normal/depth maps.

Result: Produces high-quality 3D reconstructions suitable for downstream editing tasks like relighting and shape deformation; code will be publicly available upon acceptance.

Conclusion: A unified treatment of geometry and appearance enhances reconstruction quality and downstream editability, enabling seamless editing workflows.

Abstract: Reconstructing real-world objects from multi-view images is essential for
applications in 3D editing, AR/VR, and digital content creation. Existing
methods typically prioritize either geometric accuracy (Multi-View Stereo) or
photorealistic rendering (Novel View Synthesis), often decoupling geometry and
appearance optimization, which hinders downstream editing tasks. This paper
advocates an unified treatment on geometry and appearance optimization for
seamless Gaussian-mesh joint optimization. More specifically, we propose a
novel framework that simultaneously optimizes mesh geometry (vertex positions
and faces) and vertex colors via Gaussian-guided mesh differentiable rendering,
leveraging photometric consistency from input images and geometric
regularization from normal and depth maps. The obtained high-quality 3D
reconstruction can be further exploit in down-stream editing tasks, such as
relighting and shape deformation. The code will be publicly available upon
acceptance.

### [10] [A Linear Fractional Transformation Model and Calibration Method for Light Field Camera](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03962)
*Zhong Chen,Changfeng Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes an LFT-based calibration method for light-field cameras to decouple main lens and MLA, using a LS analytical solution and nonlinear refinement, plus feature detection; faster simulation and code available.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate internal parameter calibration is essential for 3D reconstruction with light-field cameras. Decoupling main lens and MLA improves calibration accuracy and enables faster, data-driven workflows.

Method: Introduce a linear fractional transformation (LFT) parameter α to decouple the main lens and MLA. Provide an analytical solution based on least squares, followed by nonlinear refinement. Also present a method for detecting features from raw images.

Result: Experimental results on physical and simulated data verify the method's performance. The proposed model speeds up the simulation of raw light-field images, which benefits data-driven learning. Code is available on the authors' website.

Conclusion: The LFT-based calibration effectively decouples lens parameters, improves calibration efficiency, and accelerates raw LF image simulation for data-driven methods; code is publicly accessible.

Abstract: Accurate calibration of internal parameters is a crucial yet challenging
prerequisite for 3D reconstruction using light field cameras. In this paper, we
propose a linear fractional transformation(LFT) parameter $\alpha$ to decoupled
the main lens and micro lens array (MLA). The proposed method includes an
analytical solution based on least squares, followed by nonlinear refinement.
The method for detecting features from the raw images is also introduced.
Experimental results on both physical and simulated data have verified the
performance of proposed method. Based on proposed model, the simulation of raw
light field images becomes faster, which is crucial for data-driven deep
learning methods. The corresponding code can be obtained from the author's

### [11] [Room Envelopes: A Synthetic Dataset for Indoor Layout Reconstruction from Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03970)
*Sam Bahrami,Dylan Campbell*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduces Room Envelopes, a synthetic dataset with RGB images and dual pointmaps per image (visible surface and first layout surface) to supervise monocular geometry models for reconstructing both visible surfaces and structural layout, enabling better scene extent and object location understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Occluded surfaces in scene reconstructions are common; walls/floors/ceilings are typically planar and simpler to predict. A dedicated dataset with direct supervision for structural layout can enable cheaper, feed-forward monocular models to predict the scene envelope.

Method: Create a synthetic dataset named Room Envelopes. For each image, provide RGB data and two pointmaps: (1) visible surface, (2) first surface after removing fittings/fixtures (the structural layout). Use these annotations to supervise feed-forward monocular geometry estimators to predict both surfaces.

Result: Demonstrates that direct supervision via dual pointmaps enables monocular models to predict the first visible surface and the first layout surface, yielding an understanding of the scene's extent and the shapes/locations of objects.

Conclusion: Predicting structural layout elements (walls, floors, ceilings) is feasible and beneficial; the Room Envelopes dataset can facilitate progress by enabling cheaper, structured supervision for scene understanding.

Abstract: Modern scene reconstruction methods are able to accurately recover 3D
surfaces that are visible in one or more images. However, this leads to
incomplete reconstructions, missing all occluded surfaces. While much progress
has been made on reconstructing entire objects given partial observations using
generative models, the structural elements of a scene, like the walls, floors
and ceilings, have received less attention. We argue that these scene elements
should be relatively easy to predict, since they are typically planar,
repetitive and simple, and so less costly approaches may be suitable. In this
work, we present a synthetic dataset -- Room Envelopes -- that facilitates
progress on this task by providing a set of RGB images and two associated
pointmaps for each image: one capturing the visible surface and one capturing
the first surface once fittings and fixtures are removed, that is, the
structural layout. As we show, this enables direct supervision for feed-forward
monocular geometry estimators that predict both the first visible surface and
the first layout surface. This confers an understanding of the scene's extent,
as well as the shape and location of its objects.

### [12] [Simple 3D Pose Features Support Human and Machine Social Scene Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03988)
*Wenshuo Qin,Leyla Isik*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 3D pose cues enable social interaction judgments; explicit 3D body/face pose predicts human judgments better than many AI vision models, and compact 3D pose features can match full 3D joint information and boost model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the computations enabling social interaction recognition in humans, and whether explicit 3D visuospatial pose information underlies these judgments and can be leveraged by AI.

Method: Estimate 3D joint positions from short videos using state-of-the-art pose and depth estimation; compare their ability to predict human social interaction judgments against current AI vision models; derive a compact 3D social pose feature set describing 3D face positions/directions; test predictive power and the effect of combining with AI embeddings; examine how well AI models encode 3D social pose and its relation to human judgments.

Result: 3D joint positions outperformed most AI vision models in predicting human social judgments; pose-model features did not capture these cues, even in their own embeddings; a minimal set of 3D social pose features (3D position/direction of faces) matched the predictive power of full 3D joints and improved off-the-shelf models when combined with their embeddings; the extent to which models encode 3D social pose predicted their ability to align with human judgments.

Conclusion: Social scene understanding in humans relies on explicit 3D pose representations and can be supported by simple, structured visuospatial primitives; leveraging explicit 3D pose cues can enhance AI vision models’ interpretation of social interactions.

Abstract: Humans can quickly and effortlessly extract a variety of information about
others' social interactions from visual input, ranging from visuospatial cues
like whether two people are facing each other to higher-level information. Yet,
the computations supporting these abilities remain poorly understood, and
social interaction recognition continues to challenge even the most advanced AI
vision systems. Here, we hypothesized that humans rely on 3D visuospatial pose
information to make social interaction judgments, which is absent in most AI
vision models. To test this, we combined state-of-the-art pose and depth
estimation algorithms to extract 3D joint positions of people in short video
clips depicting everyday human actions and compared their ability to predict
human social interaction judgments with current AI vision models. Strikingly,
3D joint positions outperformed most current AI vision models, revealing that
key social information is available in explicit body position but not in the
learned features of most vision models, including even the layer-wise
embeddings of the pose models used to extract joint positions. To uncover the
critical pose features humans use to make social judgments, we derived a
compact set of 3D social pose features describing only the 3D position and
direction of faces in the videos. We found that these minimal descriptors
matched the predictive strength of the full set of 3D joints and significantly
improved the performance of off-the-shelf AI vision models when combined with
their embeddings. Moreover, the degree to which 3D social pose features were
represented in each off-the-shelf AI vision model predicted the model's ability
to match human social judgments. Together, our findings provide strong evidence
that human social scene understanding relies on explicit representations of 3D
pose and can be supported by simple, structured visuospatial primitives.

TL;DR: CaRF is a camera-aware, fully differentiable framework for referring 3D Gaussian regions, achieving multi-view consistency in 3D Gaussian space via GFCE and ITPVS, and showing strong mIoU gains across standard benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current cross-modal 3D-language methods rely on 2D rendered supervision and view-specific features, causing poor cross-view consistency. There is a need for a 3D-space, camera-aware approach that can consistently align language with 3D geometry across views.

Method: CaRF introduces Gaussian Field Camera Encoding (GFCE) to embed camera geometry into Gaussian-language interactions, and Training Paired View Supervision (ITPVS) to align per-Gaussian logits across calibrated views during training, mitigating single-view overfitting and exposing inter-view discrepancies.

Result: Empirical gains are reported: average improvements of 16.8% (Ref LERF), 4.3% (LERF OVS), and 2.0% (3D OVS) in mean IoU over state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: CaRF promotes more reliable, view-consistent 3D scene understanding with potential benefits for embodied AI, AR/VR interaction, and autonomous perception.

Abstract: Referring 3D Gaussian Splatting Segmentation (R3DGS) aims to interpret
free-form language expressions and localize the corresponding 3D regions in
Gaussian fields. While recent advances have introduced cross-modal alignment
between language and 3D geometry, existing pipelines still struggle with
cross-view consistency due to their reliance on 2D rendered pseudo supervision
and view specific feature learning. In this work, we present Camera Aware
Referring Field (CaRF), a fully differentiable framework that operates directly
in the 3D Gaussian space and achieves multi view consistency. Specifically,
CaRF introduces Gaussian Field Camera Encoding (GFCE), which incorporates
camera geometry into Gaussian text interactions to explicitly model view
dependent variations and enhance geometric reasoning. Building on this, In
Training Paired View Supervision (ITPVS) is proposed to align per Gaussian
logits across calibrated views during training, effectively mitigating single
view overfitting and exposing inter view discrepancies for optimization.
Extensive experiments on three representative benchmarks demonstrate that CaRF
achieves average improvements of 16.8%, 4.3%, and 2.0% in mIoU over state of
the art methods on the Ref LERF, LERF OVS, and 3D OVS datasets, respectively.
Moreover, this work promotes more reliable and view consistent 3D scene
understanding, with potential benefits for embodied AI, AR/VR interaction, and
autonomous perception.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PhysCorr is a framework to enforce physical plausibility in text-to-video generation using PhysicsRM reward model for intra-object stability and inter-object interactions, and PhyDPO optimization with contrastive feedback and physics-aware reweighting; demonstrates improved physical realism while maintaining fidelity across backbones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address that current video generation often violates physical principles, hindering deployment in embodied AI, robotics, and simulations; need unified models to evaluate and optimize physical consistency.

Method: Introduce PhysicsRM, a dual-dimensional reward model; develop PhyDPO, a direct preference optimization pipeline using contrastive feedback and physics-aware reweighting; show model-agnostic integration into diffusion and transformer video backbones.

Result: Extensive experiments across benchmarks show significant improvements in physical realism while preserving visual fidelity and semantic alignment.

Conclusion: PhysCorr advances physically grounded and trustworthy video generation, enabling broader deployment and reliability.

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-video generation have achieved impressive
perceptual quality, yet generated content often violates fundamental principles
of physical plausibility - manifesting as implausible object dynamics,
incoherent interactions, and unrealistic motion patterns. Such failures hinder
the deployment of video generation models in embodied AI, robotics, and
simulation-intensive domains. To bridge this gap, we propose PhysCorr, a
unified framework for modeling, evaluating, and optimizing physical consistency
in video generation. Specifically, we introduce PhysicsRM, the first
dual-dimensional reward model that quantifies both intra-object stability and
inter-object interactions. On this foundation, we develop PhyDPO, a novel
direct preference optimization pipeline that leverages contrastive feedback and
physics-aware reweighting to guide generation toward physically coherent
outputs. Our approach is model-agnostic and scalable, enabling seamless
integration into a wide range of video diffusion and transformer-based
backbones. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that
PhysCorr achieves significant improvements in physical realism while preserving
visual fidelity and semantic alignment. This work takes a critical step toward
physically grounded and trustworthy video generation.

*Mahmoud Soliman,Omar Abdelaziz,Ahmed Radwan,Anand,Mohamed Shehata*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GNN-MoE introduces a graph-based, parameter-efficient adaptation for Vision Transformers in domain generalization by routing inter-patch graphs' patches to specialized experts via a GNN-based router, achieving competitive or state-of-the-art results with high parameter efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Domain generalization for Vision Transformers is challenging because fine-tuning on new domains risks overfitting and is costly. There is a need for efficient adaptation methods that preserve generalization by leveraging structural relationships among patches rather than treating tokens independently.

Method: Propose GNN-MoE: use a mixture-of-experts with Kronecker adapters for parameter efficiency; employ a graph neural network router (GCN, GAT, SAGE) that operates on inter-patch graphs to dynamically assign patches to specialized experts instead of token-based routing; leverages inter-patch relationships to adapt to domain shifts.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art or competitive performance on DG benchmarks with high parameter efficiency, demonstrating the effectiveness of graph-based contextual routing for robust, lightweight domain generalization in ViTs.

Conclusion: Graph-based contextual routing via a GNN-enabled MoE is an effective strategy for efficient domain generalization in Vision Transformers, suggesting future work on exploring more graph architectures and adapter configurations to further improve robustness and efficiency.

Abstract: Domain generalization (DG) seeks robust Vision Transformer (ViT) performance
on unseen domains. Efficiently adapting pretrained ViTs for DG is challenging;
standard fine-tuning is costly and can impair generalization. We propose
GNN-MoE, enhancing Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) for DG with a
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework using efficient Kronecker adapters. Instead
of token-based routing, a novel Graph Neural Network (GNN) router (GCN, GAT,
SAGE) operates on inter-patch graphs to dynamically assign patches to
specialized experts. This context-aware GNN routing leverages inter-patch
relationships for better adaptation to domain shifts. GNN-MoE achieves
state-of-the-art or competitive DG benchmark performance with high parameter
efficiency, highlighting the utility of graph-based contextual routing for
robust, lightweight DG.

*Mahmoud Soliman,Islam Osman,Mohamed S. Shehata,Rasika Rajapakshe*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A domain-specific Vision Transformer (MedDChest) trained from scratch on 1.2M thoracic images across X-ray and CT, using Guided Random Resized Crops, outperforming ImageNet-pretrained models on thoracic tasks; weights to be released for public use.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical imaging models often underperform when fine-tuned from backbones pre-trained on natural images due to a domain gap. There is a need for large-scale, in-domain pretraining and domain-aware augmentations to improve thoracic diagnosis tasks.

Method: Pre-train MedDChest from scratch on a massive multimodal thoracic dataset (~1.2M images from 10 public sources, including X-ray and CT) using a Vision Transformer. Introduce Guided Random Resized Crops, a content-aware augmentation that biases sampling toward anatomically relevant regions, and evaluate by fine-tuning on diverse downstream diagnostic tasks.

Result: MedDChest significantly outperforms strong, publicly available ImageNet-pretrained models across downstream thoracic tasks, validating the benefits of in-domain large-scale pretraining and domain-specific augmentation. The model serves as a robust feature extractor and improves starting performance for thoracic diagnostics; weights will be publicly released.

Conclusion: Large-scale, in-domain pretraining combined with anatomy-aware augmentation yields superior performance for thoracic imaging tasks and can stimulate future research by providing a strong, publicly available foundation model.

Abstract: The performance of vision models in medical imaging is often hindered by the
prevailing paradigm of fine-tuning backbones pre-trained on out-of-domain
natural images. To address this fundamental domain gap, we propose MedDChest, a
new foundational Vision Transformer (ViT) model optimized specifically for
thoracic imaging. We pre-trained MedDChest from scratch on a massive, curated,
multimodal dataset of over 1.2 million images, encompassing different
modalities including Chest X-ray and Computed Tomography (CT) compiled from 10
public sources. A core technical contribution of our work is Guided Random
Resized Crops, a novel content-aware data augmentation strategy that biases
sampling towards anatomically relevant regions, overcoming the inefficiency of
standard cropping techniques on medical scans. We validate our model's
effectiveness by fine-tuning it on a diverse set of downstream diagnostic
tasks. Comprehensive experiments empirically demonstrate that MedDChest
significantly outperforms strong, publicly available ImageNet-pretrained
models. By establishing the superiority of large-scale, in-domain pre-training
combined with domain-specific data augmentation, MedDChest provides a powerful
and robust feature extractor that serves as a significantly better starting
point for a wide array of thoracic diagnostic tasks. The model weights will be
made publicly available to foster future research and applications.

*Yihao Luo,Xianglong He,Chuanyu Pan,Yiwen Chen,Jiaqi Wu,Yangguang Li,Wanli Ouyang,Yuanming Hu,Guang Yang,ChoonHwai Yap*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Faithful Contouring is a sparse voxelized representation for high-resolution mesh data (2048+ resolution) that preserves sharp features and internal structures without requiring isosurface extraction or field-function conversions; paired with a dual-mode autoencoder for scalable, detail-preserving reconstruction; achieves near-lossless fidelity and strong quantitative gains over baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing iso-surface voxelizations rely on water-tight meshes and remeshing, which degrade geometric fidelity. There is a need for a high-resolution, sparse voxel representation that preserves sharp features and internal structures, while supporting texturing/editing.

Method: Introduce Faithful Contouring, a sparse voxelized representation supporting 2048+ resolutions for arbitrary meshes, avoiding conversion to field functions or isosurface extraction during remeshing. It preserves sharpness and internal structures, handles complex topology, and enables texturing/manipulation/editing. Additionally, a dual-mode autoencoder is designed to enable scalable, detail-preserving shape reconstruction.

Result: For direct representation, distance errors reach the 1e-5 level. For mesh reconstruction, Chamfer Distance is reduced by 93% and F-score improved by 35% over strong baselines, indicating superior fidelity and efficiency compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: Faithful Contouring delivers superior fidelity and efficiency as a representation for 3D learning tasks, with broad applicability to texturing, editing, and reconstruction.

Abstract: Accurate and efficient voxelized representations of 3D meshes are the
foundation of 3D reconstruction and generation. However, existing
representations based on iso-surface heavily rely on water-tightening or
rendering optimization, which inevitably compromise geometric fidelity. We
propose Faithful Contouring, a sparse voxelized representation that supports
2048+ resolutions for arbitrary meshes, requiring neither converting meshes to
field functions nor extracting the isosurface during remeshing. It achieves
near-lossless fidelity by preserving sharpness and internal structures, even
for challenging cases with complex geometry and topology. The proposed method
also shows flexibility for texturing, manipulation, and editing. Beyond
representation, we design a dual-mode autoencoder for Faithful Contouring,
enabling scalable and detail-preserving shape reconstruction. Extensive
experiments show that Faithful Contouring surpasses existing methods in
accuracy and efficiency for both representation and reconstruction. For direct
representation, it achieves distance errors at the $10^{-5}$ level; for mesh
reconstruction, it yields a 93\% reduction in Chamfer Distance and a 35\%
improvement in F-score over strong baselines, confirming superior fidelity as a
representation for 3D learning tasks.

*Arfina Rahman,Mahesh Banavar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A lightweight, low-frame-rate PPG-based biometric system using CWT-based time-frequency representations and a hybrid CVT-ConvMixer-LSTM model achieves high authentication accuracy on a 46-subject dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable noninvasive, low-cost biometric authentication with inherent liveness detection, while mitigating motion, illumination, and inter-subject variability in PPG signals for mobile/embedded devices.

Method: Preprocess PPG from fingertip videos (baseline drift removal, PCA-based motion artifact suppression, bandpass filtering, Fourier resampling, amplitude normalization); convert 1D PPG segments to 2D CWT-based scalograms; extract spatial features via CVT and ConvMixer branches and temporal features via an LSTM in a hybrid CVT-ConvMixer-LSTM architecture.

Result: On 46 subjects (14 Hz sampling), the approach achieved 98% authentication accuracy, indicating robustness to noise and inter-subject variability.

Conclusion: The framework is efficient, scalable, and offers inherent liveness detection, making it suitable for real-world mobile and embedded biometric security applications.

Abstract: Photoplethysmography (PPG) signals, which measure changes in blood volume in
the skin using light, have recently gained attention in biometric
authentication because of their non-invasive acquisition, inherent liveness
detection, and suitability for low-cost wearable devices. However, PPG signal
quality is challenged by motion artifacts, illumination changes, and
inter-subject physiological variability, making robust feature extraction and
classification crucial. This study proposes a lightweight and cost-effective
biometric authentication framework based on PPG signals extracted from
low-frame-rate fingertip videos. The CFIHSR dataset, comprising PPG recordings
from 46 subjects at a sampling rate of 14 Hz, is employed for evaluation. The
raw PPG signals undergo a standard preprocessing pipeline involving baseline
drift removal, motion artifact suppression using Principal Component Analysis
(PCA), bandpass filtering, Fourier-based resampling, and amplitude
normalization. To generate robust representations, each one-dimensional PPG
segment is converted into a two-dimensional time-frequency scalogram via the
Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT), effectively capturing transient
cardiovascular dynamics. We developed a hybrid deep learning model, termed
CVT-ConvMixer-LSTM, by combining spatial features from the Convolutional Vision
Transformer (CVT) and ConvMixer branches with temporal features from a Long
Short-Term Memory network (LSTM). The experimental results on 46 subjects
demonstrate an authentication accuracy of 98%, validating the robustness of the
model to noise and variability between subjects. Due to its efficiency,
scalability, and inherent liveness detection capability, the proposed system is
well-suited for real-world mobile and embedded biometric security applications.

### [19] [Unveiling Deep Semantic Uncertainty Perception for Language-Anchored Multi-modal Vision-Brain Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04078)
*Zehui Feng,Chenqi Zhang,Mingru Wang,Minuo Wei,Shiwei Cheng,Cuntai Guan,Ting Han*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Bratrix is an end-to-end Language-Anchored Vision-Brain alignment framework that decomposes visual stimuli into visual and linguistic components, projects both visual and brain signals into a shared latent space with an uncertainty-aware weighting scheme, and uses language-anchored semantic matrices with a two-stage training strategy, yielding improved EEG/MEG/fMRI tasks including a notable 14.3% gain in 200-way EEG retrieval.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Subject variability and entangled visual features make it difficult to derive latent semantic structure from neural signals; visual-only representations struggle with interpretability and robustness. A language-informed, cross-modal alignment promises better semantic grounding and resilience to noise.

Method: Decompose stimuli into hierarchical visual and linguistic semantics; map visual and brain representations into a common latent space; incorporate an uncertainty-perception module to weight alignments under noisy neural signals; use learnable language-anchored semantic matrices to strengthen cross-modal correlations; two-stage training: single-modality pretraining followed by multimodal fine-tuning; Bratrix-M variant offers further gains.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art on EEG, MEG, and fMRI benchmarks for retrieval, reconstruction, and captioning tasks; highlights include surpassing 14.3% in a 200-way EEG retrieval task; code and model are made available.

Conclusion: Bratrix enables robust, interpretable cross-modal alignment among vision, brain activity, and language by decoupling visual semantics and leveraging language anchors, with practical gains in neural decoding tasks and potential for broader neuroimaging applications.

Abstract: Unveiling visual semantics from neural signals such as EEG, MEG, and fMRI
remains a fundamental challenge due to subject variability and the entangled
nature of visual features. Existing approaches primarily align neural activity
directly with visual embeddings, but visual-only representations often fail to
capture latent semantic dimensions, limiting interpretability and deep
robustness. To address these limitations, we propose Bratrix, the first
end-to-end framework to achieve multimodal Language-Anchored Vision-Brain
alignment. Bratrix decouples visual stimuli into hierarchical visual and
linguistic semantic components, and projects both visual and brain
representations into a shared latent space, enabling the formation of aligned
visual-language and brain-language embeddings. To emulate human-like perceptual
reliability and handle noisy neural signals, Bratrix incorporates a novel
uncertainty perception module that applies uncertainty-aware weighting during
alignment. By leveraging learnable language-anchored semantic matrices to
enhance cross-modal correlations and employing a two-stage training strategy of
single-modality pretraining followed by multimodal fine-tuning, Bratrix-M
improves alignment precision. Extensive experiments on EEG, MEG, and fMRI
benchmarks demonstrate that Bratrix improves retrieval, reconstruction, and
captioning performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, specifically
surpassing 14.3% in 200-way EEG retrieval task. Code and model are available.

*Abu Hanif Muhammad Syarubany*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Unpaired, self-supervised CT denoising: CycleGAN-based residual translator vs Noise2Score; CycleGAN yields best final image quality, Noise2Score robust when clean data unavailable; code released.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address denoising of CT images without paired clean data by evaluating two data-efficient denoising paradigms and comparing their performance.

Method: Two approaches: 1) CycleGAN with a residual translator using a tuned U-Net backbone (lambda_cycle=30, lambda_iden=2, ngf=ndf=64) and longer training schedule; 2) Noise2Score (score-matching denoiser). Evaluation under a common protocol on CT denoising; metrics include PSNR, SSIM, and an unseen Kaggle leaderboard score.

Result: CycleGAN improves the noisy input from 34.66 dB / 0.9234 SSIM to 38.913 dB / 0.971 SSIM; unseen-set score 1.9343; Noise2Score trails in absolute PSNR/SSIM but shows large gains on very noisy inputs and offers a robust pair-free alternative; overall CycleGAN provides the strongest final image quality, with Noise2Score as a competitive, data-efficient fallback.

Conclusion: For unpaired/self-supervised CT denoising, CycleGAN delivers the best final image quality; Noise2Score is a strong, robust alternative when clean paired data are unavailable. Source code is available at the provided GitHub link.

Abstract: We study CT image denoising in the unpaired and self-supervised regimes by
evaluating two strong, training-data-efficient paradigms: a CycleGAN-based
residual translator and a Noise2Score (N2S) score-matching denoiser. Under a
common evaluation protocol, a configuration sweep identifies a simple standard
U-Net backbone within CycleGAN (lambda_cycle = 30, lambda_iden = 2, ngf = ndf =
64) as the most reliable setting; we then train it to convergence with a longer
schedule. The selected CycleGAN improves the noisy input from 34.66 dB / 0.9234
SSIM to 38.913 dB / 0.971 SSIM and attains an estimated score of 1.9441 and an
unseen-set (Kaggle leaderboard) score of 1.9343. Noise2Score, while slightly
behind in absolute PSNR / SSIM, achieves large gains over very noisy inputs,
highlighting its utility when clean pairs are unavailable. Overall, CycleGAN
offers the strongest final image quality, whereas Noise2Score provides a robust
pair-free alternative with competitive performance. Source code is available at

Method: BoRe-Depth introduces an Enhanced Feature Adaptive Fusion Module (EFAF) to adaptively fuse depth features for better boundary detail, and integrates semantic knowledge into the encoder to improve object recognition and boundary perception. The model is compact (8.7M params) and deployed on NVIDIA Jetson Orin, achieving 50.7 FPS.

Result: The approach reportedly outperforms previous lightweight depth-estimation models across multiple challenging datasets, with ablation studies validating the contributions of EFAF and semantic-encoder design.

Conclusion: BoRe-Depth demonstrates that high-quality, real-time monocular depth estimation is feasible on embedded platforms with a compact architecture, improved boundary fidelity, and a practical release of code for reproducibility.

Abstract: Depth estimation is one of the key technologies for realizing 3D perception
in unmanned systems. Monocular depth estimation has been widely researched
because of its low-cost advantage, but the existing methods face the challenges
of poor depth estimation performance and blurred object boundaries on embedded

*Nishchal Sapkota,Haoyan Shi,Yejia Zhang,Xianshi Ma,Bofang Zheng,Danny Z. Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A U‑Net–like segmentation model (UKAST) integrates rational-function based KANs into Swin Transformer encoders to achieve data-efficient, high-accuracy medical image segmentation with reduced FLOPs, outperforming CNN and Transformer baselines on 2D/3D benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CNNs excel at local feature extraction but miss long-range dependencies; Transformers capture global context but require large datasets and are computationally intensive. There is a need for data-efficient, scalable segmentation models that leverage global reasoning without excessive computation.

Method: UKAST is a U‑Net–like architecture that embeds Group Rational KANs (GR‑KANs) from the Kolmogorov‑Arnold Transformer into Swin Transformer encoders. It uses rational base functions to replace spline-based KANs, improving expressiveness and data efficiency, with a modest parameter increase and reduced FLOPs compared to SwinUNETR.

Result: UKAST achieves state-of-the-art performance on four diverse 2D and 3D medical image segmentation benchmarks, consistently outperforming both CNN- and Transformer-based baselines. It shows superior accuracy in data-scarce settings, mitigating the data-hungry drawbacks of standard Vision Transformers.

Conclusion: KAN‑enhanced Transformers hold promise for data-efficient medical image segmentation, combining effective global context modeling with computational efficiency. The approach advances the practicality of transformer-based medical segmentation, and code is available at the provided GitHub link.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation is critical for accurate diagnostics and treatment
planning, but remains challenging due to complex anatomical structures and
limited annotated training data. CNN-based segmentation methods excel at local
feature extraction, but struggle with modeling long-range dependencies.
Transformers, on the other hand, capture global context more effectively, but
are inherently data-hungry and computationally expensive. In this work, we
introduce UKAST, a U-Net like architecture that integrates rational-function
based Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) into Swin Transformer encoders. By
leveraging rational base functions and Group Rational KANs (GR-KANs) from the
Kolmogorov-Arnold Transformer (KAT), our architecture addresses the
inefficiencies of vanilla spline-based KANs, yielding a more expressive and
data-efficient framework with reduced FLOPs and only a very small increase in
parameter count compared to SwinUNETR. UKAST achieves state-of-the-art
performance on four diverse 2D and 3D medical image segmentation benchmarks,
consistently surpassing both CNN- and Transformer-based baselines. Notably, it
attains superior accuracy in data-scarce settings, alleviating the data-hungry
limitations of standard Vision Transformers. These results show the potential
of KAN-enhanced Transformers to advance data-efficient medical image
segmentation. Code is available at: https://github.com/nsapkota417/UKAST

*Biao Liu,Yuanzhi Liang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SpatialLock introduces PoI and PoG to jointly control spatial layouts in text-to-image generation, using an attention-based spatial injection and perception-guided learning, achieving state-of-the-art object positioning (IOU > 0.9).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Precise localization and grounding of objects in T2I remain challenging; current methods fail to fully leverage positional information, hindering accurate spatial layouts and downstream tasks like dataset generation.

Method: PoI is an attention-based injection layer that directly integrates spatial information to encourage grounding; PoG uses perception-based supervision to refine object localization, with SpatialLock combining these to steer object placement.

Result: Reported IOU scores above 0.9 on multiple datasets, establishing a new state-of-the-art for precise object positioning and improving visual quality of generated images.

Conclusion: SpatialLock provides effective and generalizable control over spatial arrangements in T2I, suggesting strong potential for applications requiring precise localization; future work may explore efficiency, broader datasets, and robustness.

Abstract: Text-to-Image (T2I) synthesis has made significant advancements in recent
years, driving applications such as generating datasets automatically. However,
precise control over object localization in generated images remains a
challenge. Existing methods fail to fully utilize positional information,
leading to an inadequate understanding of object spatial layouts. To address
this issue, we propose SpatialLock, a novel framework that leverages perception
signals and grounding information to jointly control the generation of spatial
locations. SpatialLock incorporates two components: Position-Engaged Injection
(PoI) and Position-Guided Learning (PoG). PoI directly integrates spatial
information through an attention layer, encouraging the model to learn the
grounding information effectively. PoG employs perception-based supervision to
further refine object localization. Together, these components enable the model
to generate objects with precise spatial arrangements and improve the visual
quality of the generated images. Experiments show that SpatialLock sets a new
state-of-the-art for precise object positioning, achieving IOU scores above 0.9
across multiple datasets.

### [24] [Tortoise and Hare Guidance: Accelerating Diffusion Model Inference with Multirate Integration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04117)
*Yunghee Lee,Byeonghyun Pak,Junwha Hong,Hoseong Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Training-free THG method accelerates diffusion sampling by reformulating CFG ODE as a multirate system, integrating noise on a fine grid and guidance on a coarse grid, with adaptive timestep and guidance-scale scheduling; achieves ~30% fewer function evaluations with minimal fidelity loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reduce diffusion model sampling costs without retraining, by exploiting redundancy in the CFG guidance term and robustness to numerical error.

Method: Reformulate classifier-free guidance ODE as a multirate system. Integrate noise estimate with the tortoise equation on the original fine-grained grid and the additional guidance into the hare equation on a coarse grid. Introduce an error-bound-aware timestep sampler and a guidance-scale scheduler to stabilize extrapolations.

Result: Reduces NFE by up to 30% with virtually no loss in generation fidelity (Delta ImageReward ≤ 0.032). Outperforms state-of-the-art CFG-based training-free accelerators under identical budgets.

Conclusion: Multirate formulations have strong potential for diffusion solvers, enabling real-time, high-quality image synthesis without retraining; code available at the authors' repo.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose Tortoise and Hare Guidance (THG), a training-free
strategy that accelerates diffusion sampling while maintaining high-fidelity
generation. We demonstrate that the noise estimate and the additional guidance
term exhibit markedly different sensitivity to numerical error by reformulating
the classifier-free guidance (CFG) ODE as a multirate system of ODEs. Our
error-bound analysis shows that the additional guidance branch is more robust
to approximation, revealing substantial redundancy that conventional solvers
fail to exploit. Building on this insight, THG significantly reduces the
computation of the additional guidance: the noise estimate is integrated with
the tortoise equation on the original, fine-grained timestep grid, while the
additional guidance is integrated with the hare equation only on a coarse grid.
We also introduce (i) an error-bound-aware timestep sampler that adaptively
selects step sizes and (ii) a guidance-scale scheduler that stabilizes large
extrapolation spans. THG reduces the number of function evaluations (NFE) by up
to 30% with virtually no loss in generation fidelity ($\Delta$ImageReward
$\leq$ 0.032) and outperforms state-of-the-art CFG-based training-free
accelerators under identical computation budgets. Our findings highlight the
potential of multirate formulations for diffusion solvers, paving the way for
real-time high-quality image synthesis without any model retraining. The source

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A training-free diffusion-based framework (M3S) enables explicit style guidance for sketch generation using textual prompts and reference sketches, employing a style-content guidance mechanism and multi-style AdaIN to control style without retraining, reducing content leakage and improving quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Provide precise, user-controlled sketch style synthesis without costly training, addressing leakage of reference content and poor style transfer when structural similarity is low, and enabling multi-style generation.

Method: Modify diffusion model to incorporate reference features as auxiliary information with linear smoothing instead of overwriting self-attention; introduce style-content guidance; extend to multi-style control via joint Adaptive Instance Normalization (AdaIN) coordinating multiple reference sketches.

Result: Achieves high-quality sketch generation with accurate style alignment and enhanced style control, even when reference and target sketches have low structural similarity; training-free, scalable approach; implementation named M3S.

Conclusion: The framework delivers flexible, controllable, style-aware sketch synthesis without training, and supports multi-style generation, offering robust style transfer with reduced content leakage.

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language models have facilitated progress in sketch
generation. However, existing specialized methods primarily focus on generic
synthesis and lack mechanisms for precise control over sketch styles. In this
work, we propose a training-free framework based on diffusion models that
enables explicit style guidance via textual prompts and referenced style
sketches. Unlike previous style transfer methods that overwrite key and value
matrices in self-attention, we incorporate the reference features as auxiliary
information with linear smoothing and leverage a style-content guidance
mechanism. This design effectively reduces content leakage from reference
sketches and enhances synthesis quality, especially in cases with low
structural similarity between reference and target sketches. Furthermore, we
extend our framework to support controllable multi-style generation by
integrating features from multiple reference sketches, coordinated via a joint
AdaIN module. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves
high-quality sketch generation with accurate style alignment and improved
flexibility in style control. The official implementation of M3S is available

*Shengyu Tang,Zeyuan Lu,Jiazhi Dong,Changdong Yu,Xiaoyu Wang,Yaohui Lyu,Weihao Xia*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DMSORT is a dual-branch, efficient maritime MOT framework that decouples motion and appearance to robustly track objects under camera motion, achieving state-of-the-art results with fast runtime.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Maritime MOT is challenged by camera-induced motion, clutter, occlusion, and appearance changes. Robust detection, re-identification, and motion compensation are needed to maintain accurate identities and trajectories in real time.

Method: A parallel tracker with affine compensation comprising: (1) a detection+ReID branch with Reversible Columnar Detection Network (RCDN) and a lightweight Transformer-based appearance extractor (Li-TAE); (2) a dedicated motion branch that estimates platform motion via a projective transformation and incorporates this into Kalman filtering to stabilize true object trajectories; a clustering-optimized feature fusion module combines motion and appearance cues for identity consistency.

Result: Evaluated on the Singapore Maritime Dataset, achieving state-of-the-art performance; the approach provides the fastest runtime among existing ReID-based MOT frameworks while maintaining high identity consistency and robustness to jitter and occlusion.

Conclusion: DMSORT offers an efficient, robust maritime MOT solution by decoupling motion and appearance, leveraging affine compensation and robust feature fusion to improve ID stability and real-time performance for maritime surveillance.

Abstract: Accurate perception of the marine environment through robust multi-object
tracking (MOT) is essential for ensuring safe vessel navigation and effective
maritime surveillance. However, the complicated maritime environment often
causes camera motion and subsequent visual degradation, posing significant
challenges to MOT. To address this challenge, we propose an efficient
Dual-branch Maritime SORT (DMSORT) method for maritime MOT. The core of the
framework is a parallel tracker with affine compensation, which incorporates an
object detection and re-identification (ReID) branch, along with a dedicated
branch for dynamic camera motion estimation. Specifically, a Reversible
Columnar Detection Network (RCDN) is integrated into the detection module to
leverage multi-level visual features for robust object detection. Furthermore,
a lightweight Transformer-based appearance extractor (Li-TAE) is designed to
capture global contextual information and generate robust appearance features.
Another branch decouples platform-induced and target-intrinsic motion by
constructing a projective transformation, applying platform-motion compensation
within the Kalman filter, and thereby stabilizing true object trajectories.
Finally, a clustering-optimized feature fusion module effectively combines
motion and appearance cues to ensure identity consistency under noise,
occlusion, and drift. Extensive evaluations on the Singapore Maritime Dataset
demonstrate that DMSORT achieves state-of-the-art performance. Notably, DMSORT
attains the fastest runtime among existing ReID-based MOT frameworks while
maintaining high identity consistency and robustness to jitter and occlusion.

### [28] [Learning from Online Videos at Inference Time for Computer-Use Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04137)
*Yujian Liu,Ze Wang,Hao Chen,Ximeng Sun,Xiaodong Yu,Jialian Wu,Jiang Liu,Emad Barsoum,Zicheng Liu,Shiyu Chang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A framework enabling computer-use agents to learn from online tutorial videos at inference time by retrieving, segmenting, and selecting short demonstration trajectories to provide in-context guidance, improving decision-making over text-only baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Humans leverage video tutorials to bridge gaps in domain-specific procedural knowledge; agents struggle with multi-step workflows and application-specific actions, creating a need to distill abundant online video content into actionable guidance for inference-time use.

Method: Retrieve and filter tutorial videos; convert them into structured demonstration trajectories using a visual-language model to infer UI actions, segment videos into short action subsequences, and assign each subsequence a textual objective; during inference, a two-stage trajectory selection mechanism dynamically picks a single trajectory to insert as context at each step, providing local, relevant guidance.

Result: Across two benchmarks, the proposed framework consistently outperforms strong base agents and variants using only textual tutorials or transcripts. Analyses highlight the importance of trajectory segmentation and selection, action filtering, and visual information in extracting useful guidance from online videos.

Conclusion: Online videos can be systematically distilled into actionable, context-aware guidance that improves computer-use agents at inference time; the approach demonstrates the viability of video-derived demonstrations as a scalable resource for agent learning and execution.

Abstract: Computer-use agents can operate computers and automate laborious tasks, but
despite recent rapid progress, they still lag behind human users, especially
when tasks require domain-specific procedural knowledge about particular
applications, platforms, and multi-step workflows. Humans can bridge this gap
by watching video tutorials: we search, skim, and selectively imitate short
segments that match our current subgoal. In this paper, we study how to enable
computer-use agents to learn from online videos at inference time effectively.
We propose a framework that retrieves and filters tutorial videos, converts
them into structured demonstration trajectories, and dynamically selects
trajectories as in-context guidance during execution. Particularly, using a
VLM, we infer UI actions, segment videos into short subsequences of actions,
and assign each subsequence a textual objective. At inference time, a two-stage
selection mechanism dynamically chooses a single trajectory to add in context
at each step, focusing the agent on the most helpful local guidance for its
next decision. Experiments on two widely used benchmarks show that our
framework consistently outperforms strong base agents and variants that use
only textual tutorials or transcripts. Analyses highlight the importance of
trajectory segmentation and selection, action filtering, and visual
information, suggesting that abundant online videos can be systematically
distilled into actionable guidance that improves computer-use agents at
inference time. Our code is available at

### [29] [Seeing Straight: Document Orientation Detection for Efficient OCR](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04161)
*Suranjan Goswami,Abhinav Ravi,Raja Kolla,Ali Faraz,Shaharukh Khan,Akash,Chandra Khatri,Shubham Agarwal*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduce OCR-Rotation-Bench (ORB) for evaluating OCR robustness to image rotations, with ORB-En and ORB-Indic benchmarks; present a fast 4-class rotation classifier based on Phi-3.5-Vision with dynamic cropping; show high rotation-identification accuracy (96% for ORB-En, 92% for ORB-Indic) and substantial downstream OCR gains (up to 14% closed-model, up to 4x for open weights).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate page orientation is critical for OCR performance; misalignment arises from user-captured images and base orientation errors. There is a need for standardized benchmarks to evaluate rotation robustness, including multilingual data.

Method: Create ORB-En (rotation-transformed English OCR data) and ORB-Indic (11 Indic languages) to form benchmarks. Develop a lightweight rotation classifier using the vision encoder of Phi-3.5-Vision with dynamic image cropping, fine-tuned for a 4-class rotation task, in a standalone module. Evaluate on ORB-En and ORB-Indic, and assess impact on OCR performance across closed-source and open-weight models.

Result: Rotation classifier achieves ~96% accuracy on ORB-En and ~92% on ORB-Indic. Embedding rotation correction boosts OCR accuracy: up to 14% gains for closed-source models and up to 4x improvements for open-weight models in simulated real-world settings.

Conclusion: A practical, robust rotation-correction module and a standardized benchmark (ORB) can substantially improve OCR robustness across languages; the approach is lightweight and complements existing OCR systems.

Abstract: Despite significant advances in document understanding, determining the
correct orientation of scanned or photographed documents remains a critical
pre-processing step in the real world settings. Accurate rotation correction is
essential for enhancing the performance of downstream tasks such as Optical
Character Recognition (OCR) where misalignment commonly arises due to user
errors, particularly incorrect base orientations of the camera during capture.
In this study, we first introduce OCR-Rotation-Bench (ORB), a new benchmark for
evaluating OCR robustness to image rotations, comprising (i) ORB-En, built from
rotation-transformed structured and free-form English OCR datasets, and (ii)
ORB-Indic, a novel multilingual set spanning 11 Indic mid to low-resource
languages. We also present a fast, robust and lightweight rotation
classification pipeline built on the vision encoder of Phi-3.5-Vision model
with dynamic image cropping, fine-tuned specifically for 4-class rotation task
in a standalone fashion. Our method achieves near-perfect 96% and 92% accuracy
on identifying the rotations respectively on both the datasets. Beyond
classification, we demonstrate the critical role of our module in boosting OCR
performance: closed-source (up to 14%) and open-weights models (up to 4x) in
the simulated real-world setting.

### [30] [Systematic Evaluation of Preprocessing Techniques for Accurate Image Registration in Digital Pathology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04171)
*Fatemehzahra Darzi,Rodrigo Escobar Diaz Guerrero,Thomas Bocklitz*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Applying color transformation before multimodal image registration improves alignment in digital pathology; CycleGAN-based transformation yields the best registration performance across H&E and multimodal images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate registration across different stains/modalities is crucial for biomarker analysis and tissue reconstruction in digital pathology; pre-registration color normalization could enhance alignment accuracy.

Method: 20 tissue pair dataset with preprocessing steps including color transformations (CycleGAN, Macenko, Reinhard, Vahadane), inversion, contrast adjustment, intensity normalization, and denoising. Registration performed with VALIS: rigid registration followed by two-stage non-rigid registration on low and high-resolution images. Evaluation used relative Target Registration Error (rTRE), reporting median of median rTRE (MMrTRE) and average of median rTRE (AMrTRE), plus a custom point-based evaluation with ten manually selected key points. Experiments conducted for original and inverted multimodal images.

Result: CycleGAN color transformation achieved the lowest registration errors in both scenarios; other color transformation methods yielded higher errors.

Conclusion: Color transformation before registration improves cross-modal image alignment in digital pathology, enabling more reliable downstream analysis.

Abstract: Image registration refers to the process of spatially aligning two or more
images by mapping them into a common coordinate system, so that corresponding
anatomical or tissue structures are matched across images. In digital
pathology, registration enables direct comparison and integration of
information from different stains or imaging modalities, sup-porting
applications such as biomarker analysis and tissue reconstruction. Accurate
registration of images from different modalities is an essential step in
digital pathology. In this study, we investigated how various color
transformation techniques affect image registration between hematoxylin and
eosin (H&E) stained images and non-linear multimodal images. We used a dataset
of 20 tissue sample pairs, with each pair undergoing several preprocessing
steps, including different color transformation (CycleGAN, Macenko, Reinhard,
Vahadane), inversion, contrast adjustment, intensity normalization, and
denoising. All images were registered using the VALIS registration method,
which first applies rigid registration and then performs non-rigid registration
in two steps on both low and high-resolution images. Registration performance
was evaluated using the relative Target Registration Error (rTRE). We reported
the median of median rTRE values (MMrTRE) and the average of median rTRE values
(AMrTRE) for each method. In addition, we performed a custom point-based
evaluation using ten manually selected key points. Registration was done
separately for two scenarios, using either the original or inverted multimodal
images. In both scenarios, CycleGAN color transformation achieved the lowest
registration errors, while the other methods showed higher errors. These
findings show that applying color transformation before registration improves
alignment between images from different modalities and supports more reliable
analysis in digital pathology.

*Josef Mayr,Anna Reithmeir,Maxime Di Folco,Julia A. Schnabel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Covariance descriptors built from pretrained vision encoders outperform handcrafted ones in medical image classification, and SPDNet with DINOv2 features achieves state-of-the-art performance on MedMNSIT benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical imaging benefits from robust second-order statistics and SPD-mcompatible architectures; however, covariance descriptors and the use of pretrained general vision encoders (GVEs) for this purpose have been underexplored in this domain.

Method: Construct covariance descriptors from features extracted by pretrained GVEs (DINOv2 and MedSAM) and compare them to handcrafted covariance descriptors. Evaluate across eleven binary and multi-class tasks from the MedMNSIT benchmark, using SPDNet (designed for symmetric positive definite matrices) for classification.

Result: Covariance descriptors derived from GVE features consistently outperform those based on handcrafted descriptors across the evaluated datasets. When combined with DINOv2 features, SPDNet delivers superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: Integrating covariance descriptors with powerful pretrained vision encoders shows strong potential for medical image analysis, especially when paired with SPD-based networks like SPDNet.

Abstract: Covariance descriptors capture second-order statistics of image features.
They have shown strong performance in general computer vision tasks, but remain
underexplored in medical imaging. We investigate their effectiveness for both
conventional and learning-based medical image classification, with a particular
focus on SPDNet, a classification network specifically designed for symmetric
positive definite (SPD) matrices. We propose constructing covariance
descriptors from features extracted by pre-trained general vision encoders
(GVEs) and comparing them with handcrafted descriptors. Two GVEs - DINOv2 and
MedSAM - are evaluated across eleven binary and multi-class datasets from the
MedMNSIT benchmark. Our results show that covariance descriptors derived from
GVE features consistently outperform those derived from handcrafted features.
Moreover, SPDNet yields superior performance to state-of-the-art methods when
combined with DINOv2 features. Our findings highlight the potential of
combining covariance descriptors with powerful pretrained vision encoders for
medical image analysis.

### [32] [AStF: Motion Style Transfer via Adaptive Statistics Fusor](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04192)
*Hanmo Chen,Chenghao Xu,Jiexi Yan,Cheng Deng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes Adaptive Statistics Fusor (AStF) for motion style transfer using high-order statistics (skewness, kurtosis) in addition to mean-variance, with Style Disentanglement Module (SDM) and High-Order Multi-Statistics Attention (HOS-Attn), trained with a Motion Consistency Regularization (MCR) discriminator; claims superior performance over state-of-the-art.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mean-variance based style transfer is insufficient to capture the complex, non-Gaussian, and temporally coherent patterns in motion data. Higher-order statistics (skewness, kurtosis) are introduced to better model dynamics.

Method: Introduce AStF comprising SDM and HOS-Attn to capture style via higher-order statistics; train adversarially with an MCR discriminator to enforce motion consistency.

Result: Experimental results indicate AStF achieves superior motion style transfer performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: AStF provides a more comprehensive statistical model of spatiotemporal patterns in motion, enhancing the quality of motion style transfer; code available on GitHub.

Abstract: Human motion style transfer allows characters to appear less rigidity and
more realism with specific style. Traditional arbitrary image style transfer
typically process mean and variance which is proved effective. Meanwhile,
similar methods have been adapted for motion style transfer. However, due to
the fundamental differences between images and motion, relying on mean and
variance is insufficient to fully capture the complex dynamic patterns and
spatiotemporal coherence properties of motion data. Building upon this, our key
insight is to bring two more coefficient, skewness and kurtosis, into the
analysis of motion style. Specifically, we propose a novel Adaptive Statistics
Fusor (AStF) which consists of Style Disentanglement Module (SDM) and
High-Order Multi-Statistics Attention (HOS-Attn). We trained our AStF in
conjunction with a Motion Consistency Regularization (MCR) discriminator.
Experimental results show that, by providing a more comprehensive model of the
spatiotemporal statistical patterns inherent in dynamic styles, our proposed
AStF shows proficiency superiority in motion style transfers over
state-of-the-arts. Our code and model are available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Adapting a human-centric foundation model for pose estimation (Sapiens) to medical anatomical landmark detection yields MedSapiens, achieving state-of-the-art results across multiple datasets and strong few-shot performance by leveraging spatial priors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bridging the gap between domain-specialist landmark detectors and large pre-trained vision models by reusing human-centric foundation models for medical imaging tasks, to improve accuracy and data efficiency.

Method: Adapt Sapiens to medical imaging via multi-dataset pretraining to create MedSapiens, evaluating on several anatomical landmark datasets and comparing to generalist and specialist baselines.

Result: MedSapiens achieves up to 5.26% improvement over generalist models and up to 21.81% over specialist models in average SDR; in limited-data scenarios, it improves SDR by 2.69% over the few-shot state of the art.

Conclusion: Human-centric foundation models, optimized for spatial pose localization, provide strong priors for anatomical landmark detection in medical imaging. Adapting such models via multi-dataset pretraining yields strong cross-dataset performance and data-efficient transfer, suggesting a viable path beyond task-specific architectures.

Abstract: This paper does not introduce a novel architecture; instead, it revisits a
fundamental yet overlooked baseline: adapting human-centric foundation models
for anatomical landmark detection in medical imaging. While landmark detection
has traditionally relied on domain-specific models, the emergence of
large-scale pre-trained vision models presents new opportunities. In this
study, we investigate the adaptation of Sapiens, a human-centric foundation
model designed for pose estimation, to medical imaging through multi-dataset
pretraining, establishing a new state of the art across multiple datasets. Our
proposed model, MedSapiens, demonstrates that human-centric foundation models,
inherently optimized for spatial pose localization, provide strong priors for
anatomical landmark detection, yet this potential has remained largely
untapped. We benchmark MedSapiens against existing state-of-the-art models,
achieving up to 5.26% improvement over generalist models and up to 21.81%
improvement over specialist models in the average success detection rate (SDR).
To further assess MedSapiens adaptability to novel downstream tasks with few
annotations, we evaluate its performance in limited-data settings, achieving
2.69% improvement over the few-shot state of the art in SDR. Code and model
weights are available at https://github.com/xmed-lab/MedSapiens .

*Claudio Giusti,Luca Guarnera,Sebastiano Battiato*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proto-LeakNet is a signal-leak-aware attribution framework for AI-generated images that uses latent-diffusion cues and a prototype-based embedding to enable open-set, interpretable attribution of unseen generators with high accuracy and robustness to post-processing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Source attribution and authenticity verification are critical due to diffusion pipelines leaving persistent, generator-specific signal leaks in latent representations; existing closed-set methods fail to generalize to unseen generators, necessitating open-set detection without retraining.

Method: Operate in the latent space of diffusion models; re-simulate partial forward diffusion to expose residual generator cues; use a temporal attention encoder to aggregate multi-step latent features; apply a feature-weighted prototype head to structure the embedding space; train on closed-set data and evaluate openness with a density-based open-set approach to analyze unseen generators without retraining.

Result: Achieves Macro AUC of 98.13% on closed data; robust to post-processing; surpasses state-of-the-art methods; demonstrates strong separability between known and unseen generators.

Conclusion: Modeling signal-leak bias in latent space enables reliable and interpretable AI-image and deepfake forensics; code will be available upon submission.

Abstract: The growing sophistication of synthetic image and deepfake generation models
has turned source attribution and authenticity verification into a critical
challenge for modern computer vision systems. Recent studies suggest that
diffusion pipelines unintentionally imprint persistent statistical traces,
known as signal leaks, within their outputs, particularly in latent
representations. Building on this observation, we propose Proto-LeakNet, a
signal-leak-aware and interpretable attribution framework that integrates
closed-set classification with a density-based open-set evaluation on the
learned embeddings, enabling analysis of unseen generators without retraining.
Operating in the latent domain of diffusion models, our method re-simulates
partial forward diffusion to expose residual generator-specific cues. A
temporal attention encoder aggregates multi-step latent features, while a
feature-weighted prototype head structures the embedding space and enables
transparent attribution. Trained solely on closed data and achieving a Macro
AUC of 98.13%, Proto-LeakNet learns a latent geometry that remains robust under
post-processing, surpassing state-of-the-art methods, and achieves strong
separability between known and unseen generators. These results demonstrate
that modeling signal-leak bias in latent space enables reliable and
interpretable AI-image and deepfake forensics. The code for the whole work will
be available upon submission.

*Yujie Yang,Shuang Li,Jun Ye,Neng Dong,Fan Li,Huafeng Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes DinoGRL for video-based visible-infrared ReID, leveraging DINOv2-guided gait representations with semantic silhouette learning and bidirectional multi-granularity enhancement to achieve state-of-the-art results on two benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Gait features are underutilized in video-based visible-infrared re-identification, despite being modality-invariant and rich in temporal dynamics; exploiting gait can improve spatiotemporal consistency in cross-modal video matching.

Method: DINOv2-Driven Gait Representation Learning (DinoGRL) framework: (1) SASGL (Semantic-Aware Silhouette and Gait Learning) uses semantic priors from DINOv2 to enhance silhouettes and jointly optimizes with ReID objective to learn semantically enriched gait features; (2) PBMGE (Progressive Bidirectional Multi-Granularity Enhancement) enables bidirectional interactions between gait and appearance streams across multiple spatial granularities to refine global representations with local details.

Result: Extensive experiments on HITSZ-VCM and BUPT datasets show significant performance gains over existing state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: DinoGRL effectively leverages DINOv2 priors to learn complementary gait features that enrich appearance cues, producing robust sequence-level representations for cross-modal video retrieval and achieving state-of-the-art results on benchmark datasets.

Abstract: Video-based Visible-Infrared person re-identification (VVI-ReID) aims to
retrieve the same pedestrian across visible and infrared modalities from video
sequences. Existing methods tend to exploit modality-invariant visual features
but largely overlook gait features, which are not only modality-invariant but
also rich in temporal dynamics, thus limiting their ability to model the
spatiotemporal consistency essential for cross-modal video matching. To address
these challenges, we propose a DINOv2-Driven Gait Representation Learning
(DinoGRL) framework that leverages the rich visual priors of DINOv2 to learn
gait features complementary to appearance cues, facilitating robust
sequence-level representations for cross-modal retrieval. Specifically, we
introduce a Semantic-Aware Silhouette and Gait Learning (SASGL) model, which
generates and enhances silhouette representations with general-purpose semantic
priors from DINOv2 and jointly optimizes them with the ReID objective to
achieve semantically enriched and task-adaptive gait feature learning.
Furthermore, we develop a Progressive Bidirectional Multi-Granularity
Enhancement (PBMGE) module, which progressively refines feature representations
by enabling bidirectional interactions between gait and appearance streams
across multiple spatial granularities, fully leveraging their complementarity
to enhance global representations with rich local details and produce highly
discriminative features. Extensive experiments on HITSZ-VCM and BUPT datasets
demonstrate the superiority of our approach, significantly outperforming
existing state-of-the-art methods.

*Shiwei Ren,Tianci Wen,Yongchun Fang,Biao Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FastGS introduces a densification and pruning strategy guided by multi-view consistency to regulate Gaussians during 3D Gaussian splatting training, eliminating budgeting and achieving substantial training speedups with rendering quality comparable to state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing dominant 3DGS methods (e.g., 3DGS) struggle to regulate the number of Gaussians during training, leading to unnecessary computational overhead and inefficiency.

Method: A densification and pruning framework driven by multi-view consistency that discards budget-driven control and dynamically adjusts Gaussian density during training to balance speed and quality.

Result: Significant training speedups reported: ~3.32x vs DashGaussian on Mip-NeRF 360, ~15.45x vs vanilla 3DGS on Deep Blending; 2-7x acceleration across various tasks; comparable rendering quality to baselines; demonstrated generality across dynamic, surface, sparse-view, large-scale reconstructions and SLAM.

Conclusion: FastGS is a simple, general acceleration framework for 3D Gaussian splatting that effectively trades off training time and rendering quality through multi-view-consistency-guided densification/pruning, showing strong speedups with broad applicability.

Abstract: The dominant 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) acceleration methods fail to
properly regulate the number of Gaussians during training, causing redundant
computational time overhead. In this paper, we propose FastGS, a novel, simple,
and general acceleration framework that fully considers the importance of each
Gaussian based on multi-view consistency, efficiently solving the trade-off
between training time and rendering quality. We innovatively design a
densification and pruning strategy based on multi-view consistency, dispensing
with the budgeting mechanism. Extensive experiments on Mip-NeRF 360, Tanks &
Temples, and Deep Blending datasets demonstrate that our method significantly
outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in training speed, achieving a
3.32$\times$ training acceleration and comparable rendering quality compared
with DashGaussian on the Mip-NeRF 360 dataset and a 15.45$\times$ acceleration
compared with vanilla 3DGS on the Deep Blending dataset. We demonstrate that
FastGS exhibits strong generality, delivering 2-7$\times$ training acceleration
across various tasks, including dynamic scene reconstruction, surface
reconstruction, sparse-view reconstruction, large-scale reconstruction, and
simultaneous localization and mapping. The project page is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A domain-specific, self-supervised pretrained vision model for herbicide trials yields better species identification, damage classification, and segmentation than general-purpose models, with strong generalization to unseen conditions and reduced annotation effort.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations of general-purpose vision models in agriculture where fine-grained, species- and damage-level discrimination is essential; reduce labeling burden during trials.

Method: Self-supervised pretraining on a large curated agricultural dataset to create a domain-specific model; evaluation on species ID, damage classification, and segmentation; test under unseen locations/times and domain shifts (e.g., drone imagery); annotation-efficiency analysis.

Result: Performance gains: species ID F1 0.91→0.94; damage 0.26→0.33; unseen: species 0.56→0.66; damage 0.17→0.27; drone: species 0.49→0.60. Segmentation improves particularly with few annotations. Under unseen conditions, 5.4 percentage-point higher F1 with 80% fewer labeled samples.

Conclusion: Domain-specific foundation models generalize across environments and tasks in herbicide trials and markedly reduce manual labeling, enabling scalable, automated analysis.

Abstract: Herbicide field trials require accurate identification of plant species and
assessment of herbicide-induced damage across diverse environments. While
general-purpose vision foundation models have shown promising results in
complex visual domains, their performance can be limited in agriculture, where
fine-grained distinctions between species and damage types are critical.
  In this work, we adapt a general-purpose vision foundation model to herbicide
trial characterization. Trained using a self-supervised learning approach on a
large, curated agricultural dataset, the model learns rich and transferable
representations optimized for herbicide trials images.
  Our domain-specific model significantly outperforms the best general-purpose
foundation model in both species identification (F1 score improvement from 0.91
to 0.94) and damage classification (from 0.26 to 0.33). Under unseen conditions
(new locations and other time), it achieves even greater gains (species
identification from 0.56 to 0.66; damage classification from 0.17 to 0.27). In
domain-shift scenarios, such as drone imagery, it maintains strong performance
(species classification from 0.49 to 0.60).
  Additionally, we show that domain-specific pretraining enhances segmentation
accuracy, particularly in low-annotation regimes. An annotation-efficiency
analysis reveals that, under unseen conditions, the domain-specific model
achieves 5.4% higher F1 score than the general-purpose model, while using 80%
fewer labeled samples.
  These results demonstrate the generalization capabilities of domain-specific
foundation models and their potential to significantly reduce manual annotation
efforts, offering a scalable and automated solution for herbicide trial
analysis.

### [38] [Deep learning-based object detection of offshore platforms on Sentinel-1 Imagery and the impact of synthetic training data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04304)
*Robin Spanier,Thorsten Hoeser,Claudia Kuenzer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A study shows synthetic data improves offshore infrastructure detection with YOLOv10 on Sentinel-1; region-holdout tests show generalization; F1 improves from 0.85 to 0.90; 3,529 platforms detected across three unseen regions; demonstrates synthetic data can balance datasets and enable global monitoring.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need robust, scalable global monitoring of offshore infrastructure; datasets are often unbalanced and scarce for certain shapes/sizes; synthetic data can help balance and improve transferability.

Method: Train YOLOv10 on a mix of synthetic and real Sentinel-1 imagery from Q4 2023 across Caspian Sea, South China Sea, Gulf of Guinea, Coast of Brazil; evaluate on three unseen regions (Gulf of Mexico, North Sea, Persian Gulf) using region-holdout; analyze impact of synthetic data on class representation; report F1 and detection counts.

Result: F1 score improved from 0.85 to 0.90 with synthetic data; total detections 3,529 across unseen regions (411 North Sea, 1,519 Gulf of Mexico, 1,593 Persian Gulf). Demonstrates generalization beyond training regions and improved balance.

Conclusion: Synthetic data generation is an effective strategy to balance remote-sensing datasets and enhance cross-region offshore infrastructure detection; supports scalable, globally transferable monitoring.

Abstract: The recent and ongoing expansion of marine infrastructure, including offshore
wind farms, oil and gas platforms, artificial islands, and aquaculture
facilities, highlights the need for effective monitoring systems. The
development of robust models for offshore infrastructure detection relies on
comprehensive, balanced datasets, but falls short when samples are scarce,
particularly for underrepresented object classes, shapes, and sizes. By
training deep learning-based YOLOv10 object detection models with a combination
of synthetic and real Sentinel-1 satellite imagery acquired in the fourth
quarter of 2023 from four regions (Caspian Sea, South China Sea, Gulf of
Guinea, and Coast of Brazil), this study investigates the use of synthetic
training data to enhance model performance. We evaluated this approach by
applying the model to detect offshore platforms in three unseen regions (Gulf
of Mexico, North Sea, Persian Gulf) and thereby assess geographic
transferability. This region-holdout evaluation demonstrated that the model
generalises beyond the training areas. In total, 3,529 offshore platforms were
detected, including 411 in the North Sea, 1,519 in the Gulf of Mexico, and
1,593 in the Persian Gulf. The model achieved an F1 score of 0.85, which
improved to 0.90 upon incorporating synthetic data. We analysed how synthetic
data enhances the representation of unbalanced classes and overall model
performance, taking a first step toward globally transferable detection of
offshore infrastructure. This study underscores the importance of balanced
datasets and highlights synthetic data generation as an effective strategy to
address common challenges in remote sensing, demonstrating the potential of
deep learning for scalable, global offshore infrastructure monitoring.

### [39] [RISE-T2V: Rephrasing and Injecting Semantics with LLM for Expansive Text-to-Video Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04317)
*Xiangjun Zhang,Litong Gong,Yinglin Zheng,Yansong Liu,Wentao Jiang,Mingyi Xu,Biao Wang,Tiezheng Ge,Ming Zeng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RISE-T2V unifies prompt rephrasing and semantic feature extraction for text-to-video diffusion, using a Rephrasing Adapter to condition video generation on LLM hidden states, improving quality and user-intent alignment across various LLMs and VDMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current T2V diffusion models rely on pre-trained text encoders and struggle with concise prompts, lacking online prompt rephrasing and scalable semantics, which limits video quality, usability, and adaptability.

Method: Introduce a Rephrasing Adapter that feeds LLM hidden states during next-token prediction as a conditioning signal for the video diffusion model. This integrates prompt rephrasing and semantic extraction into a single step and is designed to be universal across pre-trained LLMs and VDMs.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate that RISE-T2V enhances the ability of T2V models to generate high-quality videos that align with user intent; results are validated across multiple architectures, with visual results available online.

Conclusion: RISE-T2V provides a universal, single-step framework that leverages LLM-powered rephrasing and semantic extraction to expand and improve text-to-video capabilities, making T2V more scalable and user-aligned.

Abstract: Most text-to-video(T2V) diffusion models depend on pre-trained text encoders
for semantic alignment, yet they often fail to maintain video quality when
provided with concise prompts rather than well-designed ones. The primary issue
lies in their limited textual semantics understanding. Moreover, these text
encoders cannot rephrase prompts online to better align with user intentions,
which limits both the scalability and usability of the models, To address these
challenges, we introduce RISE-T2V, which uniquely integrates the processes of
prompt rephrasing and semantic feature extraction into a single and seamless
step instead of two separate steps. RISE-T2V is universal and can be applied to
various pre-trained LLMs and video diffusion models(VDMs), significantly
enhancing their capabilities for T2V tasks. We propose an innovative module
called the Rephrasing Adapter, enabling diffusion models to utilize text hidden
states during the next token prediction of the LLM as a condition for video
generation. By employing a Rephrasing Adapter, the video generation model can
implicitly rephrase basic prompts into more comprehensive representations that
better match the user's intent. Furthermore, we leverage the powerful
capabilities of LLMs to enable video generation models to accomplish a broader
range of T2V tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RISE-T2V is a
versatile framework applicable to different video diffusion model
architectures, significantly enhancing the ability of T2V models to generate
high-quality videos that align with user intent. Visual results are available

### [40] [Submanifold Sparse Convolutional Networks for Automated 3D Segmentation of Kidneys and Kidney Tumours in Computed Tomography](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04334)
*Saúl Alonso-Monsalve,Leigh H. Whitehead,Adam Aurisano,Lorena Escudero Sanchez*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Two-stage voxel sparsification with submanifold sparse convolutions enables high-resolution 3D tumor segmentation with reduced compute, achieving competitive accuracy on KiTS23 and substantial memory/time savings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D CT tumor segmentation is accurate but computationally expensive due to large voxel counts; downsampling and patch-based methods degrade performance, hindering routine clinical use.

Method: A two-stage approach: voxel sparsification to reduce computations while preserving high-resolution inputs, followed by submanifold sparse convolutional networks operating on sparse 3D voxel grids. Applied to KiTS23 CT scans for renal tumors, comparing against dense baselines.

Result: Dice scores: kidneys+masses 95.8%; tumours+cysts 85.7%; tumours 80.3%. Inference time reduced by up to 60%; VRAM usage reduced by up to 75% compared with an equivalent dense architecture; performance competitive with challenge winners across CPU and GPUs.

Conclusion: The method enables high-resolution 3D tumor segmentation with substantially lower resource demands, enhancing the practicality of quantitative 3D analyses in clinical workflows and showing scalability across hardware and datasets.

Abstract: The accurate delineation of tumours in radiological images like Computed
Tomography is a very specialised and time-consuming task, and currently a
bottleneck preventing quantitative analyses to be performed routinely in the
clinical setting. For this reason, developing methods for the automated
segmentation of tumours in medical imaging is of the utmost importance and has
driven significant efforts in recent years. However, challenges regarding the
impracticality of 3D scans, given the large amount of voxels to be analysed,
usually requires the downsampling of such images or using patches thereof when
applying traditional convolutional neural networks. To overcome this problem,
in this paper we propose a new methodology that uses, divided into two stages,
voxel sparsification and submanifold sparse convolutional networks. This method
allows segmentations to be performed with high-resolution inputs and a native
3D model architecture, obtaining state-of-the-art accuracies while
significantly reducing the computational resources needed in terms of GPU
memory and time. We studied the deployment of this methodology in the context
of Computed Tomography images of renal cancer patients from the KiTS23
challenge, and our method achieved results competitive with the challenge
winners, with Dice similarity coefficients of 95.8% for kidneys + masses, 85.7%
for tumours + cysts, and 80.3% for tumours alone. Crucially, our method also
offers significant computational improvements, achieving up to a 60% reduction
in inference time and up to a 75\% reduction in VRAM usage compared to an
equivalent dense architecture, across both CPU and various GPU cards tested.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Nine CNN architectures were evaluated for binary horse vs motorcycle detection in VOC 2008, addressing class imbalance via minority-class augmentation. ConvNeXt-Tiny achieved the best AP (95.53% for horses, 89.12% for motorcycles); augmentation improves minority-class detection, especially for deeper models; study informs architecture choice under imbalance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tackle severe class imbalance in binary object detection and compare modern architectures on a standard dataset to understand how architecture and augmentation affect performance.

Method: Evaluate nine architectures (including ResNet-50, ConvNeXt-Tiny, DenseNet-121, Vision Transformer) on VOC 2008 horse/motorcycle, employing minority-class augmentation techniques; measure performance with AP and other metrics across classes.

Result: ConvNeXt-Tiny achieved highest APs (horse 95.53%, motorcycle 89.12%); data augmentation improves minority-class detection; deeper architectures gain more from augmentation; performance varies across architectures.

Conclusion: Provides guidance on selecting architectures for imbalanced binary classification in object detection and quantifies the impact of data augmentation strategies to mitigate class imbalance.

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of nine convolutional neural
network architectures for binary classification of horses and motorcycles in
the VOC 2008 dataset. We address the significant class imbalance problem by
implementing minority-class augmentation techniques. Our experiments compare
modern architectures including ResNet-50, ConvNeXt-Tiny, DenseNet-121, and
Vision Transformer across multiple performance metrics. Results demonstrate
substantial performance variations, with ConvNeXt-Tiny achieving the highest
Average Precision (AP) of 95.53% for horse detection and 89.12% for motorcycle
detection. We observe that data augmentation significantly improves minority
class detection, particularly benefiting deeper architectures. This study
provides insights into architecture selection for imbalanced binary
classification tasks and quantifies the impact of data augmentation strategies
in mitigating class imbalance issues in object detection.

### [42] [Evaluating the Impact of Weather-Induced Sensor Occlusion on BEVFusion for 3D Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04347)
*Sanjay Kumar,Tim Brophy,Eoin Martino Grua,Ganesh Sistu,Valentina Donzella,Ciaran Eising*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Occlusions affect BEVFusion differently by sensor: camera occlusion heavily hurts camera-only detection but barely harms fused results, while LiDAR occlusion severely degrades LiDAR-only and fused performance, highlighting LiDAR's primary role and the need for occlusion-aware fusion methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understand how environmental occlusions (fog, haze, obstructions) impact 3D object detection using BEV-based fusion, given prior work focused on accuracy but not occlusion robustness.

Method: Evaluate BEVFusion on the nuScenes dataset with simulated occlusions on camera and LiDAR outputs. Measure detection via mAP (and NDS) for camera-only, LiDAR-only, and fused configurations, analyzing short- vs. long-range performance.

Result: Camera-only: moderate occlusion drops mAP from 35.6% to 20.9% (−41.3%). LiDAR-only: heavy occlusion drops mAP from 64.7% to 34.1% (−47.3%), especially at long range. Fused: occluding the camera yields a small mAP drop from 68.5% to 65.7% (−4.1%), while occluding LiDAR causes a larger drop to 50.1% (−26.8%), indicating greater reliance on LiDAR for 3D detection.

Conclusion: There is a need for occlusion-aware evaluation and more robust sensor fusion techniques to preserve detection accuracy under partial sensor failure due to adverse conditions.

Abstract: Accurate 3D object detection is essential for automated vehicles to navigate
safely in complex real-world environments. Bird's Eye View (BEV)
representations, which project multi-sensor data into a top-down spatial
format, have emerged as a powerful approach for robust perception. Although
BEV-based fusion architectures have demonstrated strong performance through
multimodal integration, the effects of sensor occlusions, caused by
environmental conditions such as fog, haze, or physical obstructions, on 3D
detection accuracy remain underexplored. In this work, we investigate the
impact of occlusions on both camera and Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR)
outputs using the BEVFusion architecture, evaluated on the nuScenes dataset.
Detection performance is measured using mean Average Precision (mAP) and the
nuScenes Detection Score (NDS). Our results show that moderate camera
occlusions lead to a 41.3% drop in mAP (from 35.6% to 20.9%) when detection is
based only on the camera. On the other hand, LiDAR sharply drops in performance
only under heavy occlusion, with mAP falling by 47.3% (from 64.7% to 34.1%),
with a severe impact on long-range detection. In fused settings, the effect
depends on which sensor is occluded: occluding the camera leads to a minor 4.1%
drop (from 68.5% to 65.7%), while occluding LiDAR results in a larger 26.8%
drop (to 50.1%), revealing the model's stronger reliance on LiDAR for the task
of 3D object detection. Our results highlight the need for future research into
occlusion-aware evaluation methods and improved sensor fusion techniques that
can maintain detection accuracy in the presence of partial sensor failure or
degradation due to adverse environmental conditions.

*Puneet Mishra,Martijntje Vollebregt,Yizhou Ma,Maria Font-i-Furnols*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Step-by-step tutorial showing how to use open-source deep learning models to extract spatial features from imaging data in analytical chemistry, focusing on feature extraction rather than model training, with MATLAB code demos to integrate imaging with spectral data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Analytical chemists struggle to exploit rich imaging information due to a lack of guided, actionable workflows for deep learning; existing chemometrics may miss multiscale features; need accessible methods to combine imaging-derived features with spectral information.

Method: Provide a structured, step-by-step workflow using pre-trained open-source models to extract deep features from imaging data; integrate with spectral data; MATLAB-based tutorials and code; applicable to diverse imaging modalities; readers run tutorials on their own datasets.

Result: A practical, reproducible workflow and MATLAB demonstrations for obtaining deep features from imaging data and fusing with spectral information; enables non-expert users to leverage deep learning in analytical imaging without training models.

Conclusion: The tutorial lowers barriers to adopting deep learning in analytical chemistry by offering clear guidance and runnable MATLAB code, enabling broader use of imaging-derived features for exploratory and predictive analyses.

Abstract: Background In analytical chemistry, spatial information about materials is
commonly captured through imaging techniques, such as traditional color cameras
or with advanced hyperspectral cameras and microscopes. However, efficiently
extracting and analyzing this spatial information for exploratory and
predictive purposes remains a challenge, especially when using traditional
chemometric methods. Recent advances in deep learning and artificial
intelligence have significantly enhanced image processing capabilities,
enabling the extraction of multiscale deep features that are otherwise
challenging to capture with conventional image processing techniques. Despite
the wide availability of open-source deep learning models, adoption in
analytical chemistry remains limited because of the absence of structured,
step-by-step guidance for implementing these models.
  Results This tutorial aims to bridge this gap by providing a step-by-step
guide for applying deep learning approaches to extract spatial information from
imaging data and integrating it with other data sources, such as spectral
information. Importantly, the focus of this work is not on training deep
learning models for image processing but on using existing open source models
to extract deep features from imaging data.
  Significance The tutorial provides MATLAB code tutorial demonstrations,
showcasing the processing of imaging data from various imaging modalities
commonly encountered in analytical chemistry. Readers must run the tutorial
steps on their own datasets using the codes presented in this tutorial.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A multi-task VQA framework using LoRA-tuned Florence-2 for medical VQA, explanation generation, and visual grounding. It combines Kvasir-VQA-x1, synthetic explanations, and text-to-region data to jointly learn grounding, reasoning, and interpretation, yielding improved accuracy and localization over single-task baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical VQA requires accurate, interpretable answers and grounded visual reasoning. Existing approaches often train tasks separately and lack integrated explanations or localization. A grounded, multi-task approach can leverage shared representations to improve performance and trustworthiness in data-scarce medical domains.

Method: Fine-tune Florence-2 with LoRA for a multi-task setup that jointly handles: (1) VQA on Kvasir-VQA-x1, (2) generation of structured medical explanations from a synthetic reasoning dataset, and (3) text-to-region supervision linking visual features to segmentation masks. Training uses a combined objective that aligns QA accuracy, explanation quality, and grounding precision, enabling end-to-end learning of grounding, reasoning, and interpretation.

Result: Extensive evaluation shows substantial improvements over single-task baselines in both answer accuracy and visual localization, demonstrating the effectiveness of grounded multi-task learning for medical VQA.

Conclusion: Grounded multi-task learning with LoRA-tuned large visual-language models is effective for medical VQA, yielding accurate and interpretable responses while improving visual grounding. This approach highlights the value of integrating QA, explanation, and grounding datasets for medical AI applications.

Abstract: We present a multi-task framework for the MediaEval Medico 2025 challenge,
leveraging a LoRA-tuned Florence-2 model for simultaneous visual question
answering (VQA), explanation generation, and visual grounding. The proposed
system integrates three curated datasets: (1) Kvasir-VQA-x1 for question-answer
learning, (2) a synthetically enriched explanation dataset offering structured
medical reasoning, and (3) text-to-region pairs linking visual features with
segmentation masks. This multi-task setup enables the model to jointly learn
visual grounding, reasoning, and interpretation, producing responses that are
both accurate and interpretable. Extensive evaluation demonstrates that our
approach substantially improves over single-task baselines in both answer
accuracy and visual localization, highlighting the effectiveness of grounded
multi-task learning for medical VQA applications.

### [46] [HideAndSeg: an AI-based tool with automated prompting for octopus segmentation in natural habitats](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04426)
*Alan de Aguiar,Michaella Pereira Andrade,Charles Morphy D. Santos,João Paulo Gois*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes HideAndSeg, a minimally supervised pipeline that fuses SAM2 and YOLOv11 to segment octopuses in challenging underwater videos, using unsupervised temporal Dice and component-count metrics to operate without ground-truth and handle occlusions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome challenges in analyzing wild octopuses (camouflage, rapid skin changes, non-rigid deformations, occlusions) and the lack of large annotated datasets for underwater biology, enabling scalable behavioral studies.

Method: A two-stage approach: (1) user-supplied points generate initial masks with SAM2 to train a YOLOv11 detector; (2) bounding box prompts to SAM2 automate mask generation, yielding a fully automatic pipeline. Two unsupervised metrics, temporal consistency (DICE_t) and new component count (NC_t), guide mask refinement in the absence of ground-truth.

Result: HideAndSeg achieves satisfactory segmentation performance, reduces noise compared to the manual-prompted setup, and can re-identify and segment octopuses after complete occlusions in natural environments.

Conclusion: The approach provides a practical, semi- to fully-automated tool for wild octopus segmentation, reducing manual analysis and establishing a baseline for this challenging task, with potential applicability to other elusive marine organisms.

Abstract: Analyzing octopuses in their natural habitats is challenging due to their
camouflage capability, rapid changes in skin texture and color, non-rigid body
deformations, and frequent occlusions, all of which are compounded by variable
underwater lighting and turbidity. Addressing the lack of large-scale annotated
datasets, this paper introduces HideAndSeg, a novel, minimally supervised
AI-based tool for segmenting videos of octopuses. It establishes a quantitative
baseline for this task. HideAndSeg integrates SAM2 with a custom-trained
YOLOv11 object detector. First, the user provides point coordinates to generate
the initial segmentation masks with SAM2. These masks serve as training data
for the YOLO model. After that, our approach fully automates the pipeline by
providing a bounding box prompt to SAM2, eliminating the need for further
manual intervention. We introduce two unsupervised metrics - temporal
consistency $DICE_t$ and new component count $NC_t$ - to quantitatively
evaluate segmentation quality and guide mask refinement in the absence of
ground-truth data, i.e., real-world information that serves to train, validate,
and test AI models. Results show that HideAndSeg achieves satisfactory
performance, reducing segmentation noise compared to the manually prompted
approach. Our method can re-identify and segment the octopus even after periods
of complete occlusion in natural environments, a scenario in which the manually
prompted model fails. By reducing the need for manual analysis in real-world
scenarios, this work provides a practical tool that paves the way for more
efficient behavioral studies of wild cephalopods.

*Yaniv Ohayon,Ofir Itzhak Shahar,Ohad Ben-Shahar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduces a greedy solver for convex-partition jigsaw puzzles (convex polygons), extending beyond square puzzles, and presents the first benchmark dataset with performance metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Jigsaw solving is intractable and current solvers mainly address square puzzles; there is a need to support convex polygon partitions to broaden applicability and provide a standard benchmark.

Method: Proposes a greedy algorithm that uses both geometrical (shape/edge compatibility) and pictorial (image-content similarity) cues to assemble pieces; evaluates on a newly introduced benchmark dataset for convex-partition puzzles.

Result: Presentes performance measures on the first benchmark dataset for convex-partition puzzles; demonstrates feasibility of the greedy solver and establishes baselines for this broader class of puzzles.

Conclusion: Extends computational jigsaw solving to convex partitions, providing a benchmark and establishing a baseline methodology; invites future work to improve robustness and to explore other algorithmic strategies.

Abstract: Jigsaw puzzle solving requires the rearrangement of unordered pieces into
their original pose in order to reconstruct a coherent whole, often an image,
and is known to be an intractable problem. While the possible impact of
automatic puzzle solvers can be disruptive in various application domains, most
of the literature has focused on developing solvers for square jigsaw puzzles,
severely limiting their practical use. In this work, we significantly expand
the types of puzzles handled computationally, focusing on what is known as
Convex Partitions, a major subset of polygonal puzzles whose pieces are convex.
We utilize both geometrical and pictorial compatibilities, introduce a greedy
solver, and report several performance measures next to the first benchmark
dataset of such puzzles.

TL;DR: V-Thinker is a vision-centric interactive reasoning framework for large multimodal models, featuring a Data Evolution Flywheel to synthesize reasoning datasets and a Visual Progressive Training Curriculum with two-stage RL; plus VTBench benchmark; it outperforms baselines in general and interactive reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the gap in image-interactive long-horizon reasoning by expanding visual tool spaces and reducing task-specific design constraints in LMMs.

Method: 1) Data Evolution Flywheel to automatically synthesize/evolve/verify interactive reasoning datasets across diversity, quality, difficulty; 2) Visual Progressive Training Curriculum aligning perception with point-level supervision, followed by two-stage reinforcement learning for interactive reasoning; 3) VTBench as expert-verified benchmark; extensive experiments.

Result: V-Thinker consistently outperforms strong LMM baselines in both general and interactive reasoning scenarios across tasks; provides insights for image-interactive reasoning applications.

Conclusion: This work advances image-interactive reasoning in LMMs by offering a general framework and a benchmark, enabling more capable, interactive, vision-centric reasoning.

Abstract: Empowering Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) to deeply integrate image
interaction with long-horizon reasoning capabilities remains a long-standing
challenge in this field. Recent advances in vision-centric reasoning explore a
promising "Thinking with Images" paradigm for LMMs, marking a shift from
image-assisted reasoning to image-interactive thinking. While this milestone
enables models to focus on fine-grained image regions, progress remains
constrained by limited visual tool spaces and task-specific workflow designs.
To bridge this gap, we present V-Thinker, a general-purpose multimodal
reasoning assistant that enables interactive, vision-centric thinking through
end-to-end reinforcement learning. V-Thinker comprises two key components: (1)
a Data Evolution Flywheel that automatically synthesizes, evolves, and verifies
interactive reasoning datasets across three dimensions-diversity, quality, and
difficulty; and (2) a Visual Progressive Training Curriculum that first aligns
perception via point-level supervision, then integrates interactive reasoning
through a two-stage reinforcement learning framework. Furthermore, we introduce
VTBench, an expert-verified benchmark targeting vision-centric interactive
reasoning tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that V-Thinker consistently
outperforms strong LMM-based baselines in both general and interactive
reasoning scenarios, providing valuable insights for advancing
image-interactive reasoning applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GeoFMs with a three-axis sensor-label-domain framework (Prithvi-EO-2.0) improve landslide mapping across sensors and regions with limited labels; outperform CNNs, ViTs, and other GeoFMs; but face high compute costs and data availability challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome cross-sensor transferability and data scarcity in landslide mapping by leveraging geospatial foundation models with a three-axis adaptation framework.

Method: Proposes a three-axis analytical framework (sensor, label, domain) for adapting GeoFMs; built on global pretraining, self-supervision, and adaptable fine-tuning; evaluates on landslide mapping using Prithvi-EO-2.0; compares against task-specific CNNs (U-Net, U-Net++), vision transformers (Segformer, SwinV2-B), and other GeoFMs (TerraMind, SatMAE).

Result: GeoFMs consistently outperform baselines; robust to spectral variation; maintain accuracy under label scarcity; generalize more reliably across diverse datasets and geographic settings.

Conclusion: GeoFMs are a promising step toward robust and scalable landslide risk reduction and environmental monitoring, though computational cost and limited availability of reusable AI-ready training data for landslide research remain key challenges.

Abstract: Landslides cause severe damage to lives, infrastructure, and the environment,
making accurate and timely mapping essential for disaster preparedness and
response. However, conventional deep learning models often struggle when
applied across different sensors, regions, or under conditions of limited
training data. To address these challenges, we present a three-axis analytical
framework of sensor, label, and domain for adapting geospatial foundation
models (GeoFMs), focusing on Prithvi-EO-2.0 for landslide mapping. Through a
series of experiments, we show that it consistently outperforms task-specific
CNNs (U-Net, U-Net++), vision transformers (Segformer, SwinV2-B), and other
GeoFMs (TerraMind, SatMAE). The model, built on global pretraining,
self-supervision, and adaptable fine-tuning, proved resilient to spectral
variation, maintained accuracy under label scarcity, and generalized more
reliably across diverse datasets and geographic settings. Alongside these
strengths, we also highlight remaining challenges such as computational cost
and the limited availability of reusable AI-ready training data for landslide

### [50] [THEval. Evaluation Framework for Talking Head Video Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04520)
*Nabyl Quignon,Baptiste Chopin,Yaohui Wang,Antitza Dantcheva*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes an 8-metric evaluation framework for talking head video generation organized around quality, naturalness, and synchronization; emphasizes efficiency and alignment with human preferences; analyzes fine-grained facial dynamics and face quality on a bias-mitigated real dataset; shows lip synchronization is strong but expressiveness and artifact-free detail lag across 17 SOTA models (85k videos); aims to publish open benchmarks and leaderboards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Evaluation of talking head generation is lagging behind generation quality. Existing metrics are limited and may not align with human preferences or be efficient for large-scale benchmarking; a comprehensive, efficient, and human-aligned framework is needed to guide progress.

Method: Define eight metrics spanning three dimensions (quality, naturalness, synchronization); perform fine-grained analysis of head, mouth, eyebrows, and overall face quality; conduct large-scale experiments (85,000 videos) across 17 state-of-the-art models on a real, bias-mitigated dataset; publish a benchmark with open-source code and leaderboards.

Result: Found that many models excel at lip synchronization but struggle with expressiveness and artifact-free details; validates the need for additional metrics capturing fine-grained dynamics and quality aspects; dataset designed to mitigate training data bias; results underpin ongoing evaluation framework.

Conclusion: The proposed benchmark offers a scalable, human-aligned, and open framework to evaluate and drive improvements in talking head generation, with plans to release code, dataset, and leaderboards to reflect progress.

Abstract: Video generation has achieved remarkable progress, with generated videos
increasingly resembling real ones. However, the rapid advance in generation has
outpaced the development of adequate evaluation metrics. Currently, the
assessment of talking head generation primarily relies on limited metrics,
evaluating general video quality, lip synchronization, and on conducting user
studies. Motivated by this, we propose a new evaluation framework comprising 8
metrics related to three dimensions (i) quality, (ii) naturalness, and (iii)
synchronization. In selecting the metrics, we place emphasis on efficiency, as
well as alignment with human preferences. Based on this considerations, we
streamline to analyze fine-grained dynamics of head, mouth, and eyebrows, as
well as face quality. Our extensive experiments on 85,000 videos generated by
17 state-of-the-art models suggest that while many algorithms excel in lip
synchronization, they face challenges with generating expressiveness and
artifact-free details. These videos were generated based on a novel real
dataset, that we have curated, in order to mitigate bias of training data. Our
proposed benchmark framework is aimed at evaluating the improvement of
generative methods. Original code, dataset and leaderboards will be publicly
released and regularly updated with new methods, in order to reflect progress
in the field.

*Dimitrios Anastasiou,Santiago Barbarisi,Lucy Culshaw,Jayna Patel,Evangelos B. Mazomenos,Imanol Luengo,Danail Stoyanov*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: STC-Net enables automated surgical complexity estimation in laparoscopic cholecystectomy from full videos using weakly supervised, single-timestamp-based localization and PGS grading; achieves ~62% accuracy and F1 on 1,859 videos, surpassing non-localized baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automate PGS-based inflammation/complexity assessment without manual video curation; address limitations of prior methods that rely on static frames or trimmed clips; improve post-op analysis and training.

Method: SingleTimestamp-based Complexity (STC-Net) framework with localization, window proposal, grading; operates on full videos; uses a novel loss merging hard/soft localization objectives and background-aware grading; weak temporal supervision.

Result: On 1,859 private LC videos, accuracy 62.11%, F1 61.42%, >10% improvement over non-localized baselines.

Conclusion: STC-Net provides scalable, effective automated PGS-based surgical complexity estimation from full LC videos; useful for post-operative analysis and training.

Abstract: Purpose: Accurate assessment of surgical complexity is essential in
Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy (LC), where severe inflammation is associated with
longer operative times and increased risk of postoperative complications. The
Parkland Grading Scale (PGS) provides a clinically validated framework for
stratifying inflammation severity; however, its automation in surgical videos
remains largely unexplored, particularly in realistic scenarios where complete
videos must be analyzed without prior manual curation. Methods: In this work,
we introduce STC-Net, a novel framework for SingleTimestamp-based Complexity
estimation in LC via the PGS, designed to operate under weak temporal
supervision. Unlike prior methods limited to static images or manually trimmed
clips, STC-Net operates directly on full videos. It jointly performs temporal
localization and grading through a localization, window proposal, and grading
module. We introduce a novel loss formulation combining hard and soft
localization objectives and background-aware grading supervision. Results:
Evaluated on a private dataset of 1,859 LC videos, STC-Net achieves an accuracy
of 62.11% and an F1-score of 61.42%, outperforming non-localized baselines by
over 10% in both metrics and highlighting the effectiveness of weak supervision
for surgical complexity assessment. Conclusion: STC-Net demonstrates a scalable
and effective approach for automated PGS-based surgical complexity estimation
from full LC videos, making it promising for post-operative analysis and
surgical training.

### [52] [Thinking with Video: Video Generation as a Promising Multimodal Reasoning Paradigm](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04570)
*Jingqi Tong,Yurong Mou,Hangcheng Li,Mingzhe Li,Yongzhuo Yang,Ming Zhang,Qiguang Chen,Tianyi Liang,Xiaomeng Hu,Yining Zheng,Xinchi Chen,Jun Zhao,Xuanjing Huang,Xipeng Qiu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduces Thinking with Video using video generation models (Sora-2) to unify vision-and-text reasoning in a temporal framework; presents VideoThinkBench with vision-centric and text-centric tasks; shows competitive performance to SOTA VLMs and strong results on math/text tasks, with self-consistency and in-context learning helping; posits video generation as a potential unified multimodal reasoning paradigm.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations of existing paradigms (Thinking with Text/Images) that fail to capture dynamic processes and rely on separate text and vision modalities; a unified, temporal video-based reasoning framework could bridge reasoning across modalities.

Method: Developed VideoThinkBench with two task categories (vision-centric: Eyeballing Puzzles; text-centric: GSM8K, MMMU subsets). Leveraged video generation model Sora-2 to perform multimodal reasoning, evaluated against state-of-the-art VLMs and on math/text benchmarks; analyzed sources of abilities and role of self-consistency and in-context learning.

Result: Sora-2 is generally competitive with SOTA VLMs on vision-centric tasks and even surpasses some (e.g., Eyeballing Games). On text-centric tasks, Sora-2 achieves 92% on MATH and 75.53% on MMMU. Self-consistency and in-context learning improve performance. The work suggests video generation models can serve as unified multimodal understanding and generation models.

Conclusion: Video thinking demonstrates potential as a unified multimodal reasoning paradigm, bridging visual and textual reasoning within a temporal framework and offering a path toward unified multimodal understanding and generation.

Abstract: "Thinking with Text" and "Thinking with Images" paradigm significantly
improve the reasoning ability of large language models (LLMs) and Vision
Language Models (VLMs). However, these paradigms have inherent limitations. (1)
Images capture only single moments and fail to represent dynamic processes or
continuous changes, and (2) The separation of text and vision as distinct
modalities, hindering unified multimodal understanding and generation. To
overcome these limitations, we introduce "Thinking with Video", a new paradigm
that leverages video generation models, such as Sora-2, to bridge visual and
textual reasoning in a unified temporal framework. To support this exploration,
we developed the Video Thinking Benchmark (VideoThinkBench). VideoThinkBench
encompasses two task categories: (1) vision-centric tasks (e.g., Eyeballing
Puzzles), and (2) text-centric tasks (e.g., subsets of GSM8K, MMMU). Our
evaluation establishes Sora-2 as a capable reasoner. On vision-centric tasks,
Sora-2 is generally comparable to state-of-the-art (SOTA) VLMs, and even
surpasses VLMs on several tasks, such as Eyeballing Games. On text-centric
tasks, Sora-2 achieves 92% accuracy on MATH, and 75.53% accuracy on MMMU.
Furthermore, we systematically analyse the source of these abilities. We also
find that self-consistency and in-context learning can improve Sora-2's
performance. In summary, our findings demonstrate that the video generation
model is the potential unified multimodal understanding and generation model,
positions "thinking with video" as a unified multimodal reasoning paradigm.

*Chen Shi,Shaoshuai Shi,Xiaoyang Lyu,Chunyang Liu,Kehua Sheng,Bo Zhang,Li Jiang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UniSplat is a feed-forward 3D reconstruction framework that uses a 3D latent scaffold and unified spatio-temporal fusion to produce robust dynamic scene reconstructions and out-of-view novel-view synthesis, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the challenges of sparse, non-overlapping camera views and dynamic scenes in autonomous driving, and to enable streaming, complete scene reconstruction beyond current camera coverage.

Method: Build a 3D latent scaffold that encodes geometric and semantic context via pretrained foundation models. Perform efficient fusion directly in the 3D scaffold to align information across views and time. Use a dual-branch decoder to generate dynamic-aware Gaussians by combining point-anchored refinement with voxel-based generation, while maintaining a persistent memory of static Gaussians for streaming scene completion beyond camera coverage.

Result: Experiments on real-world datasets show state-of-the-art performance in novel view synthesis and robust, high-quality renderings even for viewpoints outside the original camera coverage.

Conclusion: UniSplat provides a general, robust, and streaming-capable solution for dynamic 3D scene reconstruction in autonomous driving, with strong novelty in the 3D-scaffold fusion and Gaussian-based decoding.

Abstract: Feed-forward 3D reconstruction for autonomous driving has advanced rapidly,
yet existing methods struggle with the joint challenges of sparse,
non-overlapping camera views and complex scene dynamics. We present UniSplat, a
general feed-forward framework that learns robust dynamic scene reconstruction
through unified latent spatio-temporal fusion. UniSplat constructs a 3D latent
scaffold, a structured representation that captures geometric and semantic
scene context by leveraging pretrained foundation models. To effectively
integrate information across spatial views and temporal frames, we introduce an
efficient fusion mechanism that operates directly within the 3D scaffold,
enabling consistent spatio-temporal alignment. To ensure complete and detailed
reconstructions, we design a dual-branch decoder that generates dynamic-aware
Gaussians from the fused scaffold by combining point-anchored refinement with
voxel-based generation, and maintain a persistent memory of static Gaussians to
enable streaming scene completion beyond current camera coverage. Extensive
experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that UniSplat achieves
state-of-the-art performance in novel view synthesis, while providing robust
and high-quality renderings even for viewpoints outside the original camera
coverage.

### [54] [PixCLIP: Achieving Fine-grained Visual Language Understanding via Any-granularity Pixel-Text Alignment Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04601)
*Yicheng Xiao,Yu Chen,Haoxuan Ma,Jiale Hong,Caorui Li,Lingxiang Wu,Haiyun Guo,Jinqiao Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PixCLIP integrates visual prompts and long-form text for fine-grained image-text alignment by building a pixel-level, long-form description pipeline and a large LongGRIT dataset (~1.5M samples), replacing CLIP's text encoder with an LLM and using a three-branch alignment framework to match image regions with descriptions at arbitrary granularity, achieving state-of-the-art results in pixel-level interaction and long-text handling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP excels broadly but struggles with fine-grained alignment due to limited textual granularity and a token-length constraint in its text encoder. There is a need to jointly enhance visual processing granularity (via prompts) and textual processing granularity (via long, detailed descriptions, enabled by LLMs) to improve fine-grained vision-language alignment.

Method: (1) Develop an automated annotation pipeline to generate pixel-level localized, long-form textual descriptions for images. (2) Build LongGRIT, a high-quality dataset with ~1.5 million samples. (3) Replace CLIP’s original text encoder with a Large Language Model. (4) Propose a three-branch pixel-text alignment learning framework to align image regions with corresponding textual descriptions at arbitrary granularity.

Result: PixCLIP demonstrates breakthroughs in pixel-level interaction and handling long-form texts, achieving state-of-the-art performance on tasks requiring fine-grained image-text alignment and long textual descriptions.

Conclusion: Jointly increasing the granularity of both visual and textual content processing can significantly improve fine-grained vision-language alignment. PixCLIP validates the effectiveness of combining visual prompts, long-form text descriptions, and LLM-based text encoding for pixel-level alignment across arbitrary granularity.

Abstract: While the Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining(CLIP) model has achieved
remarkable success in a variety of downstream vison language understanding
tasks, enhancing its capability for fine-grained image-text alignment remains
an active research focus. To this end, most existing works adopt the strategy
of explicitly increasing the granularity of visual information processing,
e.g., incorporating visual prompts to guide the model focus on specific local
regions within the image. Meanwhile, researches on Multimodal Large Language
Models(MLLMs) have demonstrated that training with long and detailed textual
descriptions can effectively improve the model's fine-grained vision-language
alignment. However, the inherent token length limitation of CLIP's text encoder
fundamentally limits CLIP to process more granular textual information embedded
in long text sequences. To synergistically leverage the advantages of enhancing
both visual and textual content processing granularity, we propose PixCLIP, a
novel framework designed to concurrently accommodate visual prompt inputs and
process lengthy textual descriptions. Specifically, we first establish an
automated annotation pipeline capable of generating pixel-level localized,
long-form textual descriptions for images. Utilizing this pipeline, we
construct LongGRIT, a high-quality dataset comprising nearly 1.5 million
samples. Secondly, we replace CLIP's original text encoder with the LLM and
propose a three-branch pixel-text alignment learning framework, facilitating
fine-grained alignment between image regions and corresponding textual
descriptions at arbitrary granularity. Experiments demonstrate that PixCLIP
showcases breakthroughs in pixel-level interaction and handling long-form
texts, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

*Tushar Kataria,Shikha Dubey,Mary Bronner,Jolanta Jedrzkiewicz,Ben J. Brintz,Shireen Y. Elhabian,Beatrice S. Knudsen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: An accuracy-grounded evaluation framework for virtual IHC across 16 models, using color deconvolution to produce real vs. virtual IHC masks and computing pixel-level staining metrics. Conventional image fidelity metrics poorly reflect staining accuracy; paired models (PyramidPix2Pix, AdaptiveNCE) excel in stain accuracy; unpaired diffusion/GAN models are less reliable; whole-slide imaging reveals performance gaps unseen in patches, enabling reproducible clinical-ready benchmarking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluation metrics focus on texture/distribution fidelity (FID, PSNR, SSIM) and do not quantify the correctness of IHC staining. There is a need for automated, annotation-free, stain-level accuracy metrics to reliably assess virtual IHC quality and accelerate clinical translation.

Method: Apply color deconvolution to generate brown (IHC-positive) masks from real and virtual IHC. Compute pixel-level accuracy metrics (Dice, IoU, Hausdorff distance) between real and virtual masks across sixteen paired/unpaired image-translation models. Compare against conventional fidelity metrics (FID, PSNR, SSIM). Evaluate both patch-level and whole-slide images (WSI) to reveal performance differences. Identify models with higher stain accuracy (e.g., PyramidPix2Pix, AdaptiveNCE) and note limitations of unpaired diffusion/GAN-based models.

Result: Conventional fidelity metrics correlate poorly with stain accuracy and pathologist assessment. Paired models like PyramidPix2Pix and AdaptiveNCE achieve the highest stain accuracy; unpaired diffusion- and GAN-based models underperform in producing accurate IHC-positive pixel labels. WSIs reveal performance declines not evident in patch-level evaluations, underscoring the need for WSI-level benchmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed framework provides a reproducible, accuracy-grounded benchmark for assessing virtual IHC quality, a critical step toward reliable clinical translation and routine pathologist use.

Abstract: Deep learning models can generate virtual immunohistochemistry (IHC) stains
from hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) images, offering a scalable and low-cost
alternative to laboratory IHC. However, reliable evaluation of image quality
remains a challenge as current texture- and distribution-based metrics quantify
image fidelity rather than the accuracy of IHC staining. Here, we introduce an
automated and accuracy grounded framework to determine image quality across
sixteen paired or unpaired image translation models. Using color deconvolution,
we generate masks of pixels stained brown (i.e., IHC-positive) as predicted by
each virtual IHC model. We use the segmented masks of real and virtual IHC to
compute stain accuracy metrics (Dice, IoU, Hausdorff distance) that directly
quantify correct pixel - level labeling without needing expert manual
annotations. Our results demonstrate that conventional image fidelity metrics,
including Frechet Inception Distance (FID), peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR),
and structural similarity (SSIM), correlate poorly with stain accuracy and
pathologist assessment. Paired models such as PyramidPix2Pix and AdaptiveNCE
achieve the highest stain accuracy, whereas unpaired diffusion- and GAN-based
models are less reliable in providing accurate IHC positive pixel labels.
Moreover, whole-slide images (WSI) reveal performance declines that are
invisible in patch-based evaluations, emphasizing the need for WSI-level
benchmarks. Together, this framework defines a reproducible approach for
assessing the quality of virtual IHC models, a critical step to accelerate
translation towards routine use by pathologists.

*Kylie Cancilla,Alexander Moore,Amar Saini,Carmen Carrano*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A streaming, no-reference, opinion-unaware VQA model predicting FR-like metrics from degraded video using temporal convolutions; trained on synthetic DAVIS degradations and validated to generalize across degradations and correlate with FR metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FR VQA requires clean references; NR VQA often relies on labeled data and image-only methods ignore temporal context; need scalable, reference-free, opinion-unaware VQA suitable for streaming real-world vision systems.

Method: Train a temporal-aware convolutional network on synthetic degradations of the DAVIS dataset to predict full-reference metrics (LPIPS, PSNR, SSIM) directly from degraded video, enabling streaming inference without references.

Result: The streaming model generalizes better than an image-based baseline across diverse degradations and achieves higher correlation with FR metrics than BRISQUE.

Conclusion: Temporal modeling is valuable for scalable VQA; an opinion-unaware, streaming approach can approach FR metric performance without references or human opinions.

Abstract: Video quality assessment (VQA) is vital for computer vision tasks, but
existing approaches face major limitations: full-reference (FR) metrics require
clean reference videos, and most no-reference (NR) models depend on training on
costly human opinion labels. Moreover, most opinion-unaware NR methods are
image-based, ignoring temporal context critical for video object detection. In
this work, we present a scalable, streaming-based VQA model that is both
no-reference and opinion-unaware. Our model leverages synthetic degradations of
the DAVIS dataset, training a temporal-aware convolutional architecture to
predict FR metrics (LPIPS , PSNR, SSIM) directly from degraded video, without
references at inference. We show that our streaming approach outperforms our
own image-based baseline by generalizing across diverse degradations,
underscoring the value of temporal modeling for scalable VQA in real-world
vision systems. Additionally, we demonstrate that our model achieves higher
correlation with full-reference metrics compared to BRISQUE, a widely-used
opinion-aware image quality assessment baseline, validating the effectiveness
of our temporal, opinion-unaware approach.

TL;DR: Polarization-resolved near-infrared imaging improves eye-tracking accuracy and robustness. A PET system using a polarization-filter camera and polarized NIR illumination reveals features in sclera and cornea absent in intensity images. CNNs trained on PET data reduce 95th-percentile absolute gaze error by 10-16% vs intensity baselines, under nominal and challenging conditions, suggesting PET as a simple, robust wearable sensing modality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To augment traditional intensity-based eye tracking with polarization contrast, exploiting light–tissue polarization effects to improve accuracy and robustness across occlusions, gaze dynamics, and anatomical variability.

Method: Develop a polarization-enabled eye tracking (PET) system with a polarization-filter-array camera and linearly polarized NIR illuminator; collect data from 346 participants; train CNN-based models on PET data; compare performance against capacity-matched intensity baselines under nominal conditions and scenarios with eyelid occlusion, eye-relief changes, and pupil-size variation.

Result: PET reveals trackable features on sclera and cornea not present in intensity images; CNNs using PET data reduce the median 95th-percentile absolute gaze error by 10–16% relative to intensity baselines under both nominal and challenging conditions.

Conclusion: Polarization effects in light–tissue interactions can yield practical gains for gaze tracking; PET offers a simple, robust sensing modality suitable for future wearable eye-tracking devices.

Abstract: Polarization-resolved near-infrared imaging adds a useful optical contrast
mechanism to eye tracking by measuring the polarization state of light
reflected by ocular tissues in addition to its intensity. In this paper we
demonstrate how this contrast can be used to enable eye tracking. Specifically,
we demonstrate that a polarization-enabled eye tracking (PET) system composed
of a polarization--filter--array camera paired with a linearly polarized
near-infrared illuminator can reveal trackable features across the sclera and
gaze-informative patterns on the cornea, largely absent in intensity-only
images. Across a cohort of 346 participants, convolutional neural network based
machine learning models trained on data from PET reduced the median
95th-percentile absolute gaze error by 10--16\% relative to capacity-matched
intensity baselines under nominal conditions and in the presence of eyelid
occlusions, eye-relief changes, and pupil-size variation. These results link
light--tissue polarization effects to practical gains in human--computer
interaction and position PET as a simple, robust sensing modality for future
wearable devices.

*Ellis Brown,Jihan Yang,Shusheng Yang,Rob Fergus,Saining Xie*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a diagnostic and debiasing framework for vision-centric MLLM benchmarks to reveal and remove non-visual biases, improving fair assessment of visual understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multimodal benchmarks can be gamed by non-visual cues, linguistic priors, and surface patterns. There is a need for stress-testing and debiasing to ensure benchmarks truly test visual understanding.

Method: Introduce a Test-set Stress-Test (TsT) that fine-tunes a powerful LLM on non-visual test data via k-fold cross-validation to extract bias scores s(x); complement with a Random Forest diagnostic on hand-crafted features. Debias by Iterative Bias Pruning (IBP) to filter high-bias samples. Apply to VSI-Bench, CV-Bench, MMMU, VideoMME and produce VSI-Bench-Debiased.

Result: Found pervasive non-visual biases across four benchmarks. The debiased VSI-Bench-Debiased shows reduced non-visual solvability and a wider vision-blind performance gap than the original benchmark.

Conclusion: A principled, iterative framework can diagnose and mitigate non-visual biases in multimodal benchmarks, yielding more reliable tests of visual understanding and sharper contrasts between vision-aware and vision-blind models.

Abstract: Robust benchmarks are crucial for evaluating Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs). Yet we find that models can ace many multimodal benchmarks without
strong visual understanding, instead exploiting biases, linguistic priors, and
superficial patterns. This is especially problematic for vision-centric
benchmarks that are meant to require visual inputs. We adopt a diagnostic
principle for benchmark design: if a benchmark can be gamed, it will be.
Designers should therefore try to ``game'' their own benchmarks first, using
diagnostic and debiasing procedures to systematically identify and mitigate
non-visual biases. Effective diagnosis requires directly ``training on the test
set'' -- probing the released test set for its intrinsic, exploitable patterns.
  We operationalize this standard with two components. First, we diagnose
benchmark susceptibility using a ``Test-set Stress-Test'' (TsT) methodology.
Our primary diagnostic tool involves fine-tuning a powerful Large Language
Model via $k$-fold cross-validation on exclusively the non-visual, textual
inputs of the test set to reveal shortcut performance and assign each sample a
bias score $s(x)$. We complement this with a lightweight Random Forest-based
diagnostic operating on hand-crafted features for fast, interpretable auditing.
Second, we debias benchmarks by filtering high-bias samples using an
``Iterative Bias Pruning'' (IBP) procedure. Applying this framework to four
benchmarks -- VSI-Bench, CV-Bench, MMMU, and VideoMME -- we uncover pervasive
non-visual biases. As a case study, we apply our full framework to create
VSI-Bench-Debiased, demonstrating reduced non-visual solvability and a wider
vision-blind performance gap than the original.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SIMS-V uses 3D simulators to generate spatially-rich video training data for multimodal LMs; identifies three core question types (metric measurement, perspective-dependent reasoning, temporal tracking) as sufficient for transferable spatial intelligence; a 7B video LM trained on 25k simulated examples outperforms a 72B baseline and rivals proprietary models on real-world spatial benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world spatial reasoning requires diverse, precisely annotated video data; obtaining such data is expensive; privileged simulator information enables targeted data generation to bridge the gap.

Method: Systematic data-generation framework SIMS-V with ablations over question types, mixes, and scales; focuses on three categories; trains a 7B video LLM with 25k simulated examples; evaluates on real-world spatial benchmarks.

Result: Targeted synthetic data enables the 7B model to surpass the larger 72B baseline and achieve competitive performance with proprietary models on rigorous real-world spatial benchmarks; demonstrates robust generalization to general video understanding and embodied spatial tasks.

Conclusion: Targeted, minimal question categories in synthetic data suffice for transferable spatial intelligence; SIMS-V enables efficient data generation and effective transfer with smaller models.

Abstract: Despite impressive high-level video comprehension, multimodal language models
struggle with spatial reasoning across time and space. While current spatial
training approaches rely on real-world video data, obtaining diverse footage
with precise spatial annotations remains a bottleneck. To alleviate this
bottleneck, we present SIMS-V -- a systematic data-generation framework that
leverages the privileged information of 3D simulators to create spatially-rich
video training data for multimodal language models. Using this framework, we
investigate which properties of simulated data drive effective real-world
transfer through systematic ablations of question types, mixes, and scales. We
identify a minimal set of three question categories (metric measurement,
perspective-dependent reasoning, and temporal tracking) that prove most
effective for developing transferable spatial intelligence, outperforming
comprehensive coverage despite using fewer question types. These insights
enable highly efficient training: our 7B-parameter video LLM fine-tuned on just
25K simulated examples outperforms the larger 72B baseline and achieves
competitive performance with proprietary models on rigorous real-world spatial
reasoning benchmarks. Our approach demonstrates robust generalization,
maintaining performance on general video understanding while showing
substantial improvements on embodied and real-world spatial tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Progress toward spatial supersensing shifts from reactive, task-driven systems to predictive, memory-augmented multimodal perception. Introduces VSI-SUPER benchmarks (VSR and VSC), scales data with VSI-590K and Cambrian-S, and demonstrates that scale alone is insufficient; a self-supervised next-latent-frame predictor using prediction error improves performance and advances predictive sensing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmarks largely test early stages of spatial cognition and linguistic understanding, missing true world modeling and long-horizon, continual perception. A broader paradigm is needed to achieve true multimodal intelligence.

Method: Proposes four-stage framework for spatial supersensing: semantic perception, streaming event cognition, implicit 3D spatial cognition, predictive world modeling. Introduces VSI-SUPER with VSR (long-horizon visual spatial recall) and VSC (continual visual spatial counting). Curates VSI-590K and trains Cambrian-S to test data scaling; develops a self-supervised next-latent-frame predictor that uses surprise (prediction error) to drive memory and event segmentation.

Result: Current benchmarks underrepresent spatial cognition and true world modeling; data scaling yields +30% absolute improvement on VSI-Bench (with Cambrian-S) but VSI-SUPER performance remains limited. The predictive-sensing approach substantially outperforms leading proprietary baselines on VSI-SUPER.

Conclusion: Scale alone is insufficient for spatial supersensing. Predictive sensing—anticipation, selective memory, and organized experience—appears essential for advancing true multimodal intelligence.

Abstract: We argue that progress in true multimodal intelligence calls for a shift from
reactive, task-driven systems and brute-force long context towards a broader
paradigm of supersensing. We frame spatial supersensing as four stages beyond
linguistic-only understanding: semantic perception (naming what is seen),
streaming event cognition (maintaining memory across continuous experiences),
implicit 3D spatial cognition (inferring the world behind pixels), and
predictive world modeling (creating internal models that filter and organize
information). Current benchmarks largely test only the early stages, offering
narrow coverage of spatial cognition and rarely challenging models in ways that
require true world modeling. To drive progress in spatial supersensing, we
present VSI-SUPER, a two-part benchmark: VSR (long-horizon visual spatial
recall) and VSC (continual visual spatial counting). These tasks require
arbitrarily long video inputs yet are resistant to brute-force context
expansion. We then test data scaling limits by curating VSI-590K and training
Cambrian-S, achieving +30% absolute improvement on VSI-Bench without
sacrificing general capabilities. Yet performance on VSI-SUPER remains limited,
indicating that scale alone is insufficient for spatial supersensing. We
propose predictive sensing as a path forward, presenting a proof-of-concept in
which a self-supervised next-latent-frame predictor leverages surprise
(prediction error) to drive memory and event segmentation. On VSI-SUPER, this
approach substantially outperforms leading proprietary baselines, showing that
spatial supersensing requires models that not only see but also anticipate,
select, and organize experience.

TL;DR: InfinityStar is a purely discrete, unified spacetime autoregressive model that can perform text-to-image, text-to-video, image-to-video, and long interactive video generation; it achieves state-of-the-art-like results among autoregressive models, outperforms some diffusion methods, and runs ~10x faster at 5s 720p, making 720p industrial-level video feasible.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To unify spatial and temporal modeling under a single autoregressive, discrete framework inspired by success of autoregressive models in vision and language, enabling versatile generation tasks with efficiency without diffusion.

Method: A single unified spacetime autoregressive architecture that jointly models spatial and temporal dependencies in a purely discrete setting, enabling text-to-image, text-to-video, image-to-video, and long interactive video generation via temporal autoregression.

Result: Achieves 83.74 on VBench, outperforming autoregressive baselines by large margins and surpassing some diffusion methods like HunyuanVideo; can generate 5-second 720p video about 10x faster than leading diffusion methods; claims to be the first discrete AR video generator at industrial 720p.

Conclusion: Demonstrates the viability and efficiency of discrete autoregressive video generation at high resolution, establishes a strong baseline for fast, high-quality video synthesis, and provides code/models for further research.

Abstract: We introduce InfinityStar, a unified spacetime autoregressive framework for
high-resolution image and dynamic video synthesis. Building on the recent
success of autoregressive modeling in both vision and language, our purely
discrete approach jointly captures spatial and temporal dependencies within a
single architecture. This unified design naturally supports a variety of
generation tasks such as text-to-image, text-to-video, image-to-video, and long
interactive video synthesis via straightforward temporal autoregression.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that InfinityStar scores 83.74 on VBench,
outperforming all autoregressive models by large margins, even surpassing some
diffusion competitors like HunyuanVideo. Without extra optimizations, our model
generates a 5s, 720p video approximately 10x faster than leading
diffusion-based methods. To our knowledge, InfinityStar is the first discrete
autoregressive video generator capable of producing industrial level 720p
videos. We release all code and models to foster further research in efficient,
high-quality video generation.

### [62] [Tracking and Understanding Object Transformations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04678)
*Yihong Sun,Xinyu Yang,Jennifer J. Sun,Bharath Hariharan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes Track Any State (TAS) and VOST-TAS benchmark; a zero-shot TubeletGraph system tracks objects through transformations, detects state changes, and builds a state graph, achieving state-of-the-art performance under transformations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world objects change state (e.g., cut apples, metamorphosis). Existing trackers often miss targets after transformations due to appearance changes, hindering understanding of object dynamics.

Method: TubeletGraph: a zero-shot system that recovers missing objects after transformation by identifying overlooked tracks and using semantic and proximity priors to decide integration; then reasons about added tracks to generate a state graph describing each observed transformation and its states.

Result: TubeletGraph achieves state-of-the-art tracking under transformations and demonstrates deeper understanding of object transformations, with capabilities in temporal grounding and semantic reasoning; dataset and code are released (VOST-TAS, TubeletGraph).

Conclusion: Track Any State is feasible; the proposed approach advances tracking through complex transformations and enables semantic temporal reasoning, with a new benchmark to evaluate such capabilities.

Abstract: Real-world objects frequently undergo state transformations. From an apple
being cut into pieces to a butterfly emerging from its cocoon, tracking through
these changes is important for understanding real-world objects and dynamics.
However, existing methods often lose track of the target object after
transformation, due to significant changes in object appearance. To address
this limitation, we introduce the task of Track Any State: tracking objects
through transformations while detecting and describing state changes,
accompanied by a new benchmark dataset, VOST-TAS. To tackle this problem, we
present TubeletGraph, a zero-shot system that recovers missing objects after
transformation and maps out how object states are evolving over time.
TubeletGraph first identifies potentially overlooked tracks, and determines
whether they should be integrated based on semantic and proximity priors. Then,
it reasons about the added tracks and generates a state graph describing each
observed transformation. TubeletGraph achieves state-of-the-art tracking
performance under transformations, while demonstrating deeper understanding of
object transformations and promising capabilities in temporal grounding and
semantic reasoning for complex object transformations. Code, additional
results, and the benchmark dataset are available at

TL;DR: Introduces the problem of automatic image cropping for multiple aesthetically pleasing crops, provides a 277-image dataset with human labels, and evaluates several single-crop models using an image-partitioning pre-processing step; dataset available at GitHub.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Motivation is to move beyond single-crop results to multiple distinct, aesthetically pleasing crops for social media and other applications, and to provide a benchmark dataset with human labels to study multi-crop generation.

Method: Assess several existing single-crop models with an image partitioning pre-processing step to generate and evaluate multiple candidate crops.

Result: Empirical evaluation on a newly released 277-image dataset, demonstrating the viability of using a partitioning pre-processing step with single-crop models and providing the dataset for future benchmarking.

Conclusion: Highlights the need for and feasibility of multi-crop generation, provides a dataset and baseline evaluations, and calls for further research into generating multiple high-quality crops.

quality of cropped regions in photographs. Although several works have proposed
techniques for producing singular crops, little work has addressed the problem
of producing multiple, distinct crops with aesthetic appeal. In this paper, we
motivate the problem with a discussion on modern social media applications,
introduce a dataset of 277 relevant images and human labels, and evaluate the
efficacy of several single-crop models with an image partitioning algorithm as
a pre-processing step. The dataset is available at

provides insights into optimal model configurations. This study enhances our
understanding of model behavior, thereby improving reliability in grass growth
forecasting and contributing to the advancement of sustainable dairy farming
practices.

*Youssef Elmir,Yassine Himeur,Abbes Amira*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Federated learning with Gramian Angular Field (GAF) 2D representations enables CNN-based ECG classification on heterogeneous IoT devices, achieving high accuracy (95.18%) with privacy and efficient resource use.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Protect patient privacy in IoT healthcare and enable collaborative model training across devices with limited resources, while addressing data locality, heterogeneity, and communication overhead.

Method: Convert 1D ECG signals to 2D GAF images for CNN-based feature extraction; train models locally on diverse edge devices (server, laptop, Raspberry Pi 4) and aggregate updates via federated learning; evaluate performance, training time, and communication efficiency across a heterogeneous IoT setup.

Result: Multi-client FL with GAF achieves 95.18% accuracy, significantly outperforming a single-client baseline in both accuracy and training time; GAF's computational overhead is offset by efficient resource utilization and manageable communication costs.

Conclusion: The work demonstrates the feasibility of privacy-preserving, edge-friendly AI for IoT healthcare, indicating that GAF-based federated ECG classification can enable scalable, secure edge deployments in smart health systems.

Abstract: This study presents a federated learning (FL) framework for
privacy-preserving electrocardiogram (ECG) classification in Internet of Things
(IoT) healthcare environments. By transforming 1D ECG signals into 2D Gramian
Angular Field (GAF) images, the proposed approach enables efficient feature
extraction through Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) while ensuring that
sensitive medical data remain local to each device. This work is among the
first to experimentally validate GAF-based federated ECG classification across
heterogeneous IoT devices, quantifying both performance and communication
efficiency. To evaluate feasibility in realistic IoT settings, we deployed the
framework across a server, a laptop, and a resource-constrained Raspberry Pi 4,
reflecting edge-cloud integration in IoT ecosystems. Experimental results
demonstrate that the FL-GAF model achieves a high classification accuracy of
95.18% in a multi-client setup, significantly outperforming a single-client
baseline in both accuracy and training time. Despite the added computational
complexity of GAF transformations, the framework maintains efficient resource
utilization and communication overhead. These findings highlight the potential
of lightweight, privacy-preserving AI for IoT-based healthcare monitoring,
supporting scalable and secure edge deployments in smart health systems.

*Xuan Ouyang,Senan Wang,Bouzhou Wang,Siyuan Xiahou,Jinrong Zhou,Yuekang Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A modular multi-agent system (LOLGORITHM) for controllable short-video comment generation using multimodal prompts and six styles, achieving high user preference on Douyin (Chinese) and YouTube (English).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Short-video comments drive engagement and cultural diffusion, but existing models struggle to be compliant, stylistically diverse, and context-aware across languages and genres. A scalable, culturally adaptive solution is needed.

Method: Develop a modular multi-agent system that integrates video segmentation, contextual and affective analysis, and style-aware prompt construction. Uses a multimodal LLM to process video inputs and supports six styles (puns, rhyming, meme application, sarcasm, plain humor, content extraction) via explicit prompt markers and few-shot examples. Builds a bilingual dataset from Douyin (Chinese) and YouTube (English) across five genres; evaluation combines automated metrics with a human Preference study (40 videos, 105 participants).

Result: LOLGORITHM significantly outperforms baselines, achieving preference rates of over 90% on Douyin and 87.55% on YouTube, with strong style conformity and relevance.

Conclusion: Offers a scalable, culturally adaptive framework for stylized comment generation on short-video platforms, suggesting a promising path to enhance engagement and creative interaction; future work could expand styles, address safety concerns, and improve cross-platform generalization.

Abstract: Short-video platforms have become a central medium in the modern Internet
landscape, where efficient information delivery and strong interactivity are
reshaping user engagement and cultural dissemination. Among the various forms
of user interaction, comments play a vital role in fostering community
participation and enabling content re-creation. However, generating comments
that are both compliant with platform guidelines and capable of exhibiting
stylistic diversity and contextual awareness remains a significant challenge.
We introduce LOLGORITHM, a modular multi-agent system (MAS) designed for
controllable short-video comment generation. The system integrates video
segmentation, contextual and affective analysis, and style-aware prompt
construction. It supports six distinct comment styles: puns (homophones),
rhyming, meme application, sarcasm (irony), plain humor, and content
extraction. Powered by a multimodal large language model (MLLM), LOLGORITHM
directly processes video inputs and achieves fine-grained style control through
explicit prompt markers and few-shot examples. To support development and
evaluation, we construct a bilingual dataset using official APIs from Douyin
(Chinese) and YouTube (English), covering five popular video genres: comedy
skits, daily life jokes, funny animal clips, humorous commentary, and talk
shows. Evaluation combines automated metrics originality, relevance, and style
conformity with a large-scale human preference study involving 40 videos and
105 participants. Results show that LOLGORITHM significantly outperforms
baseline models, achieving preference rates of over 90% on Douyin and 87.55% on
YouTube. This work presents a scalable and culturally adaptive framework for
stylized comment generation on short-video platforms, offering a promising path
to enhance user engagement and creative interaction.

### [67] [What's in Common? Multimodal Models Hallucinate When Reasoning Across Scenes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03768)
*Candace Ross,Florian Bordes,Adina Williams,Polina Kirichenko,Mark Ibrahim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Common-O is a new in-the-wild, image-only benchmark for cross-scene reasoning in multimodal models. It reveals a gap: models perceive objects well but hallucinate when reasoning across scenes. The best model scores 35% on Common-O and 1% on Common-O Complex, indicating substantial room for progress. Multi-image input training offers larger gains than scaling alone; the benchmark is public to spur research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap between perception benchmarks (which saturate) and real-world cross-scene reasoning, by quantifying hallucinations that occur when models reason beyond single-image perception.

Method: Constructed Common-O with over 10.5k new images not seen in web data to avoid contamination. Tasks ask 'what's in common?' across scenes to test cross-scene reasoning. Evaluated leading multimodal LMs, including models trained for chain-of-thought, and analyzed the effect of multi-image inputs and training scale.

Result: Perception is tractable for most models, but cross-scene reasoning remains very challenging. The top model achieves 35% on Common-O and 1% on the more complex Common-O Complex. Models tend to hallucinate more when similar objects co-occur, suggesting reliance on training-time object co-occurrence. Multi-image input yields larger gains than scale alone; scaling with multi-image training shows promise.

Conclusion: Cross-scene reasoning is a persistent challenge for current multimodal models. Scaled multi-image training and dedicated benchmarks like Common-O can spur progress toward reducing hallucinations in cross-scene reasoning. The benchmark is publicly available to catalyze future research.

Abstract: Multimodal language models possess a remarkable ability to handle an
open-vocabulary's worth of objects. Yet the best models still suffer from
hallucinations when reasoning about scenes in the real world, revealing a gap
between their seemingly strong performance on existing perception benchmarks
that are saturating and their reasoning in the real world. To address this gap,
we build a novel benchmark of in-the-wild scenes that we call Common-O. With
more than 10.5k examples using exclusively new images not found in web training
data to avoid contamination, Common-O goes beyond just perception, inspired by
cognitive tests for humans, to probe reasoning across scenes by asking "what's
in common?". We evaluate leading multimodal language models, including models
specifically trained to perform chain-of-thought reasoning. We find that
perceiving objects in single images is tractable for most models, yet reasoning
across scenes is very challenging even for the best models, including reasoning
models. Despite saturating many leaderboards focusing on perception, the best
performing model only achieves 35% on Common-O -- and on Common-O Complex,
consisting of more complex scenes, the best model achieves only 1%. Curiously,
we find models are more prone to hallucinate when similar objects are present
in the scene, suggesting models may be relying on object co-occurrence seen
during training. Among the models we evaluated, we found scale can provide
modest improvements while models explicitly trained with multi-image inputs
show bigger improvements, suggesting scaled multi-image training may offer
promise. We make our benchmark publicly available to spur research into the
challenge of hallucination when reasoning across scenes.

### [68] [Contamination Detection for VLMs using Multi-Modal Semantic Perturbation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03774)
*Jaden Park,Mu Cai,Feng Yao,Jingbo Shang,Soochahn Lee,Yong Jae Lee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Contaminated open-source vision-language models (VLMs) reveal detection gaps; a simple multi-modal semantic perturbation method robustly detects contamination across strategies, outperforming existing detection approaches; code and dataset will be released.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Test-set leakage from internet-scale pretraining can inflate VLM performance; current work focuses on data decontamination for LLMs, but detection of contaminated VLMs is underexplored; need robust ways to identify contaminated models.

Method: Deliberately contaminate open-source VLMs on benchmarks; propose detection method based on multi-modal semantic perturbation; evaluate detectability by observing generalization under perturbation; test across multiple contamination strategies.

Result: Proposed method demonstrates that contaminated models fail to generalize under controlled perturbations; detection is robust across strategies; existing detection approaches fail or inconsistent; results validated on realistic contamination strategies.

Conclusion: This work provides a robust detection framework for contaminated VLMs, highlighting the importance of detecting data contamination at inference time; plan to release code and perturbed dataset to facilitate benchmarking.

Abstract: Recent advances in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved
state-of-the-art performance on numerous benchmark tasks. However, the use of
internet-scale, often proprietary, pretraining corpora raises a critical
concern for both practitioners and users: inflated performance due to test-set
leakage. While prior works have proposed mitigation strategies such as
decontamination of pretraining data and benchmark redesign for LLMs, the
complementary direction of developing detection methods for contaminated VLMs
remains underexplored. To address this gap, we deliberately contaminate
open-source VLMs on popular benchmarks and show that existing detection
approaches either fail outright or exhibit inconsistent behavior. We then
propose a novel simple yet effective detection method based on multi-modal
semantic perturbation, demonstrating that contaminated models fail to
generalize under controlled perturbations. Finally, we validate our approach
across multiple realistic contamination strategies, confirming its robustness
and effectiveness. The code and perturbed dataset will be released publicly.

### [69] [FusionDP: Foundation Model-Assisted Differentially Private Learning for Partially Sensitive Features](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03806)
*Linghui Zeng,Ruixuan Liu,Atiquer Rahman Sarkar,Xiaoqian Jiang,Joyce C. Ho,Li Xiong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FusionDP uses feature-level DP with foundation-model-based imputation of sensitive features to boost utility while preserving privacy, outperforming standard DP-SGD baselines on tabular ICU data and clinical notes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In many settings, only a subset of features (e.g., demographics) are highly sensitive. Standard DP-SGD forces privacy on all features, adding excessive noise and hurting utility. A targeted approach could improve performance without compromising privacy.

Method: A two-step approach: (1) impute sensitive features from non-sensitive ones using large foundation models, treated as external priors that do not reveal true values during training; (2) train models on both original and imputed features using a modified DP-SGD that preserves the privacy of the true sensitive features.

Result: Empirical evaluation on sepsis prediction (PhysioNet tabular data) and MIMIC-III clinical note classification shows FusionDP achieves better utility than privacy-preserving baselines while maintaining feature-level privacy.

Conclusion: Foundation-model-driven imputation can substantially improve the privacy-utility trade-off for feature-level differential privacy across modalities.

Abstract: Ensuring the privacy of sensitive training data is crucial in
privacy-preserving machine learning. However, in practical scenarios, privacy
protection may be required for only a subset of features. For instance, in ICU
data, demographic attributes like age and gender pose higher privacy risks due
to their re-identification potential, whereas raw lab results are generally
less sensitive. Traditional DP-SGD enforces privacy protection on all features
in one sample, leading to excessive noise injection and significant utility
degradation. We propose FusionDP, a two-step framework that enhances model
utility under feature-level differential privacy. First, FusionDP leverages
large foundation models to impute sensitive features given non-sensitive
features, treating them as external priors that provide high-quality estimates
of sensitive attributes without accessing the true values during model
training. Second, we introduce a modified DP-SGD algorithm that trains models
on both original and imputed features while formally preserving the privacy of
the original sensitive features. We evaluate FusionDP on two modalities: a
sepsis prediction task on tabular data from PhysioNet and a clinical note
classification task from MIMIC-III. By comparing against privacy-preserving
baselines, our results show that FusionDP significantly improves model
performance while maintaining rigorous feature-level privacy, demonstrating the
potential of foundation model-driven imputation to enhance the privacy-utility
trade-off for various modalities.

### [70] [Fair and Explainable Credit-Scoring under Concept Drift: Adaptive Explanation Frameworks for Evolving Populations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03807)
*Shivogo John*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Adaptive SHAP variants for evolving credit models yield more stable explanations and fairer outcomes without sacrificing accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Concept drift from evolving borrower behavior, economic changes, and regulation challenges static explainability in credit scoring, risking unstable and potentially unfair inferences. Adaptive explanations aim to preserve transparency and fairness as data distributions shift.

Method: Modeling with XGBoost on multi-year credit data, integrating three adaptive SHAP variants: (A) per-slice explanation reweighting to adjust for feature distribution shifts; (B) drift-aware SHAP rebaselining using sliding-window background samples; (C) online surrogate calibration via incremental Ridge regression. Benchmarked against static SHAP using metrics for predictive performance (AUC, F1), directional/rank stability (cosine, Kendall tau), and fairness (demographic parity, recalibration).

Result: Adaptive methods, notably rebaselined (B) and surrogate-based (C) explanations, show improved temporal stability and reduced disparate impact across demographics without losing predictive accuracy.

Conclusion: Adaptive explainability provides a practical path to sustained transparency, accountability, and ethical reliability in evolving credit systems and other domains where models adapt to population changes.

Abstract: Evolving borrower behaviors, shifting economic conditions, and changing
regulatory landscapes continuously reshape the data distributions underlying
modern credit-scoring systems. Conventional explainability techniques, such as
SHAP, assume static data and fixed background distributions, making their
explanations unstable and potentially unfair when concept drift occurs. This
study addresses that challenge by developing adaptive explanation frameworks
that recalibrate interpretability and fairness in dynamically evolving credit
models. Using a multi-year credit dataset, we integrate predictive modeling via
XGBoost with three adaptive SHAP variants: (A) per-slice explanation
reweighting that adjusts for feature distribution shifts, (B) drift-aware SHAP
rebaselining with sliding-window background samples, and (C) online surrogate
calibration using incremental Ridge regression. Each method is benchmarked
against static SHAP explanations using metrics of predictive performance (AUC,
F1), directional and rank stability (cosine, Kendall tau), and fairness
(demographic parity and recalibration). Results show that adaptive methods,
particularly rebaselined and surrogate-based explanations, substantially
improve temporal stability and reduce disparate impact across demographic
groups without degrading predictive accuracy. Robustness tests, including
counterfactual perturbations, background sensitivity analysis, and
proxy-variable detection, confirm the resilience of adaptive explanations under
real-world drift conditions. These findings establish adaptive explainability
as a practical mechanism for sustaining transparency, accountability, and
ethical reliability in data-driven credit systems, and more broadly, in any
domain where decision models evolve with population change.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A difficulty-aware routing system assigns tasks to the smallest model capable of solving them, achieving near-top performance with reduced compute.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reasoning LMs achieve strong results but are costly to deploy due to model size and long reasoning traces; there is a need for cost-efficient deployment without sacrificing accuracy.

Method: Train lightweight predictors (of problem difficulty or model correctness) using intermediate representations from a large model (s1.1-32B) to route problems across a pool of reasoning models, selecting the smallest sufficient model for each task.

Result: Routing improves efficiency over random assignment on diverse math benchmarks and matches the large model's performance (s1.1-32B) while using significantly less compute.

Conclusion: Difficulty-aware routing is an effective strategy for cost-efficient deployment of reasoning models without compromising accuracy.

Abstract: Reasoning language models perform well on complex tasks but are costly to
deploy due to their size and long reasoning traces. We propose a routing
approach that assigns each problem to the smallest model likely to solve it,
reducing compute without sacrificing accuracy. Using intermediate
representations from s1.1-32B, we train lightweight predictors of problem
difficulty or model correctness to guide routing across a pool of reasoning
models. On diverse math benchmarks, routing improves efficiency over random
assignment and matches s1.1-32B's performance while using significantly less
compute. Our results demonstrate that difficulty-aware routing is effective for
cost-efficient deployment of reasoning models.

### [72] [One Size Does Not Fit All: Architecture-Aware Adaptive Batch Scheduling with DEBA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03809)
*François Belias,Naser Ezzati-Jivan,Foutse Khomh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DEBA shows that adaptive batch scheduling can accelerate training and even improve accuracy, but its gains are architecture-dependent; an architecture-aware design with sliding window statistics and cooldowns is essential, challenging the one-size-fits-all assumption.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To challenge the assumption that adaptive batch size methods generalize across architectures and to investigate how architecture-specific optimization dynamics affect the benefits of batch size adaptation.

Method: Propose DEBA (Dynamic Efficient Batch Adaptation) that monitors gradient variance, gradient norm variation, and loss variation to guide batch size changes. Systematic evaluation on six architectures (ResNet-18/50, DenseNet-121, EfficientNet-B0, MobileNet-V3, ViT-B16) trained on CIFAR-10/100 with five seeds per configuration. Introduce a baseline characterization framework using gradient stability metrics and conduct ablations on sliding window statistics and cooldown periods (≥5 epochs).

Result: Lightweight/medium-depth models (MobileNet-V3, DenseNet-121, EfficientNet-B0) gain 45-62% training speedup with 1-7% accuracy improvement. ResNet-18 yields 2.4-4.0% accuracy gain and 36-43% speedup. ResNet-50 shows high variance and occasional degradation. ViT-B16 has minimal speedup (~6%) but keeps accuracy. A gradient stability-based framework can predict which architectures benefit; sliding window statistics and cooldowns are crucial for success.

Conclusion: Adaptive batch size methods are not universally beneficial; benefits depend on architectural optimization characteristics. DEBA provides the first architecture-aware, systematic evidence and a framework to forecast when adaptive scheduling will help, challenging the one-size-fits-all approach in adaptive batching.

Abstract: Adaptive batch size methods aim to accelerate neural network training, but
existing approaches apply identical adaptation strategies across all
architectures, assuming a one-size-fits-all solution. We introduce DEBA
(Dynamic Efficient Batch Adaptation), an adaptive batch scheduler that monitors
gradient variance, gradient norm variation and loss variation to guide batch
size adaptations. Through systematic evaluation across six architectures
(ResNet-18/50, DenseNet-121, EfficientNet-B0, MobileNet-V3, ViT-B16) on
CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, with five random seeds per configuration, we
demonstrate that the architecture fundamentally determines adaptation efficacy.
Our findings reveal that: (1) lightweight and medium-depth architectures
(MobileNet-V3, DenseNet-121, EfficientNet-B0) achieve a 45-62% training speedup
with simultaneous accuracy improvements of 1-7%; (2) shallow residual networks
(ResNet-18) show consistent gains of +2.4 - 4.0% in accuracy, 36 - 43% in
speedup, while deep residual networks (ResNet-50) exhibit high variance and
occasional degradation; (3) already-stable architectures (ViT-B16) show minimal
speedup (6%) despite maintaining accuracy, indicating that adaptation benefits
vary with baseline optimization characteristics. We introduce a baseline
characterization framework using gradient stability metrics (stability score,
gradient norm variation) that predicts which architectures will benefit from
adaptive scheduling. Our ablation studies reveal critical design choices often
overlooked in prior work: sliding window statistics (vs. full history) and
sufficient cooldown periods (5+ epochs) between adaptations are essential for
success. This work challenges the prevailing assumption that adaptive methods
generalize across architectures and provides the first systematic evidence that
batch size adaptation requires an architecture-aware design.

*Ryien Hosseini,Filippo Simini,Venkatram Vishwanath,Rebecca Willett,Henry Hoffmann*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Inject Sketched Random Features into standard GNNs to capture long-range dependencies, alleviating oversquashing, oversmoothing, and limited expressivity; yields consistent improvements and can complement graph positional encodings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Local GNNs rely on message passing, which biases learning towards local structure and causes issues capturing long-range information. This leads to oversquashing of distant signals, oversmoothing of node representations, and limited expressive power. A scalable global embedding could mitigate these problems.

Method: Introduce Sketched Random Features as unique, distance-sensitive, topology-agnostic embeddings for node features. These randomized global embeddings are injected into standard GNNs, enabling efficient long-range information capture. They can be used as a standalone enhancement or in combination with existing techniques such as graph positional encodings.

Result: Empirical results on real-world graph learning tasks show consistent improvements over baseline GNNs. The approach provides a standalone solution and also serves as a complementary enhancement to existing techniques like graph positional encodings, with source code available.

Conclusion: Sketched Random Features alleviate oversquashing, oversmoothing, and expressivity limitations in GNNs by providing efficient global, distance-aware embeddings. The method is modular, scalable, and easy to integrate with existing architectures.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks learn on graph-structured data by iteratively
aggregating local neighborhood information. While this local message passing
paradigm imparts a powerful inductive bias and exploits graph sparsity, it also
yields three key challenges: (i) oversquashing of long-range information, (ii)
oversmoothing of node representations, and (iii) limited expressive power. In
this work we inject randomized global embeddings of node features, which we
term \textit{Sketched Random Features}, into standard GNNs, enabling them to
efficiently capture long-range dependencies. The embeddings are unique,
distance-sensitive, and topology-agnostic -- properties which we analytically
and empirically show alleviate the aforementioned limitations when injected
into GNNs. Experimental results on real-world graph learning tasks confirm that
this strategy consistently improves performance over baseline GNNs, offering
both a standalone solution and a complementary enhancement to existing
techniques such as graph positional encodings. Our source code is available at

### [74] [From Static to Dynamic: Enhancing Offline-to-Online Reinforcement Learning via Energy-Guided Diffusion Stratification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03828)
*Lipeng Zu,Hansong Zhou,Xiaonan Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: StratDiff uses a diffusion model to capture offline data priors and energy-based refinements to generate offline-like actions; KL-based stratification splits batches into offline-like and online-like samples, enabling offline-like updates and online-like updates, improving offline-to-online RL when paired with Cal-QL and IQL.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The shift from fixed offline data distributions to evolving online policies causes distributional mismatch. Existing methods rarely exploit the intrinsic structure of the offline data to tailor learning strategies.

Method: Train a diffusion model on the offline dataset to learn priors; refine with energy-based functions to produce offline-like actions during online fine-tuning; compute per-sample KL divergence between generated and sampled actions; stratify training batches into offline-like (use offline objectives) and online-like (use online learning strategies); integrate StratDiff with Cal-QL and IQL.

Result: Empirical results on D4RL show StratDiff significantly outperforms baselines, with improved adaptability and stability across diverse offline-to-online RL settings.

Conclusion: StratDiff provides a practical framework that leverages diffusion priors and energy-based refinement to smoother offline-to-online transitions, improving learning by tailoring updates to the sampled data's similarity to offline-like behavior.

Abstract: Transitioning from offline to online reinforcement learning (RL) poses
critical challenges due to distributional shifts between the fixed behavior
policy in the offline dataset and the evolving policy during online learning.
Although this issue is widely recognized, few methods attempt to explicitly
assess or utilize the distributional structure of the offline data itself,
leaving a research gap in adapting learning strategies to different types of
samples. To address this challenge, we propose an innovative method,
Energy-Guided Diffusion Stratification (StratDiff), which facilitates smoother
transitions in offline-to-online RL. StratDiff deploys a diffusion model to
learn prior knowledge from the offline dataset. It then refines this knowledge
through energy-based functions to improve policy imitation and generate
offline-like actions during online fine-tuning. The KL divergence between the
generated action and the corresponding sampled action is computed for each
sample and used to stratify the training batch into offline-like and
online-like subsets. Offline-like samples are updated using offline objectives,
while online-like samples follow online learning strategies. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of StratDiff by integrating it with off-the-shelf methods Cal-QL
and IQL. Extensive empirical evaluations on D4RL benchmarks show that StratDiff
significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving enhanced adaptability and
more stable performance across diverse RL settings.

### [75] [Higher-Order Causal Structure Learning with Additive Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03831)
*James Enouen,Yujia Zheng,Ignavier Ng,Yan Liu,Kun Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Extends causal additive models to higher-order interactions via directed acyclic hypergraphs, provides identifiability theory, and develops a greedy CAM extension with empirical validation on synthetic data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world processes display higher-order interactions not captured by CAM; a hypergraph-based framework is needed for identifiability and practical learning.

Method: Introduce additive models with higher-order interactions; define directed acyclic hypergraphs; develop theoretical tools; prove identifiability results; extend greedy CAM algorithm; evaluate on synthetic data.

Result: Proves identifiability for hyper DAGs beyond standard Markov equivalence; shows that stronger CAM-style restrictions can yield easier learning and better finite-sample performance; demonstrates empirical usefulness of the hyper-DAG CAM algorithm on simulations.

Conclusion: Presents a novel hyper-DAG framework for causal structure learning; extends CAM to higher-order interactions; provides identifiability theory and a practical algorithm with positive synthetic-data results; opens avenues for further research on real-world data and more complex interactions.

Abstract: Causal structure learning has long been the central task of inferring causal
insights from data. Despite the abundance of real-world processes exhibiting
higher-order mechanisms, however, an explicit treatment of interactions in
causal discovery has received little attention. In this work, we focus on
extending the causal additive model (CAM) to additive models with higher-order
interactions. This second level of modularity we introduce to the structure
learning problem is most easily represented by a directed acyclic hypergraph
which extends the DAG. We introduce the necessary definitions and theoretical
tools to handle the novel structure we introduce and then provide
identifiability results for the hyper DAG, extending the typical Markov
equivalence classes. We next provide insights into why learning the more
complex hypergraph structure may actually lead to better empirical results. In
particular, more restrictive assumptions like CAM correspond to easier-to-learn
hyper DAGs and better finite sample complexity. We finally develop an extension
of the greedy CAM algorithm which can handle the more complex hyper DAG search
space and demonstrate its empirical usefulness in synthetic experiments.

### [76] [Enhancing Q-Value Updates in Deep Q-Learning via Successor-State Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03836)
*Lipeng Zu,Hansong Zhou,Xiaonan Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SADQ extends DQN by integrating successor-state distributions via a stochastic transition model to reduce variance and align updates with the current policy, improving stability and learning efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DQN's use of next states from past suboptimal policies leads to high-variance, misaligned updates; there is a need for policy-aligned, low-variance value updates.

Method: Introduce a stochastic transition model to model successor-state distributions; incorporate successor-state information into Q-value estimation; propose a more efficient action selection strategy using the transition structure; provide theoretical guarantees of unbiasedness and variance reduction.

Result: Empirical results show SADQ outperforms DQN variants in stability and learning efficiency across standard RL benchmarks and real-world vector-based control tasks.

Conclusion: SADQ stabilizes learning and improves efficiency by leveraging dynamics through successor-state aggregation while preserving unbiased value estimates; demonstrates effectiveness across diverse tasks.

Abstract: Deep Q-Networks (DQNs) estimate future returns by learning from transitions
sampled from a replay buffer. However, the target updates in DQN often rely on
next states generated by actions from past, potentially suboptimal, policy. As
a result, these states may not provide informative learning signals, causing
high variance into the update process. This issue is exacerbated when the
sampled transitions are poorly aligned with the agent's current policy. To
address this limitation, we propose the Successor-state Aggregation Deep
Q-Network (SADQ), which explicitly models environment dynamics using a
stochastic transition model. SADQ integrates successor-state distributions into
the Q-value estimation process, enabling more stable and policy-aligned value
updates. Additionally, it explores a more efficient action selection strategy
with the modeled transition structure. We provide theoretical guarantees that
SADQ maintains unbiased value estimates while reducing training variance. Our
extensive empirical results across standard RL benchmarks and real-world
vector-based control tasks demonstrate that SADQ consistently outperforms DQN
variants in both stability and learning efficiency.

### [77] [Benchmark Datasets for Lead-Lag Forecasting on Social Platforms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03877)
*Kimia Kazemian,Zhenzhen Liu,Yangfanyu Yang,Katie Z Luo,Shuhan Gu,Audrey Du,Xinyu Yang,Jack Jansons,Kilian Q Weinberger,John Thickstun,Yian Yin,Sarah Dean*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Lead-Lag Forecasting (LLF) is formalized with two large benchmark datasets (arXiv: accesses -> citations; GitHub: pushes/stars -> forks) and establishes LLF as a new forecasting paradigm with data, tests, and baselines for cross-domain long-horizon lead-lag dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLF reflects ubiquitous temporal dependencies where early interactions influence future outcomes; the lack of standardized datasets has hindered systematic research and comparability.

Method: Create and curate two high-volume LLF datasets (arXiv and GitHub) and outline additional domains; document data cleaning; validate lead-lag dynamics with statistical and classification tests; benchmark parametric and non-parametric regression baselines; provide a data portal.

Result: Confirmed presence of lead-lag dynamics; established LLF as a novel forecasting paradigm with empirical foundation; datasets and baselines serve as reference; data portal provided for downloads and documentation.

Conclusion: LLF opens a new research direction in time-series forecasting; encourages systematic exploration across domains; standardized datasets will foster reproducible LLF studies.

Abstract: Social and collaborative platforms emit multivariate time-series traces in
which early interactions-such as views, likes, or downloads-are followed,
sometimes months or years later, by higher impact like citations, sales, or
reviews. We formalize this setting as Lead-Lag Forecasting (LLF): given an
early usage channel (the lead), predict a correlated but temporally shifted
outcome channel (the lag). Despite the ubiquity of such patterns, LLF has not
been treated as a unified forecasting problem within the time-series community,
largely due to the absence of standardized datasets. To anchor research in LLF,
here we present two high-volume benchmark datasets-arXiv (accesses -> citations
of 2.3M papers) and GitHub (pushes/stars -> forks of 3M repositories)-and
outline additional domains with analogous lead-lag dynamics, including
Wikipedia (page views -> edits), Spotify (streams -> concert attendance),
e-commerce (click-throughs -> purchases), and LinkedIn profile (views ->
messages). Our datasets provide ideal testbeds for lead-lag forecasting, by
capturing long-horizon dynamics across years, spanning the full spectrum of
outcomes, and avoiding survivorship bias in sampling. We documented all
technical details of data curation and cleaning, verified the presence of
lead-lag dynamics through statistical and classification tests, and benchmarked
parametric and non-parametric baselines for regression. Our study establishes
LLF as a novel forecasting paradigm and lays an empirical foundation for its
systematic exploration in social and usage data. Our data portal with downloads
and documentation is available at https://lead-lag-forecasting.github.io/.

### [78] [DecoHD: Decomposed Hyperdimensional Classification under Extreme Memory Budgets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03911)
*Sanggeon Yun,Hyunwoo Oh,Ryozo Masukawa,Mohsen Imani*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DecoHD introduces a decomposed HDC parameterization that learns directly from compact, shared per-layer channels with multiplicative binding and end-bundling, enabling substantial compression while preserving HDC properties and achieving major hardware efficiency gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Decomposition reduces model size, but in hyperdimensional computing (HDC) decompositions have relied on fixed atomic hypervectors, which are ill-suited for compressing learned class prototypes and often hurt concentration, robustness, and end-to-end training. DecoHD aims to enable end-to-end training and strong performance by learning in decomposed HDC parameterization that keeps the HDC interpretation intact and aligns with near-memory accelerators.

Method: Introduce a decomposed HDC parameterization with a small, shared set of per-layer channels that are multiplicatively bound across layers and bundled at the end, generating a large representational space from compact factors. Compress along the class axis with a lightweight bundling head. Train end-to-end; inference remains pure HDC.

Result: DecoHD achieves extreme memory savings with minimal accuracy loss, averaging ~0.1–0.15% below a strong non-reduced HDC baseline (worst case 5.7%). It is more robust to random bit-flip noise and reaches near-maximum accuracy with up to ~97% fewer trainable parameters. Hardware-wise, it delivers ~277x/35x energy and speed gains over a CPU, ~13.5x/3.7x over a GPU, and ~2.0x/2.4x over a baseline HDC ASIC.

Conclusion: DecoHD provides an effective, end-to-end trainable decomposition for HDC that preserves native HDC properties, sustains robustness, and yields substantial memory and hardware efficiency, making it suitable for near-memory accelerators and deployment under tight budgets.

Abstract: Decomposition is a proven way to shrink deep networks without changing I/O.
We bring this idea to hyperdimensional computing (HDC), where footprint cuts
usually shrink the feature axis and erode concentration and robustness. Prior
HDC decompositions decode via fixed atomic hypervectors, which are ill-suited
for compressing learned class prototypes. We introduce DecoHD, which learns
directly in a decomposed HDC parameterization: a small, shared set of per-layer
channels with multiplicative binding across layers and bundling at the end,
yielding a large representational space from compact factors. DecoHD compresses
along the class axis via a lightweight bundling head while preserving native
bind-bundle-score; training is end-to-end, and inference remains pure HDC,
aligning with in/near-memory accelerators. In evaluation, DecoHD attains
extreme memory savings with only minor accuracy degradation under tight
deployment budgets. On average it stays within about 0.1-0.15% of a strong
non-reduced HDC baseline (worst case 5.7%), is more robust to random bit-flip
noise, reaches its accuracy plateau with up to ~97% fewer trainable parameters,
and -- in hardware -- delivers roughly 277x/35x energy/speed gains over a CPU
(AMD Ryzen 9 9950X), 13.5x/3.7x over a GPU (NVIDIA RTX 4090), and 2.0x/2.4x
over a baseline HDC ASIC.

### [79] [On Predicting Sociodemographics from Mobility Signals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03924)
*Ekin Uğurel,Cynthia Chen,Brian H. Y. Lee,Filipe Rodrigues*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes higher-order mobility features, uncertainty diagnostics, and multitask learning to infer sociodemographics from mobility data, achieving better accuracy, interpretability, and cross-context generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Inferring sociodemographic attributes from mobility data is valuable for planners but difficult due to weak trait-pattern relationships and limited generalization across contexts; improving accuracy, interpretability, and robustness is essential.

Method: 1) Develop behaviorally grounded directed mobility graph descriptors (trip sequences, modes, co-travel) as higher-order features; 2) propose metrics/visual tools to calibrate and diagnose model uncertainty; 3) implement multitask learning with a shared representation to predict multiple attributes jointly, improving sample efficiency and cross-time generalization.

Result: Higher predictive performance for age, gender, income, and household structure over baselines; better calibrated uncertainty and interpretability; multitask model outperforms single-task models, especially with limited data or distribution shifts across time periods.

Conclusion: A combination of interpretable, behaviorally grounded features, uncertainty quantification, and multitask learning yields more accurate and generalizable sociodemographic inference from mobility data, supporting planners in decision-making with quantified confidence.

Abstract: Inferring sociodemographic attributes from mobility data could help
transportation planners better leverage passively collected datasets, but this
task remains difficult due to weak and inconsistent relationships between
mobility patterns and sociodemographic traits, as well as limited
generalization across contexts. We address these challenges from three angles.
First, to improve predictive accuracy while retaining interpretability, we
introduce a behaviorally grounded set of higher-order mobility descriptors
based on directed mobility graphs. These features capture structured patterns
in trip sequences, travel modes, and social co-travel, and significantly
improve prediction of age, gender, income, and household structure over
baselines features. Second, we introduce metrics and visual diagnostic tools
that encourage evenness between model confidence and accuracy, enabling
planners to quantify uncertainty. Third, to improve generalization and sample
efficiency, we develop a multitask learning framework that jointly predicts
multiple sociodemographic attributes from a shared representation. This
approach outperforms single-task models, particularly when training data are
limited or when applying models across different time periods (i.e., when the
test set distribution differs from the training set).

### [80] [SynQuE: Estimating Synthetic Dataset Quality Without Annotations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03928)
*Arthur Chen,Victor Zhong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SynQuE ranks synthetic datasets by their expected real-world task performance using limited unannotated real data and benchmarks proxy metrics (distribution/diversity-based via embeddings) plus a language-model–driven proxy (LENS). It shows proxies correlate with real performance across tasks and achieves notable gains (e.g., Text2SQL top-3 data raises accuracy from 30.4% to 38.4%).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address data scarcity due to collection costs or privacy constraints by enabling estimation of real-task performance using synthetic data without labeled real data. Establish benchmarks and proxies to guide synthetic data selection.

Method: Formulate the SynQuE problem. Create comprehensive benchmarks with proxy metrics for synthetic data selection. Adapt distribution and diversity-based distance measures via embeddings. Introduce LENS, a large language model–based reasoning proxy. Evaluate across tasks (sentiment analysis, Text2SQL, web navigation, image classification) and compare proxies by their correlation to true real-task performance.

Result: SynQuE proxies correlate with real task performance across diverse tasks. LENS consistently outperforms other proxies on complex tasks by capturing nuanced characteristics. In Text2SQL parsing, training on the top-3 synthetic datasets selected via SynQuE proxies raises accuracy from 30.4% to 38.4% on average (+8.1 percentage points) compared to data chosen indiscriminately.

Conclusion: SynQuE provides a practical framework for synthetic data selection under real-data scarcity and prompts future work on foundation-model–based data characterization and fine-grained data selection.

Abstract: We introduce and formalize the Synthetic Dataset Quality Estimation (SynQuE)
problem: ranking synthetic datasets by their expected real-world task
performance using only limited unannotated real data. This addresses a critical
and open challenge where data is scarce due to collection costs or privacy
constraints. We establish the first comprehensive benchmarks for this problem
by introducing and evaluating proxy metrics that choose synthetic data for
training to maximize task performance on real data. We introduce the first
proxy metrics for SynQuE by adapting distribution and diversity-based distance
measures to our context via embedding models. To address the shortcomings of
these metrics on complex planning tasks, we propose LENS, a novel proxy that
leverages large language model reasoning. Our results show that SynQuE proxies
correlate with real task performance across diverse tasks, including sentiment
analysis, Text2SQL, web navigation, and image classification, with LENS
consistently outperforming others on complex tasks by capturing nuanced
characteristics. For instance, on text-to-SQL parsing, training on the top-3
synthetic datasets selected via SynQuE proxies can raise accuracy from 30.4% to
38.4 (+8.1)% on average compared to selecting data indiscriminately. This work
establishes SynQuE as a practical framework for synthetic data selection under
real-data scarcity and motivates future research on foundation model-based data
characterization and fine-grained data selection.

### [82] [LogHD: Robust Compression of Hyperdimensional Classifiers via Logarithmic Class-Axis Reduction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03938)
*Sanggeon Yun,Hyunwoo Oh,Ryozo Masukawa,Pietro Mercati,Nathaniel D. Bastian,Mohsen Imani*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LogHD reduces per-class prototypes in Hyperdimensional Computing from C prototypes to about log_k C bundle hypervectors, enabling an n-dimensional activation decoding. This yields memory O(D log_k C) while preserving accuracy, with strong resilience to bit flips and substantial hardware energy/speed gains in ASIC implementations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the O(CD) memory requirement of standard one-prototype-per-class HDC, which burdens memory, compute, and energy in constrained systems; prior compaction reduces feature dimension but harms robustness.

Method: Introduce LogHD: replace C per-class prototypes with n ≈ ceil(log_k C) bundle hypervectors (alphabet size k). Decode in an n-dimensional activation space. Use a capacity-aware codebook and profile-based decoding. Combine with feature-axis sparsification as needed. Memory scales as O(D log_k C) while keeping D unchanged, and classification uses an activation-space decoder.

Result: LogHD attains competitive accuracy across datasets with injected bit flips and smaller models, offering higher resilience at matched memory. Under equal memory, it maintains target accuracy at roughly 2.5–3.0× higher bit-flip tolerance than feature-axis compression. ASIC implementation reports 498× energy efficiency and 62.6× speedup over an AMD Ryzen 9 9950X, and 24.3×/6.58× over an NVIDIA RTX 4090; also 4.06× more energy-efficient and 2.19× faster than a feature-axis HDC ASIC baseline.

Conclusion: LogHD provides a memory-efficient, robust, and hardware-friendly approach to hyperdimensional computing, achieving substantial memory reductions with preserved accuracy and large hardware performance gains; it can complement sparsification and offers strong resilience to memory faults, suitable for energy-constrained AI hardware.

Abstract: Hyperdimensional computing (HDC) suits memory, energy, and
reliability-constrained systems, yet the standard "one prototype per class"
design requires $O(CD)$ memory (with $C$ classes and dimensionality $D$). Prior
compaction reduces $D$ (feature axis), improving storage/compute but weakening
robustness. We introduce LogHD, a logarithmic class-axis reduction that
replaces the $C$ per-class prototypes with $n\!\approx\!\lceil\log_k C\rceil$
bundle hypervectors (alphabet size $k$) and decodes in an $n$-dimensional
activation space, cutting memory to $O(D\log_k C)$ while preserving $D$. LogHD
uses a capacity-aware codebook and profile-based decoding, and composes with
feature-axis sparsification. Across datasets and injected bit flips, LogHD
attains competitive accuracy with smaller models and higher resilience at
matched memory. Under equal memory, it sustains target accuracy at roughly
$2.5$-$3.0\times$ higher bit-flip rates than feature-axis compression; an ASIC
instantiation delivers $498\times$ energy efficiency and $62.6\times$ speedup
over an AMD Ryzen 9 9950X and $24.3\times$/$6.58\times$ over an NVIDIA RTX
4090, and is $4.06\times$ more energy-efficient and $2.19\times$ faster than a
feature-axis HDC ASIC baseline.

### [84] [Conditional Score Learning for Quickest Change Detection in Markov Transition Kernels](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03953)
*Wuxia Chen,Taposh Banerjee,Vahid Tarokh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Score-based quickest change detection in high-dimensional Markov processes with unknown kernels, learned via conditional score estimation; uses a score-based CUSUM with truncation, and provides exponential false-alarm guarantees and asymptotic detection-delay bounds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Detect changes in Markov transition dynamics when the transition kernel is unknown and data are high-dimensional, making likelihood-based methods intractable. Learn p(y|x) via conditional score from sample pairs to enable practical, model-free change detection.

Method: Estimate the conditional score ∇_y log p(y|x) from sample pairs (x,y) generated by the same kernel. Build a score-based CUSUM using conditional Hyvarinen score differences. Introduce a truncated statistic to bound increments. Use Hoeffding’s inequality for uniformly ergodic Markov processes to derive exponential lower bounds on the mean time to false alarm and give asymptotic upper bounds on detection delay.

Result: Provides a theoretically grounded, practically feasible framework for score-based change detection in high-dimensional Markov models with unknown kernels, including both finite-sample/long-run guarantees (false-alarm bounds) and asymptotic performance (detection delay).

Conclusion: Score-based change detection with learned conditional scores is a viable approach for high-dimensional Markov processes with unknown transitions, offering a scalable and analyzable alternative to likelihood-based methods, aided by truncation for stability.

Abstract: We address the problem of quickest change detection in Markov processes with
unknown transition kernels. The key idea is to learn the conditional score
$\nabla_{\mathbf{y}} \log p(\mathbf{y}|\mathbf{x})$ directly from sample pairs
$( \mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})$, where both $\mathbf{x}$ and $\mathbf{y}$ are
high-dimensional data generated by the same transition kernel. In this way, we
avoid explicit likelihood evaluation and provide a practical way to learn the
transition dynamics. Based on this estimation, we develop a score-based CUSUM
procedure that uses conditional Hyvarinen score differences to detect changes
in the kernel. To ensure bounded increments, we propose a truncated version of
the statistic. With Hoeffding's inequality for uniformly ergodic Markov
processes, we prove exponential lower bounds on the mean time to false alarm.
We also prove asymptotic upper bounds on detection delay. These results give
both theoretical guarantees and practical feasibility for score-based detection
in high-dimensional Markov models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes hierarchical importance-guided forgetting (HIF) for cognitive diagnosis (CD) models to efficiently unlearn specific data while preserving performance; shows improvements over baselines on real datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Growing privacy concerns and the right to be forgotten have spurred the need for data unlearning in CD models; existing unlearning methods are ill-suited for CD due to its heterogeneous structure and privacy-utility-efficiency trade-offs.

Method: HIF leverages layer-wise parameter importance with a smoothing mechanism that blends individual- and layer-level importance, enabling precise forgetting of data contributions in CD models.

Result: Empirical evaluation on three real-world datasets shows HIF outperforms baselines in unlearning effectiveness while maintaining utility and efficiency.

Conclusion: HIF provides the first effective solution for data removal in CD models, enabling privacy-preserving AI systems with high performance.

Abstract: The need to remove specific student data from cognitive diagnosis (CD) models
has become a pressing requirement, driven by users' growing assertion of their
"right to be forgotten". However, existing CD models are largely designed
without privacy considerations and lack effective data unlearning mechanisms.
Directly applying general purpose unlearning algorithms is suboptimal, as they
struggle to balance unlearning completeness, model utility, and efficiency when
confronted with the unique heterogeneous structure of CD models. To address
this, our paper presents the first systematic study of the data unlearning
problem for CD models, proposing a novel and efficient algorithm: hierarchical
importanceguided forgetting (HIF). Our key insight is that parameter importance
in CD models exhibits distinct layer wise characteristics. HIF leverages this
via an innovative smoothing mechanism that combines individual and layer, level
importance, enabling a more precise distinction of parameters associated with
the data to be unlearned. Experiments on three real world datasets show that
HIF significantly outperforms baselines on key metrics, offering the first
effective solution for CD models to respond to user data removal requests and
for deploying high-performance, privacy preserving AI systems

*Semih Cayci*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Stochastic Gauss-Newton with Levenberg–Marquardt damping for overparameterized DNNs: derive finite-time convergence and non-asymptotic generalization bounds, showing that larger Gauss-Newton eigenvalue along the path improves generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understand how higher-order optimization affects generalization in deep learning, especially with overparameterization and damping.

Method: Variable-metric analysis in parameter space; finite-time convergence bounds for SGN with mini-batch sampling and damping; non-asymptotic generalization bounds via uniform stability; regression with smooth activations.

Result: Explicit finite-time convergence bounds depending on batch size, width, depth; non-asymptotic generalization bounds; curvature, batch size, and overparameterization impacts; favorable regime with larger GN minimum eigenvalue yields tighter stability bounds.

Conclusion: SGN can generalize well in a regime where the Gauss-Newton matrix has a larger minimum eigenvalue along the optimization path; higher-order methods' impact on generalization depends on curvature along the path.

Abstract: An important question in deep learning is how higher-order optimization
methods affect generalization. In this work, we analyze a stochastic
Gauss-Newton (SGN) method with Levenberg-Marquardt damping and mini-batch
sampling for training overparameterized deep neural networks with smooth
activations in a regression setting. Our theoretical contributions are twofold.
First, we establish finite-time convergence bounds via a variable-metric
analysis in parameter space, with explicit dependencies on the batch size,
network width and depth. Second, we derive non-asymptotic generalization bounds
for SGN using uniform stability in the overparameterized regime, characterizing
the impact of curvature, batch size, and overparameterization on generalization
performance. Our theoretical results identify a favorable generalization regime
for SGN in which a larger minimum eigenvalue of the Gauss-Newton matrix along
the optimization path yields tighter stability bounds.

*Xu Zou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PETRA uses evolutionary trajectories from phylogenetic trees to power a transformer that predicts future SARS-CoV-2 mutations, addressing sequencing noise and data imbalance; it achieves strong improvements over baselines and is open-sourced.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SARS-CoV-2 evolves rapidly with immune-evasive variants, and sequencing data are noisy and geographically/temporally imbalanced, hindering mutation forecasting essential for vaccines and public health.

Method: PETRA is a transformer-based model that leverages evolutionary trajectories extracted from phylogenetic trees (not raw RNA) and uses a weighted training framework to balance global sequence data; it predicts nucleotide mutations and spike amino-acid mutations and supports real-time mutation forecasting for major clades.

Result: Weighted recall@1: 9.45% for nucleotide mutations and 17.10% for spike amino-acid mutations, substantially higher than baselines (0.49% and 6.64%). Demonstrates real-time mutation prediction for clades 24F(XEC) and 25A(LP.8.1). Open-source at https://github.com/xz-keg/PETra.

Conclusion: PETRA effectively mitigates sequencing noise and captures the hierarchical evolutionary structure, delivering improved mutation forecasting with potential to support vaccine design and surveillance; code is publicly available.

Abstract: Since its emergence, SARS-CoV-2 has demonstrated a rapid and unpredictable
evolutionary trajectory, characterized by the continual emergence of
immune-evasive variants. This poses persistent challenges to public health and
vaccine development.
  While large-scale generative pre-trained transformers (GPTs) have
revolutionized the modeling of sequential data, their direct applications to
noisy viral genomic sequences are limited. In this paper, we introduce
PETRA(Pretrained Evolutionary TRAnsformer), a novel transformer approach based
on evolutionary trajectories derived from phylogenetic trees rather than raw
RNA sequences. This method effectively mitigates sequencing noise and captures
the hierarchical structure of viral evolution.
  With a weighted training framework to address substantial geographical and
temporal imbalances in global sequence data, PETRA excels in predicting future
SARS-CoV-2 mutations, achieving a weighted recall@1 of 9.45% for nucleotide
mutations and 17.10\% for spike amino-acid mutations, compared to 0.49% and
6.64% respectively for the best baseline. PETRA also demonstrates its ability
to aid in the real-time mutation prediction of major clades like 24F(XEC) and
25A(LP.8.1). The code is open sourced on https://github.com/xz-keg/PETra

*Yuxiao Wang,Di Wu,Feng Liu,Zhimin Qiu,Chenrui Hu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A graph-prior guided composable fine-tuning framework that combines graph-based task dependencies with modular adapters to reduce cost and improve stability and accuracy in multi-task learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large pre-trained models suffer high computational cost and structural instability during multi-task adaptation with standard adapters. A unified, graph-informed approach is needed to constrain adapter allocation and routing, enabling efficient cross-task reuse and reduced path conflicts.

Method: Introduce a relation matrix to model task dependencies and encode node/path correlations into graph structural priors, providing unified constraints for adapter weight allocation and path selection. Embed modular adapters into layers via low-rank mappings and a pluggable mechanism to enable efficient cross-task composition under prior guidance. Systematically analyze routing temperature, gating thresholds, and relation matrix regularization to validate stability and consistency under structural constraints.

Result: Empirical results show improved task prediction accuracy, more precise adapter weight allocation, and enhanced computational efficiency, with stable training. Ablations on hyperparameters and sensitivity analyses confirm robustness of the approach and the effectiveness of graph priors in guiding composable fine-tuning.

Conclusion: The proposed graph-prior guided modular adapter framework offers synergistic benefits for composable fine-tuning—achieving higher accuracy and parameter efficiency in multi-task settings while maintaining a lightweight model and reducing path conflicts and redundant computation.

Abstract: This paper proposes a composable fine-tuning method that integrates graph
structural priors with modular adapters to address the high computational cost
and structural instability faced by large-scale pre-trained models in
multi-task adaptation. The method introduces a relation matrix to model
dependencies among tasks, explicitly encoding correlations between nodes and
paths into graph structural priors, which provide unified structural
constraints for adapter weight allocation and path selection. Modular adapters
are embedded into different layers through low-rank mapping and a pluggable
mechanism, enabling efficient cross-task composition and reuse under prior
guidance. This mechanism not only improves parameter efficiency and training
stability but also alleviates path conflicts and redundant computation in
multi-task scenarios. Furthermore, experiments on hyperparameter sensitivity,
environmental sensitivity, and data sensitivity are conducted to systematically
analyze key factors such as routing temperature, gating thresholds, and
relation matrix regularization strength, verifying the consistency and superior
performance of the method under structural constraints. The results demonstrate
that the proposed framework significantly enhances task prediction accuracy,
adapter weight allocation precision, and overall computational efficiency while
maintaining model lightweight design, highlighting the synergistic advantages
of graph priors and modular mechanisms in composable fine-tuning.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Motivation analysis unavailable

Method: Method extraction failed

Result: Result analysis unavailable

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We introduce TwIST, a distributed training framework for efficient large
language model (LLM) sparsification. TwIST trains multiple subnetworks in
parallel, periodically aggregates their parameters, and resamples new
subnetworks during training. This process identifies high-quality subnetworks
("golden tickets") without requiring post-training procedures such as
calibration or Hessian-based recovery. As a result, TwIST enables zero-cost
pruning at deployment time while achieving perplexity competitive with
state-of-the-art post-training sparsification methods. The benefits are most
pronounced under aggressive sparsity (e.g., 50%+), where TwIST significantly
outperforms baseline methods; for example, reaching 23.14 PPL compared to 31.64
for the closest prior approach. Unlike unstructured pruning, TwIST produces
structured, dense matrices that offer practical inference speedups and memory
reductions on commodity hardware (e.g., CPUs) that do not support efficient
sparse computation. TwIST provides an efficient training-time path to
deployable sparse LLMs without additional fine-tuning or recovery overhead.

*Ahmed A. Metwally,Heyjun Park,Yue Wu,Tracey McLaughlin,Michael P. Snyder*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CGM and wearables enable dynamic metabolic subtyping; ML maps glucose trajectories to insulin resistance and beta-cell defects; PPGR and lifestyle data yield personalized prevention strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Static glycemic thresholds overlook underlying heterogeneity in dysglycemia; need precise subphenotyping to tailor prevention.

Method: A review synthesizing CGM-enabled at-home oral glucose tolerance tests with machine learning predicting gold-standard measures of muscle insulin resistance and beta-cell function; analysis of postprandial glycemic response to standardized meals; integration of wearable data on diet, sleep, and activity; assessment of phenotype-dependent dietary mitigators.

Result: Evidence that high-resolution CGM data coupled with ML can predict gold-standard metabolic measures; PPGR differences across meals reveal metabolic subtypes; habitual lifestyle patterns associate with specific dysfunctions; dietary interventions show phenotype-dependent efficacy; CGM-based subphenotyping deconstructs early dysglycemia into actionable subphenotypes.

Conclusion: Dynamic CGM-driven subtyping enables precision nutrition, behavior, and pharmacological strategies for targeted diabetes prevention.

Abstract: The classification of diabetes and prediabetes by static glucose thresholds
obscures the pathophysiological dysglycemia heterogeneity, primarily driven by
insulin resistance (IR), beta-cell dysfunction, and incretin deficiency. This
review demonstrates that continuous glucose monitoring and wearable
technologies enable a paradigm shift towards non-invasive, dynamic metabolic
phenotyping. We show evidence that machine learning models can leverage
high-resolution glucose data from at-home, CGM-enabled oral glucose tolerance
tests to accurately predict gold-standard measures of muscle IR and beta-cell
function. This personalized characterization extends to real-world nutrition,
where an individual's unique postprandial glycemic response (PPGR) to
standardized meals, such as the relative glucose spike to potatoes versus
grapes, could serve as a biomarker for their metabolic subtype. Moreover,
integrating wearable data reveals that habitual diet, sleep, and physical
activity patterns, particularly their timing, are uniquely associated with
specific metabolic dysfunctions, informing precision lifestyle interventions.
The efficacy of dietary mitigators in attenuating PPGR is also shown to be
phenotype-dependent. Collectively, this evidence demonstrates that CGM can
deconstruct the complexity of early dysglycemia into distinct, actionable
subphenotypes. This approach moves beyond simple glycemic control, paving the
way for targeted nutritional, behavioral, and pharmacological strategies
tailored to an individual's core metabolic defects, thereby paving the way for
a new era of precision diabetes prevention.

TL;DR: Ca2+-modulated learning framework integrating astrocyte dynamics with a DNN for streaming anomaly detection, yielding high accuracy and low overhead; demonstrates robustness to evolving data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Offline detectors struggle with concept drift and new attacks; bio-inspired rapid, context-sensitive adaptation can improve streaming anomaly detection.

Method: A multicellular astrocyte dynamics simulator modeling IP3-Ca2+ release, SERCA uptake, and gap-junction diffusion, coupled to a DNN; Ca2+ trajectories are precomputed and used to gate learning; evaluated on CTU-13 traffic dataset; yields faster adaptation.

Result: Up to ~98% accuracy with reduced false positives/negatives across splits; negligible runtime overhead after precomputation; outperforms baseline DNN.

Conclusion: Biologically grounded Ca2+-modulated framework provides a generic approach for streaming detection requiring rapid adaptation; can generalize beyond cybersecurity.

Abstract: Network anomaly detection systems encounter several challenges with
traditional detectors trained offline. They become susceptible to concept drift
and new threats such as zero-day or polymorphic attacks. To address this
limitation, we propose a Ca$^{2+}$-modulated learning framework that draws
inspiration from astrocytic Ca$^{2+}$ signaling in the brain, where rapid,
context-sensitive adaptation enables robust information processing. Our
approach couples a multicellular astrocyte dynamics simulator with a deep
neural network (DNN). The simulator models astrocytic Ca$^{2+}$ dynamics
through three key mechanisms: IP$_3$-mediated Ca$^{2+}$ release, SERCA pump
uptake, and conductance-aware diffusion through gap junctions between cells.
Evaluation of our proposed network on CTU-13 (Neris) network traffic data
demonstrates the effectiveness of our biologically plausible approach. The
Ca$^{2+}$-gated model outperforms a matched baseline DNN, achieving up to
$\sim$98\% accuracy with reduced false positives and negatives across multiple
train/test splits. Importantly, this improved performance comes with negligible
runtime overhead once Ca$^{2+}$ trajectories are precomputed. While
demonstrated here for cybersecurity applications, this Ca$^{2+}$-modulated
learning framework offers a generic solution for streaming detection tasks that
require rapid, biologically grounded adaptation to evolving data patterns.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need for standardized objective metrics to compare diverse ML/AI algorithms in science and engineering; current rapid advances require benchmarks similar to those in speech, language, and vision to track progress and enable fair comparison.

Method: Proposes the Common Task Framework (CTF) as a framework comprising a growing collection of challenge datasets and a set of objective metrics tailored to practical scientific objectives (forecasting, state reconstruction, generalization, control), with attention to data scarcity and measurement noise.

Result: The abstract presents a framework and its intended benefits but does not report empirical results; it claims CTF is a critically enabling technology that has already accelerated ML in other domains and could do so for science and engineering.

Conclusion: A standardized benchmarking framework with shared datasets and metrics is needed to compare ML/AI methods across scientific domains; CTF could accelerate progress by providing common evaluation criteria and datasets.

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms are
transforming and empowering the characterization and control of dynamic systems

*Mingyu Sung,Vikas Palakonda,Suhwan Im,Sunghwan Moon,Il-Min Kim,Sangseok Yun,Jae-Mo Kang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Autoregressive-aware split computing for edge LLM deployment; introduces OPSC, a two-stage intermediate compression (TS+TAB-Q), and a unified optimization to balance memory, latency, and accuracy; reports 1.49x speedup and lower communication with maintained/improved accuracy vs SOTA quantization baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are too large for resource-constrained IoT devices, and autoregressive decoding with expanding KV caches makes edge inference particularly challenging. Existing split-computing approaches often ignore the iterative token generation and cache growth, leading to memory bottlenecks and high communication. There is a need for an autoregressive-specific framework that reduces memory footprint and communication without sacrificing accuracy.

Method: Threefold contribution: (1) One-point split compression (OPSC): a mixed-precision quantization scheme that partitions the model into front-end and back-end with different precision to prevent OOM during edge/cloud partitioning. (2) Two-stage intermediate compression: threshold splitting (TS) combined with token-wise adaptive bit quantization (TAB-Q) to preserve accuracy-critical activations while dramatically reducing communication. (3) A unified optimization framework that jointly selects split points, quantization settings, and sequence lengths to meet strict memory and latency constraints.

Result: Extensive evaluations across diverse LLMs and hardware show superior performance relative to state-of-the-art quantization methods (SmoothQuant, OmniQuant, Atom), achieving a 1.49 inference speedup and significant reductions in communication overhead while maintaining or improving model accuracy.

Conclusion: The proposed autoregressive-aware split computing framework enables practical edge deployment of LLMs by addressing autoregressive-specific bottlenecks and combining novel compression strategies with a unified optimization, outperforming existing baselines.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved near-human performance across
diverse reasoning tasks, yet their deployment on resource-constrained
Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices remains impractical due to massive parameter
footprints and memory-intensive autoregressive decoding. While split computing
offers a promising solution by partitioning model execution between edge
devices and cloud servers, existing approaches fail to address the unique
challenges of autoregressive inference, particularly the iterative token
generation process and expanding key-value (KV) cache requirements. This work
introduces the first autoregressive-aware split computing framework designed
explicitly for LLM deployment on edge devices. Our approach makes three key
contributions. First, we develop one-point split compression (OPSC), a
mixed-precision quantization scheme that prevents out-of-memory failures by
strategically partitioning models into front-end and back-end segments with
different precision levels. Second, we propose a two-stage intermediate
compression pipeline that combines threshold splitting (TS) and token-wise
adaptive bit quantization (TAB-Q) to preserve accuracy-critical activations
while dramatically reducing communication overhead. Third, we formulate a
unified optimization framework that jointly selects optimal split points,
quantization settings, and sequence lengths to satisfy strict memory and
latency constraints. Extensive evaluations across diverse LLMs and hardware
platforms demonstrate superior performance compared to state-of-the-art
quantization methods, including SmoothQuant, OmniQuant, and Atom. The framework
achieves a 1.49 inference speedup and significant communication overhead
reduction while maintaining or improving model accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal protein features (structure, sequence, attributes, interaction networks) are diverse and interdependent, making it difficult to decipher their interconnections and to perform hierarchical multi-label protein function prediction.

Method: Introduce reconstructive pre-training to mine fine-grained, low-semantic information; use Bidirectional Interaction Module (BInM) for interactive learning among multimodal features; implement Dynamic Selection Module (DSM) to select the most predictive feature representation for current protein function prediction.

Result: Significant improvements on human datasets for BPO, MFO, and CCO, outperforming benchmark models.

Conclusion: The approach effectively leverages multimodal features and dynamic feature selection to enhance protein function prediction, addressing hierarchical multi-label challenges and showing strong empirical gains.

Abstract: Multimodal protein features play a crucial role in protein function
prediction. However, these features encompass a wide range of information,
ranging from structural data and sequence features to protein attributes and
interaction networks, making it challenging to decipher their complex
interconnections. In this work, we propose a multimodal protein function
prediction method (DSRPGO) by utilizing dynamic selection and reconstructive
pre-training mechanisms. To acquire complex protein information, we introduce
reconstructive pre-training to mine more fine-grained information with low
semantic levels. Moreover, we put forward the Bidirectional Interaction Module
(BInM) to facilitate interactive learning among multimodal features.
Additionally, to address the difficulty of hierarchical multi-label
classification in this task, a Dynamic Selection Module (DSM) is designed to
select the feature representation that is most conducive to current protein
function prediction. Our proposed DSRPGO model improves significantly in BPO,
MFO, and CCO on human datasets, thereby outperforming other benchmark models.

TL;DR: DartQuant offers an efficient distribution-aware rotational calibration for quantization that reduces optimization complexity and enables 70B-language-model quantization on a single GPU, delivering substantial speed and memory gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Rotational matrices can smooth outliers to improve quantization, but end-to-end optimization of rotations is computationally expensive and prone to overfitting, hindering large-model quantization.

Method: DartQuant constrains the distribution of activations after rotation to reduce optimization complexity and introduces QR-Orth optimization to replace costly alternating optimization.

Result: Achieves 47× acceleration and 10× memory savings for rotational optimization on a 70B model; first to complete rotational calibration for a 70B model on a single 3090 GPU; code released.

Conclusion: DartQuant delivers superior efficiency and practicality in large-model quantization, enabling resource-constrained quantization of very large language models.

Abstract: Quantization plays a crucial role in accelerating the inference of
large-scale models, and rotational matrices have been shown to effectively
improve quantization performance by smoothing outliers. However, end-to-end
fine-tuning of rotational optimization algorithms incurs high computational
costs and is prone to overfitting. To address this challenge, we propose an
efficient distribution-aware rotational calibration method, DartQuant, which
reduces the complexity of rotational optimization by constraining the
distribution of the activations after rotation. This approach also effectively
reduces reliance on task-specific losses, thereby mitigating the risk of
overfitting. Additionally, we introduce the QR-Orth optimization scheme, which
replaces expensive alternating optimization with a more efficient solution. In
a variety of model quantization experiments, DartQuant demonstrates superior
performance. Compared to existing methods, it achieves 47$\times$ acceleration
and 10$\times$ memory savings for rotational optimization on a 70B model.
Furthermore, it is the first to successfully complete rotational calibration
for a 70B model on a single 3090 GPU, making quantization of large language
models feasible in resource-constrained environments. Code is available at

Motivation: To address diagnostic challenges in pediatric appendicitis due to overlapping symptoms and variable ultrasound quality by automating detection with deep learning.

Method: Fine-tune pretrained ResNet on ultrasound frames; preprocessing steps include normalization, resizing, and augmentation; classify as appendicitis vs non-appendicitis; dataset includes 1-15 views per subject.

Result: Accuracy 93.44%; precision 91.53%; recall 89.8%.

Conclusion: Demonstrates strong discriminative capability across heterogeneous views; suggests potential for aiding clinical decision-making; external validation and multicenter data needed to assess generalizability.

Abstract: Pediatric appendicitis remains one of the most common causes of acute
abdominal pain in children, and its diagnosis continues to challenge clinicians
due to overlapping symptoms and variable imaging quality. This study aims to
develop and evaluate a deep learning model based on a pretrained ResNet
architecture for automated detection of appendicitis from ultrasound images. We
used the Regensburg Pediatric Appendicitis Dataset, which includes ultrasound
scans, laboratory data, and clinical scores from pediatric patients admitted
with abdominal pain to Children Hospital. Hedwig in Regensburg, Germany. Each
subject had 1 to 15 ultrasound views covering the right lower quadrant,
appendix, lymph nodes, and related structures. For the image based
classification task, ResNet was fine tuned to distinguish appendicitis from
non-appendicitis cases. Images were preprocessed by normalization, resizing,
and augmentation to enhance generalization. The proposed ResNet model achieved
an overall accuracy of 93.44, precision of 91.53, and recall of 89.8,
demonstrating strong performance in identifying appendicitis across
heterogeneous ultrasound views. The model effectively learned discriminative
spatial features, overcoming challenges posed by low contrast, speckle noise,

Motivation: Automate LA segmentation to reduce manual annotation burden, enable large-scale/time-sensitive workflows, leveraging nnU-Net's self-configuring architecture.

Method: Applied nnU-Net to the Left Atrial Segmentation Challenge 2013 dataset (30 MRI scans) with automated preprocessing and training; evaluated with Dice and qualitative comparison to expert masks and prior methods.

Result: Mean Dice score of 93.5; robust generalization across anatomical/quality variations; accurately delineates atrial body and proximal pulmonary veins; outperforms several traditional approaches.

Conclusion: nnU-Net provides a robust, automated solution for LA segmentation in cardiac MRI, supporting clinical workflows and potential integration into biophysical modeling; further validation on larger datasets.

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of the left atrium (LA) from cardiac MRI is critical
for guiding atrial fibrillation (AF) ablation and constructing biophysical
cardiac models. Manual delineation is time-consuming, observer-dependent, and
impractical for large-scale or time-sensitive clinical workflows. Deep learning
methods, particularly convolutional architectures, have recently demonstrated
superior performance in medical image segmentation tasks. In this study, we
applied the nnU-Net framework, an automated, self-configuring deep learning
segmentation architecture, to the Left Atrial Segmentation Challenge 2013
dataset. The dataset consists of thirty MRI scans with corresponding
expert-annotated masks. The nnU-Net model automatically adapted its
preprocessing, network configuration, and training pipeline to the
characteristics of the MRI data. Model performance was quantitatively evaluated
using the Dice similarity coefficient (DSC), and qualitative results were
compared against expert segmentations. The proposed nnUNet model achieved a
mean Dice score of 93.5, demonstrating high overlap with expert annotations and
outperforming several traditional segmentation approaches reported in previous
studies. The network exhibited robust generalization across variations in left
atrial shape, contrast, and image quality, accurately delineating both the

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Learned, data-driven trade-off weights for filtered ANN search that replace fixed penalties with a constrained linear optimization that aligns distance and filter match.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing graph-based filtered ANN methods rely on fixed, data-agnostic penalties for filter satisfaction, which hurts generalization across datasets with varying label and vector distributions.

Method: Formulate a constrained linear optimization to derive weights that balance vector distance and filter match, learning distance penalties from data; use these weights to guide search and influence index construction, yielding graph structures that reflect the filter distribution and semantics.

Result: The learned weighting improves accuracy by 5-10% over fixed-penalty methods, demonstrating better accuracy and generalization in filtered ANN search.

Conclusion: A data-adaptive distance function via learned weights provides a principled, flexible framework for filtered ANN search, enhancing both search effectiveness and index design across diverse datasets.

Abstract: Filtered Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) search retrieves the closest
vectors for a query vector from a dataset. It enforces that a specified set of
discrete labels $S$ for the query must be included in the labels of each
retrieved vector. Existing graph-based methods typically incorporate filter
awareness by assigning fixed penalties or prioritizing nodes based on filter
satisfaction. However, since these methods use fixed, data in- dependent
penalties, they often fail to generalize across datasets with diverse label and
vector distributions. In this work, we propose a principled alternative that
learns the optimal trade-off between vector distance and filter match directly
from the data, rather than relying on fixed penalties. We formulate this as a
constrained linear optimization problem, deriving weights that better reflect
the underlying filter distribution and more effectively address the filtered
ANN search problem. These learned weights guide both the search process and
index construction, leading to graph structures that more effectively capture
the underlying filter distribution and filter semantics. Our experiments
demonstrate that adapting the distance function to the data significantly im-
proves accuracy by 5-10% over fixed-penalty methods, providing a more flexible
and generalizable framework for the filtered ANN search problem.

### [100] [DeNoise: Learning Robust Graph Representations for Unsupervised Graph-Level Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04086)
*Qingfeng Chen,Haojin Zeng,Jingyi Jie,Shichao Zhang,Debo Cheng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DeNoise is a robust UGAD framework that handles noisy training data by jointly learning a graph encoder and decoders with adversarial objectives, plus encoder anchor-alignment denoising and contrastive learning to improve graph-level anomaly detection under contamination.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Unsupervised graph-level anomaly detection models assume clean training data, but real-world data is often contaminated with anomalies, which degrades learned representations and performance. A robust method is needed.

Method: Train a graph-level encoder, an attribute decoder, and a structure decoder under an adversarial objective. Introduce encoder anchor-alignment denoising to inject high-information node embeddings from normal graphs into all graph embeddings. Apply contrastive learning to pull normal graph embeddings together and push anomalous ones apart.

Result: Empirical evaluation on eight real-world datasets shows DeNoise achieves robust graph-level representations under varying noise intensities and consistently outperforms state-of-the-art UGAD baselines.

Conclusion: DeNoise provides a noise-resistant UGAD framework that preserves normal-graph structure in representations despite contamination, enabling improved detection of anomalous graphs in practice.

Abstract: With the rapid growth of graph-structured data in critical domains,
unsupervised graph-level anomaly detection (UGAD) has become a pivotal task.
UGAD seeks to identify entire graphs that deviate from normal behavioral
patterns. However, most Graph Neural Network (GNN) approaches implicitly assume
that the training set is clean, containing only normal graphs, which is rarely
true in practice. Even modest contamination by anomalous graphs can distort
learned representations and sharply degrade performance. To address this
challenge, we propose DeNoise, a robust UGAD framework explicitly designed for
contaminated training data. It jointly optimizes a graph-level encoder, an
attribute decoder, and a structure decoder via an adversarial objective to
learn noise-resistant embeddings. Further, DeNoise introduces an encoder
anchor-alignment denoising mechanism that fuses high-information node
embeddings from normal graphs into all graph embeddings, improving
representation quality while suppressing anomaly interference. A contrastive
learning component then compacts normal graph embeddings and repels anomalous
ones in the latent space. Extensive experiments on eight real-world datasets
demonstrate that DeNoise consistently learns reliable graph-level
representations under varying noise intensities and significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art UGAD baselines.

### [101] [KoTaP: A Panel Dataset for Corporate Tax Avoidance, Performance, and Governance in Korea](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04094)
*Hyungjong Na,Wonho Song,Seungyong Han,Donghyeon Jo,Sejin Myung,Hyungjoon Kim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: KoTaP is a long-term balanced panel dataset of Korean non-financial firms (2011–2024) that measures corporate tax avoidance and links it to earnings management, profitability, stability, growth, and governance, enabling benchmarking, AI-enabled analyses, and policy/investment research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a standardized, open, longitudinal dataset for studying tax avoidance and its associations, addressing data gaps and enabling cross-country comparability while capturing Korean institutional features.

Method: Assembled from KOSPI and KOSDAQ non-financial firms; exclude financials, non-December FY ends, capital impairment, negative pre-tax income; final sample 12,653 firm-year observations from 1,754 firms; tax avoidance measured via CETR, GETR, TSTA, TSDA with adjustments; standardized variables; designed for panel analyses and AI methods; described as balanced and internationally comparable.

Result: KoTaP yields a consistent, balanced panel with standardized indicators and distributions/correlations aligned with international literature; provides open resource for research, benchmarking, and explainable AI; supports model validation, policy evaluation, audit planning, and investment analysis.

Conclusion: KoTaP is a critical open resource enabling interdisciplinary accounting and finance research, with policy and investment applications; it captures Korean institutional features while maintaining international comparability.

Abstract: This study introduces the Korean Tax Avoidance Panel (KoTaP), a long-term
panel dataset of non-financial firms listed on KOSPI and KOSDAQ between 2011
and 2024. After excluding financial firms, firms with non-December fiscal year
ends, capital impairment, and negative pre-tax income, the final dataset
consists of 12,653 firm-year observations from 1,754 firms. KoTaP is designed
to treat corporate tax avoidance as a predictor variable and link it to
multiple domains, including earnings management (accrual- and activity-based),
profitability (ROA, ROE, CFO, LOSS), stability (LEV, CUR, SIZE, PPE, AGE,
INVREC), growth (GRW, MB, TQ), and governance (BIG4, FORN, OWN). Tax avoidance
itself is measured using complementary indicators cash effective tax rate
(CETR), GAAP effective tax rate (GETR), and book-tax difference measures (TSTA,
TSDA) with adjustments to ensure interpretability. A key strength of KoTaP is
its balanced panel structure with standardized variables and its consistency
with international literature on the distribution and correlation of core
indicators. At the same time, it reflects distinctive institutional features of
Korean firms, such as concentrated ownership, high foreign shareholding, and
elevated liquidity ratios, providing both international comparability and
contextual uniqueness. KoTaP enables applications in benchmarking econometric
and deep learning models, external validity checks, and explainable AI
analyses. It further supports policy evaluation, audit planning, and investment
analysis, making it a critical open resource for accounting, finance, and
interdisciplinary research.

### [102] [Decomposable Neuro Symbolic Regression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04124)
*Giorgio Morales,John W. Sheppard*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A decomposable, explainable symbolic regression framework that distills an opaque model into interpretable multivariate expressions using a Multi-Set Transformer, genetic algorithms (GAs), and genetic programming (GP). It selects and merges univariate skeletons into multivariate expressions with GA-optimized coefficients, achieving robust performance and faithful recovery of the original equations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Symbolic regression often emphasizes prediction accuracy at the expense of discovering governing equations, leading to overly complex or inaccurate expressions. There is a need for interpretable models that reveal underlying relationships and reproduce the original mathematical structure, even in noisy data.

Method: A Multi-Set Transformer generates multiple univariate symbolic skeletons describing each variable's influence on an opaque model's response. GA-based selection filters high-quality skeletons, which are incrementally merged via a GP-based cascade that preserves skeleton structure. Final multivariate skeletons have coefficients optimized by GA. The approach distills a trained, opaque regression model into explainable mathematical expressions.

Result: On problems with varying noise levels, the method yields interpolation and extrapolation errors that are lower or comparable to two GP-based methods, three neural SR methods, and a hybrid approach. Unlike the baselines, it consistently learns expressions that match the original mathematical structure.

Conclusion: The proposed decomposable SR framework delivers interpretable, accurate symbolic representations by combining transformer-based skeleton generation with GA/GP-based selection, merging, and coefficient optimization, and demonstrates robustness to noise while recovering the underlying equations.

Abstract: Symbolic regression (SR) models complex systems by discovering mathematical
expressions that capture underlying relationships in observed data. However,
most SR methods prioritize minimizing prediction error over identifying the
governing equations, often producing overly complex or inaccurate expressions.
To address this, we present a decomposable SR method that generates
interpretable multivariate expressions leveraging transformer models, genetic
algorithms (GAs), and genetic programming (GP). In particular, our explainable
SR method distills a trained ``opaque'' regression model into mathematical
expressions that serve as explanations of its computed function. Our method
employs a Multi-Set Transformer to generate multiple univariate symbolic
skeletons that characterize how each variable influences the opaque model's
response. We then evaluate the generated skeletons' performance using a
GA-based approach to select a subset of high-quality candidates before
incrementally merging them via a GP-based cascade procedure that preserves
their original skeleton structure. The final multivariate skeletons undergo
coefficient optimization via a GA. We evaluated our method on problems with
controlled and varying degrees of noise, demonstrating lower or comparable
interpolation and extrapolation errors compared to two GP-based methods, three
neural SR methods, and a hybrid approach. Unlike them, our approach
consistently learned expressions that matched the original mathematical
structure.

### [103] [Exploring the Feasibility of End-to-End Large Language Model as a Compiler](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04132)
*Hongbin Zhang,Shihao Gao,Yang Liu,Mingjie Xing,Yanjun Wu,Chen Zhao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LLMs show basic compiler-like capabilities, but current end-to-end compilation via LaaC struggles with low success rates; with prompts, scale, and reasoning, assembly code quality can improve; a CompilerEval dataset/framework assesses LLMs on source comprehension and assembly generation; optimistic outlook with targeted training and infrastructure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore whether large language models can serve as end-to-end compilers (LaaC), addressing their current limitations in code generation and compilation, and to establish an evaluation framework (CompilerEval) for assessing LLMs on source and assembly tasks across platforms.

Method: Design of the CompilerEval dataset and evaluation framework to test mainstream LLMs on source code comprehension and assembly generation; systematic error analysis; exploration of prompt engineering, model scaling, and reasoning methods; cross-platform compilation assessment.

Result: LLMs demonstrate basic compiler abilities but exhibit low compilation success rates; improvements through better prompts, larger models, and reasoning techniques yield notable gains in assembly code quality.

Conclusion: LaaC is promising but requires targeted training, rich prompts, and specialized infrastructure to reliably generate high-quality assembly; the approach could drive a paradigm shift in compilation and merits further research and architectural design.

Abstract: In recent years, end-to-end Large Language Model (LLM) technology has shown
substantial advantages across various domains. As critical system software and
infrastructure, compilers are responsible for transforming source code into
target code. While LLMs have been leveraged to assist in compiler development
and maintenance, their potential as an end-to-end compiler remains largely
unexplored. This paper explores the feasibility of LLM as a Compiler (LaaC) and
its future directions. We designed the CompilerEval dataset and framework
specifically to evaluate the capabilities of mainstream LLMs in source code
comprehension and assembly code generation. In the evaluation, we analyzed
various errors, explored multiple methods to improve LLM-generated code, and
evaluated cross-platform compilation capabilities. Experimental results
demonstrate that LLMs exhibit basic capabilities as compilers but currently
achieve low compilation success rates. By optimizing prompts, scaling up the
model, and incorporating reasoning methods, the quality of assembly code
generated by LLMs can be significantly enhanced. Based on these findings, we
maintain an optimistic outlook for LaaC and propose practical architectural
designs and future research directions. We believe that with targeted training,
knowledge-rich prompts, and specialized infrastructure, LaaC has the potential
to generate high-quality assembly code and drive a paradigm shift in the field
of compilation.

### [104] [Exchange Policy Optimization Algorithm for Semi-Infinite Safe Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04147)
*Jiaming Zhang,Yujie Yang,Haoning Wang,Liping Zhang,Shengbo Eben Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Exchange Policy Optimization (EPO) provides a safe RL framework for semi-infinite constraints by iteratively solving finite-subproblem RL with an expanding/shrinking constraint set, achieving near-optimal performance while guaranteeing deterministic bounds on global constraint violations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In many real-world safe RL tasks, safety constraints must hold over a continuous space (semi-infinite constraints), which is intractable to enforce exactly. A method that can manage an active finite constraint set while ensuring safety and good performance is needed.

Method: EPO iteratively solves safe RL subproblems using a finite active constraint set. Constraints violated beyond a tolerance are added to the active set (constraint expansion), while those with zero Lagrange multipliers after a policy update are removed (constraint deletion). This exchange of constraints prevents unbounded growth of the working set and guides policy training.

Result: Theoretical analysis indicates that, under mild assumptions, policies trained via EPO achieve performance close to the global-optimal solution, with all constraint violations strictly bounded within a prescribed limit.

Conclusion: EPO offers a principled and scalable approach to semi-infinite safe RL by adaptively managing the constraint set, providing performance guarantees and deterministic safety bounds.

Abstract: Safe reinforcement learning (safe RL) aims to respect safety requirements
while optimizing long-term performance. In many practical applications,
however, the problem involves an infinite number of constraints, known as
semi-infinite safe RL (SI-safe RL). Such constraints typically appear when
safety conditions must be enforced across an entire continuous parameter space,
such as ensuring adequate resource distribution at every spatial location. In
this paper, we propose exchange policy optimization (EPO), an algorithmic
framework that achieves optimal policy performance and deterministic bounded
safety. EPO works by iteratively solving safe RL subproblems with finite
constraint sets and adaptively adjusting the active set through constraint
expansion and deletion. At each iteration, constraints with violations
exceeding the predefined tolerance are added to refine the policy, while those
with zero Lagrange multipliers are removed after the policy update. This
exchange rule prevents uncontrolled growth of the working set and supports
effective policy training. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that, under
mild assumptions, strategies trained via EPO achieve performance comparable to
optimal solutions with global constraint violations strictly remaining within a
prescribed bound.

*Olav Finne Praesteng Larsen,Massimiliano Ruocco,Michail Spitieris,Abdulmajid Murad,Martina Ragosta*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Transfer learning from data-rich Zurich to data-scarce Dublin enables realistic trajectory generation with limited local data, with diffusion models performing best at 5% data and near baseline at ~20%; other pretrained latent models help variably; flow matching generalizes less well.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Data scarcity at secondary and regional airports hinders machine learning for ATM and large-scale simulations. Transfer learning could reduce data needs by leveraging models trained on data-rich airports.

Method: Pretrain diffusion- and flow-matching-based architectures on Zurich landing trajectories, then fine-tune on Dublin with 0–100% of local data. Compare diffusion-based, latent diffusion, latent flow matching, and flow matching models against scratch-trained baselines, using metrics and visual inspections to assess performance and rare trajectory patterns.

Result: Diffusion-based models achieve competitive performance with as little as 5% Dublin data and reach baseline around 20%, consistently outperforming models trained from scratch. Latent flow matching and latent diffusion benefit from pretraining with more variable gains; flow matching shows weaker generalization. Rare trajectory patterns remain challenging.

Conclusion: Transfer learning can substantially reduce data requirements for aviation trajectory generation, enabling realistic synthetic data in data-scarce ATM environments. While cross-airport transfer is promising, gains vary by model type and some rare-pattern cases require further study.

Abstract: Access to trajectory data is a key requirement for developing and validating
Air Traffic Management (ATM) solutions, yet many secondary and regional
airports face severe data scarcity. This limits the applicability of machine
learning methods and the ability to perform large-scale simulations or
"what-if" analyses. In this paper, we investigate whether generative models
trained on data-rich airports can be efficiently adapted to data-scarce
airports using transfer learning. We adapt state-of-the-art diffusion- and
flow-matching-based architectures to the aviation domain and evaluate their
transferability between Zurich (source) and Dublin (target) landing trajectory
datasets. Models are pretrained on Zurich and fine-tuned on Dublin with varying
amounts of local data, ranging from 0% to 100%. Results show that
diffusion-based models achieve competitive performance with as little as 5% of
the Dublin data and reach baseline-level performance around 20%, consistently
outperforming models trained from scratch across metrics and visual
inspections. Latent flow matching and latent diffusion models also benefit from
pretraining, though with more variable gains, while flow matching models show
weaker generalization. Despite challenges in capturing rare trajectory
patterns, these findings demonstrate the potential of transfer learning to
substantially reduce data requirements for trajectory generation in ATM,
enabling realistic synthetic data generation even in environments with limited
historical records.

### [106] [Deep Learning Approach for Clinical Risk Identification Using Transformer Modeling of Heterogeneous EHR Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04158)
*Anzhuo Xie,Wei-Chen Chang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A Transformer-based method for longitudinal risk classification on heterogeneous EHR data, using unified embeddings, learnable temporal encoding, and semantic-weighted pooling to improve predictive performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clinical risk classification using EHR data is hampered by irregular time intervals, modality heterogeneity, and complex semantics across events. Existing models often fail to capture long-term trends and the varying importance of events.

Method: The approach embeds multi-source medical features into a unified representation, uses a learnable temporal encoding to handle uneven sampling, employs a multi-head self-attention backbone to model global dependencies in longitudinal sequences, and adds a semantic-weighted pooling module to adaptively weight key medical events, followed by a linear mapping layer to output risk scores.

Result: The model surpasses traditional machine learning and temporal deep learning baselines in accuracy, recall, precision, and F1-score, delivering stable and precise risk identification across multi-source heterogeneous EHR data.

Conclusion: The Transformer-based longitudinal model effectively handles irregular sampling and data heterogeneity, improving predictive performance for clinical risk assessment and offering an efficient, interpretable framework for decision-making.

Abstract: This study proposes a Transformer-based longitudinal modeling method to
address challenges in clinical risk classification with heterogeneous
Electronic Health Record (EHR) data, including irregular temporal patterns,
large modality differences, and complex semantic structures. The method takes
multi-source medical features as input and employs a feature embedding layer to
achieve a unified representation of structured and unstructured data. A
learnable temporal encoding mechanism is introduced to capture dynamic
evolution under uneven sampling intervals. The core model adopts a multi-head
self-attention structure to perform global dependency modeling on longitudinal
sequences, enabling the aggregation of long-term trends and short-term
fluctuations across different temporal scales. To enhance semantic
representation, a semantic-weighted pooling module is designed to assign
adaptive importance to key medical events, improving the discriminative ability
of risk-related features. Finally, a linear mapping layer generates
individual-level risk scores. Experimental results show that the proposed model
outperforms traditional machine learning and temporal deep learning models in
accuracy, recall, precision, and F1-Score, achieving stable and precise risk
identification in multi-source heterogeneous EHR environments and providing an
efficient and reliable framework for clinical intelligent decision-making.

*Laurits Fredsgaard,Mikkel N. Schmidt*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Jointly tuning weight decay, temperature scaling, and early stopping in deep ensembles can improve or match performance, with a practical partially overlapping holdout strategy enabling joint evaluation while preserving training data; results vary across tasks and metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how joint optimization across components of deep ensembles affects predictive performance and uncertainty calibration, and to provide practical guidance for practitioners.

Method: Experiments tuning multiple hyperparameters jointly (weight decay, temperature scaling, early stopping) across ensemble members; compare to independent tuning; propose and evaluate a partially overlapping holdout strategy; assess across tasks/uncertainty metrics; code available at the referenced repository.

Result: Joint tuning generally matches or improves performance; the magnitude of improvement varies by task and metric; the overlapping holdout strategy is a practical compromise between enabling joint evaluation and maximizing data usage for training.

Conclusion: Joint optimization of deep ensembles is beneficial with caveats; adopting the overlapping holdout strategy offers a practical approach for practitioners seeking to balance joint evaluation with data efficiency; code is provided for reproducibility.

Abstract: Deep ensembles are a powerful tool in machine learning, improving both model
performance and uncertainty calibration. While ensembles are typically formed
by training and tuning models individually, evidence suggests that jointly
tuning the ensemble can lead to better performance. This paper investigates the
impact of jointly tuning weight decay, temperature scaling, and early stopping
on both predictive performance and uncertainty quantification. Additionally, we
propose a partially overlapping holdout strategy as a practical compromise
between enabling joint evaluation and maximizing the use of data for training.
Our results demonstrate that jointly tuning the ensemble generally matches or
improves performance, with significant variation in effect size across
different tasks and metrics. We highlight the trade-offs between individual and
joint optimization in deep ensemble training, with the overlapping holdout
strategy offering an attractive practical solution. We believe our findings
provide valuable insights and guidance for practitioners looking to optimize
deep ensemble models. Code is available at:

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ScaleDL is a nonlinear, layer-wise model with a GNN-based cross-layer interaction and D-optimal design to predict DNN runtimes accurately while reducing data collection costs; achieves 6x lower MRE and 5x lower RMSE across five DNN models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need accurate, generalizable runtime predictions for growing DNN workloads; traditional additive models lack accuracy; graph-based models improve accuracy but increase data costs; aim to balance accuracy, generalizability, and data collection efficiency.

Method: Introduce ScaleDL: nonlinear layer-wise modeling + graph neural network-based cross-layer interaction mechanism; plus D-optimal data selection to reduce data collection costs.

Result: Experimental evaluation on five popular DNN models shows significant improvements in prediction accuracy and generalizability; 6x lower mean relative error (MRE) and 5x lower RMSE relative to baselines.

Conclusion: ScaleDL provides accurate, generalizable DNN runtime predictions with lower data collection costs, enabling scalable resource planning across diverse network architectures.

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) form the cornerstone of modern AI services,
supporting a wide range of applications, including autonomous driving,
chatbots, and recommendation systems. As models increase in size and
complexity, DNN workloads like training and inference tasks impose
unprecedented demands on distributed computing resources, making the accurate
prediction of runtime essential for optimizing development and resource
allocation. Traditional methods rely on additive computational unit models,
limiting their accuracy and generalizability. In contrast, graph-enhanced
modeling improves performance but significantly increases data collection
costs. Therefore, there is a critical need for a method that strikes a balance
between accuracy, generalizability, and the costs of data collection. To
address these challenges, we propose ScaleDL, a novel runtime prediction
framework that combines nonlinear layer-wise modeling with graph neural network
(GNN)-based cross-layer interaction mechanism, enabling accurate DNN runtime
prediction and hierarchical generalizability across different network
architectures. Additionally, we employ the D-optimal method to reduce data
collection costs. Experiments on the workloads of five popular DNN models prove
that ScaleDL enhances runtime prediction accuracy and generalizability,
achieving 6$\times$ lower MRE and 5$\times$ lower RMSE compared to baseline
models.

*Yuantian Shao,Peisong Wang,Yuanteng Chen,Chang Xu,Zhihui Wei,Jian Cheng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Benchmarking post-training quantization under MXFP4, revealing rotation-based methods clash with PoT block scaling; GPTQ performs well; a simple block-rotation strategy adapts rotation-based PTQ to MXFP4, boosting accuracy across LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable efficient deployment of large LLMs on MXFP4, a new FP4 format with hardware support, and address the gap that existing PTQ methods, especially rotation-based ones, may not work well under MXFP4 due to PoT block scaling.

Method: Systematically evaluate major PTQ methods (including GPTQ and rotation-based) on MXFP4 across multiple LLMs; analyze the incompatibility root cause (PoT block scaling vs outlier energy redistribution); develop a block rotation technique to align with MXFP4; validate with experiments.

Result: GPTQ delivers strong accuracy; rotation-based methods are largely incompatible with MXFP4 due to PoT scaling and outlier energy redistribution; the block-rotation strategy significantly improves accuracy across diverse LLMs.

Conclusion: Offers practical guidance for deploying MXFP4-PTQ and lays groundwork for PTQ research under emerging FP4 formats, demonstrating that a simple block-rotation can unlock rotation-based PTQ with MXFP4.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success, but their
rapidly growing scale imposes prohibitive costs in memory, computation, and
energy. Post-training quantization (PTQ) is a promising solution for efficient
deployment, yet achieving accurate W4A4 quantization remains an open challenge.
While most existing methods are designed for INT4 formats, the emergence of
MXFP4 -- a new FP4 format with various hardware support (NVIDIA, AMD, Intel)--
raises questions about the applicability of current techniques. In this work,
we establish a comprehensive benchmark of PTQ methods under the MXFP4 format.
Through systematic evaluation, we find that methods like GPTQ consistently
deliver strong performance, whereas rotation-based approaches, which are almost
used by all state-of-the-art approaches, suffer from severe incompatibility
with MXFP4. We further provide the first in-depth analysis of this conflict,
tracing its root to a fundamental mismatch between MXFP4's PoT (power-of-two)
block scaling and the redistribution of outlier energy via global rotation.
Building on this insight, we propose a simple yet effective block rotation
strategy that adapts rotation-based methods to MXFP4, leading to substantial
accuracy improvements across diverse LLMs. Our findings not only offer clear
guidance for practitioners but also set a foundation for advancing PTQ research
under emerging low-precision formats.

### [110] [The Strong Lottery Ticket Hypothesis for Multi-Head Attention Mechanisms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04217)
*Hikari Otsuka,Daiki Chijiwa,Yasuyuki Okoshi,Daichi Fujiki,Susumu Takeuchi,Masato Motomura*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The strong lottery ticket hypothesis (SLTH) is extended to multi-head attention (MHA) and transformers: randomly initialized MHAs with H heads and input dim d, requiring hidden dimension for keys/values of O(d log(Hd^{3/2})), contain a strong lottery ticket that approximates any target MHA with the same input dimension with high probability; extending SLTH to transformers without normalization; empirical results show approximation error decays exponentially as the source model's hidden dimension grows.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformers rely on multi-head attention (MHA), but existing SLTH theory did not account for MHA. The work aims to establish theoretical guarantees for the existence of strong lottery tickets within MHAs and extend SLTH to transformer architectures.

Method: The paper provides a theoretical analysis proving the existence of SLTs in randomly initialized MHAs by deriving a sufficient hidden dimension bound for keys/values. It then extends this result to transformers without normalization layers. Empirical experiments validate the theory by showing the SLT in a source MHA/transformer approximates a target counterpart with exponentially improving accuracy as the source hidden dimension increases.

Result: A randomly initialized MHA with H heads and input dim d contains a strong lottery ticket that, with hidden dimension O(d log(Hd^{3/2})) for key and value, can approximate any target MHA with the same input dimension with high probability. The theory extends to transformers without normalization layers. Empirically, the approximation error between the SLT in a source model and an approximate target decreases exponentially as the source hidden dimension grows.

Conclusion: The SLTH extends to MHAs and transformers, offering theoretical guarantees and empirical support that strong lottery tickets exist in transformer-related architectures, enabling accurate approximation of target MHAs/transformers as hidden dimensions scale.

Abstract: The strong lottery ticket hypothesis (SLTH) conjectures that high-performing
subnetworks, called strong lottery tickets (SLTs), are hidden in randomly
initialized neural networks. Although recent theoretical studies have
established the SLTH across various neural architectures, the SLTH for
transformer architectures still lacks theoretical understanding. In particular,
the current theory of the SLTH does not yet account for the multi-head
attention (MHA) mechanism, a core component of transformers. To address this
gap, we introduce a theoretical analysis of the existence of SLTs within MHAs.
We prove that, if a randomly initialized MHA of $H$ heads and input dimension
$d$ has the hidden dimension $O(d\log(Hd^{3/2}))$ for the key and value, it
contains an SLT that approximates an arbitrary MHA with the same input
dimension with high probability. Furthermore, by leveraging this theory for
MHAs, we extend the SLTH to transformers without normalization layers. We
empirically validate our theoretical findings, demonstrating that the
approximation error between the SLT within a source model (MHA and transformer)
and an approximate target counterpart decreases exponentially by increasing the
hidden dimension of the source model.

TL;DR: seqme is an open-source Python library that provides modular, model-agnostic metrics to evaluate designed biological sequences, covering sequence-based, embedding-based, and property-based metrics for DNA, RNA, peptides, and proteins; includes diagnostics and visualization; supports both one-shot and iterative design methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There was no single, unified tool to evaluate the fidelity of designed sequences to a target distribution and their properties across diverse biological sequence types, hindering standardized benchmarking and comparison of design methods.

Method: Introduce seqme with a modular architecture that organizes metrics into three groups (sequence-based, embedding-based, property-based). Provide multiple embedding and property models for biological sequences, along with diagnostic and visualization utilities. Ensure compatibility with a wide range of sequence types (DNA, ncRNA, mRNA, peptides, proteins, small molecules) and support both one-shot and iterative design workflows.

Result: A new open-source library (seqme) implementing model-agnostic metrics, embeddings, and property models, plus diagnostics/visualization for evaluating computational sequence design methods across various sequence Types.

Conclusion: seqme offers a unified framework for evaluating and comparing sequence-design methods, with broad applicability and extensibility to accommodate additional metrics, sequence types, and analyses.

Abstract: Recent advances in computational methods for designing biological sequences
have sparked the development of metrics to evaluate these methods performance
in terms of the fidelity of the designed sequences to a target distribution and
their attainment of desired properties. However, a single software library
implementing these metrics was lacking. In this work we introduce seqme, a
modular and highly extendable open-source Python library, containing
model-agnostic metrics for evaluating computational methods for biological
sequence design. seqme considers three groups of metrics: sequence-based,
embedding-based, and property-based, and is applicable to a wide range of
biological sequences: small molecules, DNA, ncRNA, mRNA, peptides and proteins.
The library offers a number of embedding and property models for biological
sequences, as well as diagnostics and visualization functions to inspect the
results. seqme can be used to evaluate both one-shot and iterative
computational design methods.

*Irene Ferfoglia,Simone Silvetti,Gaia Saveri,Laura Nenzi,Luca Bortolussi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: STELLE is a neuro-symbolic time-series classifier that embeds trajectories into a space of temporal-logic concepts using an STL-inspired kernel, yielding accurate predictions with local (STL-condition) and global explanations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Time-series classification is critical but dominated by black-box deep learning models, which impede interpretability, especially in safety-critical domains; there is a need for models that provide faithful explanations alongside predictions.

Method: Proposes STELLE, a neuro-symbolic framework that embeds time-series into a space of temporal logic concepts. Introduces an STL-inspired kernel mapping raw series to align with predefined STL formulas, enabling joint optimization of accuracy and interpretability and producing both local (per-prediction STL conditions) and global (class-differentiating formulas) explanations.

Result: STELLE achieves competitive accuracy while delivering logically faithful explanations, demonstrated on diverse real-world benchmarks.

Conclusion: The work shows that integrating temporal-logic grounded representations with learning can yield interpretable yet accurate time-series classifiers, supporting safer and more transparent AI in practice.

Abstract: Time series classification is a task of paramount importance, as this kind of
data often arises in safety-critical applications. However, it is typically
tackled with black-box deep learning methods, making it hard for humans to
understand the rationale behind their output. To take on this challenge, we
propose a novel approach, STELLE (Signal Temporal logic Embedding for
Logically-grounded Learning and Explanation), a neuro-symbolic framework that
unifies classification and explanation through direct embedding of trajectories
into a space of temporal logic concepts. By introducing a novel STL-inspired
kernel that maps raw time series to their alignment with predefined STL
formulae, our model jointly optimises accuracy and interpretability, as each
prediction is accompanied by the most relevant logical concepts that
characterise it. This yields (i) local explanations as human-readable STL
conditions justifying individual predictions, and (ii) global explanations as
class-characterising formulae. Experiments demonstrate that STELLE achieves
competitive accuracy while providing logically faithful explanations, validated
on diverse real-world benchmarks.

### [113] [Efficient Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback via Bayesian Preference Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04286)
*Matteo Cercola,Valeria Capretti,Simone Formentin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A hybrid RLHF-PBO framework with an acquisition-driven module improves sample efficiency and performance in high-dimensional preference optimization and LLM fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Collecting human preferences is expensive and time-consuming. RLHF scales well but is sample-inefficient; PBO is sample-efficient but less scalable. A combined approach aims to achieve both scalability and sample efficiency.

Method: Integrate an acquisition-driven module into the RLHF pipeline to enable active, query-efficient preference gathering. The acquisition function selects informative human feedback, enabling active learning within RLHF. Validate on two domains: high-dimensional preference optimization and LLM fine-tuning.

Result: The hybrid approach yields consistent improvements in both sample efficiency and overall performance across the evaluated tasks, demonstrating the benefits of combining RLHF scalability with PBO’s active querying.

Conclusion: The proposed acquisition-driven RLHF framework effectively unifies the strengths of RLHF and PBO, achieving more sample-efficient, scalable preference learning with potential applicability to a range of human-in-the-loop ML tasks.

Abstract: Learning from human preferences is a cornerstone of aligning machine learning
models with subjective human judgments. Yet, collecting such preference data is
often costly and time-consuming, motivating the need for more efficient
learning paradigms. Two established approaches offer complementary advantages:
RLHF scales effectively to high-dimensional tasks such as LLM fine-tuning,
while PBO achieves greater sample efficiency through active querying. We
propose a hybrid framework that unifies RLHF's scalability with PBO's query
efficiency by integrating an acquisition-driven module into the RLHF pipeline,
thereby enabling active and sample-efficient preference gathering. We validate
the proposed approach on two representative domains: (i) high-dimensional
preference optimization and (ii) LLM fine-tuning. Experimental results
demonstrate consistent improvements in both sample efficiency and overall
performance across these tasks.

*Antti Koskela,Tejas Kulkarni,Laith Zumot*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A DP framework for in-context learning that privately retrieves context via DP-compliant nearest-neighbor search and tracks privacy cost, improving privacy-utility over baselines on text classification and document QA.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In-context learning in large language models exposes privacy risks, especially during retrieval of relevant examples via similarity search. A privacy-preserving retrieval mechanism within a central DP budget is needed.

Method: Proposes a differential privacy framework for in-context learning that integrates nearest-neighbor retrieval from a context database with a privacy filter that accounts for the cumulative privacy cost of selected samples to stay within a central DP budget.

Result: Outperforms existing baselines by a substantial margin across evaluated benchmarks, achieving more favorable privacy-utility trade-offs. Experimental results on text classification and document question answering show clear advantages over baselines.

Conclusion: Integrating privacy-aware retrieval and budget accounting into DP-ICL yields significant gains and demonstrates the importance of the retrieval step in privacy-preserving LLM pipelines.

Abstract: Differentially private in-context learning (DP-ICL) has recently become an
active research topic due to the inherent privacy risks of in-context learning.
However, existing approaches overlook a critical component of modern large
language model (LLM) pipelines: the similarity search used to retrieve relevant
context data. In this work, we introduce a DP framework for in-context learning
that integrates nearest neighbor search of relevant examples in a privacy-aware
manner. Our method outperforms existing baselines by a substantial margin
across all evaluated benchmarks, achieving more favorable privacy-utility
trade-offs. To achieve this, we employ nearest neighbor retrieval from a
database of context data, combined with a privacy filter that tracks the
cumulative privacy cost of selected samples to ensure adherence to a central
differential privacy budget. Experimental results on text classification and
document question answering show a clear advantage of the proposed method over
existing baselines.

### [115] [LUME-DBN: Full Bayesian Learning of DBNs from Incomplete data in Intensive Care](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04333)
*Federico Pirola,Fabio Stella,Marco Grzegorczyk*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A Gibbs sampling-based Bayesian DBN learner imputes missing values as Gaussian latent variables, yielding improved reconstruction and uncertainty estimation over MICE in simulated and ICU data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Missing data and temporal dynamics in longitudinal healthcare hinder trustworthy inference; DBNs allow interpretable temporal modeling but require proper Bayesian handling of missing data to quantify uncertainty over time.

Method: Treat missing values as Gaussian latent variables and sample from their full conditional distributions within a Gibbs sampling framework to impute data and propagate uncertainty; apply this within learning of Dynamic Bayesian Networks.

Result: On simulated data and real ICU data from critically ill patients, the proposed method achieves superior reconstruction accuracy and better convergence properties compared to standard model-agnostic techniques like MICE, providing principled imputations and uncertainty estimates.

Conclusion: Incorporating full Bayesian inference into temporal models enhances imputations and model trustworthiness, enabling safer, more informed clinical decisions in settings with frequent missing data.

Abstract: Dynamic Bayesian networks (DBNs) are increasingly used in healthcare due to
their ability to model complex temporal relationships in patient data while
maintaining interpretability, an essential feature for clinical
decision-making. However, existing approaches to handling missing data in
longitudinal clinical datasets are largely derived from static Bayesian
networks literature, failing to properly account for the temporal nature of the
data. This gap limits the ability to quantify uncertainty over time, which is
particularly critical in settings such as intensive care, where understanding
the temporal dynamics is fundamental for model trustworthiness and
applicability across diverse patient groups. Despite the potential of DBNs, a
full Bayesian framework that integrates missing data handling remains
underdeveloped. In this work, we propose a novel Gibbs sampling-based method
for learning DBNs from incomplete data. Our method treats each missing value as
an unknown parameter following a Gaussian distribution. At each iteration, the
unobserved values are sampled from their full conditional distributions,
allowing for principled imputation and uncertainty estimation. We evaluate our
method on both simulated datasets and real-world intensive care data from
critically ill patients. Compared to standard model-agnostic techniques such as
MICE, our Bayesian approach demonstrates superior reconstruction accuracy and
convergence properties. These results highlight the clinical relevance of
incorporating full Bayesian inference in temporal models, providing more
reliable imputations and offering deeper insight into model behavior. Our
approach supports safer and more informed clinical decision-making,
particularly in settings where missing data are frequent and potentially
impactful.

### [116] [Spurious Correlation-Aware Embedding Regularization for Worst-Group Robustness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04401)
*Subeen Park,Joowang Kim,Hakyung Lee,Sunjae Yoo,Kyungwoo Song*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SCER regularizes embeddings to suppress spurious cues, improving worst-group robustness under distribution shifts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Subpopulation shifts cause models to rely on spurious correlations; existing methods lack a theoretical link between embeddings and worst-group error.

Method: Introduce Spurious Correlation-Aware Embedding Regularization for Worst-Group Robustness (SCER). Theoretical analysis shows worst-group error relates to reliance on spurious vs core directions, captured via group-wise mean embedding differences across domains/classes. SCER imposes embedding-level constraints to emphasize core features and dampen spurious cues.

Result: Empirically improves worst-group accuracy on multiple vision and language benchmarks; outperforms prior SOTA in worst-group accuracy. Code released.

Conclusion: Embedding-focused regularization provides a principled path to worst-group robustness, bridging theory with practice; suggests potential for broader domain adoption.

Abstract: Deep learning models achieve strong performance across various domains but
often rely on spurious correlations, making them vulnerable to distribution
shifts. This issue is particularly severe in subpopulation shift scenarios,
where models struggle in underrepresented groups. While existing methods have
made progress in mitigating this issue, their performance gains are still
constrained. They lack a rigorous theoretical framework connecting the
embedding space representations with worst-group error. To address this
limitation, we propose Spurious Correlation-Aware Embedding Regularization for
Worst-Group Robustness (SCER), a novel approach that directly regularizes
feature representations to suppress spurious cues. We show theoretically that
worst-group error is influenced by how strongly the classifier relies on
spurious versus core directions, identified from differences in group-wise mean
embeddings across domains and classes. By imposing theoretical constraints at
the embedding level, SCER encourages models to focus on core features while
reducing sensitivity to spurious patterns. Through systematic evaluation on
multiple vision and language, we show that SCER outperforms prior
state-of-the-art studies in worst-group accuracy. Our code is available at

### [117] [The Illusion of Certainty: Uncertainty quantification for LLMs fails under ambiguity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04418)
*Tim Tomov,Dominik Fuchsgruber,Tom Wollschläger,Stephan Günnemann*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Current UQ methods for LLMs fail under ambiguity; introduces MAQA* and AmbigQA* datasets with ground-truth answer distributions; shows deterioration across predictive distribution, internal representations, and ensembles; provides theoretical explanation; calls for rethinking UQ paradigms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world language exhibits aleatoric uncertainty; existing UQ benchmarks assume no ambiguity, leading to misleading performance; need evaluation under ambiguity.

Method: Create MAQA* and AmbigQA* datasets with ground-truth answer distributions estimated from factual co-occurrence; evaluate UQ estimators using predictive distribution, internal representations, and ensembles; provide theoretical explanation for limits.

Result: UQ estimators degrade to near-random on ambiguous data; deterioration consistent across estimation paradigms; predictive-distribution and ensemble-based estimators are fundamentally limited under ambiguity.

Conclusion: Current UQ methods for LLMs have a key shortcoming; modeling paradigms should be reconsidered to handle ambiguity and aleatoric uncertainty.

Abstract: Accurate uncertainty quantification (UQ) in Large Language Models (LLMs) is
critical for trustworthy deployment. While real-world language is inherently
ambiguous, reflecting aleatoric uncertainty, existing UQ methods are typically
benchmarked against tasks with no ambiguity. In this work, we demonstrate that
while current uncertainty estimators perform well under the restrictive
assumption of no ambiguity, they degrade to close-to-random performance on
ambiguous data. To this end, we introduce MAQA* and AmbigQA*, the first
ambiguous question-answering (QA) datasets equipped with ground-truth answer
distributions estimated from factual co-occurrence. We find this performance
deterioration to be consistent across different estimation paradigms: using the
predictive distribution itself, internal representations throughout the model,
and an ensemble of models. We show that this phenomenon can be theoretically
explained, revealing that predictive-distribution and ensemble-based estimators
are fundamentally limited under ambiguity. Overall, our study reveals a key
shortcoming of current UQ methods for LLMs and motivates a rethinking of
current modeling paradigms.

### [118] [On the Equivalence of Regression and Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04422)
*Jayadeva,Naman Dwivedi,Hari Krishnan,N. M. Anoop Krishnan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A formal link is established between regression and classification via a data augmentation mapping: M regression samples on a hyperplane correspond to 2M linearly separable classification samples; margin maximization in the classification form yields a different regression objective; a new regressability measure is proposed; neural nets can be trained to learn a linearizing map to enable linear regression in the transformed space.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To clarify and strengthen the theoretical bond between regression and classification, leverage margin concepts to rethink regression objectives, quantify how hard regression is (regressability), and provide a practical representation-learning approach (linearizing map) that makes linear regression effective.

Method: Demonstrate a one-to-one equivalence between M hyperplane-regression samples and 2M linearly separable-classification samples. Show that margin maximization on the equivalent classification task induces a different regression formulation than standard ones. Introduce a regressability measure derived from this equivalence. Use the framework to train neural networks to learn a linearizing map that transforms inputs to a space where a linear regressor suffices.

Result: Establishes the stated equivalence and shows margin-based classification informs a distinct regression objective. Proposes the regressability measure to gauge regression difficulty without fitting a model. Demonstrates training neural networks to learn an input transformation that makes linear regression viable in the transformed space.

Conclusion: The work provides a conceptual bridge between regression and classification, introduces a practical regression-difficulty metric, and offers a representation-learning pathway to render regression effectively linear through learned mappings.

Abstract: A formal link between regression and classification has been tenuous. Even
though the margin maximization term $\|w\|$ is used in support vector
regression, it has at best been justified as a regularizer. We show that a
regression problem with $M$ samples lying on a hyperplane has a one-to-one
equivalence with a linearly separable classification task with $2M$ samples. We
show that margin maximization on the equivalent classification task leads to a
different regression formulation than traditionally used. Using the
equivalence, we demonstrate a ``regressability'' measure, that can be used to
estimate the difficulty of regressing a dataset, without needing to first learn
a model for it. We use the equivalence to train neural networks to learn a
linearizing map, that transforms input variables into a space where a linear
regressor is adequate.

### [119] [ForecastGAN: A Decomposition-Based Adversarial Framework for Multi-Horizon Time Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04445)
*Syeda Sitara Wishal Fatima,Afshin Rahimi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ForecastGAN is a decomposition-based adversarial framework for multi-horizon time series forecasting that combines decomposition, model selection, and conditional GAN training to handle both numerical and categorical features; it outperforms transformer baselines in short-term forecasting and remains competitive for long-term horizons across 11 datasets, with less hyperparameter tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer-based time series models excel at long-term predictions but underperform for short horizons and often neglect categorical features; there is a need for a robust, adaptable framework that performs across horizons and leverages both numerical and categorical data.

Method: Three integrated modules: (1) Decomposition Module to extract seasonality and trend; (2) Model Selection Module to identify optimal neural network configurations based on forecasting horizon; (3) Adversarial Training Module employing Conditional GAN to enhance robustness, enabling integration of numerical and categorical features; tested across multiple horizons on 11 datasets; minimal hyperparameter tuning.

Result: ForecastGAN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art transformer models for short-term forecasts and remains competitive for long-term horizons across 11 benchmark multivariate data; demonstrates generalizability across diverse datasets and context; reduces need for extensive hyperparameter tuning.

Conclusion: Proposes a generalizable forecasting framework that adapts to context and maintains strong performance across data characteristics by combining decomposition, horizon-aware model selection, and adversarial training, while incorporating categorical information.

Abstract: Time series forecasting is essential across domains from finance to supply
chain management. This paper introduces ForecastGAN, a novel decomposition
based adversarial framework addressing limitations in existing approaches for
multi-horizon predictions. Although transformer models excel in long-term
forecasting, they often underperform in short-term scenarios and typically
ignore categorical features. ForecastGAN operates through three integrated
modules: a Decomposition Module that extracts seasonality and trend components;
a Model Selection Module that identifies optimal neural network configurations
based on forecasting horizon; and an Adversarial Training Module that enhances
prediction robustness through Conditional Generative Adversarial Network
training. Unlike conventional approaches, ForecastGAN effectively integrates
both numerical and categorical features. We validate our framework on eleven
benchmark multivariate time series datasets that span various forecasting
horizons. The results show that ForecastGAN consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art transformer models for short-term forecasting while remaining
competitive for long-term horizons. This research establishes a more
generalizable approach to time series forecasting that adapts to specific
contexts while maintaining strong performance across diverse data
characteristics without extensive hyperparameter tuning.

### [120] [Federated Stochastic Minimax Optimization under Heavy-Tailed Noises](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04456)
*Xinwen Zhang,Hongchang Gao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Two federated minimax optimization algorithms (Fed-NSGDA-M and FedMuon-DA) tackle heavy-tailed gradient noise, achieving a convergence rate of O((TNp)^-(s-1)/(2s)); they are the first to provide theoretical guarantees in this setting and are validated by experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Heavy-tailed gradient noise is a more realistic assumption than bounded variance in stochastic optimization, especially in federated learning. There is a need for provable guarantees for nonconvex-PL minimax problems under such noise.

Method: Introduce Fed-NSGDA-M (normalized gradients) and FedMuon-DA (Muon optimizer for local updates). These algorithms are designed to handle heavy-tailed noise under milder conditions and come with theoretical convergence guarantees for federated nonconvex-PL minimax problems.

Result: Both algorithms achieve a convergence rate of O(1/(TNp)^{(s-1)/(2s)}). They are claimed to be the first federated minimax optimization methods with rigorous guarantees under heavy-tailed noise, with extensive experiments validating performance.

Conclusion: The work advances federated minimax optimization under heavy-tailed noise by providing practical algorithms with provable guarantees and empirical validation, highlighting a new direction for studying heavy-tailed effects in federated nonconvex-PL minimax problems.

Abstract: Heavy-tailed noise has attracted growing attention in nonconvex stochastic
optimization, as numerous empirical studies suggest it offers a more realistic
assumption than standard bounded variance assumption. In this work, we
investigate nonconvex-PL minimax optimization under heavy-tailed gradient noise
in federated learning. We propose two novel algorithms: Fed-NSGDA-M, which
integrates normalized gradients, and FedMuon-DA, which leverages the Muon
optimizer for local updates. Both algorithms are designed to effectively
address heavy-tailed noise in federated minimax optimization, under a milder
condition. We theoretically establish that both algorithms achieve a
convergence rate of $O({1}/{(TNp)^{\frac{s-1}{2s}}})$. To the best of our
knowledge, these are the first federated minimax optimization algorithms with
rigorous theoretical guarantees under heavy-tailed noise. Extensive experiments
further validate their effectiveness.

*Dennis Thumm,Luis Ontaneda Mijares*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A Time-series Neural Causal Model VAE (TNCM-VAE) that integrates variational autoencoders with structural causal models to generate counterfactual financial time series, enforcing DAG constraints in the decoder and training with a causal Wasserstein distance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Lack of causal reasoning in deep generative models for financial data hinders counterfactual analysis and risk assessment; need for models that preserve both temporal dependencies and causal relationships.

Method: A VAE-based framework augmented with structural causal models, where the decoder enforces directed acyclic graph (DAG) causal constraints and training uses the causal Wasserstein distance; validated on synthetic autoregressive processes inspired by the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck model.

Result: Accurate counterfactual probability estimation with low L1 distances to ground truth (as low as 0.03–0.10); demonstrates superior performance in generating plausible counterfactual trajectories that respect causal mechanisms.

Conclusion: Enables financial stress testing, scenario analysis, and enhanced backtesting by producing counterfactual market trajectories consistent with underlying causal structures.

Abstract: Market generators using deep generative models have shown promise for
synthetic financial data generation, but existing approaches lack causal
reasoning capabilities essential for counterfactual analysis and risk
assessment. We propose a Time-series Neural Causal Model VAE (TNCM-VAE) that
combines variational autoencoders with structural causal models to generate
counterfactual financial time series while preserving both temporal
dependencies and causal relationships. Our approach enforces causal constraints
through directed acyclic graphs in the decoder architecture and employs the
causal Wasserstein distance for training. We validate our method on synthetic
autoregressive models inspired by the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, demonstrating
superior performance in counterfactual probability estimation with L1 distances
as low as 0.03-0.10 compared to ground truth. The model enables financial
stress testing, scenario analysis, and enhanced backtesting by generating
plausible counterfactual market trajectories that respect underlying causal
mechanisms.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes SynthKGQA to generate synthetic KG-QA datasets with full ground-truth facts, enabling benchmarking and training of KG retrievers; applies to Wikidata to produce GTSQA for zero-shot generalization tests and KG-augmented LLM benchmarking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the lack of challenging, ground-truth KG retrieval QA datasets, which hampers evaluation and training of KG-augmented LLMs and retrievers. Provide a framework to generate high-quality synthetic data and ground-truth reasoning paths from any KG.

Method: Introduce SynthKGQA, a framework that converts any Knowledge Graph into a synthetic KG-QA dataset with complete ground-truth facts for each question. We apply it to Wikidata to generate GTSQA, a dataset aimed at testing zero-shot generalization to unseen graph structures and relation types, and for benchmarking KG-augmented LLM methods.

Result: SynthKGQA enables more informative benchmarking of KG retrievers and improves model training by providing rich, ground-truth reasoning data. GTSQA serves as a stress test for zero-shot generalization to unseen graph structures and relations and is used to benchmark existing KG-augmented LLM solutions.

Conclusion: SynthKGQA is a versatile tool for generating higher-quality KG-QA benchmarks and training data, and GTSQA provides a targeted test bed for zero-shot generalization and benchmarking of KG-based LLM retrieval approaches.

Abstract: Retrieval of information from graph-structured knowledge bases represents a
promising direction for improving the factuality of LLMs. While various
solutions have been proposed, a comparison of methods is difficult due to the
lack of challenging QA datasets with ground-truth targets for graph retrieval.
We present SynthKGQA, a framework for generating high-quality synthetic
Knowledge Graph Question Answering datasets from any Knowledge Graph, providing
the full set of ground-truth facts in the KG to reason over each question. We
show how, in addition to enabling more informative benchmarking of KG
retrievers, the data produced with SynthKGQA also allows us to train better
models. We apply SynthKGQA to Wikidata to generate GTSQA, a new dataset
designed to test zero-shot generalization abilities of KG retrievers with
respect to unseen graph structures and relation types, and benchmark popular
solutions for KG-augmented LLMs on it.

### [123] [Q3R: Quadratic Reweighted Rank Regularizer for Effective Low-Rank Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04485)
*Ipsita Ghosh,Ethan Nguyen,Christian Kümmerle*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Q3R introduces a quadratic reweighted rank regularizer for inducing low-rank training, enabling training with prescribed low ranks while maintaining near-dense performance. Demonstrated on ViT-Tiny CIFAR-10 with 60% and 80% parameter pruning, incurring only ~1.3% and ~4% accuracy loss. Broadly effective for Transformers in image and language tasks, including low-rank fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current parameter-efficient methods (low-rank fine-tuning) struggle on low-rank pre-training tasks due to difficulty in maintaining the low-rank structure and the objective. There is a need for a training strategy that enforces a low-rank constraint while preserving predictive performance and compatibility with existing architectures.

Method: Introduce Quadratic Reweighted Rank Regularizer (Q3R), inspired by the IRLS framework. Q3R uses a quadratic regularizer that majorizes a smoothed log-determinant surrogate of rank. This yields a low-rank inducing training process that can target a prescribed low rank, with modest computational overhead and full architectural compatibility.

Result: Empirical results show the ability to truncate 60% and 80% of ViT-Tiny parameters with CIFAR-10 accuracy drops of about 1.3% and 4%, respectively. The approach is effective across Transformers in both vision and language tasks, including for low-rank fine-tuning.

Conclusion: Q3R offers a novel, low-overhead, low-rank inducing training strategy that enables efficient, high-performing Transformer models with prescribed low ranks and broad applicability to image and language tasks.

Abstract: Parameter-efficient training, based on low-rank optimization, has become a
highly successful tool for fine-tuning large deep-learning models. However,
these methods fail at low-rank pre-training tasks where maintaining the
low-rank structure and the objective remains a challenging task. We propose the
Quadratic Reweighted Rank Regularizer dubbed Q3R, which leads to a novel
low-rank inducing training strategy inspired by the iteratively reweighted
least squares (IRLS) framework. Q3R is based on a quadratic regularizer term
which majorizes a smoothed log determinant serving as rank surrogate objective.
Unlike other low-rank training techniques, Q3R is able to train weight matrices
with prescribed, low target ranks of models that achieve comparable predictive
performance as dense models, with small computational overhead, while remaining
fully compatible with existing architectures. For example, we demonstrated one
experiment where we are able to truncate $60\%$ and $80\%$ of the parameters of
a ViT-Tiny model with $~1.3\%$ and $~4\%$ accuracy drop in CIFAR-10 performance
respectively. The efficacy of Q3R is confirmed on Transformers across both
image and language tasks, including for low-rank fine-tuning.

### [124] [Distribution-Aware Tensor Decomposition for Compression of Convolutional Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04494)
*Alper Kalle,Theo Rudkiewicz,Mohamed-Oumar Ouerfelli,Mohamed Tamaazousti*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A data-informed tensor compression method for CNNs using covariance-weighted norms and ALS-based Tucker-2/CPD decompositions, achieving strong compression with little/no fine-tuning and cross-dataset transferability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional low-rank compression minimizes isotropic weight-space errors, which may not reflect how changes affect layer outputs. This work uses a function-space, data-informed norm based on input covariance to preserve behavior and enables covariance transfer across datasets.

Method: Minimize the norm ||(W - W~) Σ^{1/2}||F where Σ^{1/2} is the input covariance; develop alternating least squares algorithms for Tucker-2 and CPD that optimize this objective; show that the same covariance-based norm can transfer between datasets, facilitating compression without original training data.

Result: Often competitive accuracy without fine-tuning; the covariance-based norm transfers with only minor accuracy drop; validated on CNNs (ResNet-18/50, GoogLeNet) and datasets (ImageNet, FGVC-Aircraft, CIFAR-10/100).

Conclusion: Data-informed tensor compression provides effective, transferable compression without heavy retraining, expanding practical applicability of tensorized networks.

Abstract: Neural networks are widely used for image-related tasks but typically demand
considerable computing power. Once a network has been trained, however, its
memory- and compute-footprint can be reduced by compression. In this work, we
focus on compression through tensorization and low-rank representations.
Whereas classical approaches search for a low-rank approximation by minimizing
an isotropic norm such as the Frobenius norm in weight-space, we use
data-informed norms that measure the error in function space. Concretely, we
minimize the change in the layer's output distribution, which can be expressed
as $\lVert (W - \widetilde{W}) \Sigma^{1/2}\rVert_F$ where $\Sigma^{1/2}$ is
the square root of the covariance matrix of the layer's input and $W$,
$\widetilde{W}$ are the original and compressed weights. We propose new
alternating least square algorithms for the two most common tensor
decompositions (Tucker-2 and CPD) that directly optimize the new norm. Unlike
conventional compression pipelines, which almost always require
post-compression fine-tuning, our data-informed approach often achieves
competitive accuracy without any fine-tuning. We further show that the same
covariance-based norm can be transferred from one dataset to another with only
a minor accuracy drop, enabling compression even when the original training
dataset is unavailable. Experiments on several CNN architectures (ResNet-18/50,
and GoogLeNet) and datasets (ImageNet, FGVC-Aircraft, Cifar10, and Cifar100)
confirm the advantages of the proposed method.

*Shaolong Wu,James Blume,Geshi Yeung*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A fairness framework for criminal-justice risk tools that relaxes exact parity by minimizing a weighted error loss with a tolerance on false negative rate differences, improving practicality and guiding deployment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To resolve conflicts among group, individual, and process fairness and to address real-world constraints in public decision systems, including biased/incomplete data, latent affirmative action, and proliferating subgroup constraints, while ensuring legitimacy.

Method: Review of fairness notions; propose a modification to standard group fairness by optimizing a weighted error loss with a small tolerance on differences in false negative rates; analyze three critique classes; propose a practical deployment framework for public decision systems based on need-based decisions, transparency/accountability, and narrowly tailored definitions/solutions.

Result: The modification makes optimization easier and can improve predictive accuracy, clarifies the ethical cost tradeoffs, and yields a practical deployment framework for agencies using risk assessment tools.

Conclusion: Provides a bridge between theory and practice by linking technical design to legitimacy and offering actionable guidance for deploying risk assessment and related tools in public decision-making.

Abstract: Algorithmic fairness has grown rapidly as a research area, yet key concepts
remain unsettled, especially in criminal justice. We review group, individual,
and process fairness and map the conditions under which they conflict. We then
develop a simple modification to standard group fairness. Rather than exact
parity across protected groups, we minimize a weighted error loss while keeping
differences in false negative rates within a small tolerance. This makes
solutions easier to find, can raise predictive accuracy, and surfaces the
ethical choice of error costs. We situate this proposal within three classes of
critique: biased and incomplete data, latent affirmative action, and the
explosion of subgroup constraints. Finally, we offer a practical framework for
deployment in public decision systems built on three pillars: need-based
decisions, Transparency and accountability, and narrowly tailored definitions
and solutions. Together, these elements link technical design to legitimacy and
provide actionable guidance for agencies that use risk assessment and related
tools.

### [126] [Linear Mode Connectivity under Data Shifts for Deep Ensembles of Image Classifiers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04514)
*C. Hepburn,T. Zielke,A. P. Raulf*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Data shifts act as extra stochastic gradient noise; with small learning rates and large batch sizes, models may converge to different regions of the loss landscape rather than the exact same minimum. Overall, LMC trades training efficiency for gains from larger, more diverse ensembles, though errors tend to be correlated across LMC models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how linear mode connectivity behaves under data shifts and identify practical hyperparameter settings that mitigate the impact of shifts on convergence, generalization, and ensemble diversity.

Method: Experimental analysis of linear mode connectivity (LMC) under data shifts. Treat data shifts as additional SGD noise, examine the effects of learning rate and batch size on convergence to the same local minimum versus different regions of the loss landscape, and assess error similarity across models to evaluate ensemble diversity; report that code will be publicly released.

Result: Data shifts introduce extra SGD noise; smaller learning rates and larger batch sizes reduce this noise, influencing whether LMC models converge to the same minimum or to regions with different smoothness and generalization. LMC models tend to make similar errors more often than models in different basins, but LMC offers a balance between training efficiency and gains from larger, more diverse ensembles.

Conclusion: Data shifts can be mitigated by appropriate hyperparameter choices (smaller learning rates, larger batches). LMC provides a practical trade-off: efficient training with potential benefits from more diverse ensembles, at the cost of higher error correlation among co-trained models. Code and supplementary materials will be publicly available.

Abstract: The phenomenon of linear mode connectivity (LMC) links several aspects of
deep learning, including training stability under noisy stochastic gradients,
the smoothness and generalization of local minima (basins), the similarity and
functional diversity of sampled models, and architectural effects on data
processing. In this work, we experimentally study LMC under data shifts and
identify conditions that mitigate their impact. We interpret data shifts as an
additional source of stochastic gradient noise, which can be reduced through
small learning rates and large batch sizes. These parameters influence whether
models converge to the same local minimum or to regions of the loss landscape
with varying smoothness and generalization. Although models sampled via LMC
tend to make similar errors more frequently than those converging to different
basins, the benefit of LMC lies in balancing training efficiency against the
gains achieved from larger, more diverse ensembles. Code and supplementary
materials will be made publicly available at https://github.com/DLR-KI/LMC in
due course.

*Obed Amo,Samit Ghosh,Markus Lange-Hegermann,Bogdan Raiţă,Michael Pokojovy*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A boundary-constrained EPGP surrogate outperforms CN-FEM under degrees-of-freedom matching for the 2D wave equation, achieving roughly two orders of magnitude higher accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Evaluate and compare the accuracy of a boundary-constrained Ehrenpreis–Palamodov Gaussian Process surrogate against a classical CN-FEM discretization for the 2D wave equation, using a fair DoF-matching protocol.

Method: Construct a B-EPGP surrogate using exponential-polynomial bases derived from the PDE's characteristic variety to enforce the PDE and homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions exactly. Estimate coefficients with penalized least squares. Introduce a DoF-matching protocol to ensure fair comparison with CN-FEM (Crank–Nicolson in time).

Result: Under matched DoF, B-EPGP achieves lower space-time L2-error and lower maximum-in-time L2-error in space than CN-FEM, with accuracy improved by about two orders of magnitude.

Conclusion: Boundary-constrained EPGP provides substantially more accurate surrogates for this 2D wave problem under fair comparison; the DoF-matching protocol is crucial for a fair assessment and suggests potential applicability to broader PDE settings.

Abstract: We present a new benchmarking study comparing a boundary-constrained
Ehrenpreis--Palamodov Gaussian Process (B-EPGP) surrogate with a classical
finite element method combined with Crank--Nicolson time stepping (CN-FEM) for
solving the two-dimensional wave equation with homogeneous Dirichlet boundary
conditions. The B-EPGP construction leverages exponential-polynomial bases
derived from the characteristic variety to enforce the PDE and boundary
conditions exactly and employs penalized least squares to estimate the
coefficients. To ensure fairness across paradigms, we introduce a
degrees-of-freedom (DoF) matching protocol. Under matched DoF, B-EPGP
consistently attains lower space-time $L^2$-error and maximum-in-time
$L^{2}$-error in space than CN-FEM, improving accuracy by roughly two orders of
magnitude.

*Daniel Mayfrank,Kayra Dernek,Laura Lang,Alexander Mitsos,Manuel Dahmen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A reinforcement-learning guided Koopman surrogate for eNMPC scales to a large-scale nitrogen air separation unit, preserving economic performance while avoiding constraint violations under partial observability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable reliable, scalable economic nonlinear model predictive control for large-scale, constrained processes using Koopman surrogates trained via reinforcement learning, addressing constraint violations and limited measurements.

Method: Extend a previously proposed RL-based Koopman surrogate approach for eNMPC to a large-scale demand-response case study of a single-product nitrogen air separation unit, assuming only a subset of plant variables is observable, and compare against a purely system-identification-based Koopman eNMPC.

Result: The RL-trained Koopman eNMPC achieves comparable economic performance to the ID-based Koopman eNMPC but avoids constraint violations, demonstrating good scalability to a large-scale industrial system under partial observability.

Conclusion: The proposed RL-guided Koopman eNMPC offers scalable, constraint-safe economic control for large nonlinear plants, suggesting broader applicability in demand-response scenarios where observability is limited.

Abstract: With our recently proposed method based on reinforcement learning (Mayfrank
et al. (2024), Comput. Chem. Eng. 190), Koopman surrogate models can be trained
for optimal performance in specific (economic) nonlinear model predictive
control ((e)NMPC) applications. So far, our method has exclusively been
demonstrated on a small-scale case study. Herein, we show that our method
scales well to a more challenging demand response case study built on a
large-scale model of a single-product (nitrogen) air separation unit. Across
all numerical experiments, we assume observability of only a few realistically
measurable plant variables. Compared to a purely system identification-based
Koopman eNMPC, which generates small economic savings but frequently violates
constraints, our method delivers similar economic performance while avoiding
constraint violations.

*Jonas E. Katona,Emily K. de Jong,Nipun Gunawardena*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A post hoc, model-agnostic uncertainty quantification framework for latent-space ROMs using conformal prediction, enabling prediction intervals for latent dynamics, reconstruction, and end-to-end predictions; demonstrated on cloud microphysics modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ROMs are efficient for high-dimensional systems but lack robust, flexible uncertainty quantification. Existing UQ methods are often tied to specific architectures or training setups, hindering generalization and applicability. A post hoc, architecture-agnostic UQ method is needed to provide reliable intervals without altering models.

Method: A post hoc framework that uses conformal prediction in latent-space ROMs. It is model-agnostic and requires no changes to architecture or training. It yields statistical prediction intervals for multiple components of the ROM pipeline: latent dynamics, reconstruction, and end-to-end predictions.

Result: Applied to a latent-space dynamical model for cloud microphysics. The method produced accurate predictions of droplet-size distribution evolution and provided quantified uncertainty across the ROM pipeline.

Conclusion: Conformal prediction enables reliable uncertainty quantification in latent-space ROMs without modifying the underlying model or training procedure, improving robustness and interpretability of ROM-based simulations; promising for broader ROM applications.

Abstract: Reduced-order models (ROMs) can efficiently simulate high-dimensional
physical systems, but lack robust uncertainty quantification methods. Existing
approaches are frequently architecture- or training-specific, which limits
flexibility and generalization. We introduce a post hoc, model-agnostic
framework for predictive uncertainty quantification in latent space ROMs that
requires no modification to the underlying architecture or training procedure.
Using conformal prediction, our approach estimates statistical prediction
intervals for multiple components of the ROM pipeline: latent dynamics,
reconstruction, and end-to-end predictions. We demonstrate the method on a
latent space dynamical model for cloud microphysics, where it accurately
predicts the evolution of droplet-size distributions and quantifies uncertainty
across the ROM pipeline.

### [130] [Integrating Temporal and Structural Context in Graph Transformers for Relational Deep Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04557)
*Divyansha Lachi,Mahmoud Mohammadi,Joe Meyer,Vinam Arora,Tom Palczewski,Eva L. Dyer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes Temporal Subgraph Sampler and Relational Graph Perceiver (RGP) to model temporal dynamics in relational graphs and enable multi-task learning, achieving state-of-the-art on RelBench, SALT, CTU.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Relational data involve long-range spatial/temporal dependencies across diverse entity types and tasks; current graph models largely ignore temporal signals as a predictive feature beyond filtering, and are typically single-task.

Method: Introduce a temporal subgraph sampler to retrieve temporally relevant nodes beyond the immediate neighborhood; present Relational Graph Perceiver (RGP), a graph transformer with a cross-attention-based latent bottleneck to fuse structural and temporal contexts, plus a cross-attention decoder enabling joint learning across tasks with disjoint label spaces within a single model.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on RelBench, SALT, and CTU datasets, demonstrating a general and scalable solution for relational deep learning with temporal dynamics and multi-task support.

Conclusion: RGP provides a general framework for relational deep learning that effectively integrates temporal dynamics and supports multi-task prediction across diverse domains and labels.

Abstract: In domains such as healthcare, finance, and e-commerce, the temporal dynamics
of relational data emerge from complex interactions-such as those between
patients and providers, or users and products across diverse categories. To be
broadly useful, models operating on these data must integrate long-range
spatial and temporal dependencies across diverse types of entities, while also
supporting multiple predictive tasks. However, existing graph models for
relational data primarily focus on spatial structure, treating temporal
information merely as a filtering constraint to exclude future events rather
than a modeling signal, and are typically designed for single-task prediction.
To address these gaps, we introduce a temporal subgraph sampler that enhances
global context by retrieving nodes beyond the immediate neighborhood to capture
temporally relevant relationships. In addition, we propose the Relational Graph
Perceiver (RGP), a graph transformer architecture for relational deep learning
that leverages a cross-attention-based latent bottleneck to efficiently
integrate information from both structural and temporal contexts. This latent
bottleneck integrates signals from different node and edge types into a common
latent space, enabling the model to build global context across the entire
relational system. RGP also incorporates a flexible cross-attention decoder
that supports joint learning across tasks with disjoint label spaces within a
single model. Experiments on RelBench, SALT, and CTU show that RGP delivers
state-of-the-art performance, offering a general and scalable solution for
relational deep learning with support for diverse predictive tasks.

### [131] [ARETE: an R package for Automated REtrieval from TExt with large language models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04573)
*Vasco V. Branco,Jandó Benedek,Lidia Pivovarova,Luís Correia,Pedro Cardoso*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: An open-source R package ARETE uses large language models to automate extraction of species-occurrence data from literature via OCR and validation, validated against human annotators, and demonstrates substantial expansion of species extents, potentially transforming conservation planning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Key species data are scarce and often not machine-readable; the rapid pace of environmental change requires fast data collection, but crucial data exist in publications that are hard to machine-read and labor-intensive to extract.

Method: ARETE is an open-source R package that automates data extraction of species occurrences using large language models (via the ChatGPT API). It integrates steps from Optical Character Recognition to outlier detection and tabular output, and validates automated results against human annotators. The approach was demonstrated by comparing automatically extracted data with GBIF-based ranges for 100 spider species.

Result: Newly extracted data expanded the Extent of Occurrence by a mean of three orders of magnitude, revealing previously undocumented areas and potentially affecting spatial conservation planning and extinction risk assessments.

Conclusion: ARETE enables faster access to previously untapped occurrence data, allowing researchers to prioritize manual verification for a subset of species while maintaining automated extraction for the majority; the workflow also supports planning by predicting bibliographic data availability.

Abstract: 1. A hard stop for the implementation of rigorous conservation initiatives is
our lack of key species data, especially occurrence data. Furthermore,
researchers have to contend with an accelerated speed at which new information
must be collected and processed due to anthropogenic activity. Publications
ranging from scientific papers to gray literature contain this crucial
information but their data are often not machine-readable, requiring extensive
human work to be retrieved. 2. We present the ARETE R package, an open-source
software aiming to automate data extraction of species occurrences powered by
large language models, namely using the chatGPT Application Programming
Interface. This R package integrates all steps of the data extraction and
validation process, from Optical Character Recognition to detection of outliers
and output in tabular format. Furthermore, we validate ARETE through systematic
comparison between what is modelled and the work of human annotators. 3. We
demonstrate the usefulness of the approach by comparing range maps produced
using GBIF data and with those automatically extracted for 100 species of
spiders. Newly extracted data allowed to expand the known Extent of Occurrence
by a mean three orders of magnitude, revealing new areas where the species were
found in the past, which mayhave important implications for spatial
conservation planning and extinction risk assessments. 4. ARETE allows faster
access to hitherto untapped occurrence data, a potential game changer in
projects requiring such data. Researchers will be able to better prioritize
resources, manually verifying selected species while maintaining automated
extraction for the majority. This workflow also allows predicting available
bibliographic data during project planning.

### [132] [Complexity as Advantage: A Regret-Based Perspective on Emergent Structure](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04590)
*Oshri Naparstek*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes Complexity as Advantage (CAA): a framework defining complexity relative to observers via predictive regret; complexity exists when some observers find the system easy to predict and others find it hard, creating an information advantage. Unifies emergent notions like multiscale entropy, predictive information, and observer-dependent structure; demonstrated on simple dynamical models; discusses implications for learning, evolution, and artificial agents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a quantitative, observer-relative account of complexity that explains why certain systems are functionally valuable and how diverse emergent notions can be unified under a single framework.

Method: Define complexity as predictive regret across a family of observers; formalize a measurement framework for observer-specific predictability; show that the framework subsumes multiscale entropy, predictive information, and observer-dependent structure; illustrate via simple dynamical models.

Result: A unifying framework that connects multiple emergent notions (multiscale entropy, predictive information, observer-dependent structure); identifies complexity with differentiated predictive regret across observers; validated conceptually on simple dynamical systems and discussed implications for learning, evolution, and artificial agents.

Conclusion: CAA provides a principled, observer-relative metric of complexity with broad implications, suggesting that interesting systems are those that yield differentiated regret across observers and offering a quantitative basis for the functional value of complexity.

Abstract: We introduce Complexity as Advantage (CAA), a framework that defines the
complexity of a system relative to a family of observers. Instead of measuring
complexity as an intrinsic property, we evaluate how much predictive regret a
system induces for different observers attempting to model it. A system is
complex when it is easy for some observers and hard for others, creating an
information advantage. We show that this formulation unifies several notions of
emergent behavior, including multiscale entropy, predictive information, and
observer-dependent structure. The framework suggests that "interesting" systems
are those positioned to create differentiated regret across observers,
providing a quantitative grounding for why complexity can be functionally
valuable. We demonstrate the idea through simple dynamical models and discuss
implications for learning, evolution, and artificial agents.

### [133] [Regret Lower Bounds for Decentralized Multi-Agent Stochastic Shortest Path Problems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04594)
*Utkarsh U. Chavan,Prashant Trivedi,Nandyala Hemachandra*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: In Decentralized Multi-Agent SSPs with linear models, the paper derives symmetry-based structure of optimal policies and proves the first regret lower bound, Omega(sqrt(K)), for any number of agents, highlighting inherent learning difficulty in decentralized control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in understanding learning dynamics and performance limits in decentralized SSPs with multiple agents, motivating a formal regret lower bound and insights for algorithm design.

Method: Model Dec-MASSPs with linear transition costs, use symmetry-based arguments to characterize optimal policy structure, and construct hard-to-learn instances to establish a regret lower bound across K episodes for any n.

Result: Establishes a regret lower bound Omega(sqrt(K)) for Dec-MASSPs with linear models, via hard instances; demonstrates fundamental learning difficulty in decentralized control across any number of agents.

Conclusion: Provides fundamental limits on learning in decentralized SSPs, guiding the design of more efficient learning algorithms and highlighting intrinsic complexity in multi-agent coordination tasks.

Abstract: Multi-agent systems (MAS) are central to applications such as swarm robotics
and traffic routing, where agents must coordinate in a decentralized manner to
achieve a common objective. Stochastic Shortest Path (SSP) problems provide a
natural framework for modeling decentralized control in such settings. While
the problem of learning in SSP has been extensively studied in single-agent
settings, the decentralized multi-agent variant remains largely unexplored. In
this work, we take a step towards addressing that gap. We study decentralized
multi-agent SSPs (Dec-MASSPs) under linear function approximation, where the
transition dynamics and costs are represented using linear models. Applying
novel symmetry-based arguments, we identify the structure of optimal policies.
Our main contribution is the first regret lower bound for this setting based on
the construction of hard-to-learn instances for any number of agents, $n$. Our
regret lower bound of $\Omega(\sqrt{K})$, over $K$ episodes, highlights the
inherent learning difficulty in Dec-MASSPs. These insights clarify the learning
complexity of decentralized control and can further guide the design of
efficient learning algorithms in multi-agent systems.

### [134] [Environment Agnostic Goal-Conditioning, A Study of Reward-Free Autonomous Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04598)
*Hampus Åström,Elin Anna Topp,Jacek Malec*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Transforms RL into a goal-conditioned, reward-free framework where agents autonomously select goals; training is comparable to guided RL; average performance improves and stabilizes across goals, though individual goals may be unstable; enables environment-agnostic pretraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enable autonomous, reward-free learning and broad pretraining across environments by removing task-specific reward shaping; address instability when treating all goals equally.

Method: Convert environments to a goal-conditioned setting; allow agents to self-select goals in an environment-agnostic manner; use off-policy learning without needing explicit goal weighting; train to maximize success on chosen goals; evaluate via average goal success rate.

Result: Average goal success rate improves and stabilizes despite instability for individual goals; training times comparable to externally guided RL; agents can be instructed to seek any observations, enabling generic pretraining before task-specific use.

Conclusion: Environment-agnostic, goal-conditioned learning provides a practical pretraining paradigm that is independent of the specific off-policy algorithm used; useful for generic preparation before deployment to specific tasks, though care is needed to manage per-goal instability.

Abstract: In this paper we study how transforming regular reinforcement learning
environments into goal-conditioned environments can let agents learn to solve
tasks autonomously and reward-free. We show that an agent can learn to solve
tasks by selecting its own goals in an environment-agnostic way, at training
times comparable to externally guided reinforcement learning. Our method is
independent of the underlying off-policy learning algorithm. Since our method
is environment-agnostic, the agent does not value any goals higher than others,
leading to instability in performance for individual goals. However, in our
experiments, we show that the average goal success rate improves and
stabilizes. An agent trained with this method can be instructed to seek any
observations made in the environment, enabling generic training of agents prior
to specific use cases.

### [135] [Addressing divergent representations from causal interventions on neural networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04638)
*Satchel Grant,Simon Jerome Han,Alexa Tartaglini,Christopher Potts*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Causal interventions used for mechanistic interpretability can push model representations outside their natural distribution. The paper classifies divergences as harmless (in weight-nullspace or sculpture within decision boundaries) and pernicious (activating hidden pathways), and proposes a modified Counterfactual Latent (CL) loss to keep interventions closer to the natural data distribution, improving faithfulness while preserving interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Question whether interventions produce out-of-distribution representations and whether such shifts undermine the faithfulness of explanations to the target model in its natural state.

Method: Empirically show that causal interventions shift internal representations away from the model's natural distribution; theoretically analyze two divergence classes (harmless and pernicious); modify the Counterfactual Latent loss to regularize interventions toward natural distributions; evaluate impact on derailments and interpretive power.

Result: Demonstrates that many interventions shift representations away from the natural distribution; formulates harmless vs pernicious divergences; proposes a modified CL loss that reduces pernicious divergences while preserving interpretability.

Conclusion: To achieve more reliable interpretability, interventions should be regularized to remain closer to the model's natural distribution, mitigating harmful divergences without sacrificing explanatory power.

Abstract: A common approach to mechanistic interpretability is to causally manipulate
model representations via targeted interventions in order to understand what
those representations encode. Here we ask whether such interventions create
out-of-distribution (divergent) representations, and whether this raises
concerns about how faithful their resulting explanations are to the target
model in its natural state. First, we demonstrate empirically that common
causal intervention techniques often do shift internal representations away
from the natural distribution of the target model. Then, we provide a
theoretical analysis of two classes of such divergences: `harmless' divergences
that occur in the null-space of the weights and from covariance within
behavioral decision boundaries, and `pernicious' divergences that activate
hidden network pathways and cause dormant behavioral changes. Finally, in an
effort to mitigate the pernicious cases, we modify the Counterfactual Latent
(CL) loss from Grant (2025) that regularizes interventions to remain closer to
the natural distributions, reducing the likelihood of harmful divergences while
preserving the interpretive power of interventions. Together, these results
highlight a path towards more reliable interpretability methods.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper compares multiple distillation-based extensions to flow matching for probabilistic forecasting of PDE-driven dynamical systems, evaluating efficiency gains from reduced sampling steps and exploring 2D slice predictions for 3D inflow generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve probabilistic forecasts of complex PDE systems (e.g., Navier–Stokes) by reducing sampling cost through distillation-inspired diffusion methods, and to enable efficient inflow generation by predicting 2D slices of 3D simulations.

Method: Systematic comparison of direct distillation, progressive distillation, adversarial diffusion distillation, Wasserstein GANs, and rectified flows within the flow-matching paradigm; experimental evaluation on challenging dynamical systems; exploration of 2D slices of large-scale 3D simulations for inflow generation.

Result: Findings show trade-offs among methods in reducing sampling steps while maintaining accuracy; demonstrated feasibility of predicting 2D slices for inflow generation, supporting efficient solvers.

Conclusion: The study broadens the set of tools for probabilistic PDE forecasting, highlights promising distillation-based approaches for efficiency, and lays groundwork for practical inflow generation in large-scale simulations.

Abstract: This paper is concerned with probabilistic techniques for forecasting
dynamical systems described by partial differential equations (such as, for
example, the Navier-Stokes equations). In particular, it is investigating and
comparing various extensions to the flow matching paradigm that reduce the
number of sampling steps. In this regard, it compares direct distillation,
progressive distillation, adversarial diffusion distillation, Wasserstein GANs
and rectified flows. Moreover, experiments are conducted on a set of
challenging systems. In particular, we also address the challenge of directly
predicting 2D slices of large-scale 3D simulations, paving the way for
efficient inflow generation for solvers.

### [137] [Optimal Inference Schedules for Masked Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04647)
*Sitan Chen,Kevin Cong,Jerry Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Exact characterization of sampling divergence for diffusion language models; derives bounds and shows potential for O(log n) parallel sampling under certain information-theoretic conditions, but achieving the optimal unmasking schedule generally requires strong distribution priors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the sequential bottleneck of autoregressive LMs by enabling parallel or out-of-order token sampling via diffusion-based methods, and to rigorously quantify how much parallel sampling degrades sampling performance.

Method: Derive an exact expression for the expected divergence between the true distribution and the sampled distribution for any distribution and any unmasking schedule. Link the problem to univariate function approximation, derive lower and upper bounds, and propose new sampling schedules based on total correlation and dual total correlation (information-theoretic properties) of the base distribution.

Result: Provides new lower and upper bounds on sampling divergence, shows that in some natural settings O(log n) parallel sampling steps can be achieved with negligible loss, and argues that the optimal unmasking schedule is generally unattainable without strong priors on the distribution; proposes practical schedules derived from information-theoretic quantities.

Conclusion: The work advances theoretical understanding of diffusion LMs by connecting sampling performance to function approximation and information-theoretic properties, offering practical sampling strategies and highlighting the limits imposed by lack of distribution priors.

Abstract: A major bottleneck of standard auto-regressive large language models is that
their inference process is inherently sequential, resulting in very long and
costly inference times. To circumvent this, practitioners proposed a class of
language models called diffusion language models, of which the masked diffusion
model (MDM) is the most successful. The MDM is able to sample tokens
out-of-order and, ostensibly, many tokens at once and in parallel. However,
there is very limited rigorous understanding of how much parallel sampling
these models can perform without noticeable degradation in their sampling
performance. Prior work of Li and Cai obtained some preliminary bounds, but
these are not tight for many natural classes of distributions. In this work, we
give a new, exact characterization of the expected divergence between the true
distribution and the sampled distribution, for any distribution and any
unmasking schedule for the sampler, showing an elegant connection to the theory
of univariate function approximation.
  By leveraging this connection, we then attain a number of novel lower and
upper bounds for this problem. While the connection to function approximation
in principle gives the optimal unmasking schedule for any distribution, we show
that it is in general impossible to compete with it without strong a priori
knowledge of the distribution, even in seemingly benign settings. However, we
also demonstrate new upper bounds and new sampling schedules in terms of
well-studied information-theoretic properties of the base distribution, namely,
its total correlation and dual total correlation, which show that in some
natural settings, one can sample in $O(log n)$ steps without any visible loss
in performance, where $n$ is the total sequence length.

*Xinlu Zhang,Yansha Deng,Toktam Mahmoodi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Adaptive model pruning in time-triggered federated learning (TT-Fed) jointly tunes pruning ratio and wireless bandwidth to minimize training loss under a latency constraint, using convergence analysis and KKT-based closed-form solutions; simulations show ~40% reduction in communication cost with preserved performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FL is privacy-preserving but plagued by stragglers and high communication costs in wireless networks as device counts grow. TT-Fed unifies asynchronous/synchronous FL; adaptive pruning and resource allocation are needed to mitigate bandwidth bottlenecks while meeting latency constraints.

Method: Perform convergence analysis on the gradient L2 norm of the pruned TT-Fed model. Formulate a joint optimization problem for pruning ratio and bandwidth to minimize training loss under a delay threshold. Derive closed-form solutions for pruning and bandwidth using Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions.

Result: Derives closed-form expressions for optimal pruning ratio and wireless bandwidth under the given delay constraint; simulations indicate the approach reduces communication cost by about 40% without degrading model performance.

Conclusion: Adaptive pruning in TT-Fed effectively reduces communication overhead while maintaining performance; the convergence analysis supports the approach, and the KKT-based solutions offer practical, implementable resource allocations in wireless FL environments.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) offers new opportunities in machine learning,
particularly in addressing data privacy concerns. In contrast to conventional
event-based federated learning, time-triggered federated learning (TT-Fed), as
a general form of both asynchronous and synchronous FL, clusters users into
different tiers based on fixed time intervals. However, the FL network consists
of a growing number of user devices with limited wireless bandwidth,
consequently magnifying issues such as stragglers and communication overhead.
In this paper, we introduce adaptive model pruning to wireless TT-Fed systems
and study the problem of jointly optimizing the pruning ratio and bandwidth
allocation to minimize the training loss while ensuring minimal learning
latency. To answer this question, we perform convergence analysis on the
gradient l_2 norm of the TT-Fed model based on model pruning. Based on the
obtained convergence upper bound, a joint optimization problem of pruning ratio
and wireless bandwidth is formulated to minimize the model training loss under
a given delay threshold. Then, we derive closed-form solutions for wireless
bandwidth and pruning ratio using Karush-Kuhn-Tucker(KKT) conditions. The
simulation results show that model pruning could reduce the communication cost
by 40% while maintaining the model performance at the same level.

TL;DR: 3D gray-box nowcasting using physics-informed neural operators to forecast extreme precipitation; improves lead times to 3 hours and dominates in expert blind tests.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of NWP and both extrapolation-based and 2D radar methods, which lack vertical dynamics or are too slow/over-smoothed; aims to provide physically consistent, high-fidelity 3D nowcasting.

Method: Volumetric (3D) radar reflectivity input; learn vertically varying 3D advection under a conservative advection operator; parameterize spatially varying diffusion; include Brownian-motion–inspired stochastic term for unresolved motions; residual branch for small-scale initiation; diffusion-based stochastic module for uncertainty.

Result: Improved forecast accuracy up to 3-hour lead times across precipitation regimes; 57% of cases ranked first in blind evaluation by 160 meteorologists.

Conclusion: Restores full 3D dynamics with physical consistency; offers a scalable, robust pathway for skillful and reliable nowcasting of extreme precipitation.

Abstract: Extreme precipitation nowcasting demands high spatiotemporal fidelity and
extended lead times, yet existing approaches remain limited. Numerical Weather
Prediction (NWP) and its deep-learning emulations are too slow and coarse for
rapidly evolving convection, while extrapolation and purely data-driven models
suffer from error accumulation and excessive smoothing. Hybrid 2D radar-based
methods discard crucial vertical information, preventing accurate
reconstruction of height-dependent dynamics. We introduce a gray-box, fully
three-dimensional nowcasting framework that directly processes volumetric radar
reflectivity and couples physically constrained neural operators with
datadriven learning. The model learns vertically varying 3D advection fields
under a conservative advection operator, parameterizes spatially varying
diffusion, and introduces a Brownian-motion--inspired stochastic term to
represent unresolved motions. A residual branch captures small-scale convective
initiation and microphysical variability, while a diffusion-based stochastic
module estimates uncertainty. The framework achieves more accurate forecasts up
to three-hour lead time across precipitation regimes and ranked first in 57\%
of cases in a blind evaluation by 160 meteorologists. By restoring full 3D
dynamics with physical consistency, it offers a scalable and robust pathway for
skillful and reliable nowcasting of extreme precipitation.

TL;DR: Forgetting is framed as a failure of self-consistency in a learner's predictive distribution over future experiences, quantified by a general information-loss measure; the theory yields a universal propensity-to-forget metric and is validated across diverse tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is no unified, principled definition of forgetting in ML; existing studies lack a general theory linking forgetting to predictive information and learning dynamics.

Method: Propose an algorithm- and task-agnostic theory that defines forgetting as a loss of predictive information in the learner's future-prediction distribution; derive a general forgetting propensity metric; validate via experiments across classification, regression, generative modelling, and reinforcement learning.

Result: Forgetting is observed across all tested learning settings; the proposed measure correlates with learning efficiency and captures the tendency of an algorithm to forget past information.

Conclusion: The work provides a principled framework for understanding forgetting and lays the groundwork for assessing and improving information retention in general learning algorithms.

Abstract: A fundamental challenge in developing general learning algorithms is their
tendency to forget past knowledge when adapting to new data. Addressing this
problem requires a principled understanding of forgetting; yet, despite decades
of study, no unified definition has emerged that provides insights into the
underlying dynamics of learning. We propose an algorithm- and task-agnostic
theory that characterises forgetting as a lack of self-consistency in a
learner's predictive distribution over future experiences, manifesting as a
loss of predictive information. Our theory naturally yields a general measure
of an algorithm's propensity to forget. To validate the theory, we design a
comprehensive set of experiments that span classification, regression,
generative modelling, and reinforcement learning. We empirically demonstrate
how forgetting is present across all learning settings and plays a significant
role in determining learning efficiency. Together, these results establish a
principled understanding of forgetting and lay the foundation for analysing and
improving the information retention capabilities of general learning
algorithms.

### [141] [Multi-Method Analysis of Mathematics Placement Assessments: Classical, Machine Learning, and Clustering Approaches](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04667)
*Julian D. Allagan,Dasia A. Singleton,Shanae N. Perry,Gabrielle C. Morgan,Essence A. Morgan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Multi-method evaluation of a 40-item math placement exam reveals overall strong discrimination with notable poorly discriminating items; item 6 stands out as a perfect discriminator; ML models perform near-perfect cross-validation; clustering suggests a lower competency boundary at 42.5%, lower than the official 55% threshold; two-cluster solution is stable; recommends item replacement, a two-stage assessment, and transparent ML integration for placement optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve mathematics placement decisions by triangulating evidence from classical test theory, machine learning, and unsupervised clustering, enabling item-level refinements, better cut-scores, and reduced misclassification.

Method: Classical Test Theory item discrimination analysis; Random Forest and Gradient Boosting classifiers; K-means clustering for latent competency structure; bootstrap ARI for clustering stability; analysis of feature importance via RF and ANOVA F-statistics.

Result: 55% of items show excellent discrimination (D>=0.40); 30% show poor discrimination (D<0.20) requiring replacement; Q6 (Graph Interpretation) has perfect discrimination (D=1.000), F=4609.1, RF importance=0.206 (20.6%); RF and Gradient Boosting cross-validation accuracies: 97.5% and 96.0%; K-means supports a binary competency structure with a 42.5% boundary, divergent from the 55% threshold; two-cluster solution has bootstrap ARI=0.855 with perfect lower-cluster purity; convergent refinements include replacing poorly discriminating items, adopting a two-stage assessment, and integrating RF predictions with transparency mechanisms.

Conclusion: Multi-method integration provides a robust empirical basis for mathematics placement optimization, enabling targeted item revisions, alternate decision rules (two-stage), and transparent use of predictive models to improve placement accuracy and fairness.

Abstract: This study evaluates a 40-item mathematics placement examination administered
to 198 students using a multi-method framework combining Classical Test Theory,
machine learning, and unsupervised clustering. Classical Test Theory analysis
reveals that 55\% of items achieve excellent discrimination ($D \geq 0.40$)
while 30\% demonstrate poor discrimination ($D < 0.20$) requiring replacement.
Question 6 (Graph Interpretation) emerges as the examination's most powerful
discriminator, achieving perfect discrimination ($D = 1.000$), highest ANOVA
F-statistic ($F = 4609.1$), and maximum Random Forest feature importance
(0.206), accounting for 20.6\% of predictive power. Machine learning algorithms
demonstrate exceptional performance, with Random Forest and Gradient Boosting
achieving 97.5\% and 96.0\% cross-validation accuracy. K-means clustering
identifies a natural binary competency structure with a boundary at 42.5\%,
diverging from the institutional threshold of 55\% and suggesting potential
overclassification into remedial categories. The two-cluster solution exhibits
exceptional stability (bootstrap ARI = 0.855) with perfect lower-cluster
purity. Convergent evidence across methods supports specific refinements:
replace poorly discriminating items, implement a two-stage assessment, and
integrate Random Forest predictions with transparency mechanisms. These
findings demonstrate that multi-method integration provides a robust empirical
foundation for evidence-based mathematics placement optimization.

### [142] [Dynamic Shape Control of Soft Robots Enabled by Data-Driven Model Reduction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03931)
*Iman Adibnazari,Harsh Sharma,Myungsun Park,Jacobo Cervera-Torralba,Boris Kramer,Michael T. Tolley*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: LOpInf-based models yield better MPC performance for dynamic shape control of an eel-inspired soft robot across multiple tracking tasks, outperforming ERA and DMDc.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Soft robots have high-dimensional, nonlinear dynamics; there is a need for tractable, data-driven linearizations that enable model predictive control; this work compares three reduction techniques for generating such linear models.

Method: Generate linear models using ERA, dynamic mode decomposition with control (DMDc), and the Lagrangian operator inference (LOpInf) method from simulation data of an eel-inspired soft robot. Apply these models in MPC to track reference trajectories across three experiments: (1) feasible trajectories, (2) eel-kinematics-based references, (3) reduced-scale physical-analog references.

Result: In all experiments, policies based on LOpInf produced lower tracking errors than those based on ERA or DMDc.

Conclusion: LOpInf provides a more effective data-driven approach for creating control-friendly linear models for soft-robot dynamic shape control and shows promise for broader applicability to soft-robot control tasks.

Abstract: Soft robots have shown immense promise in settings where they can leverage
dynamic control of their entire bodies. However, effective dynamic shape
control requires a controller that accounts for the robot's high-dimensional
dynamics--a challenge exacerbated by a lack of general-purpose tools for
modeling soft robots amenably for control. In this work, we conduct a
comparative study of data-driven model reduction techniques for generating
linear models amendable to dynamic shape control. We focus on three
methods--the eigensystem realization algorithm, dynamic mode decomposition with
control, and the Lagrangian operator inference (LOpInf) method. Using each
class of model, we explored their efficacy in model predictive control policies
for the dynamic shape control of a simulated eel-inspired soft robot in three
experiments: 1) tracking simulated reference trajectories guaranteed to be
feasible, 2) tracking reference trajectories generated from a biological model
of eel kinematics, and 3) tracking reference trajectories generated by a
reduced-scale physical analog. In all experiments, the LOpInf-based policies
generated lower tracking errors than policies based on other models.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A unified RL-based humanoid soccer controller that fuses perception and motion by extending Adversarial Motion Priors to perceptual settings, using an encoder-decoder plus a virtual perception system to recover privileged states from imperfect observations, enabling reactive, coherent play in RoboCup.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations of modular, decoupled perception and control pipelines in dynamic real-world soccer where perceptual noise and time delays degrade performance; a tight perception-action loop is needed for reactive, robust behavior.

Method: Extend Adversarial Motion Priors to perceptual settings, propose an encoder-decoder architecture with a virtual perception system modeling real-world visuals, enabling policy to recover privileged states from imperfect inputs and coordinate perception and action.

Result: Policy demonstrates strong reactivity and coherent robust soccer behaviors across varied scenarios, including real RoboCup matches.

Conclusion: Shows that a unified RL-based controller can bridge motion imitation and visually grounded dynamic control, enabling responsive humanoid soccer in real-world dynamic environments.

Abstract: Humanoid soccer poses a representative challenge for embodied intelligence,
requiring robots to operate within a tightly coupled perception-action loop.
However, existing systems typically rely on decoupled modules, resulting in
delayed responses and incoherent behaviors in dynamic environments, while
real-world perceptual limitations further exacerbate these issues. In this
work, we present a unified reinforcement learning-based controller that enables
humanoid robots to acquire reactive soccer skills through the direct
integration of visual perception and motion control. Our approach extends
Adversarial Motion Priors to perceptual settings in real-world dynamic
environments, bridging motion imitation and visually grounded dynamic control.
We introduce an encoder-decoder architecture combined with a virtual perception
system that models real-world visual characteristics, allowing the policy to
recover privileged states from imperfect observations and establish active
coordination between perception and action. The resulting controller
demonstrates strong reactivity, consistently executing coherent and robust
soccer behaviors across various scenarios, including real RoboCup matches.

*Chenzui Li,Yiming Chen,Xi Wu,Giacinto Barresi,Fei Chen*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: An integrated optimization and control framework for bimanual human-robot co-carry tasks that improves ergonomics and force manipulability via joint-angle optimization, transformed robot end-effector references, and a bimanual MPIC, validated with human subjects showing improved muscle activation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior work often treats safety or manipulation efficiency separately; this work seeks a unified approach to enhance collaboration across diverse grasp postures and object shapes, reducing risk while increasing performance.

Method: Optimize joint angles of a simplified human skeleton model by minimizing a composite cost function to prioritize safety and manipulability; use a transformation module to generate reference robot end-effector poses; employ a bimanual model predictive impedance controller (MPIC) on the robot CURI to follow planned trajectories and recalibrate poses; validate through HHC and HRC experiments with multiple subjects and objects.

Result: Experimental results show significant improvements in target muscle activation after optimization, indicating better ergonomics and force manipulability; demonstration across diverse subjects and object shapes.

Conclusion: The integrated optimization and MPIC framework enhances safety and manipulability in bimanual HRC tasks and is adaptable to varying grasp postures and object geometries; supports safer, more efficient human-robot collaboration.

Abstract: This paper introduces an upper limb postural optimization method for
enhancing physical ergonomics and force manipulability during bimanual
human-robot co-carrying tasks. Existing research typically emphasizes human
safety or manipulative efficiency, whereas our proposed method uniquely
integrates both aspects to strengthen collaboration across diverse conditions
(e.g., different grasping postures of humans, and different shapes of objects).
Specifically, the joint angles of a simplified human skeleton model are
optimized by minimizing the cost function to prioritize safety and manipulative
capability. To guide humans towards the optimized posture, the reference
end-effector poses of the robot are generated through a transformation module.
A bimanual model predictive impedance controller (MPIC) is proposed for our
human-like robot, CURI, to recalibrate the end effector poses through planned
trajectories. The proposed method has been validated through various subjects
and objects during human-human collaboration (HHC) and human-robot
collaboration (HRC). The experimental results demonstrate significant
improvement in muscle conditions by comparing the activation of target muscles
before and after optimization.

### [145] [An LLM-based Framework for Human-Swarm Teaming Cognition in Disaster Search and Rescue](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04042)
*Kailun Ji,Xiaoyu Hu,Xinyu Zhang,Jun Chen*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Proposes an LLM-CRF system to bridge the intention-to-action gap in UAV-swarm SAR tasks by using LLMs to interpret operator intent, decompose tasks, and plan missions; evaluated in simulation with substantial gains in efficiency and reduced cognitive load.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the intention-to-action bottleneck in human-swarm collaboration under high-stress SAR conditions, where translating high-level rescue goals into low-level swarm commands is error-prone and cognitively demanding.

Method: Capture operator intent via natural and multi-modal input (voice/graphics) and use a large language model as a cognitive engine to perform intention comprehension, hierarchical task decomposition, and swarm mission planning in a closed-loop framework that provides real-time proactive feedback.

Result: In a simulated SAR scenario, the LLM-driven approach reduced task completion time by about 64.2%, increased task success rate by 7%, and cut NASA-TLX workload scores by 42.9% compared to traditional interfaces.

Conclusion: LLMs can substantially enhance human-swarm teaming in high-stakes SAR by making the swarm a proactive partner, thereby reducing cognitive load and improving efficiency; the work demonstrates the feasibility and benefits of LLM-assisted intention-to-action bridging.

Abstract: Large-scale disaster Search And Rescue (SAR) operations are persistently
challenged by complex terrain and disrupted communications. While Unmanned
Aerial Vehicle (UAV) swarms offer a promising solution for tasks like wide-area
search and supply delivery, yet their effective coordination places a
significant cognitive burden on human operators. The core human-machine
collaboration bottleneck lies in the ``intention-to-action gap'', which is an
error-prone process of translating a high-level rescue objective into a
low-level swarm command under high intensity and pressure. To bridge this gap,
this study proposes a novel LLM-CRF system that leverages Large Language Models
(LLMs) to model and augment human-swarm teaming cognition. The proposed
framework initially captures the operator's intention through natural and
multi-modal interactions with the device via voice or graphical annotations. It
then employs the LLM as a cognitive engine to perform intention comprehension,
hierarchical task decomposition, and mission planning for the UAV swarm. This
closed-loop framework enables the swarm to act as a proactive partner,
providing active feedback in real-time while reducing the need for manual
monitoring and control, which considerably advances the efficacy of the SAR
task. We evaluate the proposed framework in a simulated SAR scenario.
Experimental results demonstrate that, compared to traditional order and
command-based interfaces, the proposed LLM-driven approach reduced task
completion time by approximately $64.2\%$ and improved task success rate by
$7\%$. It also leads to a considerable reduction in subjective cognitive
workload, with NASA-TLX scores dropping by $42.9\%$. This work establishes the
potential of LLMs to create more intuitive and effective human-swarm
collaborations in high-stakes scenarios.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Demonstrates fault-tolerant, high-performance onboard GNC/LVS computing on next-gen multi-core processors, using ARBITER MV redundancy to achieve large speedups (up to 15x for LVS, >250x for GFOLD) and real-time fault resilience for future planetary missions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable autonomous, low-latency, energy-efficient onboard computation for deterministic Entry, Descent, and Landing (EDL) and ongoing GNC/LVS operations, with robust fault tolerance for mission-critical autonomy.

Method: Deploy GNC and LVS workloads on multi-core processors (HPSC, Snapdragon VOXL2, AMD Xilinx Versal). Introduce ARBITER (Asynchronous Redundant Behavior Inspection for Trusted Execution and Recovery) with a Multi-Core Voting mechanism for real-time fault detection and correction across redundant cores. Validate via static optimization (GFOLD) and dynamic Attitude Control System tests; perform fault-injection to identify sensitive computation stages (notably the gradient step in GFOLD) and develop selective protection and vector-based output arbitration strategies.

Result: Shows up to 15x speedup for LVS image processing and over 250x speedup for GFOLD trajectory optimization relative to legacy hardware. ARBITER proves effective for fault detection/correction in both static and dynamic contexts. Fault-injection highlights the gradient computation stage as most error-prone, guiding targeted protection and arbitration approaches.

Conclusion: The work demonstrates a scalable, energy-efficient onboard architecture capable of meeting autonomy, low-latency, and fault-resilience requirements for ambitious missions (e.g., Mars Sample Return, Enceladus Orbilander, Ceres Sample Return).

Abstract: Future planetary exploration missions demand high-performance, fault-tolerant
computing to enable autonomous Guidance, Navigation, and Control (GNC) and
Lander Vision System (LVS) operations during Entry, Descent, and Landing (EDL).
This paper evaluates the deployment of GNC and LVS algorithms on
next-generation multi-core processors--HPSC, Snapdragon VOXL2, and AMD Xilinx
Versal--demonstrating up to 15x speedup for LVS image processing and over 250x
speedup for Guidance for Fuel-Optimal Large Divert (GFOLD) trajectory
optimization compared to legacy spaceflight hardware. To ensure computational
reliability, we present ARBITER (Asynchronous Redundant Behavior Inspection for
Trusted Execution and Recovery), a Multi-Core Voting (MV) mechanism that
performs real-time fault detection and correction across redundant cores.
ARBITER is validated in both static optimization tasks (GFOLD) and dynamic
closed-loop control (Attitude Control System). A fault injection study further
identifies the gradient computation stage in GFOLD as the most sensitive to
bit-level errors, motivating selective protection strategies and vector-based
output arbitration. This work establishes a scalable and energy-efficient
architecture for future missions, including Mars Sample Return, Enceladus
Orbilander, and Ceres Sample Return, where onboard autonomy, low latency, and
fault resilience are critical.

*Yanbo Pang,Qingkai Li,Mingguo Zhao*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A CNS-inspired, fully Spiking Neural Network-based control framework for agile robotic arms, with five brain-like modules (cerebral cortex, cerebellum, thalamus, brainstem, spinal cord) and three control levels, achieving improved manipulation agility over traditional industrial-position control in simulation and real hardware.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To achieve agile manipulation in complex, dynamic, and unpredictable environments (healthcare, service, daily life) where existing controllers struggle with dynamic trajectories, interactions, and diverse objects.

Method: A biomimetic control architecture implemented entirely with Spiking Neural Networks, consisting of five modules mapped to CNS structures: cerebral cortex, cerebellum, thalamus, brainstem, spinal cord. It uses three hierarchical control levels (first-, second-, third-order) and two information pathways (ascending, descending). Spinal cord uses spike encoding and Leaky Integrate-and-Fire neurons for feedback. Brainstem dynamically adjusts spinal parameters via reinforcement learning using a network of LIF and non-spiking LIF neurons. Thalamus adjusts cerebellum torque outputs. Cerebellum employs a recurrent SNN to learn arm dynamics via regression, providing feedforward gravity compensation torques. Validated in simulation and on a real robotic arm under various loads/trajectories.

Result: The approach outperforms industrial-grade position control in manipulation agility across tested scenarios.

Conclusion: A CNS-inspired, fully SNN framework can achieve agile and robust robotic arm manipulation in dynamic environments, with coordinated neuromorphic modules enabling learning, adaptation, and gravity compensation; validated both in simulation and on real hardware.

Abstract: As robotic arm applications extend beyond industrial settings into
healthcare, service, and daily life, existing control algorithms struggle to
achieve the agile manipulation required for complex environments with dynamic
trajectories, unpredictable interactions, and diverse objects. This paper
presents a biomimetic control framework based on Spiking Neural Networks (SNN),
inspired by the human Central Nervous System (CNS), to achieve agile control in
such environments. The proposed framework features five control modules
(cerebral cortex, cerebellum, thalamus, brainstem, spinal cord), three
hierarchical control levels (first-order, second-order, third-order), and two
information pathways (ascending, descending). Each module is fully implemented
using SNN. The spinal cord module uses spike encoding and Leaky
Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) neurons for feedback control. The brainstem module
employs a network of LIF and non-spiking LIF neurons to dynamically adjust
spinal cord parameters via reinforcement learning. The thalamus module
similarly adjusts the cerebellum's torque outputs. The cerebellum module uses a
recurrent SNN to learn the robotic arm's dynamics through regression, providing
feedforward gravity compensation torques. The framework is validated both in
simulation and on real-world robotic arm platform under various loads and
trajectories. Results demonstrate that our method outperforms the
industrial-grade position control in manipulation agility.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: BFM-Zero presents a shared latent space that embeds motions, goals, and rewards, enabling a single promptable policy to handle multiple downstream whole-body humanoid tasks on a real robot, with zero/few-shot adaptation and sim-to-real bridging.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current humanoid control methods are either simulationally restricted or task-specific; there is a need for a scalable, promptable, generalist policy that can perform diverse tasks with minimal retraining using a unified latent representation.

Method: Learn a shared latent representation via Forward-Backward (FB) models and unsupervised RL that encodes motions, goals, and rewards in a common space. The policy is prompted for different tasks without retraining. The approach includes reward shaping, domain randomization, and history-dependent asymmetric learning to bridge sim-to-real gaps. Inference methods include zero-shot motion tracking, goal reaching, reward optimization, and few-shot adaptation, demonstrated on a Unitree G1 humanoid in the real world.

Result: The framework yields versatile, robust whole-body skills on a real humanoid; ablations in simulation quantify the impact of design choices; claims to be a first-of-its-kind model toward scalable, promptable BFMs for humanoid control.

Conclusion: BFM-Zero advances toward scalable, promptable behavioral foundation models for real-world humanoid control, showing effective multi-task behavior without retraining and bridging sim-to-real gaps; future work will extend task breadth and robustness.

Abstract: Building Behavioral Foundation Models (BFMs) for humanoid robots has the
potential to unify diverse control tasks under a single, promptable generalist
policy. However, existing approaches are either exclusively deployed on
simulated humanoid characters, or specialized to specific tasks such as
tracking. We propose BFM-Zero, a framework that learns an effective shared
latent representation that embeds motions, goals, and rewards into a common
space, enabling a single policy to be prompted for multiple downstream tasks
without retraining. This well-structured latent space in BFM-Zero enables
versatile and robust whole-body skills on a Unitree G1 humanoid in the real
world, via diverse inference methods, including zero-shot motion tracking, goal
reaching, and reward optimization, and few-shot optimization-based adaptation.
Unlike prior on-policy reinforcement learning (RL) frameworks, BFM-Zero builds
upon recent advancements in unsupervised RL and Forward-Backward (FB) models,
which offer an objective-centric, explainable, and smooth latent representation
of whole-body motions. We further extend BFM-Zero with critical reward shaping,
domain randomization, and history-dependent asymmetric learning to bridge the
sim-to-real gap. Those key design choices are quantitatively ablated in
simulation. A first-of-its-kind model, BFM-Zero establishes a step toward
scalable, promptable behavioral foundation models for whole-body humanoid
control.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Hybrid Active SLAM framework combining Path-Uncertainty Co-Optimization DRL with Lightweight Stagnation Detection for faster exploration and shorter paths; demonstrated up to 65% faster exploration and up to 42% shorter paths versus frontier/RRT baselines; validated in simulation and on a real robot with ablation confirming training convergence benefits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address slow exploration and suboptimal paths in Active SLAM by jointly optimizing travel distance and map uncertainty, and by eliminating redundant exploration via stagnation detection.

Method: A dual-objective reinforcement learning framework that co-optimizes travel distance and map uncertainty (path-uncertainty co-optimization) paired with Lightweight Stagnation Detection using Lidar anomaly detection and map-update stagnation checks to terminate unproductive episodes.

Result: Compared with frontier-based and RRT baselines, exploration time reduced up to 65% and path length reduced up to 42%; improved exploration efficiency in complex environments while maintaining map completeness; ablation studies show faster convergence; real-world platform validates sim-to-real transfer.

Conclusion: The proposed hybrid framework enhances Active SLAM efficiency and reliability, delivering faster exploration and shorter paths without compromising map completeness, with demonstrated practicality and transferability to real robots.

Abstract: Existing Active SLAM methodologies face issues such as slow exploration speed
and suboptimal paths. To address these limitations, we propose a hybrid
framework combining a Path-Uncertainty Co-Optimization Deep Reinforcement
Learning framework and a Lightweight Stagnation Detection mechanism. The
Path-Uncertainty Co-Optimization framework jointly optimizes travel distance
and map uncertainty through a dual-objective reward function, balancing
exploration and exploitation. The Lightweight Stagnation Detection reduces
redundant exploration through Lidar Static Anomaly Detection and Map Update
Stagnation Detection, terminating episodes on low expansion rates. Experimental
results show that compared with the frontier-based method and RRT method, our
approach shortens exploration time by up to 65% and reduces path distance by up
to 42%, significantly improving exploration efficiency in complex environments
while maintaining reliable map completeness. Ablation studies confirm that the
collaborative mechanism accelerates training convergence. Empirical validation
on a physical robotic platform demonstrates the algorithm's practical
applicability and its successful transferability from simulation to real-world
environments.

*Shenglin Wang,Mingtong Dai,Jingxuan Su,Lingbo Liu,Chunjie Chen,Xinyu Wu,Liang Lin*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: RGB-only GraspView enables robust tabletop grasping in clutter by building a locally consistent, up-to-scale 3D scene from a single RGB view, actively acquiring views, and aligning VGGT-based predictions with robot kinematics, outperforming RGB-D baselines especially under occlusion and with transparent objects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RGB-D pipelines struggle with transparent/glossy objects, close-range sensing, and clutter; depth sensors fail or degrade; a depth-free, RGB-only approach could provide more robust, cost-effective grasping.

Method: Three components: (i) global perception scene reconstruction to derive locally consistent, up-to-scale geometry from a single RGB view and fuse multi-view projections into a global 3D scene; (ii) render-and-score active perception to select next-best-views revealing occluded regions; (iii) online metric alignment to calibrate VGGT predictions against robot kinematics for geometric scale consistency. Uses GraspView for best-view global grasping and GraspNet for execution."

Result: Experiments on diverse tabletop objects show GraspView significantly outperforms RGB-D and single-view RGB baselines, especially under heavy occlusion, near-field sensing, and with transparent objects, validating RGB-only pipeline as a practical alternative.

Conclusion: GraspView demonstrates reliable grasping in unstructured real-world environments without depth sensing, offering a practical and versatile solution that handles clutter, occlusion, and challenging materials.

Abstract: Robotic grasping is a fundamental capability for autonomous manipulation, yet
remains highly challenging in cluttered environments where occlusion, poor
perception quality, and inconsistent 3D reconstructions often lead to unstable
or failed grasps. Conventional pipelines have widely relied on RGB-D cameras to
provide geometric information, which fail on transparent or glossy objects and
degrade at close range. We present GraspView, an RGB-only robotic grasping
pipeline that achieves accurate manipulation in cluttered environments without
depth sensors. Our framework integrates three key components: (i) global
perception scene reconstruction, which provides locally consistent, up-to-scale
geometry from a single RGB view and fuses multi-view projections into a
coherent global 3D scene; (ii) a render-and-score active perception strategy,
which dynamically selects next-best-views to reveal occluded regions; and (iii)
an online metric alignment module that calibrates VGGT predictions against
robot kinematics to ensure physical scale consistency. Building on these
tailor-designed modules, GraspView performs best-view global grasping, fusing
multi-view reconstructions and leveraging GraspNet for robust execution.
Experiments on diverse tabletop objects demonstrate that GraspView
significantly outperforms both RGB-D and single-view RGB baselines, especially
under heavy occlusion, near-field sensing, and with transparent objects. These
results highlight GraspView as a practical and versatile alternative to RGB-D
pipelines, enabling reliable grasping in unstructured real-world environments.

*Marco Iannotta,Yuxuan Yang,Johannes A. Stork,Erik Schaffernicht,Todor Stoyanov*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Conditioning a DR-based RL policy on estimated dynamics (context) improves sim-to-real transfer; context-aware policies outperform context-agnostic baselines, with the best supervision strategy depending on the task.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the sim-to-real transfer gap in reinforcement learning caused by variations in environment dynamics. Domain randomization helps but can reduce peak performance; conditioning the policy on an estimate of dynamics (context) may improve transfer.

Method: Integrate a context estimation module into a domain-randomized RL framework and systematically compare state-of-the-art supervision strategies; evaluate on a canonical control benchmark and a real-world pushing task with a Franka Emika Panda robot.

Result: Context-aware policies outperform a context-agnostic baseline across all settings; however, the best supervision strategy varies with the task.

Conclusion: Conditioning policies on estimated dynamics is beneficial for sim-to-real transfer, but the most effective supervision strategy is task-dependent.

Abstract: Sim-to-real transfer remains a major challenge in reinforcement learning (RL)
for robotics, as policies trained in simulation often fail to generalize to the
real world due to discrepancies in environment dynamics. Domain Randomization
(DR) mitigates this issue by exposing the policy to a wide range of randomized
dynamics during training, yet leading to a reduction in performance. While
standard approaches typically train policies agnostic to these variations, we
investigate whether sim-to-real transfer can be improved by conditioning the
policy on an estimate of the dynamics parameters -- referred to as context. To
this end, we integrate a context estimation module into a DR-based RL framework
and systematically compare SOTA supervision strategies. We evaluate the
resulting context-aware policies in both a canonical control benchmark and a
real-world pushing task using a Franka Emika Panda robot. Results show that
context-aware policies outperform the context-agnostic baseline across all
settings, although the best supervision strategy depends on the task.

Motivation: To mitigate wind disturbance in multi-rotor mode due to the large frontal area, reduce dead weight, and improve power efficiency and stability in tailsitter VTOL operations.

Method: Introduce a retractable wing design that enables wing retraction in multi-rotor mode and extension in fixed-wing mode; adopt a coaxial heterogeneous dual-rotor to cut total power consumption; enhance swashplateless control with an improved design including flapping hinges to reduce vibration; optimize the swashplateless structure for better pitch/roll control; perform comprehensive transition flight tests.

Result: Power consumption is significantly reduced; vibration during cyclic acceleration/deceleration is mitigated; transition flight tests demonstrate stable flight performance across the entire flight envelope.

Conclusion: The integrated design improves wind robustness, efficiency, and structural simplicity, and demonstrates viable tailsitter VTOL operation with smooth transitions between modes.

Abstract: The tailsitter vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) UAV is widely used due to
its lower dead weight, which eliminates the actuators and mechanisms for
tilting. However, the tailsitter UAV is susceptible to wind disturbances in
multi-rotor mode, as it exposes a large frontal fuselage area. To address this
issue, our tailsitter UAV features a reconfigurable wing design, allowing wings
to retract in multi-rotor mode and extend in fixed- wing mode. Considering
power efficiency, we design a coaxial heterogeneous dual-rotor configuration,
which significantly re- duces the total power consumption. To reduce structural
weight and simplify structural complexity, we employ a swashplateless mechanism
with an improved design to control pitch and roll in multi-rotor mode. We
optimize the structure of the swashplateless mechanism by adding flapping
hinges, which reduces vibration during cyclic acceleration and deceleration.
Finally, we perform comprehensive transition flight tests to validate stable
flight performance across the entire flight envelope of the tailsitter UAV.

*Kuankuan Sima,Longbin Tang,Haozhe Ma,Lin Zhao*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: MacroNav combines a lightweight, multi-task self-supervised context encoder with a graph-guided RL policy to enable compact, robust spatial understanding and efficient action selection for autonomous navigation under partial observability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To achieve rich yet compact spatial representations that enable high-quality decision making in unknown, partially observable environments without sacrificing navigation efficiency.

Method: (1) A lightweight context encoder trained via multi-task self-supervised learning to capture multi-scale, navigation-centric spatial representations; (2) A reinforcement learning policy that fuses these representations with graph-based reasoning for efficient action selection.

Result: The context encoder is demonstrated to be efficient and robust for environmental understanding; real-world deployments show significant gains over state-of-the-art methods in Success Rate (SR) and SPL, while maintaining low computational cost; code will be released upon acceptance.

Conclusion: MacroNav provides a practical, scalable navigation framework that improves decision-making efficiency by integrating compact spatial understanding with graph-based reasoning, validated by real-world deployment and strong SR/SPL gains.

Abstract: Autonomous navigation in unknown environments requires compact yet expressive
spatial understanding under partial observability to support high-level
decision making. Existing approaches struggle to balance rich contextual
representation with navigation efficiency. We present MacroNav, a
learning-based navigation framework featuring two key components: (1) a
lightweight context encoder trained via multi-task self-supervised learning to
capture multi-scale, navigation-centric spatial representations; and (2) a
reinforcement learning policy that seamlessly integrates these representations
with graph-based reasoning for efficient action selection. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the context encoder's efficient and robust
environmental understanding. Real-world deployments further validate MacroNav's
effectiveness, yielding significant gains over state-of-the-art navigation
methods in both Success Rate (SR) and Success weighted by Path Length (SPL),
while maintaining low computational cost. Code will be released upon
acceptance.

*Maëlic Neau,Zoe Falomir,Paulo E. Santos,Anne-Gwenn Bosser,Cédric Buche*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: GraSP-VLA uses a Continuous Scene Graph to convert demonstrations into symbolic planning domains and orchestrate low-level Vision-Language Action policies, enabling scalable, long-horizon robotic tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap between end-to-end Vision-Language Action models and symbolic Action Model Learning: VLA lacks high-level symbolic planning for long-horizon tasks, while AML lacks generalization/scalability. A neuro-symbolic approach aims to combine strengths of both.

Method: Propose GraSP-VLA, a neuro-symbolic framework that derives a Continuous Scene Graph-based symbolic representation from human demonstrations; uses this representation to generate new planning domains at inference time and to orchestrate low-level VLA policies, expanding the repertoire of actions that can be executed in sequence.

Result: Demonstrates that GraSP-VLA can effectively model symbolic representations for automatic planning-domain generation from observations; real-world experiments show the Continuous Scene Graph can orchestrate low-level VLA policies for long-horizon tasks.

Conclusion: GraSP-VLA shows promise as a neuro-symbolic bridge between symbolic planning and learning-based perception/execution, enabling automatic planning-domain generation and orchestration of VLA policies for long-horizon tasks, with potential improvements in generalization and scalability.

Abstract: Deploying autonomous robots that can learn new skills from demonstrations is
an important challenge of modern robotics. Existing solutions often apply
end-to-end imitation learning with Vision-Language Action (VLA) models or
symbolic approaches with Action Model Learning (AML). On the one hand, current
VLA models are limited by the lack of high-level symbolic planning, which
hinders their abilities in long-horizon tasks. On the other hand, symbolic
approaches in AML lack generalization and scalability perspectives. In this
paper we present a new neuro-symbolic approach, GraSP-VLA, a framework that
uses a Continuous Scene Graph representation to generate a symbolic
representation of human demonstrations. This representation is used to generate
new planning domains during inference and serves as an orchestrator for
low-level VLA policies, scaling up the number of actions that can be reproduced
in a row. Our results show that GraSP-VLA is effective for modeling symbolic
representations on the task of automatic planning domain generation from
observations. In addition, results on real-world experiments show the potential
of our Continuous Scene Graph representation to orchestrate low-level VLA
policies in long-horizon tasks.

### [155] [Studying the Effect of Explicit Interaction Representations on Learning Scene-level Distributions of Human Trajectories](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04375)
*Anna Mészáros,Javier Alonso-Mora,Jens Kober*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Explicit, well-defined interaction rules outperform data-driven learned interactions for multi-agent joint distribution modeling in autonomous driving; relying on learned interactions often hurts performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurately capturing the joint distribution of all agents is crucial for predicting scene evolution and informing autonomous vehicle decisions. There is no consensus on how to represent agent interactions, with debate between implicit neural learning and explicit, human-grounded spatial-temporal relations.

Method: Within a single network architecture, study and compare various means of describing interactions among agents, evaluating their effect on the learned joint distributions.

Result: Allowing a network to learn interactive connections from data often degrades performance, whereas explicit interactions (e.g., which agent passes first at an intersection) yield clear performance gains.

Conclusion: Prefer explicit, well-defined interaction structures grounded in real-world decision-making over purely data-driven learned interactions when modeling multi-agent joint distributions for scene prediction.

Abstract: Effectively capturing the joint distribution of all agents in a scene is
relevant for predicting the true evolution of the scene and in turn providing
more accurate information to the decision processes of autonomous vehicles.
While new models have been developed for this purpose in recent years, it
remains unclear how to best represent the joint distributions particularly from
the perspective of the interactions between agents. Thus far there is no clear
consensus on how best to represent interactions between agents; whether they
should be learned implicitly from data by neural networks, or explicitly
modeled using the spatial and temporal relations that are more grounded in
human decision-making. This paper aims to study various means of describing
interactions within the same network structure and their effect on the final
learned joint distributions. Our findings show that more often than not, simply
allowing a network to establish interactive connections between agents based on
data has a detrimental effect on performance. Instead, having well defined
interactions (such as which agent of an agent pair passes first at an
intersection) can often bring about a clear boost in performance.

### [156] [ForeRobo: Unlocking Infinite Simulation Data for 3D Goal-driven Robotic Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04381)
*Dexin wang,Faliang Chang,Chunsheng Liu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: ForeRobo combines generative simulations with classical control in a self-guided propose-generate-learn-actuate cycle to acquire manipulation skills, enabling zero-shot sim-to-real transfer and strong performance gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Efficiently leveraging simulation for advanced manipulation is challenging; end-to-end policy learning often lacks interpretability and data efficiency, and sim-to-real transfer remains difficult. A framework that builds goal-conditioned representations from generated goals and data can improve performance and generalization.

Method: A self-guided propose-generate-learn-actuate cycle: ForeGen generates skill-consistent goal states by configuring objects and scene arrangements; ForeFormer learns a dense, point-wise 3D goal-position predictor for each point in the current state, trained on virtually infinite ForeGen data; classical control then actuates the robot in the real world to pursue envisioned goals based on ForeFormer outputs.

Result: ForeFormer achieves an average improvement of 56.32% over state-of-the-art state generation models; demonstrates strong generality across rigid-body and articulated-object manipulation patterns; in real-world tests (>20 tasks) it enables zero-shot sim-to-real transfer with an average success rate of 79.28%.

Conclusion: Integrating generative simulations with classical control yields interpretable, data-efficient manipulation skills with robust generalization and sim-to-real transfer. The ForeGen/ForeFormer framework provides a scalable approach for diverse manipulation tasks.

Abstract: Efficiently leveraging simulation to acquire advanced manipulation skills is
both challenging and highly significant. We introduce \textit{ForeRobo}, a
generative robotic agent that utilizes generative simulations to autonomously
acquire manipulation skills driven by envisioned goal states. Instead of
directly learning low-level policies, we advocate integrating generative
paradigms with classical control. Our approach equips a robotic agent with a
self-guided \textit{propose-generate-learn-actuate} cycle. The agent first
proposes the skills to be acquired and constructs the corresponding simulation
environments; it then configures objects into appropriate arrangements to
generate skill-consistent goal states (\textit{ForeGen}). Subsequently, the
virtually infinite data produced by ForeGen are used to train the proposed
state generation model (\textit{ForeFormer}), which establishes point-wise
correspondences by predicting the 3D goal position of every point in the
current state, based on the scene state and task instructions. Finally,
classical control algorithms are employed to drive the robot in real-world
environments to execute actions based on the envisioned goal states. Compared
with end-to-end policy learning methods, ForeFormer offers superior
interpretability and execution efficiency. We train and benchmark ForeFormer
across a variety of rigid-body and articulated-object manipulation tasks, and
observe an average improvement of 56.32\% over the state-of-the-art state
generation models, demonstrating strong generality across different
manipulation patterns. Moreover, in real-world evaluations involving more than
20 robotic tasks, ForeRobo achieves zero-shot sim-to-real transfer and exhibits
remarkable generalization capabilities, attaining an average success rate of
79.28\%.

### [157] [Temporal Action Selection for Action Chunking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04421)
*Yueyang Weng,Xiaopeng Zhang,Yongjin Mu,Yingcong Zhu,Yanjie Li,Qi Liu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Temporal Action Selector (TAS) caches multiple-step action chunks and uses a lightweight selector to dynamically pick the best action, balancing reactivity, decision consistency, and motion coherence in Learning from Demonstration (LfD). It improves success rates (up to 73.3% absolute gain) and enhances RL training efficiency when used as a base policy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Action chunking in LfD improves multi-step policy modeling but reduces decision frequency, hurting reactivity to sensor noise and dynamic changes. Prior methods traded reactivity for consistency without achieving both. TAS aims to reconcile reactivity, consistency, and coherence.

Method: TAS caches predicted action chunks from several timesteps and employs a lightweight selector network to choose the optimal action in real time. The approach maintains multi-timestep planning benefits while preserving reactivity and motion coherence. It is evaluated across tasks with diverse base policies and integrated with residual reinforcement learning to boost training efficiency and performance plateaus.

Result: TAS significantly improves success rates, with an absolute gain of up to 73.3%. When used as a base policy with residual RL, it enhances training efficiency and raises the performance plateau. Validation conducted in both simulation and physical robot experiments.

Conclusion: TAS achieves balanced optimization across reactivity, decision consistency, and motion coherence in LfD. It generalizes across tasks with different base policies and synergizes with RL to improve learning efficiency and final performance.

Abstract: Action chunking is a widely adopted approach in Learning from Demonstration
(LfD). By modeling multi-step action chunks rather than single-step actions,
action chunking significantly enhances modeling capabilities for human expert
policies. However, the reduced decision frequency restricts the utilization of
recent observations, degrading reactivity - particularly evident in the
inadequate adaptation to sensor noise and dynamic environmental changes.
Existing efforts to address this issue have primarily resorted to trading off
reactivity against decision consistency, without achieving both. To address
this limitation, we propose a novel algorithm, Temporal Action Selector (TAS),
which caches predicted action chunks from multiple timesteps and dynamically
selects the optimal action through a lightweight selector network. TAS achieves
balanced optimization across three critical dimensions: reactivity, decision
consistency, and motion coherence. Experiments across multiple tasks with
diverse base policies show that TAS significantly improves success rates -
yielding an absolute gain of up to 73.3%. Furthermore, integrating TAS as a
base policy with residual reinforcement learning (RL) substantially enhances
training efficiency and elevates the performance plateau. Experiments in both
simulation and physical robots confirm the method's efficacy.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Evo-1 is a lightweight 0.77B-parameter Vision-Language-Action model that achieves state-of-the-art results without robot-data pretraining, with strong real-world performance and efficient inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLA models are large, require extensive robot data pretraining, are computationally expensive, and risk degrading the perception backbone, leading to poor generalization and deployability.

Method: Introduce Evo-1, a native multimodal Vision-Language model augmented with a cross-modulated diffusion transformer and an optimized integration module. Train via a two-stage paradigm that progressively aligns action with perception while preserving VLM representations; no robot-data pretraining.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art on Meta-World and RoboTwin (surpassing prior best by 12.4% and 6.9%), 94.8% LIBERO, and 78% real-world success with high inference frequency and low memory; uses only 0.77B parameters.

Conclusion: Demonstrates that lightweight, efficiently trained VLA models can match or exceed heavy predecessors without robot data pretraining, offering strong deployment potential and providing reusable code/data/model weights for future research.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have emerged as a powerful framework that
unifies perception, language, and control, enabling robots to perform diverse
tasks through multimodal understanding. However, current VLA models typically
contain massive parameters and rely heavily on large-scale robot data
pretraining, leading to high computational costs during training, as well as
limited deployability for real-time inference. Moreover, most training
paradigms often degrade the perceptual representations of the vision-language
backbone, resulting in overfitting and poor generalization to downstream tasks.
In this work, we present Evo-1, a lightweight VLA model that reduces
computation and improves deployment efficiency, while maintaining strong
performance without pretraining on robot data. Evo-1 builds on a native
multimodal Vision-Language model (VLM), incorporating a novel cross-modulated
diffusion transformer along with an optimized integration module, together
forming an effective architecture. We further introduce a two-stage training
paradigm that progressively aligns action with perception, preserving the
representations of the VLM. Notably, with only 0.77 billion parameters, Evo-1
achieves state-of-the-art results on the Meta-World and RoboTwin suite,
surpassing the previous best models by 12.4% and 6.9%, respectively, and also
attains a competitive result of 94.8% on LIBERO. In real-world evaluations,
Evo-1 attains a 78% success rate with high inference frequency and low memory
overhead, outperforming all baseline methods. We release code, data, and model
weights to facilitate future research on lightweight and efficient VLA models.

### [159] [SAFe-Copilot: Unified Shared Autonomy Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04664)
*Phat Nguyen,Erfan Aasi,Shiva Sreeram,Guy Rosman,Andrew Silva,Sertac Karaman,Daniela Rus*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A unified shared autonomy approach uses vision-language models to infer driver intent from multi-modal cues and arbitrate between human and autonomous control at a semantic level, improving safety and intent preservation beyond low-level trajectory arbitration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autonomous driving systems fail in rare, ambiguous, and out-of-distribution scenarios; human contextual reasoning is needed. Existing arbitration is often limited to low-level trajectories, which can obscure driving intent; semantic-level arbitration can preserve intent and enable common-sense reasoning.

Method: A framework that integrates human input and autonomous planners at a high level of abstraction, using Vision Language Models to infer driver intent from driver actions and environmental context, and to synthesize coherent strategies that mediate control. Validated in a mock-human setting (perfect recall, high accuracy/precision), with a human-subject survey (92% alignment), and evaluation on the Bench2Drive benchmark.

Result: In the mock-human setting, the approach achieves perfect recall along with high accuracy and precision. The human-subject survey shows strong alignment, with 92% of participants agreeing with arbitration outcomes. On Bench2Drive, substantial reductions in collision rate and overall performance improvements are observed compared with pure autonomy.

Conclusion: Arbitration at the semantic, language-based representation level is a design principle for shared autonomy, enabling common-sense reasoning and maintaining continuity with human intent.

Abstract: Autonomous driving systems remain brittle in rare, ambiguous, and
out-of-distribution scenarios, where human driver succeed through contextual
reasoning. Shared autonomy has emerged as a promising approach to mitigate such
failures by incorporating human input when autonomy is uncertain. However, most
existing methods restrict arbitration to low-level trajectories, which
represent only geometric paths and therefore fail to preserve the underlying
driving intent. We propose a unified shared autonomy framework that integrates
human input and autonomous planners at a higher level of abstraction. Our
method leverages Vision Language Models (VLMs) to infer driver intent from
multi-modal cues -- such as driver actions and environmental context -- and to
synthesize coherent strategies that mediate between human and autonomous
control. We first study the framework in a mock-human setting, where it
achieves perfect recall alongside high accuracy and precision. A human-subject
survey further shows strong alignment, with participants agreeing with
arbitration outcomes in 92% of cases. Finally, evaluation on the Bench2Drive
benchmark demonstrates a substantial reduction in collision rate and
improvement in overall performance compared to pure autonomy. Arbitration at
the level of semantic, language-based representations emerges as a design
principle for shared autonomy, enabling systems to exercise common-sense
reasoning and maintain continuity with human intent.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Proposes a real-to-sim evaluation framework for deformable manipulation by building soft-body digital twins from real videos and rendering photorealistically; demonstrates strong real-vs-sim correlation across tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Evaluating robotic manipulation in the real world is costly, time-consuming, and hard to reproduce, especially for deformable objects; existing simulators struggle to capture coupled visual and physical soft-body interactions.

Method: Construct soft-body digital twins from real-world videos, render robots/objects/environments with photorealistic fidelity using 3D Gaussian Splatting, and validate on tasks like plush toy packing, rope routing, and T-block pushing.

Result: Simulated rollouts show strong correlation with real-world performance and reveal key behavioral patterns of learned policies, supporting reproducibility and scalability of evaluation.

Conclusion: Combining physics-informed reconstruction with high-quality rendering enables reproducible, scalable, and accurate evaluation of robotic manipulation policies in deformable settings.

Abstract: Robotic manipulation policies are advancing rapidly, but their direct
evaluation in the real world remains costly, time-consuming, and difficult to
reproduce, particularly for tasks involving deformable objects. Simulation
provides a scalable and systematic alternative, yet existing simulators often
fail to capture the coupled visual and physical complexity of soft-body
interactions. We present a real-to-sim policy evaluation framework that
constructs soft-body digital twins from real-world videos and renders robots,
objects, and environments with photorealistic fidelity using 3D Gaussian
Splatting. We validate our approach on representative deformable manipulation
tasks, including plush toy packing, rope routing, and T-block pushing,
demonstrating that simulated rollouts correlate strongly with real-world
execution performance and reveal key behavioral patterns of learned policies.
Our results suggest that combining physics-informed reconstruction with
high-quality rendering enables reproducible, scalable, and accurate evaluation

### [161] [X-Diffusion: Training Diffusion Policies on Cross-Embodiment Human Demonstrations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04671)
*Maximus A. Pace,Prithwish Dan,Chuanruo Ning,Atiksh Bhardwaj,Audrey Du,Edward W. Duan,Wei-Chiu Ma,Kushal Kedia*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: X-Diffusion leverages diffusion-based policy training to utilize human demonstration data for robot manipulation while avoiding physically infeasible motions caused by embodiment differences. It uses a classifier to gate human data by noise level, enabling fine-grained robot-consistent supervision at low noise and coarse, human-guided hints at high noise; this yields a 16% average success rate improvement over the best baseline across five tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human videos offer rich manipulation cues but direct kinematic retargeting from humans to robots often produces physically infeasible actions due to embodiment mismatch. There is a need to harness valuable human data while ensuring policy actions remain executable by robots.

Method: X-Diffusion trains a classifier to predict whether a noisy action is from a human or a robot. A human action is incorporated into policy training only after adding enough noise so the classifier cannot distinguish embodiment. At low noise, robot-like actions supervise denoising for fine-grained control; at higher noise, human actions provide coarse guidance. This diffusion-based framework enables leveraging human data without learning infeasible motions.

Result: Empirical evaluation across five manipulation tasks shows that naive co-training with mismatched execution degrades performance, while X-Diffusion consistently improves results. It achieves a 16% higher average success rate than the best baseline. The project website is provided for more details.

Conclusion: X-Diffusion offers a principled approach to exploit human demonstration data in robot policy learning under embodiment mismatch, improving performance by effectively separating the guidance provided by human and robot exemplars through a noisy diffusion process.

Abstract: Human videos can be recorded quickly and at scale, making them an appealing
source of training data for robot learning. However, humans and robots differ
fundamentally in embodiment, resulting in mismatched action execution. Direct
kinematic retargeting of human hand motion can therefore produce actions that
are physically infeasible for robots. Despite these low-level differences,
human demonstrations provide valuable motion cues about how to manipulate and
interact with objects. Our key idea is to exploit the forward diffusion
process: as noise is added to actions, low-level execution differences fade
while high-level task guidance is preserved. We present X-Diffusion, a
principled framework for training diffusion policies that maximally leverages
human data without learning dynamically infeasible motions. X-Diffusion first
trains a classifier to predict whether a noisy action is executed by a human or
robot. Then, a human action is incorporated into policy training only after
adding sufficient noise such that the classifier cannot discern its embodiment.
Actions consistent with robot execution supervise fine-grained denoising at low
noise levels, while mismatched human actions provide only coarse guidance at
higher noise levels. Our experiments show that naive co-training under
execution mismatches degrades policy performance, while X-Diffusion
consistently improves it. Across five manipulation tasks, X-Diffusion achieves
a 16% higher average success rate than the best baseline. The project website
is available at https://portal-cornell.github.io/X-Diffusion/.

*Qingzhou Lu,Yao Feng,Baiyu Shi,Michael Piseno,Zhenan Bao,C. Karen Liu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A spring-based impedance framework (GentleHumanoid) enables upper-body compliance by integrating resistive and guiding contacts into a whole-body motion tracking policy, reducing peak contact forces while preserving task success across human-robot interaction tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable safe, natural physical interaction in human-centered environments where current RL policies focus on rigid tracking and existing impedance methods are limited to base or end-effector control, hindering global compliance.

Method: Propose GentleHumanoid with a unified spring-based formulation that models both resistive contacts (pressing against surfaces) and guiding contacts (pulls/pushes from human motion data); ensures kinematically consistent forces across shoulder, elbow, and wrist; integrates into a whole-body motion tracking policy with task-adjustable force thresholds; evaluated in simulation and on the Unitree G1 across tasks such as gentle hugging, sit-to-stand assistance, and safe object manipulation.

Result: Compared to baselines, the policy reduces peak contact forces while maintaining task success, yielding smoother and more natural interactions; demonstrated effectiveness in both simulation and real robot experiments.

Conclusion: Represents a step toward humanoid robots that safely and effectively collaborate with humans and handle objects in real-world environments, offering a generalizable approach to safe compliance in humanoid robotics.

Abstract: Humanoid robots are expected to operate in human-centered environments where
safe and natural physical interaction is essential. However, most recent
reinforcement learning (RL) policies emphasize rigid tracking and suppress
external forces. Existing impedance-augmented approaches are typically
restricted to base or end-effector control and focus on resisting extreme
forces rather than enabling compliance. We introduce GentleHumanoid, a
framework that integrates impedance control into a whole-body motion tracking
policy to achieve upper-body compliance. At its core is a unified spring-based
formulation that models both resistive contacts (restoring forces when pressing
against surfaces) and guiding contacts (pushes or pulls sampled from human
motion data). This formulation ensures kinematically consistent forces across
the shoulder, elbow, and wrist, while exposing the policy to diverse
interaction scenarios. Safety is further supported through task-adjustable
force thresholds. We evaluate our approach in both simulation and on the
Unitree G1 humanoid across tasks requiring different levels of compliance,
including gentle hugging, sit-to-stand assistance, and safe object
manipulation. Compared to baselines, our policy consistently reduces peak
contact forces while maintaining task success, resulting in smoother and more
natural interactions. These results highlight a step toward humanoid robots
that can safely and effectively collaborate with humans and handle objects in
real-world environments.

Main category: cs.CG

TL;DR: Introduces a GPU-accelerated, vectorized framework for computing the weighted Euler characteristic transform (WECT) and Euler characteristic function (ECF) on simplicial or cubical complexes of arbitrary dimension, achieving up to 180x speedups; implemented as pyECT.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for computing WECT/ECF are slow and do not scale well to higher dimensions, limiting their applicability across diverse datasets and applications.

Method: A tensor-based, vectorized implementation optimized for GPU architectures that handles geometric simplicial and cubical complexes in arbitrary dimensions. The framework is implemented as a Python package (pyECT) and validated on image datasets.

Result: Demonstrates substantial speedups (up to ~180×) over existing methods across multiple image datasets and dimensions, validating scalability and generality across complex types.

Conclusion: Provides a fast, scalable solution for WECT/ECF computation and a publicly available tool (pyECT) that broadens practical use of topological transforms in higher-dimensional settings.

Abstract: The weighted Euler characteristic transform (WECT) and Euler characteristic
function (ECF) have proven to be useful tools in a variety of applications.
However, current methods for computing these functions are neither optimized
for speed nor do they scale to higher-dimensional settings. In this work, we
present a vectorized framework for computing such topological transforms using
tensor operations, which is highly optimized for GPU architectures and works in
full generality across geometric simplicial complexes (or cubical complexes) of
arbitrary dimension. Experimentally, the framework demonstrates significant
speedups (up to $180 \times$) over existing methods when computing the WECT and
ECF across a variety of image datasets. Computation of these transforms is
implemented in a publicly available Python package called pyECT.

TL;DR: DreamGym provides a scalable framework to synthesize diverse RL experiences using a reasoning-based environment model, a replay buffer with offline data, and adaptive task generation for online curriculum, achieving strong performance in synthetic and sim-to-real settings with reduced real-world interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reinforcement learning for autonomous agents (including LLM-based agents) suffers from costly rollouts, limited task diversity, unreliable rewards, and infrastructure complexity, hindering scalable data collection. A unified, scalable data-generation framework is needed to train robust online RL policies and bridge sim-to-real gaps.

Method: DreamGym distills environment dynamics into a reasoning-based experience model that yields consistent state transitions and feedback signals via step-by-step reasoning. It uses an experience replay buffer initialized with offline data and continually enriched with new interactions. It adaptively generates new tasks to challenge the current policy, enabling online curriculum learning. The framework is evaluated across diverse environments and agent backbones in fully synthetic and sim-to-real transfer scenarios.

Result: DreamGym substantially improves RL training. On WebArena (non-RL-ready), it outperforms baselines by over 30%. In RL-ready but costly settings, it matches GRPO and PPO using only synthetic interactions. When transferring a policy trained on synthetic experience to real environments, it yields significant gains with far fewer real-world interactions, providing a scalable warm-start for general-purpose RL.

Conclusion: DreamGym offers a scalable, unified approach to online RL data generation that reduces real-world requirement and enables effective sim-to-real transfer, supporting broader, more practical deployment of RL for autonomous agents.

Abstract: While reinforcement learning (RL) can empower large language model (LLM)
agents by enabling self-improvement through interaction, its practical adoption
remains challenging due to costly rollouts, limited task diversity, unreliable
reward signals, and infrastructure complexity, all of which obstruct the
collection of scalable experience data. To address these challenges, we
introduce DreamGym, the first unified framework designed to synthesize diverse
experiences with scalability in mind to enable effective online RL training for
autonomous agents. Rather than relying on expensive real-environment rollouts,
DreamGym distills environment dynamics into a reasoning-based experience model
that derives consistent state transitions and feedback signals through
step-by-step reasoning, enabling scalable agent rollout collection for RL. To
improve the stability and quality of transitions, DreamGym leverages an
experience replay buffer initialized with offline real-world data and
continuously enriched with fresh interactions to actively support agent
training. To improve knowledge acquisition, DreamGym adaptively generates new
tasks that challenge the current agent policy, enabling more effective online
curriculum learning. Experiments across diverse environments and agent
backbones demonstrate that DreamGym substantially improves RL training, both in
fully synthetic settings and in sim-to-real transfer scenarios. On non-RL-ready
tasks like WebArena, DreamGym outperforms all baselines by over 30%. And in
RL-ready but costly settings, it matches GRPO and PPO performance using only
synthetic interactions. When transferring a policy trained purely on synthetic
experiences to real-environment RL, DreamGym yields significant additional
performance gains while requiring far fewer real-world interactions, providing
a scalable warm-start strategy for general-purpose RL.

### [165] [How Different Tokenization Algorithms Impact LLMs and Transformer Models for Binary Code Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03825)
*Ahmed Mostafa,Raisul Arefin Nahid,Samuel Mulder*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Tokenization for assembly code is studied: evaluating how tokenizer choices (models, vocab sizes, preprocessing) affect intrinsic properties and downstream tasks like function signature prediction, using Llama 3.2, BERT, and BART; intrinsic metrics partially predict extrinsic performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tokenization shapes vocabulary size, semantic coverage, and downstream performance in binary/code analysis. Assembly language has unique characteristics requiring tailored tokenization to improve robustness and scalability of NLP-based binary analysis workflows.

Method: Systematic evaluation of multiple tokenizers and preprocessing options tailored to assembly code. Intrinsic assessments cover tokenization efficiency, vocabulary compression, and representational fidelity. Downstream impact assessed on function signature prediction using state-of-the-art pre-trained models (decoder-only Llama 3.2, encoder-only BERT, and encoder-decoder BART) across multiple metrics.

Result: Tokenizer choice significantly influences downstream performance; intrinsic metrics provide partial but incomplete predictability of extrinsic outcomes. There are complex trade-offs between intrinsic tokenizer properties and practical utility in assembly-code tasks.

Conclusion: Gives actionable insights for optimizing tokenization of low-level code, enhancing robustness and scalability of NLP-based binary analysis workflows.

Abstract: Tokenization is fundamental in assembly code analysis, impacting intrinsic
characteristics like vocabulary size, semantic coverage, and extrinsic
performance in downstream tasks. Despite its significance, tokenization in the
context of assembly code remains an underexplored area. This study aims to
address this gap by evaluating the intrinsic properties of Natural Language
Processing (NLP) tokenization models and parameter choices, such as vocabulary
size. We explore preprocessing customization options and pre-tokenization rules
tailored to the unique characteristics of assembly code. Additionally, we
assess their impact on downstream tasks like function signature prediction -- a
critical problem in binary code analysis.
  To this end, we conduct a thorough study on various tokenization models,
systematically analyzing their efficiency in encoding assembly instructions and
capturing semantic nuances. Through intrinsic evaluations, we compare
tokenizers based on tokenization efficiency, vocabulary compression, and
representational fidelity for assembly code. Using state-of-the-art pre-trained
models such as the decoder-only Large Language Model (LLM) Llama 3.2, the
encoder-only transformer BERT, and the encoder-decoder model BART, we evaluate
the effectiveness of these tokenizers across multiple performance metrics.
Preliminary findings indicate that tokenizer choice significantly influences
downstream performance, with intrinsic metrics providing partial but incomplete
predictability of extrinsic evaluation outcomes. These results reveal complex
trade-offs between intrinsic tokenizer properties and their utility in
practical assembly code tasks. Ultimately, this study provides valuable
insights into optimizing tokenization models for low-level code analysis,
contributing to the robustness and scalability of Natural Language Model
(NLM)-based binary analysis workflows.

*Tianning Dong,Luyi Ma,Varun Vasudevan,Jason Cho,Sushant Kumar,Kannan Achan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A study benchmarking how modality choices (text vs image) affect MLLMs for user-behavior reasoning. It introduces BehaviorLens, a framework to compare six MLLMs across representations (text, scatter plot, flowchart) using real-world purchase data, finding image-based representations boost next-purchase accuracy by 87.5% with no extra compute.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand whether textual or image representations of sequential user-behavior data yield better MLLM performance and whether there are efficiency gains, addressing a gap in modality choice for MLLMs.

Method: Introduce BehaviorLens, a benchmarking framework; evaluate six MLLMs on a real-world purchase-sequence dataset; represent data as three modalities: text paragraph, scatter plot image, and flowchart image; assess next-purchase prediction performance.

Result: When data is represented as images, next-purchase prediction accuracy improves by 87.5% compared with an equivalent textual representation, with no additional computational cost.

Conclusion: Modalities matter for MLLM user-behavior reasoning; image representations can substantially boost performance without added compute, and BehaviorLens enables systematic cross-model, cross-modality benchmarking.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are reshaping how modern agentic
systems reason over sequential user-behavior data. However, whether textual or
image representations of user behavior data are more effective for maximizing
MLLM performance remains underexplored. We present \texttt{BehaviorLens}, a
systematic benchmarking framework for assessing modality trade-offs in
user-behavior reasoning across six MLLMs by representing transaction data as
(1) a text paragraph, (2) a scatter plot, and (3) a flowchart. Using a
real-world purchase-sequence dataset, we find that when data is represented as
images, MLLMs next-purchase prediction accuracy is improved by 87.5% compared
with an equivalent textual representation without any additional computational
cost.

### [167] [KnowThyself: An Agentic Assistant for LLM Interpretability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03878)
*Suraj Prasai,Mengnan Du,Ying Zhang,Fan Yang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: KnowThyself is a chat-based agentic assistant that unifies fragmented LLM interpretability tools via an orchestrator LLM and an agent router to deliver interactive visualizations and guided explanations, lowering technical barriers and enabling extensible LLM inspection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM interpretability tools are fragmented, code-intensive, and standalone. There is a need for a cohesive, user-friendly platform that can inspect and explain LLM behavior through natural language queries and visualizations.

Method: Proposes KnowThyself architecture: a chat-based interface where users upload models and ask questions; an orchestrator LLM reformulates queries; an agent router directs tasks to specialized modules; outputs are contextualized into coherent explanations within a conversational workflow.

Result: The abstract presents a design and architectural approach rather than empirical results. It claims to lower technical barriers and provide an extensible platform for LLM inspection with interactive visualizations and guided explanations.

Conclusion: KnowThyself offers a robust foundation for accessible LLM interpretability by consolidating fragmented tooling into a unified, conversational platform.

Abstract: We develop KnowThyself, an agentic assistant that advances large language
model (LLM) interpretability. Existing tools provide useful insights but remain
fragmented and code-intensive. KnowThyself consolidates these capabilities into
a chat-based interface, where users can upload models, pose natural language
questions, and obtain interactive visualizations with guided explanations. At
its core, an orchestrator LLM first reformulates user queries, an agent router
further directs them to specialized modules, and the outputs are finally
contextualized into coherent explanations. This design lowers technical
barriers and provides an extensible platform for LLM inspection. By embedding
the whole process into a conversational workflow, KnowThyself offers a robust
foundation for accessible LLM interpretability.

### [168] [Extracting Causal Relations in Deep Knowledge Tracing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03948)
*Kevin Hong,Kia Karbasi,Gregory Pottie*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DKT's success in knowledge tracing may stem from its implicit modeling of causal prerequisite relationships between knowledge components (KCs), not bidirectional KC relations. The authors prune relational graphs into DAGs, train DKT on causal subsets (Assistments dataset), and show predictive power aligns with causal structures; they also propose a method to extract such DAGs from DKT representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Explainable knowledge tracing is desired; prior claims attributed DKT's gains to bidirectional KC relations. This work investigates whether causal dependencies (prerequisites) better explain DKT's effectiveness and seeks methods to extract causal graphs.

Method: Prune exercise relation graphs into Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) and train DKT on causal subsets derived from the Assistments dataset. Additionally, propose an extraction approach that derives DAGs from DKT's learned representations to reveal underlying causal dependencies.

Result: DKT's predictive performance correlates strongly with the underlying causal DAG structures of KCs. The causal-subset training reproduces DKT's strengths, and the authors provide empirical evidence that DKT approximates causal dependencies rather than simple relational mappings. An alternative DAG extraction method based on DKT representations supports this claim.

Conclusion: DKT’s effectiveness in knowledge tracing appears largely driven by its capacity to approximate causal prerequisite dependencies among KCs, rather than purely exploiting bidirectional KC relationships. This has implications for designing interpretable KT models and for mining causal structures from neural representations.

Abstract: A longstanding goal in computational educational research is to develop
explainable knowledge tracing (KT) models. Deep Knowledge Tracing (DKT), which
leverages a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to predict student knowledge and
performance on exercises, has been proposed as a major advancement over
traditional KT methods. Several studies suggest that its performance gains stem
from its ability to model bidirectional relationships between different
knowledge components (KCs) within a course, enabling the inference of a
student's understanding of one KC from their performance on others. In this
paper, we challenge this prevailing explanation and demonstrate that DKT's
strength lies in its implicit ability to model prerequisite relationships as a
causal structure, rather than bidirectional relationships. By pruning exercise
relation graphs into Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) and training DKT on causal
subsets of the Assistments dataset, we show that DKT's predictive capabilities
align strongly with these causal structures. Furthermore, we propose an
alternative method for extracting exercise relation DAGs using DKT's learned
representations and provide empirical evidence supporting our claim. Our
findings suggest that DKT's effectiveness is largely driven by its capacity to
approximate causal dependencies between KCs rather than simple relational
mappings.

### [169] [LLMs and Cultural Values: the Impact of Prompt Language and Explicit Cultural Framing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03980)
*Bram Bulté,Ayla Rigouts Terryn*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs' responses vary with prompt language and cultural framing; explicit cultural framing can align outputs with country values but models are biased toward a small set of countries and cannot fully reflect global cultural diversity; combining language prompts with cultural framing offers no clear advantage over cultural framing with English.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess whether LLMs can represent broad cultural diversity given data/optimization biases by testing responses to culturally framed prompts across languages.

Method: Evaluate 10 LLMs on 63 items from Hofstede Values Survey Module and World Values Survey, translated into 11 languages, presented with and without explicit cultural perspectives, measuring alignment with human values across countries.

Result: Prompt language and cultural perspective influence outputs; targeted prompting can steer outputs toward country values but does not overcome systematic bias toward values from the Netherlands, Germany, the US, and Japan; models show similar patterns across origins; outputs are largely neutral with selective progressive stances on topics like social tolerance; alignment improves more with explicit cultural perspective than with language prompts; combining both approaches is no more effective than cultural framing in English.

Conclusion: LLMs sit between being responsive to prompts and anchored to cultural defaults, limiting true representation of cultural diversity; deeper interventions beyond prompt language or framing are needed to achieve authentic cross-cultural alignment.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are rapidly being adopted by users across the
globe, who interact with them in a diverse range of languages. At the same
time, there are well-documented imbalances in the training data and
optimisation objectives of this technology, raising doubts as to whether LLMs
can represent the cultural diversity of their broad user base. In this study,
we look at LLMs and cultural values and examine how prompt language and
cultural framing influence model responses and their alignment with human
values in different countries. We probe 10 LLMs with 63 items from the Hofstede
Values Survey Module and World Values Survey, translated into 11 languages, and
formulated as prompts with and without different explicit cultural
perspectives. Our study confirms that both prompt language and cultural
perspective produce variation in LLM outputs, but with an important caveat:
While targeted prompting can, to a certain extent, steer LLM responses in the
direction of the predominant values of the corresponding countries, it does not
overcome the models' systematic bias toward the values associated with a
restricted set of countries in our dataset: the Netherlands, Germany, the US,
and Japan. All tested models, regardless of their origin, exhibit remarkably
similar patterns: They produce fairly neutral responses on most topics, with
selective progressive stances on issues such as social tolerance. Alignment
with cultural values of human respondents is improved more with an explicit
cultural perspective than with a targeted prompt language. Unexpectedly,
combining both approaches is no more effective than cultural framing with an
English prompt. These findings reveal that LLMs occupy an uncomfortable middle
ground: They are responsive enough to changes in prompts to produce variation,
but too firmly anchored to specific cultural defaults to adequately represent
cultural diversity.

### [170] [ArchPilot: A Proxy-Guided Multi-Agent Approach for Machine Learning Engineering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03985)
*Zhuowen Yuan,Tao Liu,Yang Yang,Yang Wang,Feng Qi,Kaushik Rangadurai,Bo Li,Shuang Yang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ArchPilot introduces a three-agent system to reduce reliance on full training by proxy-based evaluation and an MCTS-inspired orchestration strategy, enabling efficient architecture search within budget.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Full training-based evaluation is computationally expensive and scales poorly; there is a need for scalable, budget-aware, faster iteration in automated ML engineering.

Method: Three specialized agents: orchestration agent using an MCTS-inspired algorithm with restarts and memory of candidates; generation agent iteratively designs and refines architectures; evaluation agent executes proxy training, builds/optimizes proxy functions, and produces a fidelity-aware performance metric; collaboration prioritizes high-potential candidates with limited full trainings.

Result: On MLE-Bench, ArchPilot outperforms state-of-the-art baselines (AIDE, ML-Master), validating the effectiveness of the multi-agent approach and proxy-based evaluation for efficient ML engineering.

Conclusion: A coordinated multi-agent framework with proxy evaluation and adaptive search can accelerate automated ML engineering under budget constraints, achieving competitive performance with fewer full training runs.

Abstract: Recent LLM-based agents have demonstrated strong capabilities in automated ML
engineering. However, they heavily rely on repeated full training runs to
evaluate candidate solutions, resulting in significant computational overhead,
limited scalability to large search spaces, and slow iteration cycles. To
address these challenges, we introduce ArchPilot, a multi-agent system that
integrates architecture generation, proxy-based evaluation, and adaptive search
into a unified framework. ArchPilot consists of three specialized agents: an
orchestration agent that coordinates the search process using a Monte Carlo
Tree Search (MCTS)-inspired novel algorithm with a restart mechanism and
manages memory of previous candidates; a generation agent that iteratively
generates, improves, and debugs candidate architectures; and an evaluation
agent that executes proxy training runs, generates and optimizes proxy
functions, and aggregates the proxy scores into a fidelity-aware performance
metric. This multi-agent collaboration allows ArchPilot to prioritize
high-potential candidates with minimal reliance on expensive full training
runs, facilitating efficient ML engineering under limited budgets. Experiments
on MLE-Bench demonstrate that ArchPilot outperforms SOTA baselines such as AIDE
and ML-Master, validating the effectiveness of our multi-agent system.

*Divya Pathak,Harshit Kumar,Anuska Roy,Felix George,Mudit Verma,Pratibha Moogi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: First systematic study of anomaly detection in Multi-Agentic AI systems; introduces anomaly detection for agentic trajectories; curates two labeled datasets (4,275 and 894 trajectories); supervised (XGBoost) and semi-supervised (SVDD) methods achieve high accuracy; provides datasets and benchmarks for future work.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Non-determinism and silent failures in Multi-Agentic AI systems (drift, cycles, missing details) are hard to detect. There is a lack of anomaly datasets and benchmarks to study anomaly detection in agentic trajectories.

Method: Develop a dataset curation pipeline capturing user behavior, agent non-determinism, and LLM variation; curate and label two benchmark datasets; benchmark anomaly detection methods (supervised XGBoost and semi-supervised SVDD) on these datasets.

Result: Supervised XGBoost and semi-supervised SVDD achieve accuracies up to 98% and 96%, respectively.

Conclusion: This work provides the first systematic study of anomaly detection in Multi-Agentic AI systems, delivering datasets, benchmarks, and insights to guide future research.

Abstract: Multi-Agentic AI systems, powered by large language models (LLMs), are
inherently non-deterministic and prone to silent failures such as drift,
cycles, and missing details in outputs, which are difficult to detect. We
introduce the task of anomaly detection in agentic trajectories to identify
these failures and present a dataset curation pipeline that captures user
behavior, agent non-determinism, and LLM variation. Using this pipeline, we
curate and label two benchmark datasets comprising \textbf{4,275 and 894}
trajectories from Multi-Agentic AI systems. Benchmarking anomaly detection
methods on these datasets, we show that supervised (XGBoost) and
semi-supervised (SVDD) approaches perform comparably, achieving accuracies up
to 98% and 96%, respectively. This work provides the first systematic study of
anomaly detection in Multi-Agentic AI systems, offering datasets, benchmarks,
and insights to guide future research.

*Hirohane Takagi,Gouki Minegishi,Shota Kizawa,Issey Sukeda,Hitomi Yanaka*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs encode and amplify real-world numerical correlations in shared latent spaces; irrelevant numerical context perturbs magnitudes with size-dependent downstream effects, revealing a vulnerability and a need for representation-aware control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To uncover how LLMs internally represent and integrate multiple numerical attributes and how irrelevant numerical context disrupts these representations and outputs.

Method: Linear probing, partial correlation analysis, and prompt-based vulnerability tests across models of varying sizes.

Result: LLMs encode real-world numerical correlations and tend to amplify them; irrelevant context induces shifts in magnitude representations with downstream effects that vary by model size.

Conclusion: This uncovers a vulnerability in LLM decision-making and lays groundwork for fairer, representation-aware control under multi-attribute entanglement.

Abstract: Although behavioral studies have documented numerical reasoning errors in
large language models (LLMs), the underlying representational mechanisms remain
unclear. We hypothesize that numerical attributes occupy shared latent
subspaces and investigate two questions:(1) How do LLMs internally integrate
multiple numerical attributes of a single entity? (2)How does irrelevant
numerical context perturb these representations and their downstream outputs?
To address these questions, we combine linear probing with partial correlation
analysis and prompt-based vulnerability tests across models of varying sizes.
Our results show that LLMs encode real-world numerical correlations but tend to
systematically amplify them. Moreover, irrelevant context induces consistent
shifts in magnitude representations, with downstream effects that vary by model
size. These findings reveal a vulnerability in LLM decision-making and lay the
groundwork for fairer, representation-aware control under multi-attribute
entanglement.

### [173] [Agentmandering: A Game-Theoretic Framework for Fair Redistricting via Large Language Model Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04076)
*Hao Li,Haotian Chen,Ruoyuan Gong,Juanjuan Wang,Hao Jiang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Agentmandering reframes redistricting as a turn-based negotiation between opposing agents using LLMs and a Choose-and-Freeze protocol to select districts from candidate maps, addressing both formal constraints and strategic manipulation. It achieves fairness and stability with dramatically lower variance than baselines, based on post-2020 census data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing computational redistricting methods emphasize generating large ensembles of legally valid plans but largely ignore the strategic dynamics of map selection. This omission allows partisan actors to cherry-pick maps that are technically compliant yet politically advantageous. Fairness should consider not only constraints but also the selection process itself.

Method: Two opposing agents (LLMs) alternate between selecting and freezing districts from a small set of candidate maps, gradually partitioning the state through constrained and interpretable choices. This mirrors a Choose-and-Freeze style negotiation and embeds strategic interaction into redistricting. The evaluation uses post-2020 U.S. Census data across all states, with code provided.

Result: Agentmandering significantly reduces partisan bias and unfairness and achieves 2 to 3 orders of magnitude lower variance than standard baselines, indicating both fairness and stability, particularly in swing-state scenarios.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates that incorporating strategic interaction into redistricting can yield fairer and more stable outcomes, and the authors provide a public codebase for replication.

Abstract: Redistricting plays a central role in shaping how votes are translated into
political power. While existing computational methods primarily aim to generate
large ensembles of legally valid districting plans, they often neglect the
strategic dynamics involved in the selection process. This oversight creates
opportunities for partisan actors to cherry-pick maps that, while technically
compliant, are politically advantageous. Simply satisfying formal constraints
does not ensure fairness when the selection process itself can be manipulated.
We propose \textbf{Agentmandering}, a framework that reimagines redistricting
as a turn-based negotiation between two agents representing opposing political
interests. Drawing inspiration from game-theoretic ideas, particularly the
\textit{Choose-and-Freeze} protocol, our method embeds strategic interaction
into the redistricting process via large language model (LLM) agents. Agents
alternate between selecting and freezing districts from a small set of
candidate maps, gradually partitioning the state through constrained and
interpretable choices. Evaluation on post-2020 U.S. Census data across all
states shows that Agentmandering significantly reduces partisan bias and
unfairness, while achieving 2 to 3 orders of magnitude lower variance than
standard baselines. These results demonstrate both fairness and stability,
especially in swing-state scenarios. Our code is available at

### [174] [KGFR: A Foundation Retriever for Generalized Knowledge Graph Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04093)
*Yuanning Cui,Zequn Sun,Wei Hu,Zhangjie Fu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLM-KGFR is a collaborative framework that pairs a large language model with a Knowledge Graph Foundation Retriever (KGFR) to enable zero-shot generalization to unseen knowledge graphs and scalable, KG-augmented reasoning via Asymmetric Progressive Propagation and multi-level interfaces for node/edge/path reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs can reason well but struggle with knowledge-intensive questions due to limited context and reliance on parametric memory. Finetuned LLMs or GNN retrievers face dataset-specific tuning and scalability issues on large or unseen graphs; there is a need for zero-shot generalization and scalable retrieval.

Method: KGFR encodes relations with descriptions generated by the LLM and initializes entities based on their roles in the question. It uses Asymmetric Progressive Propagation (APP) to progressively expand the relevant subgraph while avoiding high-degree nodes. The system provides node-, edge-, and path-level interfaces allowing the LLM to iteratively request candidate answers, supporting facts, and reasoning paths, forming a controllable reasoning loop.

Result: Experiments show strong performance of LLM-KGFR with good scalability and generalization, demonstrating a practical solution for KG-augmented reasoning.

Conclusion: LLM-KGFR offers a scalable, generalizable framework that combines LLM reasoning with a structured KG retriever, enabling efficient reasoning over large or unseen knowledge graphs through APP and multi-level interfaces.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at reasoning but struggle with
knowledge-intensive questions due to limited context and parametric knowledge.
However, existing methods that rely on finetuned LLMs or GNN retrievers are
limited by dataset-specific tuning and scalability on large or unseen graphs.
We propose the LLM-KGFR collaborative framework, where an LLM works with a
structured retriever, the Knowledge Graph Foundation Retriever (KGFR). KGFR
encodes relations using LLM-generated descriptions and initializes entities
based on their roles in the question, enabling zero-shot generalization to
unseen KGs. To handle large graphs efficiently, it employs Asymmetric
Progressive Propagation (APP)- a stepwise expansion that selectively limits
high-degree nodes while retaining informative paths. Through node-, edge-, and
path-level interfaces, the LLM iteratively requests candidate answers,
supporting facts, and reasoning paths, forming a controllable reasoning loop.
Experiments demonstrate that LLM-KGFR achieves strong performance while
maintaining scalability and generalization, providing a practical solution for
KG-augmented reasoning.

*Miguel E. Andres,Vadim Fedorov,Rida Sadek,Enric Spagnolo-Arrizabalaga,Nadescha Trudel*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A systematic, human-centered benchmarking framework for evaluating voice AI testing platforms, combining psychometric methods to measure simulation and evaluation quality, validated across three commercial platforms with large-scale human judgments; top platform, Evalion, shows superior evaluation and simulation metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As voice AI scales to billions of daily interactions, there is no objective, reproducible way to assess whether testing approaches (internal tools or external platforms) actually work, creating a measurement gap.

Method: Develop a framework that integrates psychometric techniques (pairwise comparisons with Elo ratings, bootstrap confidence intervals, permutation tests) with rigorous validation. Apply it to 21,600 human judgments across 45 simulations and 60 conversations to compare three leading commercial Voice AI Testing platforms.

Result: The framework detects statistically significant differences between platforms. Evalion achieves higher evaluation quality (0.92 F1) versus 0.73 for rivals, and higher simulation quality (0.61 league-based score) versus 0.43 for rivals, indicating practical superiority.

Conclusion: The proposed framework provides reproducible, quantitative metrics for validating testing capabilities across platforms, enabling reliable, scalable voice AI deployment and facilitating adoption through accompanying materials.

Abstract: Voice AI agents are rapidly transitioning to production deployments, yet
systematic methods for ensuring testing reliability remain underdeveloped.
Organizations cannot objectively assess whether their testing approaches
(internal tools or external platforms) actually work, creating a critical
measurement gap as voice AI scales to billions of daily interactions.
  We present the first systematic framework for evaluating voice AI testing
quality through human-centered benchmarking. Our methodology addresses the
fundamental dual challenge of testing platforms: generating realistic test
conversations (simulation quality) and accurately evaluating agent responses
(evaluation quality). The framework combines established psychometric
techniques (pairwise comparisons yielding Elo ratings, bootstrap confidence
intervals, and permutation tests) with rigorous statistical validation to
provide reproducible metrics applicable to any testing approach.
  To validate the framework and demonstrate its utility, we conducted
comprehensive empirical evaluation of three leading commercial platforms
focused on Voice AI Testing using 21,600 human judgments across 45 simulations
and ground truth validation on 60 conversations. Results reveal statistically
significant performance differences with the proposed framework, with the
top-performing platform, Evalion, achieving 0.92 evaluation quality measured as
f1-score versus 0.73 for others, and 0.61 simulation quality using a league
based scoring system (including ties) vs 0.43 for other platforms.
  This framework enables researchers and organizations to empirically validate
the testing capabilities of any platform, providing essential measurement
foundations for confident voice AI deployment at scale. Supporting materials
are made available to facilitate reproducibility and adoption.

### [176] [When Empowerment Disempowers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04177)
*Claire Yang,Maya Cakmak,Max Kleiman-Weiner*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Empowerment-based goals for assistive AI can inadvertently disempower other humans in multi-human settings; introducing Disempower-Grid reveals when this happens and how joint empowerment can mitigate it at the cost of the user's reward, highlighting misalignment of goal-agnostic objectives in multi-agent environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To study whether a universal, single-agent empowerment objective remains effective in multi-human environments and whether optimizing for one human's empowerment can negatively affect others, revealing potential pitfalls for AI alignment.

Method: Introduce Disempower-Grid, an open-source multi-human gridworld test suite. Conduct empirical experiments showing that optimizing for one human's empowerment reduces another human's environmental influence and rewards (disempowerment). Formalize disempowerment, characterize its conditions, and demonstrate that joint empowerment mitigates disempowerment but decreases the user's own reward.

Result: Identification of disempowerment as a phenomenon in multi-human empowerment settings. Characterization of when it occurs. Evidence that joint empowerment can mitigate disempowerment, at the expense of the empowered individual's reward.

Conclusion: Goal-agnostic objectives that appear aligned in single-agent contexts can become misaligned in multi-agent settings, underscoring a broader AI alignment challenge for assistive and collaborative AI systems.

Abstract: Empowerment, a measure of an agent's ability to control its environment, has
been proposed as a universal goal-agnostic objective for motivating assistive
behavior in AI agents. While multi-human settings like homes and hospitals are
promising for AI assistance, prior work on empowerment-based assistance assumes
that the agent assists one human in isolation. We introduce an open source
multi-human gridworld test suite Disempower-Grid. Using Disempower-Grid, we
empirically show that assistive RL agents optimizing for one human's
empowerment can significantly reduce another human's environmental influence
and rewards - a phenomenon we formalize as disempowerment. We characterize when
disempowerment occurs in these environments and show that joint empowerment
mitigates disempowerment at the cost of the user's reward. Our work reveals a
broader challenge for the AI alignment community: goal-agnostic objectives that
seem aligned in single-agent settings can become misaligned in multi-agent
contexts.

*Alan Seroul,Théo Fagnoni,Inès Adnani,Dana O. Mohamed,Phillip Kingston*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Opus Workflow Evaluation Framework provides a probabilistic-normative model to measure and optimize workflow quality by combining a probabilistic reward with normative penalties, enabling automated assessment, ranking, and optimization in automation systems and RL loops.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To deliver a coherent, quantitative framework that unifies correctness, reliability, and cost in workflows, allowing direct comparison, scoring, and optimization across automated processes.

Method: Defines the Opus Workflow Reward as a probabilistic expectation of performance based on success likelihood, resource usage, and output gain; defines Opus Workflow Normative Penalties as measurable functions for structural and informational quality across Cohesion, Coupling, Observability, and Information Hygiene; proposes a unified Reward-Penalty optimization formulation to identify and rank optimal workflows.

Result: Proposes a formal framework and its constituent models (Reward and Normative Penalties) and an optimization formulation, enabling automated assessment, ranking, and optimization of workflows; supports integration into reinforcement learning loops and automation systems like Opus.

Conclusion: Provides a mathematical foundation for comparing and optimizing workflows, facilitating more reliable and cost-efficient automation, and establishing groundwork for implementation and empirical validation.

Abstract: This paper introduces the Opus Workflow Evaluation Framework, a
probabilistic-normative formulation for quantifying Workflow quality and
efficiency. It integrates notions of correctness, reliability, and cost into a
coherent mathematical model that enables direct comparison, scoring, and
optimization of Workflows. The framework combines the Opus Workflow Reward, a
probabilistic function estimating expected performance through success
likelihood, resource usage, and output gain, with the Opus Workflow Normative
Penalties, a set of measurable functions capturing structural and informational
quality across Cohesion, Coupling, Observability, and Information Hygiene. It
supports automated Workflow assessment, ranking, and optimization within modern
automation systems such as Opus and can be integrated into Reinforcement
Learning loops to guide Workflow discovery and refinement. In this paper, we
introduce the Opus Workflow Reward model that formalizes Workflow success as a
probabilistic expectation over costs and outcomes. We define measurable Opus
Workflow Normative Penalties capturing structural, semantic, and signal-related
properties of Workflows. Finally, we propose a unified optimization formulation
for identifying and ranking optimal Workflows under joint Reward-Penalty
trade-offs.

### [178] [Shared Spatial Memory Through Predictive Coding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04235)
*Zhengru Fang,Yu Guo,Jingjing Wang,Yuang Zhang,Haonan An,Yinhai Wang,Yuguang Fang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A multi-agent predictive coding framework minimizes joint uncertainty via an information bottleneck to learn when, what, and how to communicate, yielding bandwidth-efficient social representations and robust coordination in Memory-Maze.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome partial observability and limited communication bandwidth in multi-agent coordination by developing principled, scalable social representations that support collective intelligence.

Method: Formulate coordination as minimization of mutual uncertainty among agents using an information bottleneck objective; derive a grid-cell-like internal spatial code from self-supervised motion prediction; develop social place cells (SPCs) encoding partners' locations; implement a hierarchical reinforcement learning policy that actively explores to reduce joint uncertainty.

Result: On Memory-Maze, the approach maintains higher success under bandwidth constraints, with performance dropping from 73.5% to 64.4% as bandwidth goes from 128 to 4 bits/step, while a full-broadcast baseline falls from 67.6% to 28.6%, illustrating resilience to bandwidth limits.

Conclusion: The work offers a theoretically principled and biologically plausible route for emergent social representations from predictive goals, enabling social collective intelligence under bandwidth constraints.

Abstract: Sharing and reconstructing a consistent spatial memory is a critical
challenge in multi-agent systems, where partial observability and limited
bandwidth often lead to catastrophic failures in coordination. We introduce a
multi-agent predictive coding framework that formulate coordination as the
minimization of mutual uncertainty among agents. Instantiated as an information
bottleneck objective, it prompts agents to learn not only who and what to
communicate but also when. At the foundation of this framework lies a
grid-cell-like metric as internal spatial coding for self-localization,
emerging spontaneously from self-supervised motion prediction. Building upon
this internal spatial code, agents gradually develop a bandwidth-efficient
communication mechanism and specialized neural populations that encode
partners' locations: an artificial analogue of hippocampal social place cells
(SPCs). These social representations are further enacted by a hierarchical
reinforcement learning policy that actively explores to reduce joint
uncertainty. On the Memory-Maze benchmark, our approach shows exceptional
resilience to bandwidth constraints: success degrades gracefully from 73.5% to
64.4% as bandwidth shrinks from 128 to 4 bits/step, whereas a full-broadcast
baseline collapses from 67.6% to 28.6%. Our findings establish a theoretically
principled and biologically plausible basis for how complex social
representations emerge from a unified predictive drive, leading to social
collective intelligence.

*Zeng Zhiyuan,Jiashuo Liu,Zhangyue Yin,Ge Zhang,Wenhao Huang,Xipeng Qiu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RLoop mitigates RLVR overfitting by iterative policy reinitialization and rejection-sampling fine-tuning, improving generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RLVR achieves strong training rewards but struggles to generalize due to policy over-specialization and forgetting of diverse strategies; standard optimization discards inter-step policy diversity.

Method: RLoop is a self-improving loop: (1) RL explores from the current policy to generate trajectories; (2) successful trajectories are filtered to form an expert dataset; (3) Rejection-sampling Fine-Tuning (RFT) refines the initial policy using the expert data; (4) the refined policy is used to re-initialize for the next iteration, creating a virtuous cycle of exploration and exploitation.

Result: RLoop reduces forgetting and substantially improves generalization, showing average accuracy gains of about 9% and pass@32 improvements of over 15% compared to vanilla RL.

Conclusion: Iterative re-initialization that preserves and leverages inter-step policy diversity can transform transient policy variations into robust performance gains in RLVR settings.

Abstract: While Reinforcement Learning for Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) is powerful for
training large reasoning models, its training dynamics harbor a critical
challenge: RL overfitting, where models gain training rewards but lose
generalization. Our analysis reveals this is driven by policy
over-specialization and catastrophic forgetting of diverse solutions generated
during training. Standard optimization discards this valuable inter-step policy
diversity. To address this, we introduce RLoop, a self-improving framework
built on iterative policy initialization. RLoop transforms the standard
training process into a virtuous cycle: it first uses RL to explore the
solution space from a given policy, then filters the successful trajectories to
create an expert dataset. This dataset is used via Rejection-sampling
Fine-Tuning (RFT) to refine the initial policy, creating a superior starting
point for the next iteration. This loop of exploration and exploitation via
iterative re-initialization effectively converts transient policy variations
into robust performance gains. Our experiments show RLoop mitigates forgetting
and substantially improves generalization, boosting average accuracy by 9% and
pass@32 by over 15% compared to vanilla RL.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GUI-360° is a large-scale dataset and benchmark suite for computer-using agents, tackling real-world GUI tasks with an automated LLM-augmented pipeline. It provides 1.2M action steps across Windows Office apps, enabling evaluation of GUI grounding, screen parsing, and action prediction with a GUI+API action space; results show current models struggle, gains from fine-tuning/RL but still lag human reliability; dataset and code are publicly released.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To close three persistent gaps in CUA research: (1) scarcity of real-world GUI tasks, (2) lack of automated pipelines for collecting and annotating multi-modal trajectories, and (3) absence of a unified benchmark that jointly evaluates GUI grounding, screen parsing, and action prediction.

Method: An LLM-augmented, largely automated pipeline for query sourcing, environment-template construction, task instantiation, batched execution, and LLM-driven quality filtering. The dataset includes over 1.2 million executed action steps across thousands of trajectories in Windows office apps, with full-resolution screenshots, accessibility metadata, instantiated goals, intermediate reasoning traces, and both successful and failed trajectories. It supports three canonical tasks—GUI grounding, screen parsing, and action prediction—and uses a hybrid GUI+API action space. Benchmarking state-of-the-art vision-language models reveals gaps; supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning yield gains but do not reach human reliability.

Result: Released GUI-360° with accompanying code; the corpus contains 1.2M action steps across thousands of trajectories in Windows office apps, including screenshots, accessibility metadata, goals, intermediate reasoning traces, and both successful and failed trajectories. Baseline models exhibit substantial out-of-the-box deficiencies in grounding and action prediction; fine-tuning and RL improve performance but gaps to human reliability remain.

Conclusion: GUI-360° provides a scalable, reproducible resource to advance desktop CUAs and accelerate progress toward robust, human-like reliability, with public release on HuggingFace.

Abstract: We introduce GUI-360$^\circ$, a large-scale, comprehensive dataset and
benchmark suite designed to advance computer-using agents (CUAs). CUAs present
unique challenges and is constrained by three persistent gaps: a scarcity of
real-world CUA tasks, the lack of automated collection-and-annotation pipelines
for multi-modal trajectories, and the absence of a unified benchmark that
jointly evaluates GUI grounding, screen parsing, and action prediction.
  GUI-360$^\circ$ addresses these gaps with an LLM-augmented, largely automated
pipeline for query sourcing, environment-template construction, task
instantiation, batched execution, and LLM-driven quality filtering. The
released corpus contains over 1.2M executed action steps across thousands of
trajectories in popular Windows office applications, and includes
full-resolution screenshots, accessibility metadata when available,
instantiated goals, intermediate reasoning traces, and both successful and
failed action trajectories. The dataset supports three canonical tasks, GUI
grounding, screen parsing, and action prediction, and a hybrid GUI+API action
space that reflects modern agent designs. Benchmarking state-of-the-art
vision--language models on GUI-360$^\circ$ reveals substantial out-of-the-box
shortcomings in grounding and action prediction; supervised fine-tuning and
reinforcement learning yield significant gains but do not close the gap to
human-level reliability. We release GUI-360$^\circ$ and accompanying code to
facilitate reproducible research and accelerate progress on robust desktop
CUAs.

### [181] [Probing the Probes: Methods and Metrics for Concept Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04312)
*Jacob Lysnæs-Larsen,Marte Eggen,Inga Strümke*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Probe accuracy alone is an unreliable measure of concept alignment in CAVs; many probes exploit spurious correlations. The authors propose a spatial attribution–based localization method, three evaluation metrics (hard accuracy, segmentation scores, augmentation robustness), and show that translation invariance and spatial alignment improve concept alignment, arguing for alignment-based evaluation and concept-specific probe design.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the mismatch between high probe accuracy and faithful concept representation in Concept Activation Vectors, and to mitigate probes exploiting spurious correlations.

Method: Develop spatial linear attribution-based concept localization; compare with existing feature-visualization techniques; define three quantitative alignment metrics; evaluate across model architectures and concepts; analyze invariance properties.

Result: Demonstrates susceptibility of standard probes to encode spurious correlations; misaligned probes can reach similar accuracy; spatially aligned and translation-invariant probes yield better concept alignment; introduces three metrics (hard accuracy, segmentation scores, augmentation robustness) to assess alignment.

Conclusion: Alignment-based evaluation is essential for CAVs; tailor probes to architecture and target concept; localization methods outperform pure accuracy in detecting misalignment; adopt invariance-aware probes and metrics to ensure faithful concept representation.

Abstract: In explainable AI, Concept Activation Vectors (CAVs) are typically obtained
by training linear classifier probes to detect human-understandable concepts as
directions in the activation space of deep neural networks. It is widely
assumed that a high probe accuracy indicates a CAV faithfully representing its
target concept. However, we show that the probe's classification accuracy alone
is an unreliable measure of concept alignment, i.e., the degree to which a CAV
captures the intended concept. In fact, we argue that probes are more likely to
capture spurious correlations than they are to represent only the intended
concept. As part of our analysis, we demonstrate that deliberately misaligned
probes constructed to exploit spurious correlations, achieve an accuracy close
to that of standard probes. To address this severe problem, we introduce a
novel concept localization method based on spatial linear attribution, and
provide a comprehensive comparison of it to existing feature visualization
techniques for detecting and mitigating concept misalignment. We further
propose three classes of metrics for quantitatively assessing concept
alignment: hard accuracy, segmentation scores, and augmentation robustness. Our
analysis shows that probes with translation invariance and spatial alignment
consistently increase concept alignment. These findings highlight the need for
alignment-based evaluation metrics rather than probe accuracy, and the
importance of tailoring probes to both the model architecture and the nature of
the target concept.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A reproducible, extensible toolbox (AdversariaLLM) for LLM jailbreak robustness research, unifying 12 attack methods, 7 benchmarks, open-weight LLM access, and JudgeZoo to improve comparability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fragmentation in LLM safety research hinders reproducibility and fair comparisons; there is a need for a unified, transparent framework.

Method: AdversariaLLM implements twelve adversarial attack algorithms, integrates seven benchmark datasets (spanning harmfulness, over-refusal, and utility), provides access to open-weight LLMs via Hugging Face, and includes features for reproducibility (compute-resource tracking, deterministic results, distributional evaluation); JudgeZoo integration.

Result: A usable framework enabling reproducible, comparable jailbreak robustness research; supports deterministic runs, resource tracking, and standardized evaluation; establishes a foundation for transparency in LLM safety research.

Conclusion: AdversariaLLM and JudgeZoo offer a robust, transparent foundation for reproducible LLM safety research, with potential to improve cross-study comparability once broadly adopted.

Abstract: The rapid expansion of research on Large Language Model (LLM) safety and
robustness has produced a fragmented and oftentimes buggy ecosystem of
implementations, datasets, and evaluation methods. This fragmentation makes
reproducibility and comparability across studies challenging, hindering
meaningful progress. To address these issues, we introduce AdversariaLLM, a
toolbox for conducting LLM jailbreak robustness research. Its design centers on
reproducibility, correctness, and extensibility. The framework implements
twelve adversarial attack algorithms, integrates seven benchmark datasets
spanning harmfulness, over-refusal, and utility evaluation, and provides access
to a wide range of open-weight LLMs via Hugging Face. The implementation
includes advanced features for comparability and reproducibility such as
compute-resource tracking, deterministic results, and distributional evaluation
techniques. \name also integrates judging through the companion package
JudgeZoo, which can also be used independently. Together, these components aim
to establish a robust foundation for transparent, comparable, and reproducible
research in LLM safety.

*Jiahao Zhao,Luxin Xu,Minghuan Tan,Lichao Zhang,Ahmadreza Argha,Hamid Alinejad-Rokny,Min Yang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RxSafeBench introduces a realistic, two-stage framework and RxRisk DB to benchmark LLM medication safety in simulated clinical consultations, revealing current LLMs struggle with contraindications and drug interactions when risks are implicit.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medication safety in LLM-driven clinical support is underexplored due to lack of real-world, privacy-constrained datasets and realistic evaluation settings. A dedicated benchmark is needed to assess LLMs’ ability to reason about contraindications and interactions in patient contexts.

Method: Generate inquiry-diagnosis dialogues with embedded medication risks and assemble RxRisk DB (6,725 contraindications; 28,781 drug interactions; 14,906 indication-drug pairs). Apply a two-stage filtering for clinical realism and quality. Create RxSafeBench with 2,443 high-quality consultation scenarios. Evaluate open-source and proprietary LLMs using structured multiple-choice questions to assess safe medication recommendations in simulated patient contexts.

Result: LLMs currently struggle to integrate contraindication and interaction knowledge, particularly when risks are implied rather than explicit. Highlighted challenges in achieving medication safety; results suggest improvements through better prompting and task-specific tuning.

Conclusion: RxSafeBench provides the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating medication safety in LLMs, enabling safer and more trustworthy AI-driven clinical decision support and guiding future model development and evaluation.

Abstract: Numerous medical systems powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) have
achieved remarkable progress in diverse healthcare tasks. However, research on
their medication safety remains limited due to the lack of real world datasets,
constrained by privacy and accessibility issues. Moreover, evaluation of LLMs
in realistic clinical consultation settings, particularly regarding medication
safety, is still underexplored. To address these gaps, we propose a framework
that simulates and evaluates clinical consultations to systematically assess
the medication safety capabilities of LLMs. Within this framework, we generate
inquiry diagnosis dialogues with embedded medication risks and construct a
dedicated medication safety database, RxRisk DB, containing 6,725
contraindications, 28,781 drug interactions, and 14,906 indication-drug pairs.
A two-stage filtering strategy ensures clinical realism and professional
quality, resulting in the benchmark RxSafeBench with 2,443 high-quality
consultation scenarios. We evaluate leading open-source and proprietary LLMs
using structured multiple choice questions that test their ability to recommend
safe medications under simulated patient contexts. Results show that current
LLMs struggle to integrate contraindication and interaction knowledge,
especially when risks are implied rather than explicit. Our findings highlight
key challenges in ensuring medication safety in LLM-based systems and provide
insights into improving reliability through better prompting and task-specific
tuning. RxSafeBench offers the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating
medication safety in LLMs, advancing safer and more trustworthy AI-driven
clinical decision support.

*Nick Oh,Fernand Gobet*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposal of Monitor-Generate-Verify (MGV) framework that adds explicit metacognitive monitoring before generation to mitigate prefix dominance in Generate-Verify architectures; theoretical, with no empirical validation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the prefix dominance trap and substantial accuracy loss in Generate-Verify-style test-time reasoning by embedding explicit monitoring informed by metacognitive theories.

Method: Formalize метacognitive theories (Flavell; Nelson & Narens) into computational specifications and define the Monitor-Generate-Verify framework that introduces monitoring before generation and uses verification feedback to refine monitoring—extending Generate-Verify; no empirical validation is provided.

Result: Conceptual framework; first systematic computational translation of foundational metacognitive theories; identifies where monitoring should occur and how feedback updates monitoring; offers architectural interventions for future designs.

Conclusion: MGV fills an architectural gap by incorporating metacognitive monitoring into test-time reasoning, provides a principled vocabulary for diagnosing reasoning failures, and suggests concrete directions for future empirical validation and design improvements.

Abstract: Test-time reasoning architectures such as those following the Generate-Verify
paradigm -- where a model iteratively refines or verifies its own generated
outputs -- prioritise generation and verification but exclude the monitoring
processes that determine when and how reasoning should begin. This omission may
contribute to the prefix dominance trap, in which models commit early to
suboptimal reasoning paths and seldom recover, yielding roughly 20% accuracy
loss. We address this architectural gap by formalising Flavell's and Nelson and
Narens' metacognitive theories into computational specifications, proposing the
Monitor-Generate-Verify (MGV) framework. MGV extends the Generate-Verify
paradigm by adding explicit monitoring that captures metacognitive experiences
(from difficulty assessments to confidence judgements) before generation begins
and refines future monitoring through verification feedback. Though we present
no empirical validation, this work provides the first systematic computational
translation of foundational metacognitive theories, offering a principled
vocabulary for understanding reasoning system failures and suggesting specific
architectural interventions for future test-time reasoning designs.

*Chanwoo Park,Ziyang Chen,Asuman Ozdaglar,Kaiqing Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Iterative RMFT is a post-training method that fine-tunes LLMs on their own low-regret decision trajectories to improve decision-making without engineered templates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle in online decision-making and often fail to achieve low regret or effective exploration-exploitation. A flexible training signal that elicits DM ability and reasoning is needed.

Method: Iteratively roll out decision trajectories, compute regret for each, select the k lowest-regret trajectories, and fine-tune the model on them. Repeat across iterations. Unlike prior work, it uses regret as the signal and relies on model-generated reasoning rather than external DM algorithms or handcrafted chain-of-thought prompts.

Result: Empirically improves DM performance across diverse models, including transformers with numerical IO, open-weight LLMs, and advanced closed-weight models like GPT-4o mini. Demonstrates generalization across tasks with varying horizons, action spaces, reward processes, and natural-language contexts.

Conclusion: Presents a principled, general post-training framework for enhancing LLMs’ decision-making; offers theoretical insight that a single-layer Transformer can act as a no-regret learner in a simplified setting.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as "agents" for
decision-making (DM) in interactive and dynamic environments. Yet, since they
were not originally designed for DM, recent studies show that LLMs can struggle
even in basic online DM problems, failing to achieve low regret or an effective
exploration-exploitation tradeoff. To address this, we introduce Iterative
Regret-Minimization Fine-Tuning (Iterative RMFT), a post-training procedure
that repeatedly distills low-regret decision trajectories back into the base
model. At each iteration, the model rolls out multiple decision trajectories,
selects the k-lowest regret ones, and fine-tunes itself on them. Unlike prior
methods that (a) distill action sequences from known DM algorithms or (b) rely
on manually crafted chain-of-thought templates, our approach leverages the
regret metric to elicit the model's own DM ability and reasoning rationales.
This reliance on model-generated reasoning avoids rigid output engineering and
provides more flexible, natural-language training signals. Empirical results
show that Iterative RMFT improves LLMs' DM performance across diverse models -
from Transformers with numerical input/output, to open-weight LLMs, and
advanced closed-weight models like GPT-4o mini. Its flexibility in output and
reasoning formats enables generalization across tasks with varying horizons,
action spaces, reward processes, and natural-language contexts. Finally, we
provide theoretical insight showing that a single-layer Transformer under this
paradigm can act as a no-regret learner in a simplified setting. Overall,
Iterative RMFT offers a principled and general post-training framework for
enhancing LLMs' decision-making capabilities.

### [186] [The Peril of Preference: Why GRPO fails on Ordinal Rewards](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04439)
*Anisha Garg,Ganesh Venkatesh*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CoRPO replaces GRPO's group-average baseline with an adaptive baseline that enforces a minimum quality threshold, then switches to relative preference optimization, improving stability and out-of-domain generalization when training LLMs with ordinal feedback.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GRPO’s simplicity and the use of a group-average baseline can inadvertently reinforce failed trajectories under non-binary, ordinal rewards, leading to suboptimal or incorrect policies.

Method: Introduce Correctness Relative Policy Optimization (CoRPO) with an adaptive baseline: it enforces a minimum quality threshold to prevent positive reinforcement of failed solutions; once the policy consistently meets the threshold, the baseline transitions to a relative preference mode to drive solving for optimal solutions.

Result: Empirical evaluation on a code verification task shows CoRPO achieves more stable convergence and better out-of-domain generalization compared to prior baselines.

Conclusion: This approach advances RL-based LLMS by enabling learning from richer, multi-dimensional feedback, moving from binary to ordinal rewards and beyond toward denser supervision for acquiring new capabilities.

Abstract: Group-relative Policy Optimization's (GRPO) simplicity makes it highly
desirable for adapting LLMs to become experts at specific tasks. But this
simplicity also makes it ill-specified as we seek to enhance RL training with
richer, non-binary feedback. When using ordinal rewards to give partial credit,
GRPO's simplicity starts to hurt, as its group-average baseline often assigns a
positive advantage to failed trajectories and reinforces incorrect behavior.
  We introduce Correctness Relative Policy Optimization (CoRPO), a new
formulation that solves this flaw. CoRPO uses an adaptive baseline that
enforces a minimum quality threshold, ensuring failed solutions are never
positively reinforced. Once the policy consistently meets this threshold, the
baseline automatically transitions to a relative preference mode, pushing the
model to find optimal solutions rather than just "acceptable" ones. We
empirically validate CoRPO on a code verification task, where it demonstrates
more stable convergence and better out-of-domain generalization.
  This work represents a critical step in our broader research program to
enable LLMs to learn genuinely new capabilities through reinforcement learning.
We achieve this by enabling LLMs to learn from rich, multi-dimensional feedback
- progressing from binary to ordinal rewards in this work, and onward to
denser, per-step supervision.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Hybrid planner that augments multi-objective Dijkstra routing with an LLM-based semantic reasoning layer to personalize routes using user tasks/preferences, achieving ~88% accuracy in initial route selection in benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional routing optimizes single metrics and struggles to interpret dynamic human context (multi-step tasks, constraints, urgent needs). A fused approach that adds semantic reasoning can improve personalization and adaptability for urban mobility.

Method: Generate candidate routes using a multi-objective Dijkstra algorithm (time, CO2). A Large Language Model (LLM) agent evaluates these options against user-provided tasks, preferences, and avoidance rules, guided by a pre-processed geospatial cache of urban Points of Interest (POIs), to select and modify routes.

Result: In realistic urban benchmarks, PAVe achieved over 88% accuracy in initial route selections when using a local model.

Conclusion: Integrating classical routing with an LLM-based semantic reasoning layer yields a robust, adaptive, and scalable approach for personalized urban mobility optimization.

Abstract: Traditional vehicle routing systems efficiently optimize singular metrics
like time or distance, and when considering multiple metrics, they need more
processes to optimize . However, they lack the capability to interpret and
integrate the complex, semantic, and dynamic contexts of human drivers, such as
multi-step tasks, situational constraints, or urgent needs. This paper
introduces and evaluates PAVe (Personalized Agentic Vehicular Routing), a
hybrid agentic assistant designed to augment classical pathfinding algorithms
with contextual reasoning. Our approach employs a Large Language Model (LLM)
agent that operates on a candidate set of routes generated by a multi-objective
(time, CO2) Dijkstra algorithm. The agent evaluates these options against
user-provided tasks, preferences, and avoidance rules by leveraging a
pre-processed geospatial cache of urban Points of Interest (POIs). In a
benchmark of realistic urban scenarios, PAVe successfully used complex user
intent into appropriate route modifications, achieving over 88% accuracy in its
initial route selections with a local model. We conclude that combining
classical routing algorithms with an LLM-based semantic reasoning layer is a
robust and effective approach for creating personalized, adaptive, and scalable
solutions for urban mobility optimization.

*Lars Krupp,Daniel Geißler,Vishal Banwari,Paul Lukowicz,Jakob Karolus*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Energy and CO2 costs of web agents vary with design choices; more energy does not guarantee better performance; current benchmarks lack transparency and dedicated energy metrics; study proposes energy-focused evaluation and benchmarking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sustainability concerns in web-agent development; need to quantify environmental impact and improve benchmarking transparency.

Method: Theoretical estimation of energy use; empirical benchmarking across web agents to compare energy consumption and efficiency; analysis of how design philosophies affect energy use.

Result: Different design philosophies significantly affect energy consumption; a higher energy budget does not necessarily improve outcomes; energy reporting gaps hinder accurate estimation; energy benchmarks needed.

Conclusion: Advocate dedicated energy metrics in benchmarks; encourage transparency in system parameters; adopt energy-aware development and evaluation practices for web agents.

Abstract: Web agents, like OpenAI's Operator and Google's Project Mariner, are powerful
agentic systems pushing the boundaries of Large Language Models (LLM). They can
autonomously interact with the internet at the user's behest, such as
navigating websites, filling search masks, and comparing price lists. Though
web agent research is thriving, induced sustainability issues remain largely
unexplored. To highlight the urgency of this issue, we provide an initial
exploration of the energy and $CO_2$ cost associated with web agents from both
a theoretical -via estimation- and an empirical perspective -by benchmarking.
Our results show how different philosophies in web agent creation can severely
impact the associated expended energy, and that more energy consumed does not
necessarily equate to better results. We highlight a lack of transparency
regarding disclosing model parameters and processes used for some web agents as
a limiting factor when estimating energy consumption. Our work contributes
towards a change in thinking of how we evaluate web agents, advocating for
dedicated metrics measuring energy consumption in benchmarks.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Calibrated LLMs can act as digital twins of human decision-making in game-theoretic tasks, reproducing aggregate behavior and deviations; different models align with different theories; enables novel predictions without persona prompts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To quantify how closely LLMs mirror real human decisions in social experiments, addressing misalignment risks in decision-support and social simulations and providing scalable tools for social science.

Method: Introduce a digital twin framework and prompting/probing protocol; evaluate three open-source LLMs (Llama, Mistral, Qwen) on classic and novel game configurations; compare to human data and theoretical predictions (Nash, bounded rationality); test without persona-based prompts; preregister hypotheses for new configurations.

Result: Llama reproduces human cooperation patterns and deviations from rational choice; Qwen aligns with Nash equilibrium; population-level replication achieved without persona prompts; framework enables generation of testable hypotheses beyond the original parameter grid.

Conclusion: Calibrated LLMs can replicate aggregate human behavior and enable systematic exploration of unexplored experimental spaces, offering a complementary tool for social-behavioral research and the generation of new empirical predictions about human social decision-making.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used both to make decisions in
domains such as health, education and law, and to simulate human behavior. Yet
how closely LLMs mirror actual human decision-making remains poorly understood.
This gap is critical: misalignment could produce harmful outcomes in practical
applications, while failure to replicate human behavior renders LLMs
ineffective for social simulations. Here, we address this gap by developing a
digital twin of game-theoretic experiments and introducing a systematic
prompting and probing framework for machine-behavioral evaluation. Testing
three open-source models (Llama, Mistral and Qwen), we find that Llama
reproduces human cooperation patterns with high fidelity, capturing human
deviations from rational choice theory, while Qwen aligns closely with Nash
equilibrium predictions. Notably, we achieved population-level behavioral
replication without persona-based prompting, simplifying the simulation
process. Extending beyond the original human-tested games, we generate and
preregister testable hypotheses for novel game configurations outside the
original parameter grid. Our findings demonstrate that appropriately calibrated
LLMs can replicate aggregate human behavioral patterns and enable systematic
exploration of unexplored experimental spaces, offering a complementary
approach to traditional research in the social and behavioral sciences that
generates new empirical predictions about human social decision-making.

### [190] [Optimizing Sensor Placement in Urban Storm Sewers: A Data-Driven Sparse Sensing Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04556)
*Zihang Ding,Kun Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A data-driven sparse sensing (DSS) framework integrated with EPA-SWMM optimizes sensor placement to reconstruct urban stormwater peak flowrates using limited sensors; three sensors achieved NSE of 0.92–0.95 on a Duluth catchment; robustness to sensor failure depends on location but improves with more sensors; enabling flood early warning and real-time control with constrained sensing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Urban surface water flooding is increasingly frequent; full high-resolution monitoring is limited by time, budget, and technology. There is a need to monitor drainage networks and predict flow conditions under constrained sensing resources, enabling efficient, accurate reconstruction and potential real-time control.

Method: Use SWMM to generate a training dataset of peak flowrate profiles across the stormwater network. Apply data-driven sparse sensing (DSS) with singular value decomposition for dimensionality reduction and QR factorization for sensor allocation to identify optimal monitoring nodes from 77 network nodes. Validate by comparing DSS-reconstructed peak flowrate profiles to SWMM results.

Result: With 3 optimally placed sensors among 77 nodes, NSE values range 0.92–0.95 (25th–75th percentile). The framework shows robustness to measurement uncertainty; robustness to sensor failures is location-dependent and improves with more sensors. The approach balances computational efficiency and interpretability, enabling high-accuracy flow reconstruction with minimal sensors.

Conclusion: The DSS framework integrated with SWMM effectively achieves accurate peak flow reconstruction under limited sensing. It can be extended with predictive models for flood early warning and real-time control, and applied to other urban catchments to optimize sensor networks under resource constraints.

Abstract: Urban surface water flooding, triggered by intense rainfall overwhelming
drainage systems, is increasingly frequent and widespread. While flood
prediction and monitoring in high spatial-temporal resolution are desired,
practical constraints in time, budget, and technology hinder its full
implementation. How to monitor urban drainage networks and predict flow
conditions under constrained resource is a major challenge. This study presents
a data-driven sparse sensing (DSS) framework, integrated with EPA-SWMM, to
optimize sensor placement and reconstruct peak flowrates in a stormwater
system, using the Woodland Avenue catchment in Duluth, Minnesota, as a case
study. We utilized a SWMM model to generate a training dataset of peak flowrate
profiles across the stormwater network. Furthermore, we applied DSS -
leveraging singular value decomposition for dimensionality reduction and QR
factorization for sensor allocation - to identify the optimal monitoring nodes
based on the simulated training dataset. We then validated the
representativeness of these identified monitoring nodes by comparing the
DSS-reconstructed peak flowrate profiles with those obtained from SWMM. Three
optimally placed sensors among 77 nodes achieved satisfactory reconstruction
performance with Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) values of 0.92-0.95 (25th to
75th percentiles). In addition, the model showed good robustness to uncertainty
in measurements. Its robustness to sensor failures is location-dependent and
improves with the number of sensors deployed. The framework balances
computational efficiency and physical interpretability, enabling high-accuracy
flow reconstruction with minimal sensors. This DSS framework can be further
integrated with predictive models to realize flood early warning and real-time
control under limited sensing and monitoring resource.

Abstract: Understanding the current capabilities and risks of AI Scientist systems is
essential for ensuring trustworthy and sustainable AI-driven scientific
progress while preserving the integrity of the academic ecosystem. To this end,
we develop Jr. AI Scientist, a state-of-the-art autonomous AI scientist system
that mimics the core research workflow of a novice student researcher: Given
the baseline paper from the human mentor, it analyzes its limitations,
formulates novel hypotheses for improvement, validates them through rigorous
experimentation, and writes a paper with the results. Unlike previous
approaches that assume full automation or operate on small-scale code, Jr. AI
Scientist follows a well-defined research workflow and leverages modern coding
agents to handle complex, multi-file implementations, leading to scientifically
valuable contributions. For evaluation, we conducted automated assessments
using AI Reviewers, author-led evaluations, and submissions to Agents4Science,
a venue dedicated to AI-driven scientific contributions. The findings
demonstrate that Jr. AI Scientist generates papers receiving higher review
scores than existing fully automated systems. Nevertheless, we identify
important limitations from both the author evaluation and the Agents4Science
reviews, indicating the potential risks of directly applying current AI
Scientist systems and key challenges for future research. Finally, we
comprehensively report various risks identified during development. We hope
these insights will deepen understanding of current progress and risks in AI
Scientist development.

### [192] [Are We Asking the Right Questions? On Ambiguity in Natural Language Queries for Tabular Data Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04584)
*Daniel Gomm,Cornelius Wolff,Madelon Hulsebos*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes a cooperative framework for natural language queries to tabular data, classifying queries as cooperative or uncooperative; shows current datasets mix query types and are ill-suited for evaluating both execution accuracy and interpretation, advocating cooperation-focused design and evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ambiguity in natural language queries to tabular data is intrinsic. Treating ambiguity as a defect hinders evaluation and interaction. A cooperative perspective aims to share query specification between user and system.

Method: Introduce a principled framework that distinguishes cooperative versus uncooperative queries. Apply the framework to tabular QA and analysis tasks and analyze 15 popular datasets to categorize queries by type and assess their suitability for evaluation.

Result: Identified an uncontrolled mix of query types across datasets, hindering reliable evaluation of both execution accuracy and interpretation capabilities. The framework clarifies which queries yield resolvable interpretations and how to assess them.

Conclusion: Shifting from trying to fix ambiguity to embracing cooperative resolution informs design and evaluation of NL interfaces for tabular data and suggests directions for future research.

Abstract: Natural language interfaces to tabular data must handle ambiguities inherent
to queries. Instead of treating ambiguity as a deficiency, we reframe it as a
feature of cooperative interaction, where the responsibility of query
specification is shared among the user and the system. We develop a principled
framework distinguishing cooperative queries, i.e., queries that yield a
resolvable interpretation, from uncooperative queries that cannot be resolved.
Applying the framework to evaluations for tabular question answering and
analysis, we analyze the queries in 15 popular datasets, and observe an
uncontrolled mixing of query types neither adequate for evaluating a system's
execution accuracy nor for evaluating interpretation capabilities. Our
framework and analysis of queries shifts the perspective from fixing ambiguity
to embracing cooperation in resolving queries. This reflection enables more
informed design and evaluation for natural language interfaces for tabular
data, for which we outline implications and directions for future research.

### [193] [Question the Questions: Auditing Representation in Online Deliberative Processes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04588)
*Soham De,Lodewijk Gelauff,Ashish Goel,Smitha Milli,Ariel Procaccia,Alice Siu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Introduces a justified representation (JR) auditing framework for selecting question slates in deliberation, with the first general-utility JR auditing algorithms (best: O(mn log n)); empirically compares moderator-chosen, ILP-chosen, and LLM-generated questions; finds promise and limits of LLMs; integrated in a platform used across many deliberations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To ensure that a small set of questions submitted to experts adequately represents participants’ interests when time limits prevent all questions from being addressed.

Method: Define and implement a JR-based auditing framework. Develop the first algorithms for auditing JR in the general utility setting, achieving runtimes like O(mn log n). Apply the auditing methods to historical deliberations, comparing (a) moderator-chosen questions, (b) participants’ ILP-selected questions, and (c) LLM-generated summary questions. Integrate the framework into an online deliberation platform.

Result: The auditing framework and algorithms enable measuring representativeness of a question slate. The most efficient algorithm runs in O(mn log n). Empirical comparisons reveal that LLM-generated questions show promise for aiding deliberation but also have current limitations; the toolkit is integrated into an online platform used in hundreds of deliberations across 50+ countries.

Conclusion: The JR-based auditing approach provides practitioners with a practical method to assess and improve representativeness of question slates in deliberative processes, and while LLMs can augment support, they do not yet fully replace human curation; the platform enables widespread auditing and improvement.

Abstract: A central feature of many deliberative processes, such as citizens'
assemblies and deliberative polls, is the opportunity for participants to
engage directly with experts. While participants are typically invited to
propose questions for expert panels, only a limited number can be selected due
to time constraints. This raises the challenge of how to choose a small set of
questions that best represent the interests of all participants. We introduce
an auditing framework for measuring the level of representation provided by a
slate of questions, based on the social choice concept known as justified
representation (JR). We present the first algorithms for auditing JR in the
general utility setting, with our most efficient algorithm achieving a runtime
of $O(mn\log n)$, where $n$ is the number of participants and $m$ is the number
of proposed questions. We apply our auditing methods to historical
deliberations, comparing the representativeness of (a) the actual questions
posed to the expert panel (chosen by a moderator), (b) participants' questions
chosen via integer linear programming, (c) summary questions generated by large
language models (LLMs). Our results highlight both the promise and current
limitations of LLMs in supporting deliberative processes. By integrating our
methods into an online deliberation platform that has been used for over
hundreds of deliberations across more than 50 countries, we make it easy for
practitioners to audit and improve representation in future deliberations.

### [194] [DR. WELL: Dynamic Reasoning and Learning with Symbolic World Model for Embodied LLM-Based Multi-Agent Collaboration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04646)
*Narjes Nourzad,Hanqing Yang,Shiyu Chen,Carlee Joe-Wong*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DR. WELL proposes a decentralized, neurosymbolic framework for cooperative multi-agent planning that uses a two-phase negotiation to assign symbolic roles and then independent symbolic plan execution grounded in a shared, evolving world model. Results show improved coordination, adaptability, and efficiency in cooperative block-push tasks, at the cost of some planning time overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Coordinate agents with partial information and limited communication while avoiding brittle trajectory-level alignment. Symbolic planning offers higher-level synchronization, interpretability, and reusable actions. A dynamic world model can ground plans in execution outcomes and reveal reusable patterns.

Method: A two-phase negotiation where agents first propose candidate roles with reasoning and then commit to a joint allocation under consensus and environmental constraints. After commitment, agents generate and execute symbolic plans for their roles without sharing detailed trajectories. Plans are grounded in an evolving shared world model updated by execution outcomes, enabling decentralized but coherent collaboration.

Result: Experiments show agents adapt across episodes; the dynamic world model captures reusable patterns and improves task completion rates and efficiency. Negotiation and self-refinement trade a time overhead for evolving, more efficient collaboration strategies in cooperative block-push tasks.

Conclusion: Symbolic planning grounded in a shared dynamic world model supports robust, reusable, interpretable coordination in decentralized multi-agent settings. It mitigates brittle step-level alignment and yields performance gains in cooperative tasks, with potential applicability to broader domains.

Abstract: Cooperative multi-agent planning requires agents to make joint decisions with
partial information and limited communication. Coordination at the trajectory
level often fails, as small deviations in timing or movement cascade into
conflicts. Symbolic planning mitigates this challenge by raising the level of
abstraction and providing a minimal vocabulary of actions that enable
synchronization and collective progress. We present DR. WELL, a decentralized
neurosymbolic framework for cooperative multi-agent planning. Cooperation
unfolds through a two-phase negotiation protocol: agents first propose
candidate roles with reasoning and then commit to a joint allocation under
consensus and environment constraints. After commitment, each agent
independently generates and executes a symbolic plan for its role without
revealing detailed trajectories. Plans are grounded in execution outcomes via a
shared world model that encodes the current state and is updated as agents act.
By reasoning over symbolic plans rather than raw trajectories, DR. WELL avoids
brittle step-level alignment and enables higher-level operations that are
reusable, synchronizable, and interpretable. Experiments on cooperative
block-push tasks show that agents adapt across episodes, with the dynamic world
model capturing reusable patterns and improving task completion rates and
efficiency. Experiments on cooperative block-push tasks show that our dynamic
world model improves task completion and efficiency through negotiation and
self-refinement, trading a time overhead for evolving, more efficient
collaboration strategies.

### [195] [VeriCoT: Neuro-symbolic Chain-of-Thought Validation via Logical Consistency Checks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04662)
*Yu Feng,Nathaniel Weir,Kaj Bostrom,Sam Bayless,Darion Cassel,Sapana Chaudhary,Benjamin Kiesl-Reiter,Huzefa Rangwala*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: VeriCoT is a neuro-symbolic framework that extracts and verifies formal logical arguments from chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning to improve trust and accuracy of LLMs, with empirical validation and downstream training benefits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs using CoT can produce correct answers with flawed underlying reasoning, undermining trust in high-stakes tasks. There is a need to ground and verify reasoning steps in formal logic and source information.

Method: Convert each CoT step into first-order logic, identify premises grounded in sources, commonsense, or prior reasoning steps; use automated solvers to verify logical validity; retain NL premises for human/system inspection; leverage verification signals for inference-time self-reflection, supervised fine-tuning on VeriCoT-distilled data, and preference fine-tuning with DPO using verification-based rewards.

Result: On ProofWriter, LegalBench, and BioASQ, VeriCoT effectively identifies flawed reasoning and serves as a strong predictor of final answer correctness; the verification signal improves reasoning validity and accuracy when used for self-reflection and specialized fine-tuning.

Conclusion: VeriCoT provides a practical verification pathway for chain-of-thought reasoning, enhancing trust and performance, and enabling verification-driven training and inference enhancements.

Abstract: LLMs can perform multi-step reasoning through Chain-of-Thought (CoT), but
they cannot reliably verify their own logic. Even when they reach correct
answers, the underlying reasoning may be flawed, undermining trust in
high-stakes scenarios. To mitigate this issue, we introduce VeriCoT, a
neuro-symbolic method that extracts and verifies formal logical arguments from
CoT reasoning. VeriCoT formalizes each CoT reasoning step into first-order
logic and identifies premises that ground the argument in source context,
commonsense knowledge, or prior reasoning steps. The symbolic representation
enables automated solvers to verify logical validity while the NL premises
allow humans and systems to identify ungrounded or fallacious reasoning steps.
Experiments on the ProofWriter, LegalBench, and BioASQ datasets show VeriCoT
effectively identifies flawed reasoning, and serves as a strong predictor of
final answer correctness. We also leverage VeriCoT's verification signal for
(1) inference-time self-reflection, (2) supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on
VeriCoT-distilled datasets and (3) preference fine-tuning (PFT) with direct
preference optimization (DPO) using verification-based pairwise rewards,
further improving reasoning validity and accuracy.
