While\ntheoretically expressive, such approaches often suffer from training\ninstability and limited generalizability. In this work, we propose a\nQuantum-inspired Neural Network with Quantum Jump (QiNN-QJ) for multimodal\nentanglement modelling. Each modality is firstly encoded as a quantum pure\nstate, after which a differentiable module simulating the QJ operator\ntransforms the separable product state into the entangled representation. By\njointly learning Hamiltonian and Lindblad operators, QiNN-QJ generates\ncontrollable cross-modal entanglement among modalities with dissipative\ndynamics, where structured stochasticity and steady-state attractor properties\nserve to stabilize training and constrain entanglement shaping. The resulting\nentangled states are projected onto trainable measurement vectors to produce\npredictions. In addition to achieving superior performance over the\nstate-of-the-art models on benchmark datasets, including CMU-MOSI, CMU-MOSEI,\nand CH-SIMS, QiNN-QJ facilitates enhanced post-hoc interpretability through\nvon-Neumann entanglement entropy.

We argue that studying a single sample is inadequate for\nunderstanding causal influence and the underlying computation. Though fully\nspecifying this distribution is intractable, it can be understood by sampling.\nWe present case studies using resampling to investigate model decisions. First,\nwhen a model states a reason for its action, does that reason actually cause\nthe action? In \"agentic misalignment\" scenarios, we resample specific sentences\nto measure their downstream effects. Self-preservation sentences have small\ncausal impact, suggesting they do not meaningfully drive blackmail. Second, are\nartificial edits to CoT sufficient for steering reasoning? These are common in\nliterature, yet take the model off-policy. Resampling and selecting a\ncompletion with the desired property is a principled on-policy alternative. We\nfind off-policy interventions yield small and unstable effects compared to\nresampling in decision-making tasks. Third, how do we understand the effect of\nremoving a reasoning step when the model may repeat it post-edit? We introduce\na resilience metric that repeatedly resamples to prevent similar content from\nreappearing downstream. Critical planning statements resist removal but have\nlarge effects when eliminated. Fourth, since CoT is sometimes \"unfaithful\", can\nour methods teach us anything in these settings?

Unlike traditional images\nor videos, 3D point clouds present unique challenges for copyright enforcement,\nas they are especially vulnerable to a range of geometric and non-geometric\nattacks that can easily degrade or remove conventional watermark signals. In\nthis paper, we address these challenges by proposing a robust deep neural\nwatermarking framework for 3D point cloud copyright protection and ownership\nverification.

However,\nlimited model capacity causes one-step distilled models underperform on complex\ngenerative tasks, e.g., synthesizing intricate object motions in text-to-video\ngeneration. Directly extending DMD to multi-step distillation increases memory\nusage and computational depth, leading to instability and reduced efficiency.\nWhile prior works propose stochastic gradient truncation as a potential\nsolution, we observe that it substantially reduces the generation diversity of\nmulti-step distilled models, bringing it down to the level of their one-step\ncounterparts. To address these limitations, we propose Phased DMD, a multi-step\ndistillation framework that bridges the idea of phase-wise distillation with\nMixture-of-Experts (MoE), reducing learning difficulty while enhancing model\ncapacity. Phased DMD is built upon two key ideas: progressive distribution\nmatching and score matching within subintervals. First, our model divides the\nSNR range into subintervals, progressively refining the model to higher SNR\nlevels, to better capture complex distributions. Next, to ensure the training\nobjective within each subinterval is accurate, we have conducted rigorous\nmathematical derivations.
