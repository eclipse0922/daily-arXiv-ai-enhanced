To address these\nchallenges, this research proposes a method to transform the feature\nrepresentation of biological sequences into the hyperboloid space. By applying\na transformation, the sequences are mapped onto the hyperboloid, preserving\ntheir inherent structural information. Once the sequences are represented in\nthe hyperboloid space, a kernel matrix is computed based on the hyperboloid\nfeatures. The kernel matrix captures the pairwise similarities between\nsequences, enabling more effective analysis of biological sequence\nrelationships.
