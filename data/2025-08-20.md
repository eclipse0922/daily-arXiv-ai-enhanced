### [1] [YOLO11-CR: a Lightweight Convolution-and-Attention Framework for Accurate Fatigue Driving Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13205)
*Zhebin Jin,Ligang Dong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: YOLO11-CR is a lightweight, real-time vision model for driver fatigue detection that fuses CNN local features with Transformer context and uses a rectangular calibration module to improve localization of small/occluded objects, achieving strong metrics on the DSM dataset and showing promise for deployment with future temporal and multimodal enhancements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the drawbacks of intrusive physiological/vehicle-dynamics methods and the robustness issues of existing vision-based fatigue detectors, with a focus on accuracy, efficiency, and robust multi-scale/object localization in real-world driving scenarios.

Method: Introduce YOLO11-CR, a compact object detector featuring two modules: (1) CAFM (Convolution-and-Attention Fusion Module) that blends local CNN features with global Transformer-based context to boost feature expressiveness; (2) RCM (Rectangular Calibration Module) that captures horizontal and vertical contextual cues to enhance spatial localization, especially for profile faces and small objects (e.g., mobile phones). Demonstrates real-time inference and includes ablation studies.

Result: On the DSM dataset, YOLO11-CR achieves precision 87.17%, recall 83.86%, mAP@50 88.09%, and mAP@50-95 55.93%, outperforming baseline models. Ablation studies confirm the CAFM and RCM contributions to improved sensitivity and localization accuracy.

Conclusion: YOLO11-CR offers a practical, high-performing solution for in-vehicle fatigue monitoring with potential for real-world deployment. Future work may explore temporal modeling, multi-modal data integration, and embedded optimization to further enhance robustness and efficiency.

Abstract: Driver fatigue detection is of paramount importance for intelligent
transportation systems due to its critical role in mitigating road traffic
accidents. While physiological and vehicle dynamics-based methods offer
accuracy, they are often intrusive, hardware-dependent, and lack robustness in
real-world environments. Vision-based techniques provide a non-intrusive and
scalable alternative, but still face challenges such as poor detection of small
or occluded objects and limited multi-scale feature modeling. To address these
issues, this paper proposes YOLO11-CR, a lightweight and efficient object
detection model tailored for real-time fatigue detection. YOLO11-CR introduces
two key modules: the Convolution-and-Attention Fusion Module (CAFM), which
integrates local CNN features with global Transformer-based context to enhance
feature expressiveness; and the Rectangular Calibration Module (RCM), which
captures horizontal and vertical contextual information to improve spatial
localization, particularly for profile faces and small objects like mobile
phones. Experiments on the DSM dataset demonstrated that YOLO11-CR achieves a
precision of 87.17%, recall of 83.86%, mAP@50 of 88.09%, and mAP@50-95 of
55.93%, outperforming baseline models significantly. Ablation studies further
validate the effectiveness of the CAFM and RCM modules in improving both
sensitivity and localization accuracy. These results demonstrate that YOLO11-CR
offers a practical and high-performing solution for in-vehicle fatigue
monitoring, with strong potential for real-world deployment and future
enhancements involving temporal modeling, multi-modal data integration, and
embedded optimization.

### [2] [MIRAGE: Towards AI-Generated Image Detection in the Wild](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13223)
*Cheng Xia,Manxi Lin,Jiexiang Tan,Xiaoxiong Du,Yang Qiu,Junjun Zheng,Xiangheng Kong,Yuning Jiang,Bo Zheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes Mirage, a two-source in-the-wild AIGI detection benchmark, and Mirage-R1, a vision-language detector with reflective reasoning and adaptive inference. Demonstrates improved accuracy on Mirage and public benchmarks and releases code; emphasizes speed-accuracy trade-offs in detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI-generated images at scale threaten information integrity and public trust; existing detectors fail to generalize to real-world, noisy, multi-model, edited images. A robust, adaptive detection framework and a realistic benchmark are needed to evaluate and improve detectors in-the-wild.

Method: Construct Mirage from (1) internet-sourced AIGI verified by experts, and (2) a synthesized dataset via collaboration among expert generators. Develop Mirage-R1, a vision-language model with heuristic-to-analytic and reflective reasoning for AIGI detection. Train in two stages: supervised fine-tuning (cold start) followed by reinforcement learning. Introduce an inference-time adaptive thinking strategy that toggles between quick judgments and robust conclusions.

Result: Mirage-R1 achieves state-of-the-art detection performance, outperforming existing detectors by about 5 percentage points on Mirage and 10 percentage points on a public benchmark. The authors will release the benchmark and code publicly.

Conclusion: Mirage and Mirage-R1 offer a realistic, scalable solution for detecting AIGI in-the-wild, balancing speed and accuracy through adaptive reasoning. The benchmark will enable more robust evaluation and development of detectors in complex, real-world conditions.

Abstract: The spreading of AI-generated images (AIGI), driven by advances in generative
AI, poses a significant threat to information security and public trust.
Existing AIGI detectors, while effective against images in clean laboratory
settings, fail to generalize to in-the-wild scenarios. These real-world images
are noisy, varying from ``obviously fake" images to realistic ones derived from
multiple generative models and further edited for quality control. We address
in-the-wild AIGI detection in this paper. We introduce Mirage, a challenging
benchmark designed to emulate the complexity of in-the-wild AIGI. Mirage is
constructed from two sources: (1) a large corpus of Internet-sourced AIGI
verified by human experts, and (2) a synthesized dataset created through the
collaboration between multiple expert generators, closely simulating the
realistic AIGI in the wild. Building on this benchmark, we propose Mirage-R1, a
vision-language model with heuristic-to-analytic reasoning, a reflective
reasoning mechanism for AIGI detection. Mirage-R1 is trained in two stages: a
supervised-fine-tuning cold start, followed by a reinforcement learning stage.
By further adopting an inference-time adaptive thinking strategy, Mirage-R1 is
able to provide either a quick judgment or a more robust and accurate
conclusion, effectively balancing inference speed and performance. Extensive
experiments show that our model leads state-of-the-art detectors by 5% and 10%
on Mirage and the public benchmark, respectively. The benchmark and code will
be made publicly available.

### [3] [DianJin-OCR-R1: Enhancing OCR Capabilities via a Reasoning-and-Tool Interleaved Vision-Language Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13238)
*Qian Chen,Xianyin Zhang,Lifan Guo,Feng Chen,Chi Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DianJin-OCR-R1 is a reasoning-enhanced, tool-interleaved VLM framework for end-to-end document OCR that mitigates hallucinations by first using its own OCR, consulting expert OCR tools for references, and then re-thinking to output final content; it improves OCR tasks on specialized benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large vision-language models often hallucinate and general-purpose OCR models underperform on domain-specific OCR tasks; there is a need for architectures that interleave reasoning with specialized, domain-trained tools to improve accuracy and reduce cost.

Method: A two-phase, interleaved process: (1) the model performs initial recognition with its own OCR capabilities; (2) it calls external expert OCR tools to obtain reference results; (3) it re-examines the image and revises the final recognized content based on reasoning and tool outputs.

Result: Empirical evaluation on ReST and OmniDocBench shows that DianJin-OCR-R1 consistently outperforms non-reasoning baselines and individual expert OCR models.

Conclusion: Reasoning-and-tool interleaved VLMs leveraging domain-specific OCR tools can reduce hallucinations and improve OCR accuracy while enabling scalable, iterative improvements through smaller, specialized components.

Abstract: Recent advances in large vision-language models (LVLMs) have enabled a new
paradigm of end-to-end document image parsing, excelling in Optical Character
Recognition (OCR) tasks such as text, table, and formula recognition. However,
generative LVLMs, similarly to large language models (LLMs), are prone to
hallucinations--generating words that do not exist in input images.
Furthermore, LVLMs are designed for general purposes and tend to be less
effective on OCR tasks compared to expert models that are trained on
domain-specific datasets. In this paper, we propose DianJin-OCR-R1, a
reasoning-enhanced framework designed to address these limitations through
training reasoning-and-tool interleaved VLMs. Given a recognition instruction,
our DianJin-OCR-R1 model first recognizes the content in the input image by its
own OCR capabilities, and then calls other tools (i.e., other expert models) to
obtain their results as references, finally looks again the image and rethinks
about the reasoning process to provide the final recognized content. Since
architectures of expert models are tailored for specific OCR tasks, which makes
them less prone to hallucinations, their results can help VLMs mitigate
hallucinations. Additionally, expert models are typically smaller in scale and
easy to iterate, enabling performance improvements for VLMs at a lower cost. We
evaluate our model on ReST and OmniDocBench, and experimental results show that
our DianJin-OCR-R1 models consistently outperform their non-reasoning
counterparts and expert OCR models, which proves the effectiveness of our
method.

### [4] [Exploration of Deep Learning Based Recognition for Urdu Text](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13245)
*Sumaiya Fazal,Sheeraz Ahmed*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a CNN-based, component-level Urdu OCR using permutation-generated ligatures and a two-level hierarchical NN, achieving 0.99% accuracy on component classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Urdu's complex geometry, morphology, and context sensitivity make segmentation-based recognition error-prone; improving segmentation-free or segmentation-robust recognition is desirable.

Method: A CNN trained on Urdu text data generated by permuting three characters. Unnecessary images are discarded with connected component analysis to isolate ligatures. A two-level hierarchical neural network handles three-character permutations and component classification for ligatures.

Result: The model achieved 0.99% accuracy for component classification.

Conclusion: The component-based CNN with a two-level hierarchical network effectively addresses Urdu ligature recognition and reduces segmentation dependency; shows promise for robust Urdu OCR, though effectiveness may depend on dataset generation and the handling of real-world variability.

Abstract: Urdu is a cursive script language and has similarities with Arabic and many
other South Asian languages. Urdu is difficult to classify due to its complex
geometrical and morphological structure. Character classification can be
processed further if segmentation technique is efficient, but due to context
sensitivity in Urdu, segmentation-based recognition often results with high
error rate. Our proposed approach for Urdu optical character recognition system
is a component-based classification relying on automatic feature learning
technique called convolutional neural network. CNN is trained and tested on
Urdu text dataset, which is generated through permutation process of three
characters and further proceeds to discarding unnecessary images by applying
connected component technique in order to obtain ligature only. Hierarchical
neural network is implemented with two levels to deal with three degrees of
character permutations and component classification Our model successfully
achieved 0.99% for component classification.

### [5] [CLoE: Curriculum Learning on Endoscopic Images for Robust MES Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13280)
*Zeynep Ozdemir,Hacer Yalim Keles,Omer Ozgur Tanriover*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes CLoE, a curriculum learning framework that uses image quality as a proxy for annotation confidence and combines with ResizeMix to improve ordinal MES classification for ulcerative colitis, outperforming strong baselines on LIMUC and HyperKvasir with ConvNeXt-Tiny and other backbones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mayo Endoscopic Subscore (MES) classification is challenging due to label noise from inter-observer variability and the ordinal nature of scores. Standard models often ignore these aspects, leading to suboptimal performance.

Method: Compute image quality from a lightweight BBPS-based model as a proxy for annotation confidence to order samples from easy (clean) to hard (noisy). Integrate this curriculum with ResizeMix augmentation. Evaluate on LIMUC and HyperKvasir using CNNs and Transformers (e.g., ConvNeXt-Tiny).

Result: CLoE yields consistent improvements over strong supervised and self-supervised baselines. On LIMUC, ConvNeXt-Tiny achieves 82.5% accuracy and a QWK of 0.894 with low computational cost; improvements observed across datasets and backbones.

Conclusion: Difficulty-aware, ordinal-aware training via curriculum learning and augmentation is effective for improving MES classification under label uncertainty and may generalize to similar ordinal medical imaging tasks; code will be released.

Abstract: Estimating disease severity from endoscopic images is essential in assessing
ulcerative colitis, where the Mayo Endoscopic Subscore (MES) is widely used to
grade inflammation. However, MES classification remains challenging due to
label noise from inter-observer variability and the ordinal nature of the
score, which standard models often ignore. We propose CLoE, a curriculum
learning framework that accounts for both label reliability and ordinal
structure. Image quality, estimated via a lightweight model trained on Boston
Bowel Preparation Scale (BBPS) labels, is used as a proxy for annotation
confidence to order samples from easy (clean) to hard (noisy). This curriculum
is further combined with ResizeMix augmentation to improve robustness.
Experiments on the LIMUC and HyperKvasir datasets, using both CNNs and
Transformers, show that CLoE consistently improves performance over strong
supervised and self-supervised baselines. For instance, ConvNeXt-Tiny reaches
82.5\% accuracy and a QWK of 0.894 on LIMUC with low computational cost. These
results highlight the potential of difficulty-aware training strategies for
improving ordinal classification under label uncertainty. Code will be released
at https://github.com/zeynepozdemir/CLoE.

### [6] [GaitCrafter: Diffusion Model for Biometric Preserving Gait Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13300)
*Sirshapan Mitra,Yogesh S. Rawat*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes GaitCrafter, a diffusion-based framework to synthesize realistic, controllable gait silhouettes for data augmentation and privacy-preserving novel identities, improving gait recognition performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the lack of large-scale labeled gait datasets and privacy concerns by generating realistic, diverse gait data that preserves identity privacy.

Method: Trains a video diffusion model from scratch on gait silhouette data to produce temporally consistent gait sequences. The model supports conditioning on covariates (clothing, carried objects, view angle) and introduces identity embedding interpolation to create novel synthetic identities.

Result: Synthetic data from GaitCrafter improves gait recognition performance, especially under challenging conditions; novel synthetic identities preserve privacy and offer a controllable augmentation source.

Conclusion: Diffusion-based gait silhouette synthesis provides high-quality, controllable, privacy-aware data generation that can enhance gait recognition trained with limited real data.

Abstract: Gait recognition is a valuable biometric task that enables the identification
of individuals from a distance based on their walking patterns. However, it
remains limited by the lack of large-scale labeled datasets and the difficulty
of collecting diverse gait samples for each individual while preserving
privacy. To address these challenges, we propose GaitCrafter, a diffusion-based
framework for synthesizing realistic gait sequences in the silhouette domain.
Unlike prior works that rely on simulated environments or alternative
generative models, GaitCrafter trains a video diffusion model from scratch,
exclusively on gait silhouette data. Our approach enables the generation of
temporally consistent and identity-preserving gait sequences. Moreover, the
generation process is controllable-allowing conditioning on various covariates
such as clothing, carried objects, and view angle. We show that incorporating
synthetic samples generated by GaitCrafter into the gait recognition pipeline
leads to improved performance, especially under challenging conditions.
Additionally, we introduce a mechanism to generate novel identities-synthetic
individuals not present in the original dataset-by interpolating identity
embeddings. These novel identities exhibit unique, consistent gait patterns and
are useful for training models while maintaining privacy of real subjects.
Overall, our work takes an important step toward leveraging diffusion models
for high-quality, controllable, and privacy-aware gait data generation.

### [7] [Prune2Drive: A Plug-and-Play Framework for Accelerating Vision-Language Models in Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13305)
*Minhao Xiong,Zichen Wen,Zhuangcheng Gu,Xuyang Liu,Rui Zhang,Hengrui Kang,Jiabing Yang,Junyuan Zhang,Weijia Li,Conghui He,Yafei Wang,Linfeng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Prune2Drive introduces a plug-and-play token pruning framework for multi-view vision-language models in autonomous driving, using diversity-aware token selection and a view-adaptive pruning controller to achieve substantial speedups and memory savings with minimal performance loss, without model retraining or access to attention maps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autonomous driving with multiple synchronized cameras produces an enormous number of visual tokens, causing high inference latency and memory usage due to quadratic self-attention complexity. There is a need for effective token reduction that preserves driving-critical information.

Method: 1) Diversity-aware token selection inspired by farthest point sampling to ensure semantic and spatial coverage across all views, not solely relying on attention scores. 2) A view-adaptive pruning controller learns pruning ratios per camera view based on their importance to downstream driving tasks. 3) The framework is plug-and-play and does not require retraining or access to attention maps, making it compatible with efficient attention implementations.

Result: Empirical evaluation on DriveLM and DriveLMM-o1 shows substantial speedups and memory savings: retaining only 10% of tokens yields a 6.40× speedup during the prefilling phase and uses 13.4% of the original FLOPs, with only about a 3% drop in driving task performance on DriveLM.

Conclusion: Prune2Drive effectively reduces computational demands of multi-view VLMs in autonomous driving while maintaining or improving task performance, enabling practical deployment without retraining and with compatibility to modern attention optimizations.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have emerged as a promising paradigm in
autonomous driving (AD), offering a unified framework for perception,
reasoning, and decision-making by jointly modeling visual inputs and natural
language instructions. However, their deployment is hindered by the significant
computational overhead incurred when processing high-resolution, multi-view
images, a standard setup in AD systems with six or more synchronized cameras.
This overhead stems from the large number of visual tokens generated during
encoding, increasing inference latency and memory consumption due to the
quadratic complexity of self-attention. To address these challenges, we propose
Prune2Drive, a plug-and-play visual token pruning framework for multi-view VLMs
in autonomous driving. Prune2Drive introduces two core innovations: (i) a
diversity-aware token selection mechanism inspired by farthest point sampling,
which prioritizes semantic and spatial coverage across views rather than
relying solely on attention scores, and (ii) a view-adaptive pruning controller
that learns optimal pruning ratios for each camera view based on their
importance to downstream driving tasks. Unlike prior methods, Prune2Drive does
not require model retraining or access to attention maps, making it compatible
with modern efficient attention implementations. Extensive experiments on two
large-scale multi-view driving benchmarks, DriveLM and DriveLMM-o1, show that
Prune2Drive achieves significant speedups and memory savings while maintaining
or improving task performance. When retaining only 10% of the visual tokens,
our method achieves a 6.40$\times$ speedup in the prefilling phase and consumes
13.4% of the original FLOPs, with only a 3% performance drop on the DriveLM
benchmark.

### [8] [DAASH: A Meta-Attack Framework for Synthesizing Effective and Stealthy Adversarial Examples](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13309)
*Abdullah Al Nomaan Nafi,Habibur Rahaman,Zafaryab Haider,Tanzim Mahfuz,Fnu Suya,Swarup Bhunia,Prabuddha Chakraborty*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DAASH is a differentiable meta-attack that stacks and learns weights for multiple Lp-based attacks across stages to produce perceptually aligned adversarial examples, outperforming prior perceptual attacks and generalizing to new defenses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Perceptually aligned adversarial examples are underexplored and current Lp-constrained attacks may not align with human perception; a framework that leverages Lp insights while optimizing perceptual quality is needed.

Method: Multi-stage process; at each stage, aggregate candidate adversaries from multiple base Lp attacks using learned adaptive weights; propagate to next stage; meta-loss jointly minimizes misclassification and perceptual distortion; fully differentiable; evaluated on CIFAR-10/100 and ImageNet.

Result: DAASH significantly outperforms AdvAD in attack success rate (e.g., 20.63% improvement) and improves perceptual metrics SSIM, LPIPS, FID (≈11, 0.015, and 5.7, respectively); generalizes to unseen defenses.

Conclusion: DAASH provides a practical and strong baseline for robustness evaluation, reducing reliance on handcrafted adaptive attacks; demonstrates that Lp-constrained methods can be leveraged to achieve perceptual efficacy.

Abstract: Numerous techniques have been proposed for generating adversarial examples in
white-box settings under strict Lp-norm constraints. However, such norm-bounded
examples often fail to align well with human perception, and only recently have
a few methods begun specifically exploring perceptually aligned adversarial
examples. Moreover, it remains unclear whether insights from Lp-constrained
attacks can be effectively leveraged to improve perceptual efficacy. In this
paper, we introduce DAASH, a fully differentiable meta-attack framework that
generates effective and perceptually aligned adversarial examples by
strategically composing existing Lp-based attack methods. DAASH operates in a
multi-stage fashion: at each stage, it aggregates candidate adversarial
examples from multiple base attacks using learned, adaptive weights and
propagates the result to the next stage. A novel meta-loss function guides this
process by jointly minimizing misclassification loss and perceptual distortion,
enabling the framework to dynamically modulate the contribution of each base
attack throughout the stages. We evaluate DAASH on adversarially trained models
across CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet. Despite relying solely on
Lp-constrained based methods, DAASH significantly outperforms state-of-the-art
perceptual attacks such as AdvAD -- achieving higher attack success rates
(e.g., 20.63\% improvement) and superior visual quality, as measured by SSIM,
LPIPS, and FID (improvements $\approx$ of 11, 0.015, and 5.7, respectively).
Furthermore, DAASH generalizes well to unseen defenses, making it a practical
and strong baseline for evaluating robustness without requiring handcrafted
adaptive attacks for each new defense.

TL;DR: A scalable, interpretable framework for objective aesthetic assessment in facial rhinoplasty using frontal photographs, leveraging automated landmarks, symmetry metrics, age estimation, and nasal morphology; builds the largest paired pre/post dataset (7,160 photos, 1,259 patients) including a rhinoplasty subset; reports significant nasal and global appearance improvements, with high identity preservation; provides benchmarks and dataset for cross-practice evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Subjectivity in aesthetic outcome assessment in facial plastic surgery; need for objective, reproducible metrics to guide planning, counseling, and cross-practice benchmarking.

Method: Automated landmark detection; geometric symmetry computation; deep-learning-based age estimation; nasal morphology analysis; analysis performed on a large curated dataset of pre- and post-operative frontal images (7,160 photos, 1,259 patients; rhinoplasty subset: 732 images, 366 patients). Metrics include nasal measurements (alar width/face width, nose length/face height, alar width/intercanthal), global symmetry, and perceived age. Identity verification via True Match Rates (FMR 0.01%). Inter-practitioner variability analyzed.

Result: Rhinoplasty subset: 96.2% improved in at least one of three nasal measurements; greatest improvements were alar width to face width (77.0%), nose length to face height (41.5%), alar width to intercanthal (39.3%); broader frontal-view cohort (989 subjects): 71.3% showed significant enhancements in global facial symmetry or perceived age (p<0.01). Identity retention high: True Match Rates 99.5% and 99.6% at FMR 0.01% for rhinoplasty and general cohorts. Inter-practitioner variability analyzed.

Conclusion: Provides reproducible quantitative benchmarks and a novel dataset; enables data-driven surgical planning, patient counseling, and objective outcome evaluation across practices; scalable and interpretable framework for facial aesthetic assessment.

Abstract: We introduce a scalable, interpretable computer-vision framework for
quantifying aesthetic outcomes of facial plastic surgery using frontal
photographs. Our pipeline leverages automated landmark detection, geometric
facial symmetry computation, deep-learning-based age estimation, and nasal
morphology analysis. To perform this study, we first assemble the largest
curated dataset of paired pre- and post-operative facial images to date,
encompassing 7,160 photographs from 1,259 patients. This dataset includes a
dedicated rhinoplasty-only subset consisting of 732 images from 366 patients,
96.2% of whom showed improvement in at least one of the three nasal
measurements with statistically significant group-level change. Among these
patients, the greatest statistically significant improvements (p < 0.001)
occurred in the alar width to face width ratio (77.0%), nose length to face
height ratio (41.5%), and alar width to intercanthal ratio (39.3%). Among the
broader frontal-view cohort, comprising 989 rigorously filtered subjects, 71.3%
exhibited significant enhancements in global facial symmetry or perceived age
(p < 0.01). Importantly, our analysis shows that patient identity remains
consistent post-operatively, with True Match Rates of 99.5% and 99.6% at a
False Match Rate of 0.01% for the rhinoplasty-specific and general patient
cohorts, respectively. Additionally, we analyze inter-practitioner variability
in improvement rates. By providing reproducible, quantitative benchmarks and a
novel dataset, our pipeline facilitates data-driven surgical planning, patient
counseling, and objective outcome evaluation across practices.

### [10] [Applications of Small Language Models in Medical Imaging Classification with a Focus on Prompt Strategies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13378)
*Yiting Wang,Ziwei Wang,Jiachen Zhong,Di Zhu,Weiyi Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Prompt engineering enables certain small language models to reach competitive accuracy on chest X-ray AP/PA classification using NIH data, offering cheaper, privacy-friendly alternatives to large LLMs in healthcare.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address high cost, limited accessibility, and data privacy concerns of large language models in healthcare by evaluating whether small language models can perform medical imaging classification with carefully designed prompts.

Method: Evaluate several small language models on the NIH Chest X-ray dataset for classifying chest X-ray projections (AP vs PA) using three prompt designs: baseline instruction, incremental summary prompts, and correction-based reflective prompts.

Result: Some small language models achieved competitive accuracy when paired with well-crafted prompts; prompt design substantially enhances SLM performance in this medical imaging task, reducing the need for expert AI deployment.

Conclusion: Prompt engineering can unlock practical deployment of small language models in resource-constrained healthcare settings for imaging tasks, balancing accuracy, cost, and privacy without requiring large-scale LLMs.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in natural
language processing and multi-modal understanding. However, their high
computational cost, limited accessibility, and data privacy concerns hinder
their adoption in resource-constrained healthcare environments. This study
investigates the performance of small language models (SLMs) in a medical
imaging classification task, comparing different models and prompt designs to
identify the optimal combination for accuracy and usability. Using the NIH
Chest X-ray dataset, we evaluate multiple SLMs on the task of classifying chest
X-ray positions (anteroposterior [AP] vs. posteroanterior [PA]) under three
prompt strategies: baseline instruction, incremental summary prompts, and
correction-based reflective prompts. Our results show that certain SLMs achieve
competitive accuracy with well-crafted prompts, suggesting that prompt
engineering can substantially enhance SLM performance in healthcare
applications without requiring deep AI expertise from end users.

### [12] [Mitigating Easy Option Bias in Multiple-Choice Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13428)
*Hao Zhang,Chen Li,Basura Fernando*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The abstract reveals an Easy-Options Bias (EOB) in several VQA benchmarks where models exploit vision+options cues to answer without the question. It introduces GroundAttack to generate hard, visually plausible distractors, creates EOB-free annotations for NExT-QA and MMStar, and shows that with unbiased data VLMs perform near random with V+O and drop further when the question is included, highlighting the need for robust evaluation and dataset sanitization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To diagnose and mitigate shortcuts in VQA benchmarks that inflate model performance by leveraging non-question cues (vision and option texts) and to develop a tool to generate challenging distractors for fair evaluation.

Method: Grounding experiments identify the Easy-Options Bias. Develop GroundAttack, a toolkit that automatically crafts hard negative options visually plausible with the correct answer. Apply it to NExT-QA and MMStar to produce EOB-free annotations. Evaluate VLMs under (V+O) and (V+Q+O) settings to gauge true QA ability. Plan to release code and new annotations.

Result: On EOB-free annotations, current VLMs perform near random under (V+O) and fall to non-saturated accuracies under (V+Q+O), indicating that prior gains were due to bias rather than genuine QA understanding. GroundAttack successfully creates more challenging distractors, revealing the true difficulty.

Conclusion: EOB bias is a real and impactful issue in VQA benchmarks. GroundAttack offers a practical remedy by generating visually plausible hard negatives, and the EOB-free annotations enable more realistic evaluation of VLM QA capabilities. Code and annotations are expected to be released.

Abstract: In this early study, we observe an Easy-Options Bias (EOB) issue in some
multiple-choice Visual Question Answering (VQA) benchmarks such as MMStar,
RealWorldQA, SEED-Bench, Next-QA, STAR benchmark and Video-MME. This bias
allows vision-language models (VLMs) to select the correct answer using only
the vision (V) and options (O) as inputs, without the need for the question
(Q). Through grounding experiments, we attribute the bias to an imbalance in
visual relevance: the correct answer typically aligns more closely with the
visual contents than the negative options in feature space, creating a shortcut
for VLMs to infer the answer via simply vision-option similarity matching. To
fix this, we introduce GroundAttack, a toolkit that automatically generates
hard negative options as visually plausible as the correct answer. We apply it
to the NExT-QA and MMStar datasets, creating new EOB-free annotations. On these
EOB-free annotations, current VLMs approach to random accuracies under (V+O)
settings, and drop to non-saturated accuracies under (V+Q+O) settings,
providing a more realistic evaluation of VLMs' QA ability. Codes and new
annotations will be released soon.

*Yunxiang Yang,Ningning Xu,Jidong J. Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A 3B-parameter VISTA model is trained via structured prompting and knowledge distillation from GPT-4o and o3-mini to generate risk-aware captions from low-resolution highway videos, achieving strong captioning metrics and enabling real-time edge deployment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome scalability and generalization gaps in highway scene understanding under real-world, dynamic conditions by enabling a lightweight, edge-deployable model capable of risk inference with richly supervised outputs.

Method: The framework uses two large Vision-Language Models (GPT-4o and o3-mini) with a structured Chain-of-Thought strategy to produce rich, multi-perspective outputs. These outputs serve as knowledge-enriched pseudo-annotations for supervised fine-tuning of a smaller student VLM. The compact 3B-model, named VISTA, is trained to understand low-resolution traffic videos and generate semantically faithful, risk-aware captions.

Result: VISTA achieves strong performance on captioning metrics (BLEU-4, METEOR, ROUGE-L, CIDEr) compared to its teacher models despite its smaller size, demonstrating effective knowledge distillation and structured multi-agent supervision for complex reasoning. Its compact architecture enables efficient edge deployment for real-time risk monitoring.

Conclusion: Structured prompting combined with cross-model knowledge distillation enables lightweight VLMs to capture complex reasoning required for highway scene understanding and risk inference, facilitating practical edge deployment without sacrificing performance.

Abstract: Comprehensive highway scene understanding and robust traffic risk inference
are vital for advancing Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) and autonomous
driving. Traditional approaches often struggle with scalability and
generalization, particularly under the complex and dynamic conditions of
real-world environments. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel
structured prompting and knowledge distillation framework that enables
automatic generation of high-quality traffic scene annotations and contextual
risk assessments. Our framework orchestrates two large Vision-Language Models
(VLMs): GPT-4o and o3-mini, using a structured Chain-of-Thought (CoT) strategy
to produce rich, multi-perspective outputs. These outputs serve as
knowledge-enriched pseudo-annotations for supervised fine-tuning of a much
smaller student VLM. The resulting compact 3B-scale model, named VISTA (Vision
for Intelligent Scene and Traffic Analysis), is capable of understanding
low-resolution traffic videos and generating semantically faithful, risk-aware
captions. Despite its significantly reduced parameter count, VISTA achieves
strong performance across established captioning metrics (BLEU-4, METEOR,
ROUGE-L, and CIDEr) when benchmarked against its teacher models. This
demonstrates that effective knowledge distillation and structured multi-agent
supervision can empower lightweight VLMs to capture complex reasoning
capabilities. The compact architecture of VISTA facilitates efficient
deployment on edge devices, enabling real-time risk monitoring without
requiring extensive infrastructure upgrades.

### [14] [EDTalk++: Full Disentanglement for Controllable Talking Head Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13442)
*Shuai Tan,Bin Ji*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EDTalk++ introduces a full disentanglement framework for controllable talking head generation using four independent latent spaces (mouth, pose, eye, expression) with orthogonal basis decomposition, shared priors via banks, and an Audio-to-Motion module enabling audio-driven synthesis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods often fail to decouple facial dynamics and to share information across modalities; a decoupled, multi-space representation is needed for robust, flexible talking head control.

Method: Four lightweight modules decompose facial dynamics into four latent spaces (mouth, pose, eye, expression) with learnable bases. Bases are orthogonalized to enforce independence. A training strategy allocates motion responsibilities without external supervision. Bases are stored in banks to provide shared priors across modalities. An Audio-to-Motion module enables audio-driven talking head synthesis.

Result: Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of EDTalk++ in achieving disentangled control and enabling shared priors via audio input, validating the proposed approach.

Conclusion: EDTalk++ enables full disentanglement across mouth, pose, eyes, and expression with independent manipulation, supports video and audio conditioning, and offers a practical framework for high-quality, controllable talking head generation.

Abstract: Achieving disentangled control over multiple facial motions and accommodating
diverse input modalities greatly enhances the application and entertainment of
the talking head generation. This necessitates a deep exploration of the
decoupling space for facial features, ensuring that they a) operate
independently without mutual interference and b) can be preserved to share with
different modal inputs, both aspects often neglected in existing methods. To
address this gap, this paper proposes EDTalk++, a novel full disentanglement
framework for controllable talking head generation. Our framework enables
individual manipulation of mouth shape, head pose, eye movement, and emotional
expression, conditioned on video or audio inputs. Specifically, we employ four
lightweight modules to decompose the facial dynamics into four distinct latent
spaces representing mouth, pose, eye, and expression, respectively. Each space
is characterized by a set of learnable bases whose linear combinations define
specific motions. To ensure independence and accelerate training, we enforce
orthogonality among bases and devise an efficient training strategy to allocate
motion responsibilities to each space without relying on external knowledge.
The learned bases are then stored in corresponding banks, enabling shared
visual priors with audio input. Furthermore, considering the properties of each
space, we propose an Audio-to-Motion module for audio-driven talking head
synthesis. Experiments are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of
EDTalk++.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CNNs struggle with long-range dependencies and variable imaging conditions in endoscopic kidney stone images; evaluating whether Vision Transformers (ViTs) offer robust advantages for this task.

Method: Comparative study of ViT-base pretrained on ImageNet-21k vs. ResNet50 on two ex vivo datasets (CCD camera and flexible ureteroscope images). Evaluations across imaging conditions, reporting accuracy, F1, precision, and recall. Subsets include visually complex section patches and mixed-view CCD-camera images.

Result: ViT-base achieved 95.2% accuracy and 95.1% F1 on the most visually complex subset (section patches), vs. 64.5% accuracy and 59.3% F1 for ResNet50. In the mixed-view CCD-camera subset, ViT reached 87.1% accuracy vs. 78.4% for CNN, with improvements in precision and recall across metrics.

Conclusion: ViT-based architectures offer superior classification performance and present a scalable alternative to CNNs for analyzing kidney stone endoscopic imagery.

Abstract: Kidney stone classification from endoscopic images is critical for
personalized treatment and recurrence prevention. While convolutional neural
networks (CNNs) have shown promise in this task, their limited ability to
capture long-range dependencies can hinder performance under variable imaging
conditions. This study presents a comparative analysis between Vision
Transformers (ViTs) and CNN-based models, evaluating their performance on two
ex vivo datasets comprising CCD camera and flexible ureteroscope images. The
ViT-base model pretrained on ImageNet-21k consistently outperformed a ResNet50
baseline across multiple imaging conditions. For instance, in the most visually
complex subset (Section patches from endoscopic images), the ViT model achieved
95.2% accuracy and 95.1% F1-score, compared to 64.5% and 59.3% with ResNet50.
In the mixed-view subset from CCD-camera images, ViT reached 87.1% accuracy
versus 78.4% with CNN. These improvements extend across precision and recall as
well. The results demonstrate that ViT-based architectures provide superior
classification performance and offer a scalable alternative to conventional
CNNs for kidney stone image analysis.

### [18] [MINR: Efficient Implicit Neural Representations for Multi-Image Encoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13471)
*Wenyong Zhou,Taiqiang Wu,Zhengwu Liu,Yuxin Cheng,Chen Zhang,Ngai Wong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MINR shares selected hidden layers across multiple images to build a compact multi-image INR. It keeps input/output layers per image and adds a per-image projection layer, achieving up to 60% parameter savings while maintaining performance; scalable to 100 images with PSNR ~34 dB; robust across backbones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training separate INRs for each image is storage/compute inefficient for multi-image encoding. Observing similar intermediate-layer weight distributions across trained INRs suggests a shared representation can capture common features, while per-image input/output layers and a projection layer preserve individuality.

Method: Identify and share corresponding intermediate layers across images; retain image-specific input/output layers; introduce a per-image projection layer to capture unique features; evaluate on image reconstruction and super-resolution; test across backbones; demonstrate scalability to 100 images.

Result: Parameter count reduced by up to 60%; performance remains comparable to baseline INRs; PSNR ~34 dB on 100 images; robust across backbone architectures.

Conclusion: Layer-sharing in MINR enables efficient multi-image INR with preserved quality and scalability, offering substantial parameter savings without sacrificing performance.

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) aim to parameterize discrete signals
through implicit continuous functions. However, formulating each image with a
separate neural network~(typically, a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)) leads to
computational and storage inefficiencies when encoding multi-images. To address
this issue, we propose MINR, sharing specific layers to encode multi-image
efficiently. We first compare the layer-wise weight distributions for several
trained INRs and find that corresponding intermediate layers follow highly
similar distribution patterns. Motivated by this, we share these intermediate
layers across multiple images while preserving the input and output layers as
input-specific. In addition, we design an extra novel projection layer for each
image to capture its unique features. Experimental results on image
reconstruction and super-resolution tasks demonstrate that MINR can save up to
60\% parameters while maintaining comparable performance. Particularly, MINR
scales effectively to handle 100 images, maintaining an average peak
signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) of 34 dB. Further analysis of various backbones
proves the robustness of the proposed MINR.

### [19] [Distribution-Aware Hadamard Quantization for Hardware-Efficient Implicit Neural Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13478)
*Wenyong Zhou,Jiachen Ren,Taiqiang Wu,Yuxin Cheng,Zhengwu Liu,Ngai Wong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DHQ: a distribution-aware Hadamard quantization for INRs that quantizes both weights and activations by standardizing layer-wise distributions with a Hadamard transform, yielding strong hardware benefits on FPGA and better overall quantization performance than prior methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Implicit Neural Representations require high-precision computations using MLPs, imposing hardware overhead. Previous INR quantization mostly targeted weights and neglected activations, limiting hardware savings. A distribution-aware approach could enable effective quantization across weights and activations and across layers.

Method: Apply Hadamard transformation to standardize diverse layer distributions (first/last layer weights, last-layer activations) into a unified bell-shaped form, then apply a standard quantizer. Implement and evaluate on FPGA to demonstrate hardware efficiency across image reconstruction tasks.

Result: DHQ achieves hardware improvements over full-precision and prior quantization methods: latency reduced by 32.7%, energy consumption reduced by 40.1%, and resource utilization reduced by up to 98.3% in FPGA implementations, while maintaining or improving INR performance on diverse image reconstruction tasks.

Conclusion: A distribution-aware Hadamard quantization enables effective, hardware-efficient quantization of INRs by normalizing layer distributions prior to quantization and quantizing both weights and activations, with substantial FPGA-level gains and superior performance over existing methods.

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) encode discrete signals using
Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) with complex activation functions. While INRs
achieve superior performance, they depend on full-precision number
representation for accurate computation, resulting in significant hardware
overhead. Previous INR quantization approaches have primarily focused on weight
quantization, offering only limited hardware savings due to the lack of
activation quantization. To fully exploit the hardware benefits of
quantization, we propose DHQ, a novel distribution-aware Hadamard quantization
scheme that targets both weights and activations in INRs. Our analysis shows
that the weights in the first and last layers have distributions distinct from
those in the intermediate layers, while the activations in the last layer
differ significantly from those in the preceding layers. Instead of customizing
quantizers individually, we utilize the Hadamard transformation to standardize
these diverse distributions into a unified bell-shaped form, supported by both
empirical evidence and theoretical analysis, before applying a standard
quantizer. To demonstrate the practical advantages of our approach, we present
an FPGA implementation of DHQ that highlights its hardware efficiency.
Experiments on diverse image reconstruction tasks show that DHQ outperforms
previous quantization methods, reducing latency by 32.7\%, energy consumption
by 40.1\%, and resource utilization by up to 98.3\% compared to full-precision
counterparts.

*Wenyong Zhou,Yuxin Cheng,Zhengwu Liu,Taiqiang Wu,Chen Zhang,Ngai Wong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This work studies the robustness of Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) to weight perturbations and proposes a robust loss that improves reconstruction under perturbations, achieving up to 7.5 dB PSNR gains across modalities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: INRs are vulnerable to even small weight perturbations, threatening reliable real-world deployment; improving robustness to perturbations is critical.

Method: Formulates a robustness objective by minimizing the difference between reconstruction losses with and without weight perturbations, and derives a novel robust loss that regulates the gradient of the reconstruction loss with respect to weights.

Result: Experiments across multiple modalities show up to 7.5 dB improvement in PSNR over standard INRs under noisy conditions.

Conclusion: The proposed robust loss enhances the resilience of INRs to weight perturbations, enabling more reliable signal reconstruction in practical settings and across different modalities.

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) encode discrete signals in a
continuous manner using neural networks, demonstrating significant value across
various multimedia applications. However, the vulnerability of INRs presents a
critical challenge for their real-world deployments, as the network weights
might be subjected to unavoidable perturbations. In this work, we investigate
the robustness of INRs for the first time and find that even minor
perturbations can lead to substantial performance degradation in the quality of
signal reconstruction. To mitigate this issue, we formulate the robustness
problem in INRs by minimizing the difference between loss with and without
weight perturbations. Furthermore, we derive a novel robust loss function to
regulate the gradient of the reconstruction loss with respect to weights,
thereby enhancing the robustness. Extensive experiments on reconstruction tasks
across multiple modalities demonstrate that our method achieves up to a 7.5~dB
improvement in peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) values compared to original
INRs under noisy conditions.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A multi-task, hierarchical-attention MER method (FAMNet) that fuses 2D and 3D CNNs with a shared backbone and FAUD auxiliary task, achieving strong MER performance on multiple datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MER faces challenges from the very short duration and low intensity of micro-expressions; existing static/dynamic approaches struggle to capture fine-grained spatiotemporal cues. A multi-task, attention-enabled fusion of 2D and 3D CNN features could better extract omni-directional information.

Method: A two-stream fusion model (AMNet2D and AMNet3D) with a shared ResNet-18 backbone and hierarchical attention modules. Each stream uses different data-loading schemes; trained jointly on MER and facial action unit detection (FAUD) with parameter hard sharing to link tasks; the fused model is called FAMNet.

Result: On SAMM, CASME II, and MMEW datasets, FAMNet achieves 83.75% UAR and 84.03% UF1. On the CAS(ME)3 dataset, it reaches 51% UAR and 43.42% UF1.

Conclusion: FAMNet significantly improves MER performance by effectively capturing omni-directional spatiotemporal features through multi-task learning and 2D/3D feature fusion with shared representations.

Abstract: Micro-expressions recognition (MER) has essential application value in many
fields, but the short duration and low intensity of micro-expressions (MEs)
bring considerable challenges to MER. The current MER methods in deep learning
mainly include three data loading methods: static images, dynamic image
sequence, and a combination of the two streams. How to effectively extract MEs'
fine-grained and spatiotemporal features has been difficult to solve. This
paper proposes a new MER method based on multi-task learning and hierarchical
attention, which fully extracts MEs' omni-directional features by merging 2D
and 3D CNNs. The fusion model consists of a 2D CNN AMNet2D and a 3D CNN
AMNet3D, with similar structures consisting of a shared backbone network
Resnet18 and attention modules. During training, the model adopts different
data loading methods to adapt to two specific networks respectively, jointly
trains on the tasks of MER and facial action unit detection (FAUD), and adopts
the parameter hard sharing for information association, which further improves
the effect of the MER task, and the final fused model is called FAMNet.
Extensive experimental results show that our proposed FAMNet significantly
improves task performance. On the SAMM, CASME II and MMEW datasets, FAMNet
achieves 83.75% (UAR) and 84.03% (UF1). Furthermore, on the challenging
CAS(ME)$^3$ dataset, FAMNet achieves 51% (UAR) and 43.42% (UF1).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sparse and noisy 4D radar point clouds hamper perception; leveraging LiDAR supervision helps identify noise patterns and extract discriminative features while preserving radar-only operation at inference.

Method: A cross-modal denoising framework (CORENet) that identifies noise patterns and extracts discriminative features from raw 4D radar data using LiDAR supervision during training. It is designed as a plug-and-play module that can be integrated into voxel-based detectors without altering existing pipelines, and it uses LiDAR data only for cross-modal supervision during training with radar-only inference.

Result: Evaluated on the challenging Dual-Radar dataset with elevated noise, CORENet improves detection robustness and achieves superior performance compared to mainstream approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed cross-modal, LiDAR-supervised denoising approach effectively enhances radar-based object detection robustness in noisy settings while maintaining radar-only inference, and can be integrated as a drop-in module for voxel-based detectors.

Abstract: 4D radar-based object detection has garnered great attention for its
robustness in adverse weather conditions and capacity to deliver rich spatial
information across diverse driving scenarios. Nevertheless, the sparse and
noisy nature of 4D radar point clouds poses substantial challenges for
effective perception. To address the limitation, we present CORENet, a novel
cross-modal denoising framework that leverages LiDAR supervision to identify
noise patterns and extract discriminative features from raw 4D radar data.
Designed as a plug-and-play architecture, our solution enables seamless
integration into voxel-based detection frameworks without modifying existing
pipelines. Notably, the proposed method only utilizes LiDAR data for
cross-modal supervision during training while maintaining full radar-only
operation during inference. Extensive evaluation on the challenging Dual-Radar
dataset, which is characterized by elevated noise level, demonstrates the
effectiveness of our framework in enhancing detection robustness. Comprehensive
experiments validate that CORENet achieves superior performance compared to
existing mainstream approaches.

*Shihao Dong,Yuhui Zheng,Huiying Xu,Xinzhong Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BDCL is a bi-level decoupling and consistency learning framework for multi-view clustering that improves inter-cluster separability and intra-cluster compactness by separating feature and cluster representations and enforcing cross-view consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To exploit cross-view consistency and complementarity while preserving view-specific information, addressing the overlooked cluster-oriented representation learning in existing multi-view clustering.

Method: Three modules: (1) multi-view instance learning with reconstruction autoencoders and contrastive learning to align consistent information while preserving private view features; (2) bi-level decoupling of features and clusters to improve discriminability in feature and cluster spaces; (3) a consistency learning module that treats different views and their neighbors as positive pairs to learn consistent clustering assignments and compress intra-cluster space.

Result: Empirical evaluation on five benchmark datasets shows superior performance over state-of-the-art methods; code provided at GitHub.

Conclusion: BDCL effectively enhances inter-cluster discriminability and intra-cluster compactness in multi-view clustering through bi-level decoupling and cross-view consistency learning, offering a strong, reproducible solution.

Abstract: Multi-view clustering has shown to be an effective method for analyzing
underlying patterns in multi-view data. The performance of clustering can be
improved by learning the consistency and complementarity between multi-view
features, however, cluster-oriented representation learning is often
overlooked. In this paper, we propose a novel Bi-level Decoupling and
Consistency Learning framework (BDCL) to further explore the effective
representation for multi-view data to enhance inter-cluster discriminability
and intra-cluster compactness of features in multi-view clustering. Our
framework comprises three modules: 1) The multi-view instance learning module
aligns the consistent information while preserving the private features between
views through reconstruction autoencoder and contrastive learning. 2) The
bi-level decoupling of features and clusters enhances the discriminability of
feature space and cluster space. 3) The consistency learning module treats the
different views of the sample and their neighbors as positive pairs, learns the
consistency of their clustering assignments, and further compresses the
intra-cluster space. Experimental results on five benchmark datasets
demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method compared with the SOTA
methods. Our code is published on https://github.com/LouisDong95/BDCL.

*Anas Gouda,Shrutarv Awasthi,Christian Blesing,Lokeshwaran Manohar,Frank Hoffmann,Alice Kirchheim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MR6D is a new 92-scene real-world 6D pose dataset for mobile robots in industrial environments with 16 objects; reveals gaps in current methods and 2D segmentation challenges; enables development of mobile-robot-specific pose estimation methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 6D pose datasets focus on small household objects and manipulators, not reflecting mobile robots' challenges: long-range perception, distant viewpoints, larger objects, occlusion, and diverse camera perspectives.

Method: Dataset design: 92 real-world scenes, 16 objects, static and dynamic interactions; captures distant viewpoints, varied configurations, large object sizes, and complex occlusion/self-occlusion; baseline experiments show performance gaps; dataset availability is provided.

Result: Existing 6D pipelines underperform on MR6D scenarios; 2D segmentation is an additional hurdle; provides baseline results and a foundation for tailoring methods for mobile robotics.

Conclusion: MR6D provides a foundation for developing/evaluating pose estimation methods tailored to mobile robotics in industrial environments and encourages future work; dataset is available at the provided link.

Abstract: Existing 6D pose estimation datasets primarily focus on small household
objects typically handled by robot arm manipulators, limiting their relevance
to mobile robotics. Mobile platforms often operate without manipulators,
interact with larger objects, and face challenges such as long-range
perception, heavy self-occlusion, and diverse camera perspectives. While recent
models generalize well to unseen objects, evaluations remain confined to
household-like settings that overlook these factors. We introduce MR6D, a
dataset designed for 6D pose estimation for mobile robots in industrial
environments. It includes 92 real-world scenes featuring 16 unique objects
across static and dynamic interactions. MR6D captures the challenges specific
to mobile platforms, including distant viewpoints, varied object
configurations, larger object sizes, and complex occlusion/self-occlusion
patterns. Initial experiments reveal that current 6D pipelines underperform in
these settings, with 2D segmentation being another hurdle. MR6D establishes a
foundation for developing and evaluating pose estimation methods tailored to
the demands of mobile robotics. The dataset is available at

### [27] [AdaptiveAE: An Adaptive Exposure Strategy for HDR Capturing in Dynamic Scenes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13503)
*Tianyi Xu,Fan Zhang,Boxin Shi,Tianfan Xue,Yujin Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Uses reinforcement learning to optimize shutter speed and ISO for HDR imaging in dynamic scenes, modeling motion blur and noise; adapts exposure schedules within a time budget; claims state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the poor interplay between shutter speed, ISO, and motion blur in dynamic scenes, enabling better HDR reconstruction by learning optimal exposure schedules under time budgets.

Method: AdaptiveAE uses reinforcement learning to select ISO and shutter speed sequences. It includes an image synthesis training pipeline that simulates motion blur and noise, leveraging semantic information and exposure histograms, and operates under a user-defined exposure time budget to find optimal exposure schedules.

Result: Experimental results on multiple datasets show state-of-the-art HDR reconstruction performance.

Conclusion: AdaptiveAE provides improved HDR quality in dynamic environments by learning exposure control that accounts for blur and noise trade-offs.

Abstract: Mainstream high dynamic range imaging techniques typically rely on fusing
multiple images captured with different exposure setups (shutter speed and
ISO). A good balance between shutter speed and ISO is crucial for achieving
high-quality HDR, as high ISO values introduce significant noise, while long
shutter speeds can lead to noticeable motion blur. However, existing methods
often overlook the complex interaction between shutter speed and ISO and fail
to account for motion blur effects in dynamic scenes.
  In this work, we propose AdaptiveAE, a reinforcement learning-based method
that optimizes the selection of shutter speed and ISO combinations to maximize
HDR reconstruction quality in dynamic environments. AdaptiveAE integrates an
image synthesis pipeline that incorporates motion blur and noise simulation
into our training procedure, leveraging semantic information and exposure
histograms. It can adaptively select optimal ISO and shutter speed sequences
based on a user-defined exposure time budget, and find a better exposure
schedule than traditional solutions. Experimental results across multiple
datasets demonstrate that it achieves the state-of-the-art performance.

Future work could extend multi-story layouts, dynamic elements, and broader cultural/typological coverage, as well as expanding benchmark tasks.

Abstract: We introduce ResPlan, a large-scale dataset of 17,000 detailed, structurally
rich, and realistic residential floor plans, created to advance spatial AI
research. Each plan includes precise annotations of architectural elements
(walls, doors, windows, balconies) and functional spaces (such as kitchens,
bedrooms, and bathrooms). ResPlan addresses key limitations of existing
datasets such as RPLAN (Wu et al., 2019) and MSD (van Engelenburg et al., 2024)
by offering enhanced visual fidelity and greater structural diversity,
reflecting realistic and non-idealized residential layouts. Designed as a
versatile, general-purpose resource, ResPlan supports a wide range of
applications including robotics, reinforcement learning, generative AI, virtual

both geometric and graph-based formats, enabling direct integration into
simulation engines and fast 3D conversion. A key contribution is an open-source
pipeline for geometry cleaning, alignment, and annotation refinement.
Additionally, ResPlan includes structured representations of room connectivity,
supporting graph-based spatial reasoning tasks. Finally, we present comparative
analyses with existing benchmarks and outline several open benchmark tasks
enabled by ResPlan. Ultimately, ResPlan offers a significant advance in scale,

### [29] [Bridging the Gap: Doubles Badminton Analysis with Singles-Trained Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13507)
*Seungheon Baek,Jinhyuk Yun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A framework to apply singles-trained pose-based badminton shot recognition to doubles by using ViT-Pose keypoints, contrastive embedding with ST-GCN, a multi-object tracker to handle fast moves, and a Transformer classifier; demonstrates feasibility and lays groundwork for doubles datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Doubles is predominant in international play but understudied due to data availability and tracking challenges; transferring singles-trained models to doubles can broaden analytics.

Method: Extract keypoints from ShuttleSet single matches using ViT-Pose; embed them via a contrastive learning framework based on ST-GCN; use a custom multi-object tracking algorithm to reduce ID switching from fast/overlapping movements; employ a Transformer-based classifier to detect shot occurrences from learned embeddings.

Result: Demonstrates feasibility of extending pose-based shot recognition to doubles badminton; expands analytics capabilities; establishes a foundation for doubles-specific datasets to improve understanding of this fast-paced sport.

Conclusion: This approach enables doubles analytics and motivates the creation of doubles-focused datasets to enhance understanding of fast racket sports.

Abstract: Badminton is known as one of the fastest racket sports in the world. Despite
doubles matches being more prevalent in international tournaments than singles,
previous research has mainly focused on singles due to the challenges in data
availability and multi-person tracking. To address this gap, we designed an
approach that transfers singles-trained models to doubles analysis. We
extracted keypoints from the ShuttleSet single matches dataset using ViT-Pose
and embedded them through a contrastive learning framework based on ST-GCN. To
improve tracking stability, we incorporated a custom multi-object tracking
algorithm that resolves ID switching issues from fast and overlapping player
movements. A Transformer-based classifier then determines shot occurrences
based on the learned embeddings. Our findings demonstrate the feasibility of
extending pose-based shot recognition to doubles badminton, broadening
analytics capabilities. This work establishes a foundation for doubles-specific
datasets to enhance understanding of this predominant yet understudied format
of the fast racket sport.

### [30] [2D Gaussians Meet Visual Tokenizer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13515)
*Yiang Shi,Xiaoyang Guo,Wei Yin,Mingkai Jia,Qian Zhang,Xiaolin Hu,Wenyu Liu,Xinggang Wan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VGQ introduces a 2D Gaussian-based tokenizer to capture geometry and structure in images, improving reconstruction fidelity over traditional patch-based quantizers like VQ-GAN by modeling latent geometry (position, rotation, scale). Dense Gaussians boost fidelity, achieving rFID 0.556 and PSNR 24.93 on ImageNet 256x256; codes to be released.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current quantization-based tokenizers emphasize texture/color features and fail to model geometric structure due to patch-based designs; there is a need for a tokenizer that explicitly encodes spatial structure.

Method: Encode image latents as 2D Gaussian distributions within a traditional visual codebook framework, modeling structure-related parameters (position, rotation, scale); vary Gaussian density to trade off token efficiency and visual richness; evaluate with rFID/PSNR on ImageNet 256x256.

Result: Baseline reconstruction rFID ~1.00; with higher Gaussian density, rFID improves to 0.556 and PSNR to 24.93, outperforming prior methods.

Conclusion: VGQ offers a novel tokenizer paradigm that better captures geometric structure; density of Gaussians provides flexible trade-offs; expected release of code.

Abstract: The image tokenizer is a critical component in AR image generation, as it
determines how rich and structured visual content is encoded into compact
representations. Existing quantization-based tokenizers such as VQ-GAN
primarily focus on appearance features like texture and color, often neglecting
geometric structures due to their patch-based design. In this work, we explored
how to incorporate more visual information into the tokenizer and proposed a
new framework named Visual Gaussian Quantization (VGQ), a novel tokenizer
paradigm that explicitly enhances structural modeling by integrating 2D
Gaussians into traditional visual codebook quantization frameworks. Our
approach addresses the inherent limitations of naive quantization methods such
as VQ-GAN, which struggle to model structured visual information due to their
patch-based design and emphasis on texture and color. In contrast, VGQ encodes
image latents as 2D Gaussian distributions, effectively capturing geometric and
spatial structures by directly modeling structure-related parameters such as
position, rotation and scale. We further demonstrate that increasing the
density of 2D Gaussians within the tokens leads to significant gains in
reconstruction fidelity, providing a flexible trade-off between token
efficiency and visual richness. On the ImageNet 256x256 benchmark, VGQ achieves
strong reconstruction quality with an rFID score of 1.00. Furthermore, by
increasing the density of 2D Gaussians within the tokens, VGQ gains a
significant boost in reconstruction capability and achieves a state-of-the-art
reconstruction rFID score of 0.556 and a PSNR of 24.93, substantially
outperforming existing methods. Codes will be released soon.

### [31] [Calibrating Biased Distribution in VFM-derived Latent Space via Cross-Domain Geometric Consistency](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13518)
*Yanbiao Ma,Wei Dai,Bowei Liu,Jiayi Chen,Wenke Huang,Guancheng Wan,Zhiwu Lu,Junchi Yan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A geometric knowledge-guided distribution calibration framework uses vision foundation models to extract transferable feature geometry and applies it to federated learning and long-tailed recognition to bridge training-data gaps and boost performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a persistent gap between observed training samples and the true underlying distribution caused by sampling bias, noise, and data heterogeneity. The feature geometry learned by off-the-shelf foundation models shows cross-domain transferability that can be exploited to calibrate distributions across tasks and domains.

Method: Extract features with off-the-shelf vision foundation models (e.g., CLIP, DINOv2) to study the geometric shapes of feature distributions. In federated learning, infer a global geometric shape under privacy constraints and use it to synthesize new samples for clients to align local and global distributions. In long-tailed recognition, transfer geometry from data-rich (head) classes to data-scarce (tail) classes to recover the true distribution.

Result: Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that geometric knowledge-guided distribution calibration improves performance, mitigating the adverse effects of data heterogeneity and sample imbalance across benchmarks.

Conclusion: Geometric knowledge-guided distribution calibration is an effective strategy for bridging information deficits due to heterogeneity and imbalance, with practical benefits in federated learning and long-tailed recognition.

Abstract: Despite the fast progress of deep learning, one standing challenge is the gap
of the observed training samples and the underlying true distribution. There
are multiple reasons for the causing of this gap e.g. sampling bias, noise etc.
In the era of foundation models, we show that when leveraging the off-the-shelf
(vision) foundation models (e.g., CLIP, DINOv2) for feature extraction, the
geometric shapes of the resulting feature distributions exhibit remarkable
transferability across domains and datasets. To verify its practical
usefulness, we embody our geometric knowledge-guided distribution calibration
framework in two popular and challenging settings: federated learning and
long-tailed recognition. In the federated setting, we devise a technique of
acquiring the global geometric shape under privacy constraints, then leverage
this knowledge to generate new samples for clients, in the aim of bridging the
gap between local and global observations. In long-tailed learning, it utilizes
the geometric knowledge transferred from sample-rich categories to recover the
true distribution for sample-scarce tail classes. Comprehensive experiments
show that our proposed geometric knowledge-guided distribution calibration
effectively overcomes information deficits caused by data heterogeneity and
sample imbalance, with boosted performance across benchmarks.

*Vamsi Krishna Mulukutla,Sai Supriya Pavarala,Srinivasa Raju Rudraraju,Sridevi Bonthu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Traditional CNN-based FER models outperform open-source Vision-Language Models on FER-2013, even with GFPGAN-based image restoration; VLMs lag on noisy/low-quality data, highlighting the need to adapt them for such tasks; the paper also provides a reproducible computational-cost benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Evaluate whether open-source Vision-Language Models (e.g., Phi-3.5 Vision, CLIP) can match traditional CNNs for facial emotion recognition (FER) on noisy, low-resolution data, and to address the data-quality mismatch with VLM training.

Method: Benchmark open-source VLMs (Phi-3.5 Vision, CLIP) against traditional CNNs (VGG19, ResNet-50, EfficientNet-B0) on FER-2013 (35,887 grayscale images, 7 emotions). Introduce GFPGAN-based image restoration as a preprocessing step to mitigate noise. Evaluate using precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy; provide a detailed computational-cost analysis across preprocessing, training, inference, and evaluation phases.

Result: Traditional models outperform VLMs: EfficientNet-B0 86.44% accuracy, ResNet-50 85.72% vs CLIP 64.07%, Phi-3.5 Vision 51.66%. FER-2013 comprises 35,887 low-resolution grayscale images across seven emotion classes. The GFPGAN restoration pipeline helps address data noise, but VLMs still underperform. The work also offers a comprehensive computational-cost analysis.

Conclusion: VLMs exhibit limitations in noisy, low-quality visual tasks like FER; adapting VLMs for such environments is necessary. The study provides a reproducible benchmark to guide future FER research and deployment considerations.

Abstract: Facial Emotion Recognition (FER) is crucial for applications such as
human-computer interaction and mental health diagnostics. This study presents
the first empirical comparison of open-source Vision-Language Models (VLMs),
including Phi-3.5 Vision and CLIP, against traditional deep learning models
VGG19, ResNet-50, and EfficientNet-B0 on the challenging FER-2013 dataset,
which contains 35,887 low-resolution grayscale images across seven emotion
classes. To address the mismatch between VLM training assumptions and the noisy
nature of FER data, we introduce a novel pipeline that integrates GFPGAN-based
image restoration with FER evaluation. Results show that traditional models,
particularly EfficientNet-B0 (86.44%) and ResNet-50 (85.72%), significantly
outperform VLMs like CLIP (64.07%) and Phi-3.5 Vision (51.66%), highlighting
the limitations of VLMs in low-quality visual tasks. In addition to performance
evaluation using precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy, we provide a
detailed computational cost analysis covering preprocessing, training,
inference, and evaluation phases, offering practical insights for deployment.
This work underscores the need for adapting VLMs to noisy environments and
provides a reproducible benchmark for future research in emotion recognition.

*Shikun Zhang,Cunjian Chen,Yiqun Wang,Qiuhong Ke,Yong Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes EAvatar, a 3D Gaussian Splatting–based head reconstruction framework that is expression- and deformation-aware, featuring sparse expression control and priors from pretrained generative models to improve local deformations, texture continuity, and training stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3DGS methods struggle to capture fine-grained facial expressions and preserve local texture continuity in highly deformable regions, hindering realism and controllability.

Method: Introduce a sparse expression control mechanism where a small set of Gaussians influence neighboring Gaussians to better model local deformations; incorporate high-quality 3D priors from pretrained generative models to guide facial geometry and stabilize training; maintain real-time rendering capability inherent to 3DGS.

Result: Experimental claims show more accurate, visually coherent head reconstructions with improved expression controllability and detail fidelity compared to prior methods.

Conclusion: EAvatar demonstrates that combining sparse expression control with pretrained 3D priors yields enhanced expression fidelity and geometric stability in 3DGS-based head reconstruction.

Abstract: High-fidelity head avatar reconstruction plays a crucial role in AR/VR,
gaming, and multimedia content creation. Recent advances in 3D Gaussian
Splatting (3DGS) have demonstrated effectiveness in modeling complex geometry
with real-time rendering capability and are now widely used in high-fidelity
head avatar reconstruction tasks. However, existing 3DGS-based methods still
face significant challenges in capturing fine-grained facial expressions and
preserving local texture continuity, especially in highly deformable regions.
To mitigate these limitations, we propose a novel 3DGS-based framework termed
EAvatar for head reconstruction that is both expression-aware and
deformation-aware. Our method introduces a sparse expression control mechanism,
where a small number of key Gaussians are used to influence the deformation of
their neighboring Gaussians, enabling accurate modeling of local deformations
and fine-scale texture transitions. Furthermore, we leverage high-quality 3D
priors from pretrained generative models to provide a more reliable facial
geometry, offering structural guidance that improves convergence stability and
shape accuracy during training. Experimental results demonstrate that our
method produces more accurate and visually coherent head reconstructions with
improved expression controllability and detail fidelity.

*Sukhun Ko,Dahyeon Kye,Kyle Min,Chanho Eom,Jihyong Oh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FLAIR introduces RC-GAUSS activation and WEGE encoding to give implicit neural representations explicit frequency selectivity and spatial locality, addressing spectral bias and improving 2D image tasks and 3D reconstruction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) suffer from lack of frequency selectivity, poor spatial localization, and spectral bias toward low frequencies, leading to reliance on redundant components.

Method: Introduce RC-GAUSS, an activation enabling explicit frequency control and spatial localization under the time-frequency uncertainty principle, and WEGE, a wavelet-energy-guided encoding that uses the discrete wavelet transform to compute energy scores and steer frequency information to the network.

Result: FLAIR consistently outperforms existing INRs on 2D image representation/restoration and 3D reconstruction tasks.

Conclusion: By enforcing frequency selectivity and locality through RC-GAUSS and WEGE, FLAIR mitigates spectral bias and improves the efficiency and quality of implicit representations.

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) leverage neural networks to map
coordinates to corresponding signals, enabling continuous and compact
representations. This paradigm has driven significant advances in various
vision tasks. However, existing INRs lack frequency selectivity, spatial
localization, and sparse representations, leading to an over-reliance on
redundant signal components. Consequently, they exhibit spectral bias, tending
to learn low-frequency components early while struggling to capture fine
high-frequency details. To address these issues, we propose FLAIR (Frequency-
and Locality-Aware Implicit Neural Representations), which incorporates two key
innovations. The first is RC-GAUSS, a novel activation designed for explicit
frequency selection and spatial localization under the constraints of the
time-frequency uncertainty principle (TFUP). The second is
Wavelet-Energy-Guided Encoding (WEGE), which leverages the discrete wavelet
transform (DWT) to compute energy scores and explicitly guide frequency
information to the network. Our method consistently outperforms existing INRs
in 2D image representation and restoration, as well as 3D reconstruction.

Method: A Spherical Vision Transformer processes 360° VR scenes; an LSTM-based temporal encoder captures gaze sequence patterns; a multi-modal fusion network combines spatial scene features with temporal gaze dynamics to predict future gaze locations and provide confidence estimates.

Result: Median angular error of 3.83°, outperforming traditional saliency-based baselines by 24%; reliable confidence calibration; stable performance across spatial regions and scene types; results are statistically significant across evaluation metrics; demonstrated on a comprehensive VR dataset.

Conclusion: Software-only gaze prediction can support VR foveated rendering without extra hardware, increasing accessibility for various VR platforms and apps; results suggest practical deployment potential, with robust performance and confidence estimates.

Abstract: Foveated rendering significantly reduces computational demands in virtual
reality applications by concentrating rendering quality where users focus their
gaze. Current approaches require expensive hardware-based eye tracking systems,
limiting widespread adoption due to cost, calibration complexity, and hardware
compatibility constraints. This paper presents GazeProphet, a software-only
approach for predicting gaze locations in VR environments without requiring
dedicated eye tracking hardware. The approach combines a Spherical Vision
Transformer for processing 360-degree VR scenes with an LSTM-based temporal
encoder that captures gaze sequence patterns. A multi-modal fusion network
integrates spatial scene features with temporal gaze dynamics to predict future
gaze locations with associated confidence estimates. Experimental evaluation on
a comprehensive VR dataset demonstrates that GazeProphet achieves a median
angular error of 3.83 degrees, outperforming traditional saliency-based
baselines by 24% while providing reliable confidence calibration. The approach
maintains consistent performance across different spatial regions and scene
types, enabling practical deployment in VR systems without additional hardware
requirements. Statistical analysis confirms the significance of improvements
across all evaluation metrics. These results show that software-only gaze
prediction can work for VR foveated rendering, making this performance boost
more accessible to different VR platforms and apps.

*Zihan Zhang,Shanzhi Yin,Bolin Chen,Ru-Ling Liao,Shiqi Wang,Yan Ye*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A lightweight dual-mode optimization for Generative Face Video Coding (GFVC) reduces model complexity via architectural redesign and a two-stage adaptive channel pruning, achieving large parameter and computation savings while maintaining or surpassing state-of-the-art perceptual quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GFVC offers strong perceptual coding but is hindered by large model sizes and high computational cost, limiting deployment on resource-constrained devices. A lightweight, efficient GFVC is needed.

Method: Architectural redesign replaces 3x3 convolutions with slimmer, more efficient layers. A two-stage adaptive channel pruning strategy is employed: (1) soft pruning during training using learnable thresholds to identify redundant channels, and (2) hard pruning post-training using a derived mask to permanently remove these channels.

Result: The approach achieves 90.4% parameter reduction and 88.9% computation savings compared to the baseline, while delivering superior perceptual-quality performance than the Versatile Video Coding (VVC) standard.

Conclusion: Dual-mode optimization effectively reduces GFVC complexity without sacrificing quality, enabling efficient deployment in resource-constrained environments such as mobile edge devices.

Abstract: Generative Face Video Coding (GFVC) achieves superior rate-distortion
performance by leveraging the strong inference capabilities of deep generative
models. However, its practical deployment is hindered by large model parameters
and high computational costs. To address this, we propose a lightweight GFVC
framework that introduces dual-mode optimization -- combining architectural
redesign and operational refinement -- to reduce complexity whilst preserving
reconstruction quality. Architecturally, we replace traditional 3 x 3
convolutions with slimmer and more efficient layers, reducing complexity
without compromising feature expressiveness. Operationally, we develop a
two-stage adaptive channel pruning strategy: (1) soft pruning during training
identifies redundant channels via learnable thresholds, and (2) hard pruning
permanently eliminates these channels post-training using a derived mask. This
dual-phase approach ensures both training stability and inference efficiency.
Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed lightweight dual-mode
optimization for GFVC can achieve 90.4% parameter reduction and 88.9%
computation saving compared to the baseline, whilst achieving superior
performance compared to state-of-the-art video coding standard Versatile Video
Coding (VVC) in terms of perceptual-level quality metrics. As such, the
proposed method is expected to enable efficient GFVC deployment in
resource-constrained environments such as mobile edge devices.

*Hsieh Ching-Teng,Wang Yuan-Kai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Biologically inspired neuron-like encoding with an artificial photoreceptor layer boosts spike-data information content and improves SNN performance while preserving neuromorphic principles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SNNs lag behind CNNs due to limited information capacity of spike-based data; training with non-spiking inputs contradicts neuromorphic aims. A spike-based method that enriches information content is needed to close performance gaps without abandoning spike processing.

Method: Propose a Neuron-like Encoding method grounded in the operational principles of biological neurons, augmented by an artificial photoreceptor layer to encode color and luminance into spike signals. Uses Integrate-and-Fire neurons to demonstrate enhanced spike information content and improved SNN performance while maintaining neuromorphic processing.

Result: Experimental results with Integrate-and-Fire neurons show that the biologically inspired encoding increases the information content of spike signals and improves SNN performance, all within neuromorphic constraints.

Conclusion: This approach holds strong potential for future development, offering a pathway to overcome current neuromorphic limitations and broaden the applicability of SNNs.

Abstract: In recent years, neuromorphic computing and spiking neural networks (SNNs)
have ad-vanced rapidly through integration with deep learning. However, the
performance of SNNs still lags behind that of convolutional neural networks
(CNNs), primarily due to the limited information capacity of spike-based data.
Although some studies have attempted to improve SNN performance by training
them with non-spiking inputs such as static images, this approach deviates from
the original intent of neuromorphic computing, which emphasizes spike-based
information processing. To address this issue, we propose a Neuron-like
Encoding method that generates spike data based on the intrinsic operational
principles and functions of biological neurons. This method is further enhanced
by the incorporation of an artificial pho-toreceptor layer, enabling spike data
to carry both color and luminance information, thereby forming a complete
visual spike signal. Experimental results using the Integrate-and-Fire neuron
model demonstrate that this biologically inspired approach effectively
increases the information content of spike signals and improves SNN
performance, all while adhering to neuromorphic principles. We believe this
concept holds strong potential for future development and may contribute to
overcoming current limitations in neuro-morphic computing, facilitating broader
applications of SNNs.

*Zhen Qu,Xian Tao,Xinyi Gong,ShiChen Qu,Xiaopei Zhang,Xingang Wang,Fei Shen,Zhengtao Zhang,Mukesh Prasad,Guiguang Ding*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DictAS uses a normal-reference dictionary-lookup framework with self-supervision to detect anomalies in unseen categories without retraining, achieving state-of-the-art FSAS results across seven datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current FSAS methods relying on vision-language models struggle to generalize to unseen categories without retraining or access to real anomaly samples. There is a need for a unified approach that leverages normal references and self-supervised learning to enable cross-category anomaly detection.

Method: DictAS comprises three components: (1) Dictionary Construction using features from normal reference images to simulate a dictionary's index and content; (2) Dictionary Lookup that retrieves query region features via sparse lookup and flags anomalies when retrieval fails; (3) Query Discrimination Regularization to improve anomaly discrimination, including a Contrastive Query Constraint and a Text Alignment Constraint to make abnormal features harder to retrieve.

Result: Extensive experiments on seven public industrial and medical datasets show that DictAS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art FSAS methods.

Conclusion: DictAS enables a unified model to detect visual anomalies in unseen object categories without retraining on target data, by transferring dictionary lookup capabilities through self-supervised learning, and demonstrates strong cross-category anomaly detection performance.

Abstract: Recent vision-language models (e.g., CLIP) have demonstrated remarkable
class-generalizable ability to unseen classes in few-shot anomaly segmentation
(FSAS), leveraging supervised prompt learning or fine-tuning on seen classes.
However, their cross-category generalization largely depends on prior knowledge
of real seen anomaly samples. In this paper, we propose a novel framework,
namely DictAS, which enables a unified model to detect visual anomalies in
unseen object categories without any retraining on the target data, only
employing a few normal reference images as visual prompts. The insight behind
DictAS is to transfer dictionary lookup capabilities to the FSAS task for
unseen classes via self-supervised learning, instead of merely memorizing the
normal and abnormal feature patterns from the training set. Specifically,
DictAS mainly consists of three components: (1) **Dictionary Construction** -
to simulate the index and content of a real dictionary using features from
normal reference images. (2) **Dictionary Lookup** - to retrieve queried region
features from the dictionary via a sparse lookup strategy. When a query feature
cannot be retrieved, it is classified as an anomaly. (3) **Query Discrimination
Regularization**- to enhance anomaly discrimination by making abnormal features
harder to retrieve from the dictionary. To achieve this, Contrastive Query
Constraint and Text Alignment Constraint are further proposed. Extensive
experiments on seven public industrial and medical datasets demonstrate that
DictAS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art FSAS methods.

### [39] [Learnable SMPLify: A Neural Solution for Optimization-Free Human Pose Inverse Kinematics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13562)
*Yuchen Yang,Linfeng Dong,Wei Wang,Zhihang Zhong,Xiao Sun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Learnable SMPLify replaces SMPLify's iterative IK with a single-pass neural regression, delivering massive speedups while retaining accuracy and generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SMPLify's iterative optimization for 3D pose fitting is robust but computationally expensive; there is a need for faster, data-driven IK that generalizes across motions.

Method: Introduce a neural regression model (Learnable SMPLify) to replace iterative fitting. key components include a temporal sampling strategy to create initialization-target pairs, a human-centric normalization scheme, and residual learning. The approach supports sequential inference and can be used as a plug-in post-processing tool for existing image-based estimators.

Result: Achieves nearly 200x faster runtime than SMPLify, generalizes to unseen datasets like 3DPW and RICH, and operates as a model-agnostic plug-in tool for LucidAction; code released.

Conclusion: Demonstrates a practical, simple baseline for fast 3D pose/shape estimation and shows strong speed-accuracy-generalization trade-offs, with broad applicability as a plug-in or standalone estimator.

Abstract: In 3D human pose and shape estimation, SMPLify remains a robust baseline that
solves inverse kinematics (IK) through iterative optimization. However, its
high computational cost limits its practicality. Recent advances across domains
have shown that replacing iterative optimization with data-driven neural
networks can achieve significant runtime improvements without sacrificing
accuracy. Motivated by this trend, we propose Learnable SMPLify, a neural
framework that replaces the iterative fitting process in SMPLify with a
single-pass regression model. The design of our framework targets two core
challenges in neural IK: data construction and generalization. To enable
effective training, we propose a temporal sampling strategy that constructs
initialization-target pairs from sequential frames. To improve generalization
across diverse motions and unseen poses, we propose a human-centric
normalization scheme and residual learning to narrow the solution space.
Learnable SMPLify supports both sequential inference and plug-in
post-processing to refine existing image-based estimators. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our method establishes itself as a practical and
simple baseline: it achieves nearly 200x faster runtime compared to SMPLify,
generalizes well to unseen 3DPW and RICH, and operates in a model-agnostic
manner when used as a plug-in tool on LucidAction. The code is available at

*Guiqin Wang,Peng Zhao,Cong Zhao,Jing Huang,Siyan Guo,Shusen Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Generative attention-based framework that leverages feature semantics to learn frame- and segment-level temporal action features, improving action recognition and detection in IoT contexts; code released.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video action methods largely ignore feature semantics during feature extraction and focus on action proposals. This reduces precision for high-performance IoT applications (e.g., autonomous driving) that require robust and scalable video analytics.

Method: Introduces a generative attention-based model that captures relations among feature semantics by exploiting foreground-background differences. It jointly learns frame- and segment-level dependencies of temporal action features, leveraging semantics during feature extraction.

Result: Extensive experiments on action recognition and action detection show superiority on benchmark datasets. Validation across both tasks demonstrates robustness; code is publicly available.

Conclusion: Incorporating feature semantics via a generative attention mechanism yields more precise and scalable video analytics for IoT applications, with open-source release facilitating adoption.

Abstract: Video action analysis is a foundational technology within the realm of
intelligent video comprehension, particularly concerning its application in
Internet of Things(IoT). However, existing methodologies overlook feature
semantics in feature extraction and focus on optimizing action proposals, thus
these solutions are unsuitable for widespread adoption in high-performance IoT
applications due to the limitations in precision, such as autonomous driving,
which necessitate robust and scalable intelligent video analytics analysis. To
address this issue, we propose a novel generative attention-based model to
learn the relation of feature semantics. Specifically, by leveraging the
differences of actions' foreground and background, our model simultaneously
learns the frame- and segment-dependencies of temporal action feature
semantics, which takes advantage of feature semantics in the feature extraction
effectively. To evaluate the effectiveness of our model, we conduct extensive
experiments on two benchmark video task, action recognition and action
detection. In the context of action detection tasks, we substantiate the
superiority of our approach through comprehensive validation on widely
recognized datasets. Moreover, we extend the validation of the effectiveness of
our proposed method to a broader task, video action recognition. Our code is
available at https://github.com/Generative-Feature-Model/GAF.

*Ruixin Zhang,Jiaqing Fan,Yifan Liao,Qian Qiao,Fanzhang Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A Temporal-Conditional RVOS method that upgrades segmentation head, uses a text-to-video diffusion feature extractor, drops the noise predictor, and adds a Temporal Context Mask Refinement to achieve state-of-the-art on four RVOS benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RVOS performance hinges on segmentation head and feature extraction; existing work over-emphasizes feature modeling while neglecting boundary-aware segmentation; need simpler, more robust boundary segmentation and less randomness.

Method: Proposes Temporal-Conditional RVOS by integrating existing segmentation methods to boost boundary segmentation; uses a text-to-video diffusion model for feature extraction; removes traditional noise prediction; introduces Temporal Context Mask Refinement (TCMR) to compensate for VAE limits.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance consistently on four public RVOS benchmarks.

Conclusion: The design improves boundary segmentation and overall RVOS accuracy; simplifications (no noise predictor) reduce randomness; TCMR is effective with no added complexity.

Abstract: Referring Video Object Segmentation (RVOS) aims to segment specific objects
in a video according to textual descriptions. We observe that recent RVOS
approaches often place excessive emphasis on feature extraction and temporal
modeling, while relatively neglecting the design of the segmentation head. In
fact, there remains considerable room for improvement in segmentation head
design. To address this, we propose a Temporal-Conditional Referring Video
Object Segmentation model, which innovatively integrates existing segmentation
methods to effectively enhance boundary segmentation capability. Furthermore,
our model leverages a text-to-video diffusion model for feature extraction. On
top of this, we remove the traditional noise prediction module to avoid the
randomness of noise from degrading segmentation accuracy, thereby simplifying
the model while improving performance. Finally, to overcome the limited feature
extraction capability of the VAE, we design a Temporal Context Mask Refinement
(TCMR) module, which significantly improves segmentation quality without
introducing complex designs. We evaluate our method on four public RVOS
benchmarks, where it consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance.

### [42] [Bridging Clear and Adverse Driving Conditions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13592)
*Yoel Shapiro,Yahia Showgan,Koustav Mullick*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A hybrid domain-adaptation pipeline converts clear-weather images to adverse conditions (fog, rain, snow, night) using simulation-only, GAN-based, and diffusion-GAN methods, with auxiliary inputs and mix supervision; blending image-to-image outputs reduces artifacts; finetuned on synthetic data, achieving notable gains on ACDC (1.85 overall, 4.62 nighttime).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Adverse conditions drastically degrade autonomous driving perception and are underrepresented in datasets, making robust modeling costly. A cost-effective solution is to synthesize photorealistic adverse-condition images from labeled clear-weather data to train and evaluate perception systems.

Method: Develop multiple data-generation pipelines (simulation-only, GAN-based, and hybrid diffusion–GAN) to synthesize adverse-condition images from labeled clear images. Extend an existing domain-adaptation GAN with auxiliary inputs, and create a training recipe that uses both simulated (pixel-perfect pairs) and real images to bridge sim-to-real gap. Introduce a blending strategy to reduce hallucinations/artifacts in Stable-Diffusion img2img outputs by adaptive blending with the original images. Finetune downstream models on the synthetic data and evaluate on the Adverse Conditions Dataset with Correspondences (ACDC).

Result: The proposed hybrid approach yields measurable gains: 1.85 percentage points improvement in semantic segmentation accuracy overall, and 4.62 percentage points on nighttime scenes on ACDC, indicating improved robustness under adverse conditions.

Conclusion: A hybrid simulation–GAN–diffusion DA pipeline with adaptive blending effectively mitigates sim2real gaps and image artifacts, enabling more robust AD perception under adverse conditions. This approach demonstrates the viability of generating labeled adverse-condition data from clear-weather images and suggests potential for broader domain-adaptation tasks in autonomous driving.

Abstract: Autonomous Driving (AD) systems exhibit markedly degraded performance under
adverse environmental conditions, such as low illumination and precipitation.
The underrepresentation of adverse conditions in AD datasets makes it
challenging to address this deficiency. To circumvent the prohibitive cost of
acquiring and annotating adverse weather data, we propose a novel Domain
Adaptation (DA) pipeline that transforms clear-weather images into fog, rain,
snow, and nighttime images. Here, we systematically develop and evaluate
several novel data-generation pipelines, including simulation-only, GAN-based,
and hybrid diffusion-GAN approaches, to synthesize photorealistic adverse
images from labelled clear images. We leverage an existing DA GAN, extend it to
support auxiliary inputs, and develop a novel training recipe that leverages
both simulated and real images. The simulated images facilitate exact
supervision by providing perfectly matched image pairs, while the real images
help bridge the simulation-to-real (sim2real) gap. We further introduce a
method to mitigate hallucinations and artifacts in Stable-Diffusion
Image-to-Image (img2img) outputs by blending them adaptively with their
progenitor images. We finetune downstream models on our synthetic data and
evaluate them on the Adverse Conditions Dataset with Correspondences (ACDC). We
achieve 1.85 percent overall improvement in semantic segmentation, and 4.62
percent on nighttime, demonstrating the efficacy of our hybrid method for
robust AD perception under challenging conditions.

*Jinyoung Park,Minseok Son,Changick Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MaMe is a token-merging strategy for SSM-based vision models that improves efficiency while preserving sequential behavior, using the state-transition parameter Delta as an informativeness metric and arranging tokens to maintain information flow; demonstrates strong efficiency-accuracy trade-offs on images and extends to video and audio.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SSMs are powerful for sequential modeling in vision but are computationally heavy; token reduction can help but risks breaking sequential dynamics; a strategy tailored to SSMs is needed to maintain performance under efficient token reductions.

Method: Defines token importance via the state transition parameter Delta; designs token-merging with careful token arrangements to preserve sequential information flow; evaluates on fine-tuned and off-the-shelf models; tests generalization to video and audio.

Result: Outperforms existing token-reduction methods in efficiency-accuracy trade-offs; robust under aggressive token reduction; robust generalization across video and audio domains.

Conclusion: MaMe provides an effective, cross-domain approach to improving efficiency of SSM-based models while preserving sequential properties, with strong practical implications for deployment.

Abstract: State Space Models (SSMs) have emerged as powerful architectures in computer
vision, yet improving their computational efficiency remains crucial for
practical and scalable deployment.While token reduction serves as an effective
approach for model efficiency, applying it to SSMs requires careful
consideration of their unique sequential modeling capabilities.In this work, we
propose MaMe, a token-merging strategy tailored for SSM-based vision
models.MaMe addresses two key challenges: quantifying token importance and
preserving sequential properties. Our approach leverages the state transition
parameter $\mathbf{\Delta}$ as an informativeness measure and introduces
strategic token arrangements to preserve sequential information flow.Extensive
experiments demonstrate that MaMe achieves superior efficiency-performance
trade-offs for both fine-tuned and off-the-shelf models. Particularly, our
approach maintains robustness even under aggressive token reduction where
existing methods undergo significant performance degradation.Beyond image
classification, MaMe shows strong generalization capabilities across video and
audio domains, establishing an effective approach for enhancing efficiency in
diverse SSM applications.

*Shiyuan Chen,Wei Sui,Bohao Zhang,Zeyd Boukhers,John See,Cong Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FoundationSSC proposes dual decoupling at source and pathway levels to separately harness semantic priors and high-fidelity geometric priors for camera-based 3D SSC, using a foundation encoder, specialized decoupled pathways, hybrid view transformation, and an Axis-Aware Fusion module to fuse features, achieving state-of-the-art results on SemanticKITTI and SSCBench-KITTI-360.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SSC methods rely on a coupled encoder to jointly optimize semantic and geometric priors, forcing trade-offs and limiting performance. There is a need to decouple priors and pathways to preserve semantic context and depth quality.

Method: Introduce a foundation encoder that provides semantic priors for the semantic branch and high-fidelity stereo cost volumes for the geometric branch. Use specialized decoupled pathways to refine these priors. Apply a hybrid view transformation to generate complementary 3D features. Propose Axis-Aware Fusion to anisotropically fuse features into a unified representation.

Result: Achieves simultaneous improvements in semantic and geometric metrics, surpassing prior bests by 0.23 mIoU and 2.03 IoU on SemanticKITTI; achieves SOTA on SSCBench-KITTI-360 with 21.78 mIoU and 48.61 IoU; code to be released.

Conclusion: Dual decoupling at source and pathway levels with Axis-Aware Fusion yields disentangled, refined inputs and superior 3D SSC performance, establishing a new state-of-the-art.

Abstract: Camera-based 3D semantic scene completion (SSC) provides dense geometric and
semantic perception for autonomous driving and robotic navigation. However,
existing methods rely on a coupled encoder to deliver both semantic and
geometric priors, which forces the model to make a trade-off between
conflicting demands and limits its overall performance. To tackle these
challenges, we propose FoundationSSC, a novel framework that performs dual
decoupling at both the source and pathway levels. At the source level, we
introduce a foundation encoder that provides rich semantic feature priors for
the semantic branch and high-fidelity stereo cost volumes for the geometric
branch. At the pathway level, these priors are refined through specialised,
decoupled pathways, yielding superior semantic context and depth distributions.
Our dual-decoupling design produces disentangled and refined inputs, which are
then utilised by a hybrid view transformation to generate complementary 3D
features. Additionally, we introduce a novel Axis-Aware Fusion (AAF) module
that addresses the often-overlooked challenge of fusing these features by
anisotropically merging them into a unified representation. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the advantages of FoundationSSC, achieving simultaneous
improvements in both semantic and geometric metrics, surpassing prior bests by
+0.23 mIoU and +2.03 IoU on SemanticKITTI. Additionally, we achieve
state-of-the-art performance on SSCBench-KITTI-360, with 21.78 mIoU and 48.61
IoU. The code will be released upon acceptance.

Motivation: Fill the gap in dynamic, personalized Vlogs by enabling effective multimodal collaboration and self-correcting iteration, addressing reliance on predefined scripts.

Method: A multi-agent framework powered by Multimodal LLMs to generate high-quality prompts for multimodal content creation based on a user theme and reference image; includes a feedback and rollback mechanism for iterative self-correction; introduces ThemeVlogEval for theme-based benchmarking with standardized metrics and datasets.

Result: Experiments show significant advantages over several baselines, demonstrating effectiveness and strong potential for automated Vlog generation.

Conclusion: PersonaVlog demonstrates a viable path to automated, personalized multimodal Vlogs and provides benchmarking resources (ThemeVlogEval) to standardize evaluation and spur further research.

Abstract: With the growing demand for short videos and personalized content, automated
Video Log (Vlog) generation has become a key direction in multimodal content
creation. Existing methods mostly rely on predefined scripts, lacking dynamism
and personal expression. Therefore, there is an urgent need for an automated
Vlog generation approach that enables effective multimodal collaboration and
high personalization. To this end, we propose PersonaVlog, an automated
multimodal stylized Vlog generation framework that can produce personalized
Vlogs featuring videos, background music, and inner monologue speech based on a
given theme and reference image. Specifically, we propose a multi-agent
collaboration framework based on Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). This
framework efficiently generates high-quality prompts for multimodal content
creation based on user input, thereby improving the efficiency and creativity
of the process. In addition, we incorporate a feedback and rollback mechanism
that leverages MLLMs to evaluate and provide feedback on generated results,
thereby enabling iterative self-correction of multimodal content. We also
propose ThemeVlogEval, a theme-based automated benchmarking framework that
provides standardized metrics and datasets for fair evaluation. Comprehensive
experiments demonstrate the significant advantages and potential of our
framework over several baselines, highlighting its effectiveness and great
potential for generating automated Vlogs.

Motivation: There is increasing need for IoT-enabled, secure face mask detection for entry control, especially during the COVID-19 era, and a gap in IoT-focused face mask detection systems.

Method: A two-factor authentication system for smart entryway access control using facial recognition and passcode verification, with an automation process that alerts the owner and activates surveillance when a stranger is detected. Implemented on Raspberry Pi with Local Binary Patterns Histograms for full-face recognition and a modified LBPH for occluded-face detection; remote control and notifications are handled via Telegram.

Result: Average performance: Accuracy ~70%, Precision ~80%, Recall ~83.26% across tested users. System can perform face recognition and mask detection, automate remote control for registering users, locking/unlocking doors, and notifying the owner. High user acceptance in initial tests.

Conclusion: Demonstrates feasibility of an IoT-based, two-factor facial recognition and mask-detection system for smart entry with remote monitoring and alerting, though accuracy leaves room for improvement; suitable as a foundation for secure, automated access control in smart homes.

Abstract: Face mask detection has become increasingly important recently, particularly
during the COVID-19 pandemic. Many face detection models have been developed in
smart entryways using IoT. However, there is a lack of IoT development on face
mask detection. This paper proposes a two-factor authentication system for
smart entryway access control using facial recognition and passcode
verification and an automation process to alert the owner and activate the
surveillance system when a stranger is detected and controls the system
remotely via Telegram on a Raspberry Pi platform. The system employs the Local
Binary Patterns Histograms for the full face recognition algorithm and modified
LBPH algorithm for occluded face detection. On average, the system achieved an
Accuracy of approximately 70%, a Precision of approximately 80%, and a Recall
of approximately 83.26% across all tested users. The results indicate that the
system is capable of conducting face recognition and mask detection, automating
the operation of the remote control to register users, locking or unlocking the
door, and notifying the owner. The sample participants highly accept it for
future use in the user acceptance test.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SOTA models fail to generalize across ethnicity, language, and age due to limited, biased training data; need scale, quality, diversity to close generalization gap.

Method: A multi-stage automated pipeline filters for motion stability, aesthetic quality, facial detail to build 1244 hours from 7729 speakers; TalkVid-Bench is a 500-clip stratified, demographic-linguistic balanced test set; evaluation across datasets; code release.

Result: Models trained on TalkVid outperform those trained on previous datasets; better cross-dataset generalization; TalkVid-Bench reveals subgroup performance gaps not seen in aggregate metrics.

Conclusion: TalkVid and TalkVid-Bench advance fair, generalizable synthesis; underscore importance of demographic-aware evaluation; code and data available at GitHub.

Abstract: Audio-driven talking head synthesis has achieved remarkable photorealism, yet
state-of-the-art (SOTA) models exhibit a critical failure: they lack
generalization to the full spectrum of human diversity in ethnicity, language,
and age groups. We argue that this generalization gap is a direct symptom of
limitations in existing training data, which lack the necessary scale, quality,
and diversity. To address this challenge, we introduce TalkVid, a new
large-scale, high-quality, and diverse dataset containing 1244 hours of video
from 7729 unique speakers. TalkVid is curated through a principled, multi-stage
automated pipeline that rigorously filters for motion stability, aesthetic
quality, and facial detail, and is validated against human judgments to ensure
its reliability. Furthermore, we construct and release TalkVid-Bench, a
stratified evaluation set of 500 clips meticulously balanced across key
demographic and linguistic axes. Our experiments demonstrate that a model
trained on TalkVid outperforms counterparts trained on previous datasets,
exhibiting superior cross-dataset generalization. Crucially, our analysis on
TalkVid-Bench reveals performance disparities across subgroups that are
obscured by traditional aggregate metrics, underscoring its necessity for
future research. Code and data can be found in

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A transformer-based RGB-only method for category-level object pose estimation that uses a geometric feature-guided mechanism and RANSAC-PnP to achieve accurate poses without depth.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RGB-D methods struggle in scenes with no depth data; enabling reliable RGB-only, category-level pose estimation broadens applicability in real-world scenarios.

Method: A transformer-based network predicts and fuses geometric features of target objects; a geometric feature-guided algorithm enhances geometric representation; pose is computed with RANSAC-PnP to cope with scale variation.

Result: On benchmark datasets, the RGB-only approach achieves competitive or superior accuracy compared to prior RGB-based methods, while maintaining high efficiency.

Conclusion: RGB-only category-level pose estimation is viable and promising; the proposed components offer a new direction for pose estimation without depth data.

Abstract: While most current RGB-D-based category-level object pose estimation methods
achieve strong performance, they face significant challenges in scenes lacking
depth information. In this paper, we propose a novel category-level object pose
estimation approach that relies solely on RGB images. This method enables
accurate pose estimation in real-world scenarios without the need for depth
data. Specifically, we design a transformer-based neural network for
category-level object pose estimation, where the transformer is employed to
predict and fuse the geometric features of the target object. To ensure that
these predicted geometric features faithfully capture the object's geometry, we
introduce a geometric feature-guided algorithm, which enhances the network's
ability to effectively represent the object's geometric information. Finally,
we utilize the RANSAC-PnP algorithm to compute the object's pose, addressing
the challenges associated with variable object scales in pose estimation.
Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach is not
only highly efficient but also achieves superior accuracy compared to previous
RGB-based methods. These promising results offer a new perspective for
advancing category-level object pose estimation using RGB images.

### [49] [DiffIER: Optimizing Diffusion Models with Iterative Error Reduction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13628)
*Ao Chen,Lihe Ding,Tianfan Xue*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper identifies a training-inference gap in diffusion models with classifier-free guidance, and introduces DiffIER, an optimization-based, plug-and-play method that minimizes accumulated inference error at each step. This reduces sensitivity to guidance weight and improves conditional generation across tasks (text-to-image, image super-resolution, text-to-speech).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models with CFG are highly sensitive to the guidance weight due to a mismatch between training and inference (the training-inference gap). The paper aims to quantify this gap via accumulated inference error and to reduce it for improved conditional generation.

Method: Propose DiffIER, an optimization-based plug-and-play framework that performs iterative error minimization at every inference step to reduce accumulated error and improve generation quality. This enables stepwise optimization of errors during inference.

Result: Empirical results show DiffIER outperforms baseline methods in conditional generation and demonstrates consistent success across text-to-image generation, image super-resolution, and text-to-speech tasks, highlighting its versatility.

Conclusion: Introducing DiffIER provides a general, plug-and-play approach to mitigate training-inference gap effects in diffusion models, enhancing generation quality and robustness, with broad applicability across domains.

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in generating
high-quality samples and enhancing performance across diverse domains through
Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG). However, the quality of generated samples is
highly sensitive to the selection of the guidance weight. In this work, we
identify a critical ``training-inference gap'' and we argue that it is the
presence of this gap that undermines the performance of conditional generation
and renders outputs highly sensitive to the guidance weight. We quantify this
gap by measuring the accumulated error during the inference stage and establish
a correlation between the selection of guidance weight and minimizing this gap.
Furthermore, to mitigate this gap, we propose DiffIER, an optimization-based
method for high-quality generation. We demonstrate that the accumulated error
can be effectively reduced by an iterative error minimization at each step
during inference. By introducing this novel plug-and-play optimization
framework, we enable the optimization of errors at every single inference step
and enhance generation quality. Empirical results demonstrate that our proposed
method outperforms baseline approaches in conditional generation tasks.
Furthermore, the method achieves consistent success in text-to-image
generation, image super-resolution, and text-to-speech generation, underscoring
its versatility and potential for broad applications in future research.

Motivation: Extend virtual try-on to arbitrary wearable objects and enable mask-free, practical localization without the need for paired data; address data-collection challenges for VTON with broad object categories.

Method: Two-stage training: Stage 1 uses large-scale unpaired portraits with wearable items to train mask-free object localization by repurposing an inpainting model to place objects with an empty mask. Stage 2 fine-tunes the model with paired images to align object appearance and achieve consistency; rapid convergence observed with few paired samples.

Result: On a 12-class wearable-object benchmark (in-shop and in-the-wild), OmniTry achieves better object localization and ID-preservation than existing methods.

Conclusion: OmniTry extends VTON to diverse wearables in a practical, mask-free setting and offers strong localization and identity preservation; the authors will release code, model weights, and the evaluation benchmark.

Abstract: Virtual Try-ON (VTON) is a practical and widely-applied task, for which most
of existing works focus on clothes. This paper presents OmniTry, a unified
framework that extends VTON beyond garment to encompass any wearable objects,
e.g., jewelries and accessories, with mask-free setting for more practical
application. When extending to various types of objects, data curation is
challenging for obtaining paired images, i.e., the object image and the
corresponding try-on result. To tackle this problem, we propose a two-staged
pipeline: For the first stage, we leverage large-scale unpaired images, i.e.,
portraits with any wearable items, to train the model for mask-free
localization. Specifically, we repurpose the inpainting model to automatically
draw objects in suitable positions given an empty mask. For the second stage,
the model is further fine-tuned with paired images to transfer the consistency
of object appearance. We observed that the model after the first stage shows
quick convergence even with few paired samples. OmniTry is evaluated on a
comprehensive benchmark consisting of 12 common classes of wearable objects,
with both in-shop and in-the-wild images. Experimental results suggest that
OmniTry shows better performance on both object localization and
ID-preservation compared with existing methods. The code, model weights, and
evaluation benchmark of OmniTry will be made publicly available at

### [51] [DeH4R: A Decoupled and Hybrid Method for Road Network Graph Extraction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13669)
*Dengxian Gong,Shunping Ji*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DeH4R is a hybrid road-network extraction model that merges graph-generating and graph-growing ideas to enable dynamic vertex and edge insertions, achieving fast, topology-faithful graphs that set new SOTA on CityScale and SpaceNet, while being ~10x faster than RNGDet++. Code will be released.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Segmentation-based methods struggle to preserve road topology after vectorization. Graph-growing methods offer topological fidelity but are computationally heavy due to iterative ROI cropping. Graph-generating approaches are fast but limit dynamic vertex insertion. A hybrid approach aims to combine efficiency with topology integrity.

Method: A decoupled pipeline: candidate vertex detection, adjacent vertex prediction, initial graph construction, and graph expansion. This enables dynamic vertex (and edge) insertions during inference while maintaining fast speeds and improved topology and spatial consistency.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results on CityScale and SpaceNet. Outperforms prior SOTA RNGDet++ by 4.62 APLS and 10.18 IoU on CityScale, with approximately 10x faster inference.

Conclusion: Dynamic vertex/edge insertion through a decoupled architecture improves topology fidelity and spatial consistency without compromising speed. The approach offers a scalable path for accurate road-network graphs, with code to be released.

Abstract: The automated extraction of complete and precise road network graphs from
remote sensing imagery remains a critical challenge in geospatial computer
vision. Segmentation-based approaches, while effective in pixel-level
recognition, struggle to maintain topology fidelity after vectorization
postprocessing. Graph-growing methods build more topologically faithful graphs
but suffer from computationally prohibitive iterative ROI cropping.
Graph-generating methods first predict global static candidate road network
vertices, and then infer possible edges between vertices. They achieve fast
topology-aware inference, but limits the dynamic insertion of vertices. To
address these challenges, we propose DeH4R, a novel hybrid model that combines
graph-generating efficiency and graph-growing dynamics. This is achieved by
decoupling the task into candidate vertex detection, adjacent vertex
prediction, initial graph contruction, and graph expansion. This architectural
innovation enables dynamic vertex (edge) insertions while retaining fast
inference speed and enhancing both topology fidelity and spatial consistency.
Comprehensive evaluations on CityScale and SpaceNet benchmarks demonstrate
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. DeH4R outperforms the prior SOTA
graph-growing method RNGDet++ by 4.62 APLS and 10.18 IoU on CityScale, while
being approximately 10 $\times$ faster. The code will be made publicly
available at https://github.com/7777777FAN/DeH4R.

### [52] [HumanPCR: Probing MLLM Capabilities in Diverse Human-Centric Scenes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13692)
*Keliang Li,Hongze Shen,Hao Shi,Ruibing Hou,Hong Chang,Jie Huang,Chenghao Jia,Wen Wang,Yiling Wu,Dongmei Jiang,Shiguang Shan,Xilin Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A new evaluation suite, HumanPCR, tests MLLMs on human-related visual tasks across perception, comprehension, and reasoning; it includes 6k+ human-verified MC questions and a proctored video reasoning test with CoT rationales; evaluated on 30+ models; findings show large gaps in human-centric understanding, especially in space, time, and mind modeling, with limited gains from context scaling and test-time thinking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To push toward human-like generalization in multimodal models by focusing on human-centric visual contexts across perception, comprehension, and reasoning; existing benchmarks miss such skills and context extraction from diverse scenes.

Method: Construct three hierarchical levels (P/C/R) with large question banks; Human-P and Human-C: 6,000+ MC questions across 9 dimensions; Human-R: manually curated video reasoning requiring integration of evidence and proactive context; provide CoT rationales and key visual evidence; evaluate 30+ SOTA models; analyze failures including reliance on query-guided retrieval and benefits of scaled context/test-time thinking.

Result: Models struggle across all levels, notably in fine-grained spatial perception, temporal understanding, and mind modeling; R requires proactive evidence extraction which many models fail at; scaling context/test-time thinking offers only limited improvements.

Conclusion: HumanPCR will advance how we develop and evaluate human-centric multimodal AI, guiding better alignment with human-like understanding.

Abstract: The aspiration for artificial general intelligence, fueled by the rapid
progress of multimodal models, demands human-comparable performance across
diverse environments. We propose HumanPCR, an evaluation suite for probing
MLLMs' capacity about human-related visual contexts across three hierarchical
levels: Perception, Comprehension, and Reasoning (denoted by Human-P, Human-C,
and Human-R, respectively). Human-P and Human-C feature over 6,000
human-verified multiple choice questions, assessing massive tasks of 9
dimensions, including but not limited to essential skills frequently overlooked
by existing benchmarks. Human-R offers a challenging manually curated video
reasoning test that requires integrating multiple visual evidences, proactively
extracting context beyond question cues, and applying human-like expertise.
Each question includes human-annotated Chain-of-Thought (CoT) rationales with
key visual evidence to support further research. Extensive evaluations on over
30 state-of-the-art models exhibit significant challenges in human-centric
visual understanding, particularly in tasks involving detailed space
perception, temporal understanding, and mind modeling. Moreover, analysis of
Human-R reveals the struggle of models in extracting essential proactive visual
evidence from diverse human scenes and their faulty reliance on query-guided
retrieval. Even with advanced techniques like scaling visual contexts and
test-time thinking yield only limited benefits. We hope HumanPCR and our
findings will advance the development, evaluation, and human-centric
application of multimodal models.

### [53] [Diversity-enhanced Collaborative Mamba for Semi-supervised Medical Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13712)
*Shumeng Li,Jian Zhang,Lei Qi,Luping Zhou,Yinghuan Shi,Yang Gao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DCMamba is a diversity-enhanced semi-supervised segmentation framework based on Mamba that exploits data, network, and feature diversity to improve medical image segmentation with limited labels; it achieves a 6.69% improvement on Synapse with 20% labeled data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Annotated medical images for segmentation are expensive; semi-supervised methods using pseudo labels exist but struggle with long-range dependencies. The paper leverages Mamba's long-range modeling to explore diversity-driven semi-supervision and improve performance.

Method: Introduce DCMamba with: (1) patch-level weak-strong mixing augmented by Mamba's scanning modeling; (2) diverse-scan collaboration module leveraging prediction discrepancies from different scan directions; (3) uncertainty-weighted contrastive learning to diversify feature representations.

Result: Empirical evaluation shows DCMamba outperforms other semi-supervised medical image segmentation methods, achieving a 6.69% improvement over the latest SSM-based method on Synapse with 20% labeled data.

Conclusion: DCMamba successfully leverages data, network, and feature diversity via specialized modules to exploit long-range dependencies in semi-supervised segmentation, yielding significant performance gains on limited-label regimes.

Abstract: Acquiring high-quality annotated data for medical image segmentation is
tedious and costly. Semi-supervised segmentation techniques alleviate this
burden by leveraging unlabeled data to generate pseudo labels. Recently,
advanced state space models, represented by Mamba, have shown efficient
handling of long-range dependencies. This drives us to explore their potential
in semi-supervised medical image segmentation. In this paper, we propose a
novel Diversity-enhanced Collaborative Mamba framework (namely DCMamba) for
semi-supervised medical image segmentation, which explores and utilizes the
diversity from data, network, and feature perspectives. Firstly, from the data
perspective, we develop patch-level weak-strong mixing augmentation with
Mamba's scanning modeling characteristics. Moreover, from the network
perspective, we introduce a diverse-scan collaboration module, which could
benefit from the prediction discrepancies arising from different scanning
directions. Furthermore, from the feature perspective, we adopt an
uncertainty-weighted contrastive learning mechanism to enhance the diversity of
feature representation. Experiments demonstrate that our DCMamba significantly
outperforms other semi-supervised medical image segmentation methods, e.g.,
yielding the latest SSM-based method by 6.69% on the Synapse dataset with 20%
labeled data.

*Ali Abdari,Alex Falcon,Giuseppe Serra*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduces AgriMuseums, a dataset of 457 agricultural-themed virtual museums with textual descriptions, and a hierarchical vision-language model for retrieval via natural-language queries; achieves strong results (≈62% R@1, 78% MRR) and improves benchmarks; code released.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Organizing and retrieving educational Metaverse content is challenging; existing datasets are small, limiting training of advanced models for content retrieval.

Method: Present a new AgriMuseums dataset with textual descriptions and propose a hierarchical vision-language retrieval model that matches natural language queries to AgriMuseums.

Result: The method achieves up to about 62% R@1 and 78% MRR on AgriMuseums and provides improvements on existing benchmarks by up to 6% R@1 and 11% MRR; extensive evaluation validates design choices.

Conclusion: The dataset and model are effective for retrieving agricultural Metaverse content; code and dataset are publicly available for reproducibility.

Abstract: Every day, a large amount of educational content is uploaded online across
different areas, including agriculture and gardening. When these videos or
materials are grouped meaningfully, they can make learning easier and more
effective. One promising way to organize and enrich such content is through the
Metaverse, which allows users to explore educational experiences in an
interactive and immersive environment. However, searching for relevant
Metaverse scenarios and finding those matching users' interests remains a
challenging task. A first step in this direction has been done recently, but
existing datasets are small and not sufficient for training advanced models. In
this work, we make two main contributions: first, we introduce a new dataset
containing 457 agricultural-themed virtual museums (AgriMuseums), each enriched
with textual descriptions; and second, we propose a hierarchical
vision-language model to represent and retrieve relevant AgriMuseums using
natural language queries. In our experimental setting, the proposed method
achieves up to about 62\% R@1 and 78\% MRR, confirming its effectiveness, and
it also leads to improvements on existing benchmarks by up to 6\% R@1 and 11\%
MRR. Moreover, an extensive evaluation validates our design choices. Code and

### [55] [Enhancing Targeted Adversarial Attacks on Large Vision-Language Models through Intermediate Projector Guidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13739)
*Yiming Cao,Yanjie Li,Kaisheng Liang,Yuni Lai,Bin Xiao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: IPGA introduces an intermediate-projector attack targeting the Q-Former stage to enable fine-grained adversarial perturbations in Vision-Language Models, with Residual Query Alignment to preserve unrelated content; it improves attack effectiveness and cross-model transferability to commercial VLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current adversarial attacks on Vision-Language Models typically perturb images to maximize global similarity at the encoder level, collapsing rich visual semantics into a single vector. This limits granularity and overlook the projector (Q-Former) that bridges visual encoder and language model, hindering full alignment disruption.

Method: IPGA attacks the intermediate Q-Former stage to produce semantically meaningful visual tokens rather than a single global embedding. It uses the Q-Former pretrained on the first vision-language alignment stage without LLM fine-tuning, and introduces Residual Query Alignment (RQA) to keep unrelated content intact, enabling controlled, precise perturbations.

Result: Empirically, IPGA outperforms existing global-vector attacks on standard image captioning and fine-grained VQA tasks in black-box setups, and its perturbations transfer to multiple commercial VLMs, including Google Gemini and OpenAI GPT.

Conclusion: IPGA advances adversarial attacks by leveraging the intermediate projector to achieve finer-grained manipulation and better transferability, while RQA preserves background content, highlighting a vulnerability in the full vision-language alignment pipeline and suggesting directions for defense.

Abstract: Targeted adversarial attacks are essential for proactively identifying
security flaws in Vision-Language Models before real-world deployment. However,
current methods perturb images to maximize global similarity with the target
text or reference image at the encoder level, collapsing rich visual semantics
into a single global vector. This limits attack granularity, hindering
fine-grained manipulations such as modifying a car while preserving its
background. Furthermore, these methods largely overlook the projector module, a
critical semantic bridge between the visual encoder and the language model in
VLMs, thereby failing to disrupt the full vision-language alignment pipeline
within VLMs and limiting attack effectiveness. To address these issues, we
propose the Intermediate Projector Guided Attack (IPGA), the first method to
attack using the intermediate stage of the projector module, specifically the
widely adopted Q-Former, which transforms global image embeddings into
fine-grained visual features. This enables more precise control over
adversarial perturbations by operating on semantically meaningful visual tokens
rather than a single global representation. Specifically, IPGA leverages the
Q-Former pretrained solely on the first vision-language alignment stage,
without LLM fine-tuning, which improves both attack effectiveness and
transferability across diverse VLMs. Furthermore, we propose Residual Query
Alignment (RQA) to preserve unrelated visual content, thereby yielding more
controlled and precise adversarial manipulations. Extensive experiments show
that our attack method consistently outperforms existing methods in both
standard global image captioning tasks and fine-grained visual
question-answering tasks in black-box environment. Additionally, IPGA
successfully transfers to multiple commercial VLMs, including Google Gemini and
OpenAI GPT.

### [56] [Mitigating Cross-Image Information Leakage in LVLMs for Multi-Image Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13744)
*Yeji Park,Minyoung Lee,Sanghyuk Chun,Junsuk Choe*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FOCUS is a training-free, decoding strategy that mitigates cross-image information leakage in LVLMs by sequentially masking all but one image with noise, aggregating the resulting logits, and refining with a noise-reference to improve multi-image reasoning without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) show strong single-image performance but degrade on multi-image inputs due to entangled cues across images, causing cross-image information leakage. A training-free, architecture-agnostic remedy is highly desirable.

Method: During inference, for each target image, mask all other images with random noise, compute logits under the partially masked context, repeat for all target images, and aggregate these logits. Then apply contrastive refinement using a noise-only reference input to suppress leakage and yield improved outputs.

Result: FOCUS consistently improves multi-image reasoning performance across four benchmarks and across diverse LVLM families, without additional training or architectural changes.

Conclusion: FOCUS provides a general, practical decoding strategy to mitigate cross-image leakage in multi-image LVLMs, enabling better multi-image reasoning without fine-tuning or model modifications.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) demonstrate strong performance on
single-image tasks. However, we observe that their performance degrades
significantly when handling multi-image inputs. This occurs because visual cues
from different images become entangled in the model's output. We refer to this
phenomenon as cross-image information leakage. To address this issue, we
propose FOCUS, a training-free and architecture-agnostic decoding strategy that
mitigates cross-image information leakage during inference. FOCUS sequentially
masks all but one image with random noise, guiding the model to focus on the
single clean image. We repeat this process across all target images to obtain
logits under partially masked contexts. These logits are aggregated and then
contrastively refined using a noise-only reference input, which suppresses the
leakage and yields more accurate outputs. FOCUS consistently improves
performance across four multi-image benchmarks and diverse LVLM families. This
demonstrates that FOCUS offers a general and practical solution for enhancing
multi-image reasoning without additional training or architectural
modifications.

### [57] [Shape-from-Template with Generalised Camera](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13791)
*Agniva Sengupta,Stefan Zachow*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Presents a generalised-camera framework for non-rigid shape-from-template (SfT) using multi-view 2D keypoints and silhouette, with three approaches and convex-programming solutions; validated on synthetic and real data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extend SfT beyond single images to multi-view setups to improve reconstruction accuracy and broaden applications (e.g., medical imaging, handheld camera registration) by exploiting mutual constraints across views.

Method: Uses a generalised camera model to handle any collection of perspective or orthographic cameras. Proposes three SfT approaches: (1) keypoints lying on direction vectors from a known 3D point, (2) keypoints on direction vectors from an unknown 3D point with known orientation in a local reference frame, and (3) incorporating object silhouettes. The correspondence-based approaches are solved via convex programming, while the silhouette-based approach is an iterative refinement of the convex solutions.

Result: Demonstrates accuracy improvements and feasibility of the proposed methods on many synthetic and real datasets.

Conclusion: First set of solutions to SfT with generalized cameras; the generalized-camera framework broadens SfT applicability to arbitrary camera configurations, leveraging multi-view constraints; convex formulations provide robust solutions, with silhouette refinement further enhancing accuracy.

Abstract: This article presents a new method for non-rigidly registering a 3D shape to
2D keypoints observed by a constellation of multiple cameras. Non-rigid
registration of a 3D shape to observed 2D keypoints, i.e., Shape-from-Template
(SfT), has been widely studied using single images, but SfT with information
from multiple-cameras jointly opens new directions for extending the scope of
known use-cases such as 3D shape registration in medical imaging and
registration from hand-held cameras, to name a few. We represent such
multi-camera setup with the generalised camera model; therefore any collection
of perspective or orthographic cameras observing any deforming object can be
registered. We propose multiple approaches for such SfT: the first approach
where the corresponded keypoints lie on a direction vector from a known 3D
point in space, the second approach where the corresponded keypoints lie on a
direction vector from an unknown 3D point in space but with known orientation
w.r.t some local reference frame, and a third approach where, apart from
correspondences, the silhouette of the imaged object is also known. Together,
these form the first set of solutions to the SfT problem with generalised
cameras. The key idea behind SfT with generalised camera is the improved
reconstruction accuracy from estimating deformed shape while utilising the
additional information from the mutual constraints between multiple views of a
deformed object. The correspondence-based approaches are solved with convex
programming while the silhouette-based approach is an iterative refinement of
the results from the convex solutions. We demonstrate the accuracy of our
proposed methods on many synthetic and real data

*Jiajing Lin,Shu Jiang,Qingyuan Zeng,Zhenzhong Wang,Min Jiang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VisionLaw introduces a bilevel framework to infer interpretable intrinsic dynamics from visual observations using LLM-driven constitutive evolution and vision-guided evaluation, enabling interpretable, generalizable dynamics for interactive simulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches either rely on hand-crafted constitutive priors (limited generalization) or learn dynamics with neural nets (poor interpretability). There is a need for interpretable, generalizable intrinsic dynamics inferred directly from visuals.

Method: Upper level: use LLMs as physics expert to generate and revise constitutive laws with a decoupling mechanism to reduce search complexity. Lower level: vision-guided evaluation uses visual simulation to assess consistency between proposed laws and actual dynamics, guiding the upper-level search.

Result: Empirical results on synthetic and real-world data show VisionLaw infers interpretable intrinsic dynamics, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art methods and generalizing to novel interactive scenarios.

Conclusion: VisionLaw demonstrates a practical, interpretable framework for extracting intrinsic object dynamics from visuals, facilitating physically plausible interactive simulation.

Abstract: The intrinsic dynamics of an object governs its physical behavior in the real
world, playing a critical role in enabling physically plausible interactive
simulation with 3D assets. Existing methods have attempted to infer the
intrinsic dynamics of objects from visual observations, but generally face two
major challenges: one line of work relies on manually defined constitutive
priors, making it difficult to generalize to complex scenarios; the other
models intrinsic dynamics using neural networks, resulting in limited
interpretability and poor generalization. To address these challenges, we
propose VisionLaw, a bilevel optimization framework that infers interpretable
expressions of intrinsic dynamics from visual observations. At the upper level,
we introduce an LLMs-driven decoupled constitutive evolution strategy, where
LLMs are prompted as a knowledgeable physics expert to generate and revise
constitutive laws, with a built-in decoupling mechanism that substantially
reduces the search complexity of LLMs. At the lower level, we introduce a
vision-guided constitutive evaluation mechanism, which utilizes visual
simulation to evaluate the consistency between the generated constitutive law
and the underlying intrinsic dynamics, thereby guiding the upper-level
evolution. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate
that VisionLaw can effectively infer interpretable intrinsic dynamics from
visual observations. It significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art
methods and exhibits strong generalization for interactive simulation in novel
scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Med-CTX is a fully transformer-based multimodal framework for explainable breast ultrasound segmentation that fuses clinical radiology reports with imaging for segmentation, uncertainty, and explanations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need for accurate and interpretable AI in breast ultrasound; incorporating clinical reports (BI-RADS semantics) can boost segmentation accuracy and provide clinically grounded explanations.

Method: Dual-branch visual encoder combining ViT and Swin transformers with uncertainty-aware fusion. Clinical language (BI-RADS semantics) encoded by BioClinicalBERT is integrated via cross-modal attention to produce segmentation masks, uncertainty maps, and diagnostic rationales.

Result: On the BUS-BRA dataset, Dice 99% and IoU 95%, outperforming U‑Net, ViT, and Swin baselines. Ablation shows a 5.4 percentage point drop in Dice and 31% drop in CIDEr without clinical text. Multimodal alignment (CLIP score 85%) and better confidence calibration (ECE 3.2%).

Conclusion: A transformer-based multimodal approach that leverages clinical text with imaging improves segmentation accuracy and explainability, achieving strong performance and calibrated confidence, setting a new benchmark for trustworthy multimodal medical AI.

Abstract: We introduce Med-CTX, a fully transformer based multimodal framework for
explainable breast cancer ultrasound segmentation. We integrate clinical
radiology reports to boost both performance and interpretability. Med-CTX
achieves exact lesion delineation by using a dual-branch visual encoder that
combines ViT and Swin transformers, as well as uncertainty aware fusion.
Clinical language structured with BI-RADS semantics is encoded by
BioClinicalBERT and combined with visual features utilising cross-modal
attention, allowing the model to provide clinically grounded, model generated
explanations. Our methodology generates segmentation masks, uncertainty maps,
and diagnostic rationales all at once, increasing confidence and transparency
in computer assisted diagnosis. On the BUS-BRA dataset, Med-CTX achieves a Dice
score of 99% and an IoU of 95%, beating existing baselines U-Net, ViT, and
Swin. Clinical text plays a key role in segmentation accuracy and explanation
quality, as evidenced by ablation studies that show a -5.4% decline in Dice
score and -31% in CIDEr. Med-CTX achieves good multimodal alignment (CLIP
score: 85%) and increased confi dence calibration (ECE: 3.2%), setting a new
bar for trustworthy, multimodal medical architecture.

### [60] [Timestep-Compressed Attack on Spiking Neural Networks through Timestep-Level Backpropagation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13812)
*Donghwa Kang,Doohyun Kim,Sang-Ki Ko,Jinkyu Lee,Hyeongboo Baek,Brent ByungHoon Kang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Timestep-compressed attack (TCA) reduces latency of gradient-based adversarial attacks on spiking neural networks by exploiting timestep-level backpropagation and membrane potential reuse, maintaining attack effectiveness with substantial latency reductions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current SOTA SNN attacks extend ANN FGSM/PGD frameworks and incur high latency due to multi-timestep processing, hindering real-time applicability; a SNN-aware attack could address this inefficiency.

Method: Introduce TCA with two components: (i) timestep-level backpropagation (TLBP) for per-timestep perturbation generation and early stopping, and (ii) adversarial membrane potential reuse (A-MPR) to pre-calculate and reuse warm-up membrane potential; evaluated on VGG-11 and ResNet-17 with CIFAR-10/100 and CIFAR10-DVS datasets.

Result: Latency reduced by up to 56.6% (white-box) and 57.1% (black-box) compared to SOTA, while achieving comparable attack success rates.

Conclusion: TCA demonstrates that exploiting intrinsic SNN properties (temporal dynamics and membrane potential warm-up) enables much faster gradient-based adversarial attacks without sacrificing effectiveness, suggesting a promising direction for real-time adversarial scenarios and SNN-aware attack design.

Abstract: State-of-the-art (SOTA) gradient-based adversarial attacks on spiking neural
networks (SNNs), which largely rely on extending FGSM and PGD frameworks, face
a critical limitation: substantial attack latency from multi-timestep
processing, rendering them infeasible for practical real-time applications.
This inefficiency stems from their design as direct extensions of ANN
paradigms, which fail to exploit key SNN properties. In this paper, we propose
the timestep-compressed attack (TCA), a novel framework that significantly
reduces attack latency. TCA introduces two components founded on key insights
into SNN behavior. First, timestep-level backpropagation (TLBP) is based on our
finding that global temporal information in backpropagation to generate
perturbations is not critical for an attack's success, enabling per-timestep
evaluation for early stopping. Second, adversarial membrane potential reuse
(A-MPR) is motivated by the observation that initial timesteps are
inefficiently spent accumulating membrane potential, a warm-up phase that can
be pre-calculated and reused. Our experiments on VGG-11 and ResNet-17 with the
CIFAR-10/100 and CIFAR10-DVS datasets show that TCA significantly reduces the
required attack latency by up to 56.6% and 57.1% compared to SOTA methods in
white-box and black-box settings, respectively, while maintaining a comparable
attack success rate.

*Diaa Addeen Abuhani,Marco Seccaroni,Martina Mazzarello,Imran Zualkernan,Fabio Duarte,Carlo Ratti*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Unsupervised clustering of street imagery embeddings with spatial planting data enables label-free estimation of urban biodiversity, closely matching ground-truth diversity indices across eight North American cities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Field inventories are accurate but expensive; supervised AI needs labeled data that often fails to generalize across regions; need scalable, generalizable, label-free biodiversity monitoring to support equitable urban greenery.

Method: An unsupervised clustering framework that fuses visual embeddings from street-level images with spatial planting patterns to estimate genus-level biodiversity without labels; evaluated against Shannon and Simpson indices using Wasserstein distance and checked for spatial autocorrelation.

Result: Achieves low Wasserstein distances to ground-truth indices for Shannon and Simpson, preserves spatial autocorrelation, and recovers genus-level diversity patterns across eight cities.

Conclusion: Provides a scalable, fine-grained approach for biodiversity mapping in cities lacking inventories, enabling low-cost, continuous monitoring to inform equitable access to greenery and adaptive urban ecosystem management.

Abstract: Urban tree biodiversity is critical for climate resilience, ecological
stability, and livability in cities, yet most municipalities lack detailed
knowledge of their canopies. Field-based inventories provide reliable estimates
of Shannon and Simpson diversity but are costly and time-consuming, while
supervised AI methods require labeled data that often fail to generalize across
regions. We introduce an unsupervised clustering framework that integrates
visual embeddings from street-level imagery with spatial planting patterns to
estimate biodiversity without labels. Applied to eight North American cities,
the method recovers genus-level diversity patterns with high fidelity,
achieving low Wasserstein distances to ground truth for Shannon and Simpson
indices and preserving spatial autocorrelation. This scalable, fine-grained
approach enables biodiversity mapping in cities lacking detailed inventories
and offers a pathway for continuous, low-cost monitoring to support equitable
access to greenery and adaptive management of urban ecosystems.

### [62] [Self-Aware Adaptive Alignment: Enabling Accurate Perception for Intelligent Transportation Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13823)
*Tong Xiang,Hongxia Zhao,Fenghua Zhu,Yuanyuan Chen,Yisheng Lv*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SA3 proposes a self-aware adaptive alignment framework for cross-domain Intelligent Transportation detection, using attention-guided image-level alignment and an instance-to-image alignment module to bridge domain gaps, achieving state-of-the-art results on benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper targets cross-domain detection challenges in Intelligent Transportation systems, where domain shifts between datasets hinder performance; an efficient alignment strategy is needed to align features across domains.

Method: Introduce SA3: an attention-based alignment module trained on source and target domains to guide image-level feature alignment for local-global adaptive alignment. Channel re-weighting of features from both domains feeds into the region proposal network to extract salient region features. An instance-to-image level alignment module specific to the target domain further mitigates the domain gap.

Result: Extensive experiments on popular cross-domain object detection benchmarks show SA3 achieves superior results compared to previous state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: SA3 provides an effective cross-domain adaptation mechanism for Intelligent Transportation detection by combining local-global adaptive alignment with a target-specific instance-to-image alignment, delivering improved cross-domain performance.

Abstract: Achieving top-notch performance in Intelligent Transportation detection is a
critical research area. However, many challenges still need to be addressed
when it comes to detecting in a cross-domain scenario. In this paper, we
propose a Self-Aware Adaptive Alignment (SA3), by leveraging an efficient
alignment mechanism and recognition strategy. Our proposed method employs a
specified attention-based alignment module trained on source and target domain
datasets to guide the image-level features alignment process, enabling the
local-global adaptive alignment between the source domain and target domain.
Features from both domains, whose channel importance is re-weighted, are fed
into the region proposal network, which facilitates the acquisition of salient
region features. Also, we introduce an instance-to-image level alignment module
specific to the target domain to adaptively mitigate the domain gap. To
evaluate the proposed method, extensive experiments have been conducted on
popular cross-domain object detection benchmarks. Experimental results show
that SA3 achieves superior results to the previous state-of-the-art methods.

*Paul Grimal,Michaël Soumm,Hervé Le Borgne,Olivier Ferret,Akihiro Sugimoto*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A training-free method to enhance prompt fidelity in text-to-image diffusion by learning a high-success-rate, prompt-conditioned distribution that explicitly models the denoising signal, enabling fine-grained control and optional spatial conditioning, and compatible with diffusion/flow architectures; outperforms SOTA.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current state-of-the-art text-to-image models often struggle with precise alignment to prompts, missing critical elements or inadvertently blending distinct concepts. A training-free, flexible approach is needed to improve fidelity and spatial alignment without sacrificing compatibility.

Method: Introduce a training-free framework that learns a high-success-rate signal distribution conditioned on the target prompt; explicitly model the signal component during the denoising process for fine-grained control; supports additional conditioning modalities (e.g., bounding boxes); integrates with both diffusion and flow-matching architectures; mitigates over-optimization and out-of-distribution artifacts.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms current state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The approach yields improved prompt fidelity and spatial alignment without additional training, is compatible with existing diffusion/flow architectures, and supports flexible conditioning; code is released for reproducibility.

Abstract: State-of-the-art text-to-image models produce visually impressive results but
often struggle with precise alignment to text prompts, leading to missing
critical elements or unintended blending of distinct concepts. We propose a
novel approach that learns a high-success-rate distribution conditioned on a
target prompt, ensuring that generated images faithfully reflect the
corresponding prompts. Our method explicitly models the signal component during
the denoising process, offering fine-grained control that mitigates
over-optimization and out-of-distribution artifacts. Moreover, our framework is
training-free and seamlessly integrates with both existing diffusion and flow
matching architectures. It also supports additional conditioning modalities --
such as bounding boxes -- for enhanced spatial alignment. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our approach outperforms current state-of-the-art methods. The

*Daniele Corradetti,José Delgado Rodrigues*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A multi-agent AI system (Id-Pattern) within RED.AI uses five specialized agents to diagnose stone deterioration from visual images, achieving substantial improvements over a baseline model on 28 challenging cases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional expert-based stone deterioration assessment is accurate but costly in time and resources; automating diagnosis with AI can accelerate decisions and reduce costs while maintaining quality.

Method: A cognitive architecture coordinates five agents (lithologist, pathologist, environmental expert, conservator-restorer, diagnostic coordinator) to diagnose stone pathologies from visual evidence; evaluation on 28 difficult images with multiple deterioration patterns, comparing against a foundational model.

Result: The system showed huge boosts on all metrics relative to the foundational model.

Conclusion: A multi-agent AI approach to automating stone pathology diagnosis from visual evidence is effective and promising for reducing time/resources in conservation work; results are encouraging though details on metrics are not specified.

Abstract: The Id-Pattern system within the RED.AI project (Reabilita\c{c}\~ao
Estrutural Digital atrav\'es da AI) consists of an agentic system designed to
assist in the identification of stone deterioration patterns. Traditional
methodologies, based on direct observation by expert teams, are accurate but
costly in terms of time and resources. The system developed here introduces and
evaluates a multi-agent artificial intelligence (AI) system, designed to
simulate collaboration between experts and automate the diagnosis of stone
pathologies from visual evidence. The approach is based on a cognitive
architecture that orchestrates a team of specialized AI agents which, in this
specific case, are limited to five: a lithologist, a pathologist, an
environmental expert, a conservator-restorer, and a diagnostic coordinator. To
evaluate the system we selected 28 difficult images involving multiple
deterioration patterns. Our first results showed a huge boost on all metrics of
our system compared to the foundational model.

### [65] [RICO: Two Realistic Benchmarks and an In-Depth Analysis for Incremental Learning in Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13878)
*Matthias Neuwirth-Trapp,Maarten Bieshaar,Danda Pani Paudel,Luc Van Gool*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Realistic Incremental Object Detection Benchmarks (RICO) with D-RICO (domain shifts, fixed classes) and EC-RICO (domain and class growth) reveal IL methods lag behind storage of old knowledge and adaptation to new domains; small replay buffers beat IL methods; full-data training remains superior; public code forthcoming.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current IL research relies on synthetic benchmarks, which may not reflect real-world performance. The paper introduces realistic benchmarks to evaluate adaptability and retention under domain shifts and class expansion, highlighting gaps and guiding future IL methods.

Method: Construct two benchmarks from 14 diverse datasets covering real and synthetic domains with varying conditions (weather, time of day), sensors, perspectives, and labeling policies. D-RICO fixes the class set across steps; EC-RICO expands both domains and classes per IL step. Evaluate standard IL methods with and without replay of limited previous data; compare to training on all data. Analyze causes of performance gaps (distillation, model capacity for diverse tasks, plasticity).

Result: All IL methods underperform in adaptability and retention on both benchmarks. Replaying a small amount of previous data already outperforms all IL methods, while training on the full dataset remains superior.

Conclusion: Gaps are attributed to weak teachers in distillation, single-model limitations with diverse tasks, and insufficient plasticity. The work suggests the need for improved IL techniques and realistic evaluation protocols; code will be publicly available.

Abstract: Incremental Learning (IL) trains models sequentially on new data without full
retraining, offering privacy, efficiency, and scalability. IL must balance
adaptability to new data with retention of old knowledge. However, evaluations
often rely on synthetic, simplified benchmarks, obscuring real-world IL
performance. To address this, we introduce two Realistic Incremental Object
Detection Benchmarks (RICO): Domain RICO (D-RICO) features domain shifts with a
fixed class set, and Expanding-Classes RICO (EC-RICO) integrates new domains
and classes per IL step. Built from 14 diverse datasets covering real and
synthetic domains, varying conditions (e.g., weather, time of day), camera
sensors, perspectives, and labeling policies, both benchmarks capture
challenges absent in existing evaluations. Our experiments show that all IL
methods underperform in adaptability and retention, while replaying a small
amount of previous data already outperforms all methods. However, individual
training on the data remains superior. We heuristically attribute this gap to
weak teachers in distillation, single models' inability to manage diverse
tasks, and insufficient plasticity. Our code will be made publicly available.

### [66] [In-hoc Concept Representations to Regularise Deep Learning in Medical Imaging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13880)
*Valentina Corbetta,Floris Six Dijkstra,Regina Beets-Tan,Hoel Kervadec,Kristoffer Wickstrøm,Wilson Silva*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LCRReg is a latent-concept regularization technique that uses latent concept representations to steer CNNs toward semantically meaningful features, requiring only a small auxiliary dataset to synthesize concept examples; it improves robustness to spurious correlations and OOD in medical imaging, is architecture-agnostic, and does not require dense concept labels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical imaging models often rely on spurious correlations and fail under distribution shifts; there is a need for semantically grounded representations that generalize beyond the training distribution.

Method: Introduce LCRReg, which extracts latent concept representations (LCRs) (e.g., CAVs) for predefined concepts. Use a small auxiliary dataset to synthesize high-quality, disentangled concept examples. Add a regularization term that encourages the CNN to activate latent subspaces corresponding to the chosen concepts, without requiring concept labels in the main training data. Evaluate on synthetic datasets and diabetic retinopathy (binary classification) under synthetic spurious perturbations and OOD tests; compare to multitask, linear probing, and post-hoc methods.

Result: LCRReg improves robustness to injected spurious correlations on a toy dataset and remains effective in multi-concept and multiclass settings; in diabetic retinopathy classification, it improves performance under synthetic perturbations and OOD generalization; it surpasses baselines on robustness while remaining lightweight and architecture-agnostic.

Conclusion: LCRReg provides a lightweight, architecture-agnostic regularization approach that enhances robustness to distribution shifts without dense concept supervision, with code available for implementation.

Abstract: Deep learning models in medical imaging often achieve strong in-distribution
performance but struggle to generalise under distribution shifts, frequently
relying on spurious correlations instead of clinically meaningful features. We
introduce LCRReg, a novel regularisation approach that leverages Latent Concept
Representations (LCRs) (e.g., Concept Activation Vectors (CAVs)) to guide
models toward semantically grounded representations. LCRReg requires no concept
labels in the main training set and instead uses a small auxiliary dataset to
synthesise high-quality, disentangled concept examples. We extract LCRs for
predefined relevant features, and incorporate a regularisation term that guides
a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to activate within latent subspaces
associated with those concepts. We evaluate LCRReg across synthetic and
real-world medical tasks. On a controlled toy dataset, it significantly
improves robustness to injected spurious correlations and remains effective
even in multi-concept and multiclass settings. On the diabetic retinopathy
binary classification task, LCRReg enhances performance under both synthetic
spurious perturbations and out-of-distribution (OOD) generalisation. Compared
to baselines, including multitask learning, linear probing, and post-hoc
concept-based models, LCRReg offers a lightweight, architecture-agnostic
strategy for improving model robustness without requiring dense concept
supervision. Code is available at the following link:

*Taimur Khan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ConvLSTM-based forecast of Aerosol Index using Sentinel-5P data to predict aerosol events five days ahead; achieved MSE ~0.0018, loss ~0.3995, SSIM ~0.74, indicating spatial-temporal capture albeit with room for improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable real-time regional forecasting of smog and high aerosol events in the Indo-Gangetic Plains, addressing socio-economic impacts and rising emission sources (crop burning, vehicles) amid shifting weather patterns; a regional forecast system is lacking.

Method: Train a ConvLSTM neural network on Sentinel-5P aerosol-related data from 2019–2023, using UV Aerosol Index (340–380 nm) as the predictor to forecast aerosol events at five-day intervals, capturing spatial and temporal correlations more effectively than prior models.

Result: The model forecasts the Aerosol Index at five-day intervals with Mean Squared Error ~0.0018, loss ~0.3995, and SSIM ~0.74, demonstrating effective spatio-temporal prediction though not yet perfect.

Conclusion: The approach is promising for regional smog forecasting but could be improved by integrating additional data sources and refining the network architecture to enhance accuracy and robustness.

Abstract: The South Asian Smog refers to the recurring annual air pollution events
marked by high contaminant levels, reduced visibility, and significant
socio-economic impacts, primarily affecting the Indo-Gangetic Plains (IGP) from
November to February. Over the past decade, increased air pollution sources
such as crop residue burning, motor vehicles, and changing weather patterns
have intensified these smog events. However, real-time forecasting systems for
increased particulate matter concentrations are still not established at
regional scale. The Aerosol Index, closely tied to smog formation and a key
component in calculating the Air Quality Index (AQI), reflects particulate
matter concentrations. This study forecasts aerosol events using Sentinel-5P
air constituent data (2019-2023) and a Convolutional Long-Short Term Memory
(ConvLSTM) neural network, which captures spatial and temporal correlations
more effectively than previous models. Using the Ultraviolet (UV) Aerosol Index
at 340-380 nm as the predictor, results show the Aerosol Index can be
forecasted at five-day intervals with a Mean Squared Error of ~0.0018, loss of
~0.3995, and Structural Similarity Index of ~0.74. While effective, the model
can be improved by integrating additional data and refining its architecture.

### [68] [SCRNet: Spatial-Channel Regulation Network for Medical Ultrasound Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13899)
*Weixin Xu,Ziliang Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A UNet-based SCRNet uses a Feature Aggregation Module (FAM) with Convolution and Cross-Attention Parallel Module (CCAPM) and a Spatial-Channel Regulation Module (SCRM) to jointly capture long-range and local information, achieving state-of-the-art ultrasound image segmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome CNNs' limited modeling of long-range dependencies and Transformers' potential neglect of local context in medical ultrasound segmentation.

Method: Two input features from the preceding layer are processed through two CCAPM branches within FAM, enabling complementary roles and strong inter-feature connections. FAM is integrated into SCRM to enhance salient-region and informative-feature emphasis, and SCRM is inserted into the encoder blocks of a UNet to form the SCRNet architecture.

Result: Extensive experiments show SCRNet achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing methods on ultrasound image segmentation.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively fuses convolutional and cross-attention mechanisms through FAM and SCRM, enabling simultaneous capture of local and long-range dependencies and improving salient feature awareness within a UNet framework.

Abstract: Medical ultrasound image segmentation presents a formidable challenge in the
realm of computer vision. Traditional approaches rely on Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNNs) and Transformer-based methods to address the intricacies of
medical image segmentation. Nevertheless, inherent limitations persist, as
CNN-based methods tend to disregard long-range dependencies, while
Transformer-based methods may overlook local contextual information. To address
these deficiencies, we propose a novel Feature Aggregation Module (FAM)
designed to process two input features from the preceding layer. These features
are seamlessly directed into two branches of the Convolution and
Cross-Attention Parallel Module (CCAPM) to endow them with different roles in
each of the two branches to help establish a strong connection between the two
input features. This strategy enables our module to focus concurrently on both
long-range dependencies and local contextual information by judiciously merging
convolution operations with cross-attention mechanisms. Moreover, by
integrating FAM within our proposed Spatial-Channel Regulation Module (SCRM),
the ability to discern salient regions and informative features warranting
increased attention is enhanced. Furthermore, by incorporating the SCRM into
the encoder block of the UNet architecture, we introduce a novel framework
dubbed Spatial-Channel Regulation Network (SCRNet). The results of our
extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of SCRNet, which consistently
achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance compared to existing methods.

*Chunji Lv,Zequn Chen,Donglin Di,Weinan Zhang,Hao Li,Wei Chen,Changsheng Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PhysGM presents a fast, feed-forward framework that predicts a 3D Gaussian representation and its physical properties from a single image to enable immediate 4D rendering and physics simulation, using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) instead of SDS and introducing the PhysAssets dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current physics-grounded 3D motion synthesis relies on pre-reconstructed 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) representations and either inflexible manual physical attributes or optimization-heavy guidance from video models, leading to slow, brittle pipelines. There is a need for end-to-end, fast, physically plausible synthesis from minimal input (a single image).

Method: Train a base model to jointly optimize Gaussian reconstruction and probabilistic physics prediction from a single image. Refine with physically plausible reference videos to improve rendering fidelity and physics accuracy. Use Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to align simulations with reference videos, avoiding backprop through differentiable simulation/rasterization (SDS). Introduce PhysAssets, a dataset of 24k+ 3D assets annotated with physical properties and guiding videos.

Result: The approach enables high-fidelity 4D simulations and rendering from a single image in about one minute, achieving substantial speedups over prior methods while maintaining realistic results.

Conclusion: PhysGM offers a fast, end-to-end, physics-aware 3D motion synthesis pipeline from a single image, backed by a large annotated asset dataset and DPO-based training to sidestep SDS, paving the way for practical, real-time-like 4D content generation.

Abstract: While physics-grounded 3D motion synthesis has seen significant progress,
current methods face critical limitations. They typically rely on
pre-reconstructed 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) representations, while physics
integration depends on either inflexible, manually defined physical attributes
or unstable, optimization-heavy guidance from video models. To overcome these
challenges, we introduce PhysGM, a feed-forward framework that jointly predicts
a 3D Gaussian representation and its physical properties from a single image,
enabling immediate, physical simulation and high-fidelity 4D rendering. We
first establish a base model by jointly optimizing for Gaussian reconstruction
and probabilistic physics prediction. The model is then refined with physically
plausible reference videos to enhance both rendering fidelity and physics
prediction accuracy. We adopt the Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to align
its simulations with reference videos, circumventing Score Distillation
Sampling (SDS) optimization which needs back-propagating gradients through the
complex differentiable simulation and rasterization. To facilitate the
training, we introduce a new dataset PhysAssets of over 24,000 3D assets,
annotated with physical properties and corresponding guiding videos.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method effectively generates
high-fidelity 4D simulations from a single image in one minute. This represents
a significant speedup over prior works while delivering realistic rendering
results. Our project page is at:https://hihixiaolv.github.io/PhysGM.github.io/

### [70] [DIME-Net: A Dual-Illumination Adaptive Enhancement Network Based on Retinex and Mixture-of-Experts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13921)
*Ziang Wang,Xiaoqin Wang,Dingyi Wang,Qiang Li,Shushan Qiao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DIME-Net offers a unified dual-illumination enhancement framework using a sparse-gated Mixture-of-Experts to adaptively enhance both low-light and backlit images, guided by Retinex theory, with a damage-restoration module using advanced attention, trained on a hybrid MixBL dataset, achieving competitive results without retraining across diverse lighting conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world images experience diverse lighting (low-light and backlit) that degrade image quality and hinder vision tasks. Existing methods typically handle a single degradation type and lack a unified approach; there is a need for robust, adaptable enhancement under varied illumination.

Method: Proposes DIME-Net, a dual-illumination enhancement framework. Central component is a Mixture-of-Experts illumination estimator with a sparse gating mechanism that adaptively selects S-curve expert networks based on input illumination. Integrates Retinex theory for enhancement tailored to both low-light and backlit images. Includes a damage restoration module with Illumination-Aware Cross Attention and Sequential-State Global Attention to correct artifacts and color distortions. Builds MixBL, a hybrid illumination dataset for single-training robustness. Demonstrates competitive performance on synthetic and real-world low-light/backlit datasets without retraining.

Result: DIME-Net achieves competitive performance on both synthetic and real-world low-light and backlit datasets without retraining, indicating strong generalization and robustness to diverse illumination conditions.

Conclusion: A unified framework combining adaptive dual-illumination enhancement with attention-based artifact correction and a hybrid training set can effectively handle diverse lighting scenarios, offering practical applicability for multimedia tasks under varied illumination.

Abstract: Image degradation caused by complex lighting conditions such as low-light and
backlit scenarios is commonly encountered in real-world environments,
significantly affecting image quality and downstream vision tasks. Most
existing methods focus on a single type of illumination degradation and lack
the ability to handle diverse lighting conditions in a unified manner. To
address this issue, we propose a dual-illumination enhancement framework called
DIME-Net. The core of our method is a Mixture-of-Experts illumination estimator
module, where a sparse gating mechanism adaptively selects suitable S-curve
expert networks based on the illumination characteristics of the input image.
By integrating Retinex theory, this module effectively performs enhancement
tailored to both low-light and backlit images. To further correct
illumination-induced artifacts and color distortions, we design a damage
restoration module equipped with Illumination-Aware Cross Attention and
Sequential-State Global Attention mechanisms. In addition, we construct a
hybrid illumination dataset, MixBL, by integrating existing datasets, allowing
our model to achieve robust illumination adaptability through a single training
process. Experimental results show that DIME-Net achieves competitive
performance on both synthetic and real-world low-light and backlit datasets
without any retraining. These results demonstrate its generalization ability
and potential for practical multimedia applications under diverse and complex
illumination conditions.

*Andrea Atzori,Fadi Boutros,Naser Damer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ViT-FIQA uses a learnable quality token with a ViT backbone to predict face image utility; achieves state-of-the-art performance across FR models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CNN-based FIQA methods dominate, but Vision Transformers offer richer contextual modeling. The work investigates ViTs for FIQA to predict a scalar utility score.

Method: Extend a standard ViT backbone by adding a learnable quality token that is concatenated with patch tokens and processed by global self-attention. The backbone branches into two heads: (1) patch-token features fed to a margin-penalty softmax loss to learn discriminative face representations; (2) the quality token fed to a regression head to predict the image utility.

Result: Extensive experiments on challenging benchmarks and across multiple FR models (CNN- and ViT-based) show ViT-FIQA achieves top-tier performance, highlighting the effectiveness of transformer-based architectures for modeling face image utility.

Conclusion: Transformers are effective foundations for FIQA; ViT-FIQA demonstrates strong, scalable performance and motivates further ViT-based FIQA research.

Abstract: Face Image Quality Assessment (FIQA) aims to predict the utility of a face
image for face recognition (FR) systems. State-of-the-art FIQA methods mainly
rely on convolutional neural networks (CNNs), leaving the potential of Vision
Transformer (ViT) architectures underexplored. This work proposes ViT-FIQA, a
novel approach that extends standard ViT backbones, originally optimized for
FR, through a learnable quality token designed to predict a scalar utility
score for any given face image. The learnable quality token is concatenated
with the standard image patch tokens, and the whole sequence is processed via
global self-attention by the ViT encoders to aggregate contextual information
across all patches. At the output of the backbone, ViT-FIQA branches into two
heads: (1) the patch tokens are passed through a fully connected layer to learn
discriminative face representations via a margin-penalty softmax loss, and (2)
the quality token is fed into a regression head to learn to predict the face
sample's utility. Extensive experiments on challenging benchmarks and several
FR models, including both CNN- and ViT-based architectures, demonstrate that
ViT-FIQA consistently achieves top-tier performance. These results underscore
the effectiveness of transformer-based architectures in modeling face image
utility and highlight the potential of ViTs as a scalable foundation for future
FIQA research https://cutt.ly/irHlzXUC.

### [72] [RotBench: Evaluating Multimodal Large Language Models on Identifying Image Rotation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13968)
*Tianyi Niu,Jaemin Cho,Elias Stengel-Eskin,Mohit Bansal*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RotBench is a 350-image benchmark evaluating how well Multimodal LLMs identify image rotation (0°, 90°, 180°, 270°); results show current models struggle to distinguish 90° vs 270°, with only some handling 0° and 180°, and limited gains from prompts or auxiliary data; fine-tuning helps 180° but not 90°/270°, revealing a gap to human spatial perception.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To probe the spatial orientation and rotational reasoning robustness of Multimodal LLMs, and to quantify the gap between model capability and human perception in image orientation tasks.

Method: Introduce RotBench, a manually filtered 350-image dataset spanning lifestyle, portrait, and landscape. Evaluate multiple open and proprietary MLLMs (e.g., GPT-5, o3, Gemini-2.5-Pro) under various prompting regimes (with/without captions, depth maps, chain-of-thought) and prompting setups (multi-orientation display, voting). Also assess effects of fine-tuning on rotation discrimination.

Result: Most models reliably identify right-side-up (0°); some identify upside-down (180°. 90°/270° are rarely distinguished. Providing auxiliary information or chain-of-thought prompts yields small/inconsistent gains. Multi-orientation displays yield moderate gains for reasoning models; voting helps weaker models. Fine-tuning improves 180° identification but not 90°/270°. Overall, a notable gap remains between MLLMs and human spatial perception in rotation recognition.

Conclusion: There is a substantial gap between current MLLMs' spatial reasoning for rotation and human perception, indicating the need for improved training or architectural strategies to achieve robust orientation understanding.

Abstract: We investigate to what extent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) can
accurately identify the orientation of input images rotated 0{\deg}, 90{\deg},
180{\deg}, and 270{\deg}. This task demands robust visual reasoning
capabilities to detect rotational cues and contextualize spatial relationships
within images, regardless of their orientation. To evaluate MLLMs on these
abilities, we introduce RotBench -- a 350-image manually-filtered benchmark
comprising lifestyle, portrait, and landscape images. Despite the relatively
simple nature of this task, we show that several state-of-the-art open and
proprietary MLLMs, including GPT-5, o3, and Gemini-2.5-Pro, do not reliably
identify rotation in input images. Providing models with auxiliary information
-- including captions, depth maps, and more -- or using chain-of-thought
prompting offers only small and inconsistent improvements. Our results indicate
that most models are able to reliably identify right-side-up (0{\deg}) images,
while certain models are able to identify upside-down (180{\deg}) images. None
can reliably distinguish between 90{\deg} and 270{\deg}. Simultaneously showing
the image rotated in different orientations leads to moderate performance gains
for reasoning models, while a modified setup using voting improves the
performance of weaker models. We further show that fine-tuning does not improve
models' ability to distinguish 90{\deg} and 270{\deg} rotations, despite
substantially improving the identification of 180{\deg} images. Together, these
results reveal a significant gap between MLLMs' spatial reasoning capabilities
and human perception in identifying rotation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current depth datasets (KITTI, nuScenes, DDAD) struggle with diversity and scalability, and benchmark performance is approaching saturation. A new large-scale, diverse, cost-efficient dataset is needed to support foundation-model-era depth estimation and multi-modal learning in dynamic outdoor scenes.

Method: A large-scale, frame-wise continuous dataset for depth estimation in dynamic outdoor driving environments, comprising 20k video frames. A lightweight acquisition pipeline provides broad scene coverage at low cost, with sparse yet statistically sufficient ground truth to enable robust training. The dataset emphasizes diversity of driving scenarios and lower depth density.

Result: Benchmark experiments using standard monocular depth estimation models validate the dataset's utility and reveal substantial performance gaps in challenging conditions, demonstrating its potential as a new platform for advancing depth estimation research.

Conclusion: The dataset offers greater diversity and lower depth density, creating new generalization challenges and supporting progress toward depth estimation in real-world driving, aligning with the needs of foundation-model-era research.

Abstract: Depth estimation is a fundamental task for 3D scene understanding in
autonomous driving, robotics, and augmented reality. Existing depth datasets,
such as KITTI, nuScenes, and DDAD, have advanced the field but suffer from
limitations in diversity and scalability. As benchmark performance on these
datasets approaches saturation, there is an increasing need for a new
generation of large-scale, diverse, and cost-efficient datasets to support the
era of foundation models and multi-modal learning. To address these challenges,
we introduce a large-scale, diverse, frame-wise continuous dataset for depth
estimation in dynamic outdoor driving environments, comprising 20K video frames
to evaluate existing methods. Our lightweight acquisition pipeline ensures
broad scene coverage at low cost, while sparse yet statistically sufficient
ground truth enables robust training. Compared to existing datasets, ours
presents greater diversity in driving scenarios and lower depth density,
creating new challenges for generalization. Benchmark experiments with standard
monocular depth estimation models validate the dataset's utility and highlight
substantial performance gaps in challenging conditions, establishing a new
platform for advancing depth estimation research.

*Aayush Rana,Akash Kumar,Vibhav Vineet,Yogesh S Rawat*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes cost-efficient annotation for spatio-temporal video action detection by selecting annotation types per video via active learning and generating pseudo-labels from 3D superpixels, achieving large annotation savings with minimal accuracy loss on UCF101-24 and JHMDB-21.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dense spatio-temporal annotations are expensive; real-world videos vary in difficulty and may not require uniform labeling; enabling learning from mixed annotation types could reduce labeling effort while maintaining performance.

Method: 1) Active learning to estimate the needed annotation type per video (video-level tags, points, scribbles, bounding boxes, masks). 2) Build a 3D-spatiotemporal superpixel approach to generate pseudo-labels from available annotations for training the detector.

Result: Validated on UCF101-24 and JHMDB-21; significantly reduces annotation costs with minimal performance loss.

Conclusion: Adopting adaptive annotation strategies and pseudo-labeling via 3D superpixels is effective for cost-efficient spatio-temporal action detection.

Abstract: Video action detection requires dense spatio-temporal annotations, which are
both challenging and expensive to obtain. However, real-world videos often vary
in difficulty and may not require the same level of annotation. This paper
analyzes the appropriate annotation types for each sample and their impact on
spatio-temporal video action detection. It focuses on two key aspects: 1) how
to obtain varying levels of annotation for videos, and 2) how to learn action
detection from different annotation types. The study explores video-level tags,
points, scribbles, bounding boxes, and pixel-level masks. First, a simple
active learning strategy is proposed to estimate the necessary annotation type

TL;DR: A physics-based pallet dynamics simulator with configurable layouts and a DL-based crash predictor to reduce physical testing and enable eco-friendly safety analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation:  Growing demand in logistics and emphasis on safety, automation, and sustainability motivate a virtual testing platform for pallets that reduces environmental impact from physical tests while enabling diverse configurations.

Method: Developed a 3D graphics-based virtual environment capable of representing moving pallets with variable package layouts, wrapping materials, and dynamic conditions; coupled with a deep neural network that evaluates rendered simulator videos as crash-test predictions.

Result: The approach reduces physical testing, lowers costs and environmental impact, increases measurement accuracy of pallet dynamics, and provides a data-driven crash predictor.

Conclusion: The integrated simulation-and-DL framework offers a safe, scalable, and eco-friendly tool for pallet safety analysis and design optimization.

Abstract: The design and analysis of pallet setups are essential for ensuring safety of
packages transportation. With rising demands in the logistics sector, the
development of automated systems utilizing advanced technologies has become
increasingly crucial. Moreover, the widespread use of plastic wrapping has
motivated researchers to investigate eco-friendly alternatives that still

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Extends long-range autonomous highway perception to 250m using sparse 3D encoding and self-supervised pre-training, achieving significant gains over BEV-based methods in object detection and LiDAR forecasting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need for safe, long-horizon perception on intercity highways to support heavy vehicles and maintain sufficient planning/braking margins; BEV approaches become memory- and compute-heavy as distance grows.

Method: Builds on a sparse 3D representation with efficient encoding of multi-modal and temporal features, coupled with a novel self-supervised pre-training scheme that learns from unlabeled camera-LiDAR data.

Result: Extends perception distances to 250 meters; 26.6% improvement in mAP for object detection; 30.5% decrease in Chamfer Distance for LiDAR forecasting; performance demonstrated up to 250 meters; Project Page: https://light.princeton.edu/lrs4fusion/

Conclusion: Shows that sparse 3D encoding plus self-supervised pre-training can scale perception range and improve accuracy while potentially reducing memory/computation compared to BEV methods, enabling deployment for larger, heavier trucks.

Abstract: Outside of urban hubs, autonomous cars and trucks have to master driving on
intercity highways. Safe, long-distance highway travel at speeds exceeding 100
km/h demands perception distances of at least 250 m, which is about five times
the 50-100m typically addressed in city driving, to allow sufficient planning
and braking margins. Increasing the perception ranges also allows to extend
autonomy from light two-ton passenger vehicles to large-scale forty-ton trucks,
which need a longer planning horizon due to their high inertia. However, most
existing perception approaches focus on shorter ranges and rely on Bird's Eye
View (BEV) representations, which incur quadratic increases in memory and
compute costs as distance grows. To overcome this limitation, we built on top
of a sparse representation and introduced an efficient 3D encoding of
multi-modal and temporal features, along with a novel self-supervised
pre-training scheme that enables large-scale learning from unlabeled
camera-LiDAR data. Our approach extends perception distances to 250 meters and
achieves an 26.6% improvement in mAP in object detection and a decrease of
30.5% in Chamfer Distance in LiDAR forecasting compared to existing methods,
reaching distances up to 250 meters. Project Page:

*Byeonggwon Lee,Junkyu Park,Khang Truong Giang,Soohwan Song*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduces an online adaptive view-selection framework for RGB-only 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) that combines keyframes with selectively chosen non-keyframes, plus an online multi-view stereo (MVS) component, to improve completeness and generalization in outdoor scenes, outperforming state-of-the-art.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Keyframe-only SLAM approaches yield incomplete scene reconstructions and struggle to generalize due to limited viewpoint coverage; online processing constraints restrict using many frames or long training, motivating adaptive frame selection to achieve broader coverage and robust 3D models.

Method: An online quality-driven mechanism selects informative non-keyframes to augment training alongside existing keyframes. The method integrates selected non-keyframes with keyframes to refine incomplete regions from diverse viewpoints and employs an online multi-view stereo framework to maintain consistency of 3D information during the 3DGS modeling process.

Result: Empirical evaluation demonstrates the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, delivering exceptional completeness and quality in complex outdoor scenes.

Conclusion: Adaptive view selection combined with online MVS significantly improves online 3DGS modeling from RGB data, achieving better scene completeness and generalization under real-time constraints.

Abstract: This study addresses the challenge of generating online 3D Gaussian Splatting
(3DGS) models from RGB-only frames. Previous studies have employed dense SLAM
techniques to estimate 3D scenes from keyframes for 3DGS model construction.
However, these methods are limited by their reliance solely on keyframes, which
are insufficient to capture an entire scene, resulting in incomplete
reconstructions. Moreover, building a generalizable model requires
incorporating frames from diverse viewpoints to achieve broader scene coverage.
However, online processing restricts the use of many frames or extensive
training iterations. Therefore, we propose a novel method for high-quality 3DGS
modeling that improves model completeness through adaptive view selection. By
analyzing reconstruction quality online, our approach selects optimal
non-keyframes for additional training. By integrating both keyframes and
selected non-keyframes, the method refines incomplete regions from diverse
viewpoints, significantly enhancing completeness. We also present a framework
that incorporates an online multi-view stereo approach, ensuring consistency in
3D information throughout the 3DGS modeling process. Experimental results
demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods, delivering
exceptional performance in complex outdoor scenes.

*Tuo Chen,Jie Gui,Minjing Dong,Ju Jia,Lanting Fang,Jian Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Noisy Alignment (NA) is a simple, effective DPCL attack that suppresses noise in poisoned images by exploiting controlled cropping in contrastive learning, achieving state-of-the-art backdoor effectiveness while preserving clean-data accuracy and showing robustness to defenses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Data-poisoning backdoor attacks on contrastive learning can implant targeted misbehavior in downstream tasks. Existing DPCLs rely on fragile co-occurrence between backdoor and target objects and fail to suppress discriminative backdoor features, limiting their efficacy.

Method: Identify the noisy-alignment objective from robust CL attacks and adapt it to data poisoning. Implement by strategically manipulating the CL random cropping mechanism and framing it as an image layout optimization problem, with theoretically derived optimal parameters for cropping. The approach yields a simple, effective attack that suppresses noise components in poisoned images.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance relative to existing DPCL methods while maintaining clean-data accuracy. Shows robustness against common backdoor defenses.

Conclusion: Noisy Alignment provides a straightforward yet powerful DPCL attack by explicitly suppressing noise in poisoned images through optimized cropping, delivering strong effectiveness and robustness, and releasing code for reproducibility.

Abstract: Self-supervised contrastive learning (CL) effectively learns transferable
representations from unlabeled data containing images or image-text pairs but
suffers vulnerability to data poisoning backdoor attacks (DPCLs). An adversary
can inject poisoned images into pretraining datasets, causing compromised CL
encoders to exhibit targeted misbehavior in downstream tasks. Existing DPCLs,
however, achieve limited efficacy due to their dependence on fragile implicit
co-occurrence between backdoor and target object and inadequate suppression of
discriminative features in backdoored images. We propose Noisy Alignment (NA),
a DPCL method that explicitly suppresses noise components in poisoned images.
Inspired by powerful training-controllable CL attacks, we identify and extract
the critical objective of noisy alignment, adapting it effectively into
data-poisoning scenarios. Our method implements noisy alignment by
strategically manipulating contrastive learning's random cropping mechanism,
formulating this process as an image layout optimization problem with
theoretically derived optimal parameters. The resulting method is simple yet
effective, achieving state-of-the-art performance compared to existing DPCLs,
while maintaining clean-data accuracy. Furthermore, Noisy Alignment
demonstrates robustness against common backdoor defenses. Codes can be found at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduces InfiniteTalk, a streaming, audio-driven video dubbing method that preserves sparse reference keyframes to maintain identity, iconic gestures, and camera trajectories, enabling holistic, audio-synchronized full-body motion editing for infinite-length sequences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional video dubbing edits only the mouth region, causing misaligned expressions and body gestures. Image-to-video models fail due to lack of adaptive conditioning, hindering consistent, long-sequence dubbing.

Method: Proposes sparse-frame video dubbing with reference keyframes to preserve identity/gestures/camera path. InfiniteTalk is a streaming, audio-driven generator that uses temporal context frames for seamless inter-chunk transitions and a simple sampling strategy to optimize control strength via fine-grained reference frame positioning, addressing adaptive conditioning.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on HDTF, CelebV-HQ, and EMTD datasets, with quantitative gains in visual realism, emotional coherence, and full-body motion synchronization.

Conclusion: The approach enables robust, long-sequence, audio-synchronized dubbing while preserving identity and actionable gestures, providing a practical pathway for holistic video-to-video editing in AIGC.

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in video AIGC have ushered in a transformative era for
audio-driven human animation. However, conventional video dubbing techniques
remain constrained to mouth region editing, resulting in discordant facial
expressions and body gestures that compromise viewer immersion. To overcome
this limitation, we introduce sparse-frame video dubbing, a novel paradigm that
strategically preserves reference keyframes to maintain identity, iconic
gestures, and camera trajectories while enabling holistic, audio-synchronized
full-body motion editing. Through critical analysis, we identify why naive
image-to-video models fail in this task, particularly their inability to
achieve adaptive conditioning. Addressing this, we propose InfiniteTalk, a
streaming audio-driven generator designed for infinite-length long sequence
dubbing. This architecture leverages temporal context frames for seamless
inter-chunk transitions and incorporates a simple yet effective sampling
strategy that optimizes control strength via fine-grained reference frame
positioning. Comprehensive evaluations on HDTF, CelebV-HQ, and EMTD datasets
demonstrate state-of-the-art performance. Quantitative metrics confirm superior
visual realism, emotional coherence, and full-body motion synchronization.

TL;DR: DetailGen3D adds geometric detail to coarse 3D shapes by learning data-dependent latent-space refinements via flows, with a token-matching refinement to preserve global structure. It is compatible with shapes produced by various 3D pipelines (single-view or sparse multi-view) and claims high-fidelity detail with efficient training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D generation methods produce coarse shapes due to computational limits; there is a need for an efficient, adaptable refinement module that can enhance outputs from diverse pipelines without heavy 3D model re-training.

Method: Introduce latent-space, data-dependent flows to perform coarse-to-fine refinement; deploy a token matching strategy to ensure accurate spatial correspondence during refinement; train on data tailored to the characteristics of coarse synthesized shapes; compatible with outputs from single-view and sparse multi-view generation/reconstruction methods.

Result: Extensive experiments show improved high-fidelity geometric detail synthesis while maintaining training efficiency, across various coarse inputs and generation pipelines.

Conclusion: DetailGen3D offers a practical, scalable refinement approach that enhances existing 3D generation outputs with local detail while preserving global structure, acting as a drop-in enhancement module for a wide range of pipelines.

Abstract: Modern 3D generation methods can rapidly create shapes from sparse or single
views, but their outputs often lack geometric detail due to computational
constraints. We present DetailGen3D, a generative approach specifically
designed to enhance these generated 3D shapes. Our key insight is to model the
coarse-to-fine transformation directly through data-dependent flows in latent
space, avoiding the computational overhead of large-scale 3D generative models.
We introduce a token matching strategy that ensures accurate spatial
correspondence during refinement, enabling local detail synthesis while
preserving global structure. By carefully designing our training data to match
the characteristics of synthesized coarse shapes, our method can effectively
enhance shapes produced by various 3D generation and reconstruction approaches,
from single-view to sparse multi-view inputs. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that DetailGen3D achieves high-fidelity geometric detail synthesis while
maintaining efficiency in training.

TL;DR: First knowledge distillation framework for 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to reduce memory/storage while maintaining rendering quality; uses multiple teacher variants (vanilla 3DGS, noise-augmented, dropout-regularized) to train a lightweight student with a structural similarity loss for geometry.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D Gaussian Splatting achieves strong novel view synthesis but requires many Gaussians, leading to high memory and storage costs. There is a need for compact models that preserve rendering fidelity.

Method: Aggregate outputs from diverse teacher models to supervise a lightweight student; introduce a structural similarity loss to align spatial geometric distributions between student and teachers; distillation framework across datasets.

Result: Distilled-3DGS achieves competitive rendering quality with improved storage efficiency compared to state-of-the-art methods, demonstrated by quantitative and qualitative evaluations on diverse datasets; project page and code are provided.

Conclusion: A simple, effective distillation approach can compress 3DGS representations by leveraging multiple teachers and a geometry-focused loss, yielding favorable rendering quality with reduced memory footprint.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has exhibited remarkable efficacy in novel view
synthesis (NVS). However, it suffers from a significant drawback: achieving
high-fidelity rendering typically necessitates a large number of 3D Gaussians,
resulting in substantial memory consumption and storage requirements. To
address this challenge, we propose the first knowledge distillation framework
for 3DGS, featuring various teacher models, including vanilla 3DGS,
noise-augmented variants, and dropout-regularized versions. The outputs of
these teachers are aggregated to guide the optimization of a lightweight
student model. To distill the hidden geometric structure, we propose a
structural similarity loss to boost the consistency of spatial geometric
distributions between the student and teacher model. Through comprehensive
quantitative and qualitative evaluations across diverse datasets, the proposed
Distilled-3DGS, a simple yet effective framework without bells and whistles,
achieves promising rendering results in both rendering quality and storage
efficiency compared to state-of-the-art methods. Project page:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard retrieval frameworks struggle with fine-grained compositional queries and variations in temporal understanding; dense modification texts are needed to capture detailed video changes and alignment between text and video.

Method: Proposes Dense-WebVid-CoVR dataset (1.6 million samples with dense modification text) and a cross-attention fusion model that uses a grounded text encoder to align dense query modifications with target videos.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results across metrics, notably 71.3% Recall@1 in visual+text setting, surpassing the prior SOTA by 3.4%.

Conclusion: Dense, richly described queries enable more precise video retrieval; the dataset, code, and model are released for community use.

Abstract: Composed video retrieval is a challenging task that strives to retrieve a
target video based on a query video and a textual description detailing
specific modifications. Standard retrieval frameworks typically struggle to
handle the complexity of fine-grained compositional queries and variations in
temporal understanding limiting their retrieval ability in the fine-grained
setting. To address this issue, we introduce a novel dataset that captures both
fine-grained and composed actions across diverse video segments, enabling more
detailed compositional changes in retrieved video content. The proposed
dataset, named Dense-WebVid-CoVR, consists of 1.6 million samples with dense
modification text that is around seven times more than its existing
counterpart. We further develop a new model that integrates visual and textual
information through Cross-Attention (CA) fusion using grounded text encoder,
enabling precise alignment between dense query modifications and target videos.
The proposed model achieves state-of-the-art results surpassing existing
methods on all metrics. Notably, it achieves 71.3\% Recall@1 in visual+text
setting and outperforms the state-of-the-art by 3.4\%, highlighting its

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LongSplat is a robust unposed 3D Gaussian splatting framework for long, casually captured videos in novel view synthesis, achieving state-of-the-art rendering quality, pose accuracy, and efficiency by jointly optimizing poses and 3D Gaussians, using 3D-prior-informed pose estimation, and an octree-based anchor formation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: NVS from long, casually captured videos is hindered by pose drift, poor geometry initialization, and heavy memory/compute demands. Unposed data and long trajectories lead to global inconsistency and degraded rendering; a method that jointly optimizes poses with a compact 3D representation while efficiently handling large scenes is needed.

Method: 1) Incremental Joint Optimization of camera poses and 3D Gaussian parameters to avoid local minima and enforce global consistency; 2) a Pose Estimation Module that leverages learned 3D priors to provide robust pose cues; 3) Octree Anchor Formation that converts dense point clouds into density-based anchors for memory-efficient rendering.

Result: Extensive experiments on challenging benchmarks show LongSplat achieves state-of-the-art rendering quality, improved pose accuracy, and higher computational efficiency compared to prior methods.

Conclusion: LongSplat offers a robust, scalable unposed 3D Gaussian splatting framework for long-video NVS, effectively addressing pose drift, geometry initialization, and memory challenges, with strong empirical gains and a practical project page.

Abstract: LongSplat addresses critical challenges in novel view synthesis (NVS) from
casually captured long videos characterized by irregular camera motion, unknown
camera poses, and expansive scenes. Current methods often suffer from pose
drift, inaccurate geometry initialization, and severe memory limitations. To
address these issues, we introduce LongSplat, a robust unposed 3D Gaussian
Splatting framework featuring: (1) Incremental Joint Optimization that
concurrently optimizes camera poses and 3D Gaussians to avoid local minima and
ensure global consistency; (2) a robust Pose Estimation Module leveraging
learned 3D priors; and (3) an efficient Octree Anchor Formation mechanism that
converts dense point clouds into anchors based on spatial density. Extensive

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes Chain-of-Agents (CoA): an end-to-end, single-model multi-agent reasoning paradigm that simulates multiple agents/tools inside an LLM, trained via distillation from existing multi-agent systems and agentic RL, yielding Agent Foundation Models (AFMs) that achieve SOTA on web and code benchmarks and are open-source.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual prompt/workflow engineering in multi-agent systems is inefficient, brittle, and data-insensitive. An end-to-end, data-centric learning framework can unify agent reasoning and tool use within a single model, improving efficiency and scalability.

Method: Introduce Chain-of-Agents (CoA) where the LLM dynamically activates tool agents and role-playing agents to simulate multi-agent collaboration; distill trajectories from state-of-the-art multi-agent systems into CoA for supervised fine-tuning (multi-agent distillation); apply agentic reinforcement learning on verifiable tasks to further improve capabilities; produce Agent Foundation Models (AFMs) and open-source the weights, training code, and data.

Result: AFMs achieve new state-of-the-art performance across diverse web-agent and code-agent benchmarks; comprehensive open-source release enabling further research.

Conclusion: End-to-end chain-of-agents within a single model, supported by distillation and agentic RL, offers a robust new paradigm for agentic AI and provides a solid starting point for future research.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and multi-agent systems have
demonstrated remarkable capabilities in complex problem-solving tasks such as
deep research, vibe coding, and mathematical reasoning. However, most existing
multi-agent systems are built upon manual prompt/workflow engineering with
sophisticated agent frameworks, making them computationally inefficient, less
capable, and can not benefit from data-centric learning. In this work, we
introduce Chain-of-Agents (CoA), a novel paradigm of LLM reasoning that enables
native end-to-end complex problem-solving in the same way as a multi-agent
system (i.e., multi-turn problem solving with multiple tools and multiple
agents) within one model. In chain-of-agents problem-solving, the model
dynamically activates different tool agents and role-playing agents to simulate
multi-agent collaboration in an end-to-end fashion. To elicit end-to-end
chain-of-agents problem-solving abilities in LLMs, we introduce a multi-agent
distillation framework to distill state-of-the-art multi-agent systems into
chain-of-agents trajectories for agentic supervised fine-tuning. We then use
agentic reinforcement learning on verifiable agentic tasks to further improve
the models' capabilities on chain-of-agents problem solving. We call the
resulting models Agent Foundation Models (AFMs). Our empirical studies
demonstrate that AFM establishes new state-of-the-art performance across
diverse benchmarks in both web agent and code agent settings. We make the
entire research, including the model weights, code for training and evaluation,
and the training data, fully open-sourced, which offers a solid starting point
for future research on agent models and agentic RL.

TL;DR: Cognitive Workspace introduces an active memory management paradigm that surpasses traditional RAG by emulating human cognitive memory; it achieves higher memory reuse and efficiency despite higher compute, supported by strong statistics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs face core context-management limits; passive retrieval misses metacognitive planning and dynamic memory use; cognitive-science-inspired external memory scaffolding offers a path to genuine cognitive augmentation.

Method: Propose Cognitive Workspace with (1) active memory management and curated info, (2) hierarchical cognitive buffers for persistent working states, (3) task-driven context optimization. Evaluates 2024–2025 developments, assesses limitations of Infini-attention/StreamingLLM, and provides empirical validation across multiple tasks comparing against traditional RAG, with statistical analyses.

Result: Average memory reuse of 58.6% (54–60% across tasks) versus 0% for traditional RAG; 17–18% net efficiency gain despite 3.3× higher operation counts; p<0.001 and Cohen's d>23 across task types; first quantitative evidence of active memory superiority in LLMs.

Conclusion: Presents a theoretical framework for a fundamental shift from information retrieval to cognitive augmentation, synthesizing 50+ papers and establishing active memory as a core capability for future LLM systems.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) face fundamental limitations in context
management despite recent advances extending context windows to millions of
tokens. We propose Cognitive Workspace, a novel paradigm that transcends
traditional Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) by emulating human cognitive
mechanisms of external memory use. Drawing from cognitive science foundations
including Baddeley's working memory model, Clark's extended mind thesis, and
Hutchins' distributed cognition framework, we demonstrate that current passive
retrieval systems fail to capture the dynamic, task-driven nature of human
memory management. Our analysis of 2024-2025 developments reveals that while
techniques like Infini-attention and StreamingLLM achieve impressive context
lengths, they lack the metacognitive awareness and active planning capabilities
essential for true cognitive extension. Cognitive Workspace addresses these
limitations through three core innovations: (1) active memory management with
deliberate information curation, (2) hierarchical cognitive buffers enabling
persistent working states, and (3) task-driven context optimization that
dynamically adapts to cognitive demands. Empirical validation demonstrates
Cognitive Workspace achieves an average 58.6% memory reuse rate (ranging from
54-60% across different tasks) compared to 0% for traditional RAG, with 17-18%
net efficiency gain despite 3.3x higher operation counts. Statistical analysis
confirms these advantages with p < 0.001 and Cohen's d > 23 across multiple
task types, establishing the first quantitative evidence for active memory
superiority in LLM systems. We present a comprehensive theoretical framework
synthesizing insights from 50+ recent papers, positioning Cognitive Workspace
as a fundamental shift from information retrieval to genuine cognitive
augmentation.

TL;DR: Introduces AlphaEval, a backtest-free, parallelizable framework for evaluating alpha mining models across five dimensions, achieving comparable evaluation quality to backtesting with greater efficiency and reproducibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Backtests are expensive, sequential, and parameter-sensitive; correlation-based metrics miss key properties like stability, robustness, diversity, and interpretability; closed-source models hinder reproducibility. A unified, open, scalable evaluation framework is needed.

Method: Proposes AlphaEval that evaluates generated alphas along five dimensions—predictive power, stability, robustness to market perturbations, financial logic, and diversity. It is parallelizable, backtest-free, and openly available; validated through extensive experiments across representative alpha mining algorithms.

Result: AlphaEval achieves evaluation consistency with backtesting while offering richer insights and higher efficiency; it better identifies superior alphas than traditional single-metric screening. Open-source tools promote reproducibility and community engagement.

Conclusion: AlphaEval provides a unified, scalable, and reproducible evaluation framework for automated alpha mining, facilitating progress in the field and enabling broader adoption.

Abstract: Formula alpha mining, which generates predictive signals from financial data,
is critical for quantitative investment. Although various algorithmic
approaches-such as genetic programming, reinforcement learning, and large
language models-have significantly expanded the capacity for alpha discovery,
systematic evaluation remains a key challenge. Existing evaluation metrics
predominantly include backtesting and correlation-based measures. Backtesting
is computationally intensive, inherently sequential, and sensitive to specific
strategy parameters. Correlation-based metrics, though efficient, assess only
predictive ability and overlook other crucial properties such as temporal
stability, robustness, diversity, and interpretability. Additionally, the
closed-source nature of most existing alpha mining models hinders
reproducibility and slows progress in this field. To address these issues, we
propose AlphaEval, a unified, parallelizable, and backtest-free evaluation
framework for automated alpha mining models. AlphaEval assesses the overall
quality of generated alphas along five complementary dimensions: predictive
power, stability, robustness to market perturbations, financial logic, and
diversity. Extensive experiments across representative alpha mining algorithms
demonstrate that AlphaEval achieves evaluation consistency comparable to
comprehensive backtesting, while providing more comprehensive insights and
higher efficiency. Furthermore, AlphaEval effectively identifies superior
alphas compared to traditional single-metric screening approaches. All
implementations and evaluation tools are open-sourced to promote
reproducibility and community engagement.

Conclusion: Finite bases exist for EL, EL I, guarded TGDs, and inclusion dependencies, but generally do not exist for full, frontier-guarded, and frontier-one TGDs, highlighting a boundary in expressivity where finite representability becomes impossible.

Abstract: We study the problem of fitting ontologies and constraints to positive and
negative examples that take the form of a finite relational structure. As
ontology and constraint languages, we consider the description logics
$\mathcal{E\mkern-2mu L}$ and $\mathcal{E\mkern-2mu LI}$ as well as several
classes of tuple-generating dependencies (TGDs): full, guarded,
frontier-guarded, frontier-one, and unrestricted TGDs as well as inclusion
dependencies. We pinpoint the exact computational complexity, design
algorithms, and analyze the size of fitting ontologies and TGDs. We also
investigate the related problem of constructing a finite basis of concept
inclusions / TGDs for a given set of finite structures. While finite bases
exist for $\mathcal{E\mkern-2mu L}$, $\mathcal{E\mkern-2mu LI}$, guarded TGDs,
and inclusion dependencies, they in general do not exist for full,
frontier-guarded and frontier-one TGDs.

### [89] [The Interpretability Analysis of the Model Can Bring Improvements to the Text-to-SQL Task](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13178)
*Cong Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CESQL integrates interpretability, execution-guided parsing, and model fusion to enhance text-to-SQL on WikiSQL, reducing labeled data needs and improving WHERE-clause accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To strengthen foundational capabilities and generalization of text-to-SQL models in real-world settings, especially for robust WHERE-clause parsing and reducing reliance on labeled data.

Method: Combine model interpretability analysis with an execution-guided strategy for semantic parsing of WHERE clauses, apply filtering adjustments, refine logical correlations, and fuse models to form CESQL for conditional enhancement.

Result: On WikiSQL (a single-table dataset), CESQL substantially improves prediction accuracy for basic queries and WHERE-clause values, achieving reduced dependence on data within condition columns and eliminating the need for manually labeled training data.

Conclusion:  CESQL offers a fresh perspective for tackling more complex queries and irregular data in real-world databases, promoting better generalization and accuracy in text-to-SQL systems.

Abstract: To elevate the foundational capabilities and generalization prowess of the
text-to-SQL model in real-world applications, we integrate model
interpretability analysis with execution-guided strategy for semantic parsing
of WHERE clauses in SQL queries. Furthermore, we augment this approach with
filtering adjustments, logical correlation refinements, and model fusion,
culminating in the design of the CESQL model that facilitates conditional
enhancement. Our model excels on the WikiSQL dataset, which is emblematic of
single-table database query tasks, markedly boosting the accuracy of prediction
outcomes. When predicting conditional values in WHERE clauses, we have not only
minimized our dependence on data within the condition columns of tables but
also circumvented the impact of manually labeled training data. Our hope is
that this endeavor to enhance accuracy in processing basic database queries
will offer fresh perspectives for research into handling complex queries and
scenarios featuring irregular data in real-world database environments.

### [90] [Search-Time Data Contamination](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13180)
*Ziwen Han,Meher Mankikar,Julian Michael,Zifan Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Search-time contamination (STC) leaks evaluation content of test questions through online sources (e.g., HuggingFace) in search-based LLM agent benchmarks, enabling copying rather than reasoning. Blocking leaked sources reduces contaminated evaluations; ~3% of questions are affected, and ~15% accuracy drop is observed on the contaminated subset after blocking. The phenomenon persists beyond HuggingFace, prompting best-practice recommendations and public release of logs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ensure trustworthy evaluation of search-based LLM agents by identifying and mitigating leakage that undermines benchmark integrity.

Method: Analyze logs from three benchmarks (HLE, SimpleQA, GPQA) to detect retrieval sources containing test questions or near-duplicates; observe agents' reasoning traces mentioning discovering QA pairs on HuggingFace; quantify contamination rates; perform a blocking experiment on HuggingFace and conduct ablations to find other STC sources; provide benchmark design/reporting recommendations; publicly release full logs.

Result: Approximately 3% of questions in the three benchmarks are contaminated via retrieval of ground-truth QA pairs from HuggingFace; blocking HuggingFace reduces accuracy on the contaminated subset by about 15%; ablations indicate STC sources extend beyond HuggingFace to other publicly accessible evaluation data; authors release full logs to enable auditing.

Conclusion: STC represents a novel leakage type in evaluating search-based LLM agents. To preserve benchmark validity, researchers should adopt best practices for benchmark design and result reporting, mitigate leakage by blocking problematic sources, and enable auditing through shared logs.

Abstract: Data contamination refers to the leakage of evaluation data into model
training data, resulting in overfitting to supposedly held-out test sets and
compromising test validity. We identify an analogous issue, search-time
contamination (STC), in evaluating search-based LLM agents which use tools to
gather information from online sources when answering user queries. STC occurs
when the retrieval step surfaces a source containing the test question (or a
near-duplicate) alongside its answer, enabling agents to copy rather than
genuinely infer or reason, undermining benchmark integrity. We find that
HuggingFace, an online platform hosting evaluation datasets, appears among
retrieved sources in search based agent logs. Consequently, agents often
explicitly acknowledge discovering question answer pairs from HuggingFace
within their reasoning chains. On three commonly used capability benchmarks:
Humanity's Last Exam (HLE), SimpleQA, and GPQA, we demonstrate that for
approximately 3% of questions, search-based agents directly find the datasets
with ground truth labels on HuggingFace. When millions of evaluation queries
target the same benchmark, even small, repeated leaks can accelerate the
benchmark's obsolescence, shortening its intended lifecycle. After HuggingFace
is blocked, we observe a drop in accuracy on the contaminated subset of
approximately 15%. We further show through ablation experiments that publicly
accessible evaluation datasets on HuggingFace may not be the sole source of
STC. To this end, we conclude by proposing best practices for benchmark design
and result reporting to address this novel form of leakage and ensure
trustworthy evaluation of search-based LLM agents. To facilitate the auditing
of evaluation results, we also publicly release the complete logs from our
experiments.

### [91] [QuickMerge++: Fast Token Merging with Autoregressive Prior](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13204)
*Dong Liu,Yanxuan Yu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: QuickMerge offers a dynamic token merging framework for autoregressive generation across modalities, reducing tokens via attention-norm-based salience and entropy-based budget estimation, with a lightweight transformer prior to maintain AR compatibility, achieving strong compute-accuracy tradeoffs compared to learned tokenizers and fixed patches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Token-level computation is a major bottleneck as models scale across language, vision, and video. Static, modality-specific, or AR-unfriendly token selection hinders performance and practicality. There is a need for dynamic, cross-modality token reduction that preserves autoregressive generation.

Method: Dynamically merge tokens based on attention norm magnitudes (semantic salience). Use an entropy-based budget estimator to decide token budgets. Train a lightweight transformer prior over the merged token sequence to preserve autoregressive compatibility. Evaluate across multi-modality domains to assess compute-accuracy tradeoffs.

Result: Consistent improvements in compute-accuracy tradeoffs across multi-modality domains. Substantial reductions in token counts while matching or exceeding the performance of learned tokenizers and fixed-patch baselines.

Conclusion: QuickMerge enables accurate autoregressive generation with fewer tokens, offering flexible budgets and AR alignment. Demonstrates practical cross-modal efficiency gains and potential for broader deployment; future work could explore integration with more architectures or alternative salience metrics.

Abstract: As generative models scale to larger inputs across language, vision, and
video domains, the cost of token-level computation has become a key bottleneck.
While prior work suggests that only a subset of tokens significantly influence
downstream predictions, most token selection methods are static,
modality-specific, or incompatible with autoregressive generation. In this
paper, we propose QuickMerge, a lightweight token merging framework designed
for efficient next-token prediction.
  QuickMerge dynamically selects a reduced number of tokens based on attention
norm magnitude, guided by an entropy-based budget estimator. To preserve
autoregressive compatibility, we introduce a lightweight transformer prior
trained over the merged token sequence. By combining semantic salience
estimation, flexible token budgets, and AR alignment, QuickMerge enables
accurate generation with fewer tokens.
  We evaluate QuickMerge across multi-modality domains, demonstrating
consistent improvements in compute-accuracy tradeoffs. Specifically, QuickMerge
reduces token counts sustantially while matching as well as exceeding the
performance of learned tokenizers and fixed-patch baselines.

### [92] [AI sustains higher strategic tension than humans in chess](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13213)
*Adamo Cerioli,Edward D. Lee,Vito D. P. Servedio*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A network-based metric quantifies strategic tension in chess, showing AI–AI games sustain higher tension longer than human–human games. Tension scales with AI algorithmic complexity and human expertise at ~1600 and ~2300 Elo. Humans maintain lower tension, suggesting cognitive limits; findings have implications for deploying AI in complex strategic environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how strategic tension between immediate opportunities and long-term objectives manifests in chess, comparing human–human and AI–AI dynamics and linking tension to cognitive limits and algorithmic sophistication.

Method: Introduce a network-based piece-to-piece interaction metric; compute and compare tension trajectories across AI–AI and human–human games; analyze how tension accumulates with algorithmic complexity in AI and with expertise in human games; profile temporal evolution of tension and its relation to game complexity.

Result: Competitive AI players sustain higher strategic tension for longer durations than elite humans; AI tension scales with algorithmic complexity; human players exhibit abrupt increases in tension with experience (≈1600 and ≈2300 Elo); AI adopts interconnected, balanced offense/defense positions over long horizons; humans tend to limit tension and complexity, possibly due to cognitive constraints; this divergence suggests different strategic paradigms.

Conclusion: There are fundamental differences between AI and human approaches to strategic tension in chess; these differences have implications for how AI could be leveraged in complex, strategic environments and for understanding cognitive vs. algorithmic strategies in high-stakes decision-making.

Abstract: Strategic decision-making involves managing the tension between immediate
opportunities and long-term objectives. We study this trade-off in chess by
characterizing and comparing dynamics between human vs human and AI vs AI
games. We propose a network-based metric of piece-to-piece interaction to
quantify the ongoing strategic tension on the board. Its evolution in games
reveals that the most competitive AI players sustain higher levels of strategic
tension for longer durations than elite human players. Cumulative tension
varies with algorithmic complexity for AI and correspondingly in human-played
games increases abruptly with expertise at about 1600 Elo and again at 2300
Elo. The profiles reveal different approaches. Highly competitive AI tolerates
interconnected positions balanced between offensive and defensive tactics over
long periods. Human play, in contrast, limits tension and game complexity,
which may reflect cognitive limitations and adaptive strategies. The difference
may have implications for AI usage in complex, strategic environments.

### [93] [Explicit v.s. Implicit Memory: Exploring Multi-hop Complex Reasoning Over Personalized Information](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13250)
*Zeyu Zhang,Yang Zhang,Haoran Tan,Rui Li,Xu Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Defines and investigates a multi-hop personalized reasoning task for memory-enabled LLM agents, builds a dataset and evaluation framework, compares explicit and implicit memory methods, and introduces HybridMem to combine the strengths of both paradigms; demonstrates effectiveness through extensive experiments and releases code.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current memory-based personalization in LLM agents often focuses on simple preference alignment or single-hop QA. Real-world tasks require multi-hop reasoning over large-scale, personalized user information, which existing memory mechanisms struggle to support.

Method: Explicitly define the multi-hop personalized reasoning task, construct a dataset and a unified evaluation framework, implement various explicit and implicit memory methods, evaluate them comprehensively, analyze strengths and weaknesses, and propose a hybrid memory approach called HybridMem.

Result: Comprehensive experiments reveal the relative strengths and weaknesses of explicit vs. implicit memory approaches for multi-hop personalized reasoning. The HybridMem model addressing their limitations shows effectiveness across tasks. The work also provides a thorough analysis and a public codebase.

Conclusion: The study advances memory-based personalization for LLM agents by enabling robust multi-hop reasoning over personalized information, offering a new dataset and evaluation framework, and proposing a hybrid memory solution. The authors release their project to the community to spur further research.

Abstract: In large language model-based agents, memory serves as a critical capability
for achieving personalization by storing and utilizing users' information.
Although some previous studies have adopted memory to implement user
personalization, they typically focus on preference alignment and simple
question-answering. However, in the real world, complex tasks often require
multi-hop reasoning on a large amount of user information, which poses
significant challenges for current memory approaches. To address this
limitation, we propose the multi-hop personalized reasoning task to explore how
different memory mechanisms perform in multi-hop reasoning over personalized
information. We explicitly define this task and construct a dataset along with
a unified evaluation framework. Then, we implement various explicit and
implicit memory methods and conduct comprehensive experiments. We evaluate
their performance on this task from multiple perspectives and analyze their
strengths and weaknesses. Besides, we explore hybrid approaches that combine
both paradigms and propose the HybridMem method to address their limitations.
We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed model through extensive
experiments. To benefit the research community, we release this project at
https://github.com/nuster1128/MPR.

*Di Zhang,Xue Jia,Tran Ba Hung,Seong Hoon Jang,Linda Zhang,Ryuhei Sato,Yusuke Hashimoto,Toyoto Sato,Kiyoe Konno,Shin-ichi Orimo,Hao Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A multi-agent framework (DIVE) reads and structures experimental data from figures/tables in literature to enable accurate data extraction and rapid inverse design for materials, outperforming multimodal baselines and enabling hydrogen storage composition discovery in minutes; the approach is generalizable to other materials.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most materials data reside in unstructured figures and tables in literature, creating a bottleneck for AI-driven materials discovery. Extracting structured data at scale is essential to train and deploy LLM-based agents.

Method: Introduce the DIVE multi-agent workflow that systematically reads, interprets, and organizes data from graphical elements in scientific papers, built on a curated database of 30k+ entries from 4k publications, and applied to solid-state hydrogen storage materials to enable rapid inverse design.

Result: DIVE improves data extraction accuracy and coverage (10–15% gains over commercial multimodal models and >30% over open-source models). Leveraging the 30k-entry database, it identifies previously unreported hydrogen storage compositions in about two minutes.

Conclusion: The AI workflow and agent design are broadly transferable across diverse materials, offering a paradigm for AI-driven materials discovery.

Abstract: Data-driven artificial intelligence (AI) approaches are fundamentally
transforming the discovery of new materials. Despite the unprecedented
availability of materials data in the scientific literature, much of this
information remains trapped in unstructured figures and tables, hindering the
construction of large language model (LLM)-based AI agent for automated
materials design. Here, we present the Descriptive Interpretation of Visual
Expression (DIVE) multi-agent workflow, which systematically reads and
organizes experimental data from graphical elements in scientific literatures.
We focus on solid-state hydrogen storage materials-a class of materials central
to future clean-energy technologies and demonstrate that DIVE markedly improves
the accuracy and coverage of data extraction compared to the direct extraction
by multimodal models, with gains of 10-15% over commercial models and over 30%
relative to open-source models. Building on a curated database of over 30,000
entries from 4,000 publications, we establish a rapid inverse design workflow
capable of identifying previously unreported hydrogen storage compositions in
two minutes. The proposed AI workflow and agent design are broadly transferable
across diverse materials, providing a paradigm for AI-driven materials
discovery.

### [95] [CardAIc-Agents: A Multimodal Framework with Hierarchical Adaptation for Cardiac Care Support](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13256)
*Yuting Zhang,Karina V. Bunting,Asgher Champsi,Xiaoxia Wang,Wenqi Lu,Alexander Thorley,Sandeep S Hothi,Zhaowen Qiu,Dipak Kotecha,Jinming Duan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A multimodal CardAIc-Agents framework augments AI with external tools and adaptive planning to support diverse cardiac tasks, using CardiacRAG for plan generation, a chief agent for execution, a stepwise update strategy, multidisciplinary discussion, and visual review panels; shows improved efficiency over baselines across three datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of death globally, worsened by a shortage of healthcare workers. AI can aid in early detection and screening, but current clinical AI is limited by lack of domain-specific tool support, rigid sequential workflows, static knowledge bases, unimodal/bimodal inputs, and lack of on-demand visual outputs. A flexible, tool-augmented, multimodal framework is needed to enable adaptive reasoning and personalized next steps.

Method: Introduce CardAIc-Agents: a multimodal framework where a CardiacRAG agent generates general plans from updatable cardiac knowledge; a chief agent integrates tools to autonomously execute plans and deliver decisions. A stepwise update strategy dynamically refines plans based on prior execution results for complex tasks, and a multidisciplinary discussion tool helps interpret challenging cases. Visual review panels provide clinicians with final validation support. Experiments across three datasets compare CardAIc-Agents to mainstream Vision-Language Models, state-of-the-art agentic systems, and fine-tuned VLMs.

Result: CardAIc-Agents demonstrates improved efficiency relative to baseline models and competing agentic systems across three datasets.

Conclusion: The framework offers a feasible, adaptive, tool-augmented multimodal approach to assist cardiac care, with potential to reduce clinician workload and enable continuous task-specific adaptation; further research may explore broader clinical integration and continual learning.

Abstract: Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) remain the foremost cause of mortality
worldwide, a burden worsened by a severe deficit of healthcare workers.
Artificial intelligence (AI) agents have shown potential to alleviate this gap
via automated early detection and proactive screening, yet their clinical
application remains limited by: 1) prompt-based clinical role assignment that
relies on intrinsic model capabilities without domain-specific tool support; or
2) rigid sequential workflows, whereas clinical care often requires adaptive
reasoning that orders specific tests and, based on their results, guides
personalised next steps; 3) general and static knowledge bases without
continuous learning capability; and 4) fixed unimodal or bimodal inputs and
lack of on-demand visual outputs when further clarification is needed. In
response, a multimodal framework, CardAIc-Agents, was proposed to augment
models with external tools and adaptively support diverse cardiac tasks.
Specifically, a CardiacRAG agent generated general plans from updatable cardiac
knowledge, while the chief agent integrated tools to autonomously execute these
plans and deliver decisions. To enable adaptive and case-specific
customization, a stepwise update strategy was proposed to dynamically refine
plans based on preceding execution results, once the task was assessed as
complex. In addition, a multidisciplinary discussion tool was introduced to
interpret challenging cases, thereby supporting further adaptation. When
clinicians raised concerns, visual review panels were provided to assist final
validation. Experiments across three datasets showed the efficiency of
CardAIc-Agents compared to mainstream Vision-Language Models (VLMs),
state-of-the-art agentic systems, and fine-tuned VLMs.

Motivation: to overcome limitations of single-modality analyses by leveraging both quantitative signals and qualitative news sentiment for more accurate stock movement forecasting.

Method: combine numerical and textual embeddings via feature concatenation and cross-modal attention in a unified pipeline; evaluate multiple fusion strategies and model configurations; backtesting on historical data; open-source code on GitHub.

Result: STONK outperforms numeric-only baselines in backtests; comprehensive fusion-strategy evaluation provides actionable guidance for scalable multimodal financial forecasting.

Conclusion: multimodal fusion of market data and sentiment-enhanced news improves daily stock-movement prediction; the framework is scalable and reproducible with available source code.

Abstract: We propose STONK (Stock Optimization using News Knowledge), a multimodal
framework integrating numerical market indicators with sentiment-enriched news
embeddings to improve daily stock-movement prediction. By combining numerical &
textual embeddings via feature concatenation and cross-modal attention, our
unified pipeline addresses limitations of isolated analyses. Backtesting shows
STONK outperforms numeric-only baselines. A comprehensive evaluation of fusion

### [97] [HiFo-Prompt: Prompting with Hindsight and Foresight for LLM-based Automatic Heuristic Design](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13333)
*Chentong Chen,Mengyuan Zhong,Jianyong Sun,Ye Fan,Jialong Shi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: HiFo-Prompt introduces Foresight and Hindsight prompting to guide LLMs in EC, yielding adaptive exploration-exploitation and distilled reusable heuristics, leading to faster convergence and better heuristics than prior LLM-based AHD methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-based automatic heuristic design in evolutionary computation relies on static operators and lacks a mechanism to accumulate knowledge from past runs, limiting performance and adaptability.

Method: Proposes HiFo-Prompt framework with two prompting strategies: Foresight prompts adapt search based on population dynamics to balance exploration and exploitation; Hindsight prompts distill successful heuristics from past generations into fundamental design principles, creating a persistent knowledge base that the LLM can reuse.

Result: Empirical results show HiFo-Prompt outperforms state-of-the-art LLM-based AHD methods, producing higher-quality heuristics with significantly faster convergence and better query efficiency.

Conclusion: The dual Foresight-Hindsight mechanism transforms transient discoveries into lasting knowledge, enabling the LLM to learn from its experience and continually improve heuristic design in EC.

Abstract: LLM-based Automatic Heuristic Design (AHD) within Evolutionary Computation
(EC) frameworks has shown promising results. However, its effectiveness is
hindered by the use of static operators and the lack of knowledge accumulation
mechanisms. We introduce HiFo-Prompt, a framework that guides LLMs with two
synergistic prompting strategies: Foresight and Hindsight. Foresight-based
prompts adaptively steer the search based on population dynamics, managing the
exploration-exploitation trade-off. In addition, hindsight-based prompts mimic
human expertise by distilling successful heuristics from past generations into
fundamental, reusable design principles. This dual mechanism transforms
transient discoveries into a persistent knowledge base, enabling the LLM to
learn from its own experience. Empirical results demonstrate that HiFo-Prompt
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art LLM-based AHD methods, generating
higher-quality heuristics while achieving substantially faster convergence and
superior query efficiency.

### [98] [LOOP: A Plug-and-Play Neuro-Symbolic Framework for Enhancing Planning in Autonomous Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13371)
*Ronit Virwani,Ruchika Suryawanshi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR:  LOOP is a neuro-symbolic planning framework that treats planning as an iterative dialogue between neural and symbolic components to generate PDDL plans, achieving high success on IPC benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fill the gap between one-shot NL-to-formal translations and classical planners by enabling iterative neural-symbolic interaction, improving reliability and consistency in complex autonomous planning tasks.

Method: Introduce LOOP with 13 coordinated neural features (including graph neural networks for spatial reasoning, multi-agent validation for consensus, hierarchical decomposition, and causal memory), iteratively refine PDDL with symbolic feedback, and build a causal knowledge base from execution traces; evaluate on six IPC benchmark domains against baselines (LLM+P, LLM-as-Planner, Tree-of-Thoughts).

Result: Achieves 85.8% success on six IPC domains, outperforming baselines: LLM+P (55.0%), LLM-as-Planner (19.2%), Tree-of-Thoughts (3.3%).

Conclusion: Shows that sustained neural-symbolic dialogue during planning yields more reliable, trustworthy autonomous systems and offers a blueprint for deploying robust neuro-symbolic planners in real-world settings.

Abstract: Planning is one of the most critical tasks in autonomous systems, where even
a small error can lead to major failures or million-dollar losses. Current
state-of-the-art neural planning approaches struggle with complex domains,
producing plans with missing preconditions, inconsistent goals, and
hallucinations. While classical planners provide logical guarantees, they lack
the flexibility and natural language understanding capabilities needed for
modern autonomous systems. Existing neuro-symbolic approaches use one-shot
translation from natural language to formal plans, missing the opportunity for
neural and symbolic components to work and refine solutions together. To
address this gap, we develop LOOP -- a novel neuro-symbolic planning framework
that treats planning as an iterative conversation between neural and symbolic
components rather than simple translation. LOOP integrates 13 coordinated
neural features including graph neural networks for spatial relationships,
multi-agent validation for consensus-based correctness, hierarchical
decomposition for complex task management, and causal memory that learns from
both successes and failures. Unlike existing approaches, LOOP generates PDDL
specifications, refines them iteratively based on symbolic feedback, and builds
a causal knowledge base from execution traces. LOOP was evaluated on six
standard IPC benchmark domains, where it achieved 85.8% success rate compared
to LLM+P (55.0%), LLM-as-Planner (19.2%), and Tree-of-Thoughts (3.3%). This
work shows that the key to reliable planning is not in choosing between neural
networks or symbolic reasoners but it lies in making them actually ``talk'' to
each other during the entire process. LOOP provides a thorough blueprint for
building autonomous systems that can finally be trusted with critical
real-world applications.

### [99] [SPANER: Shared Prompt Aligner for Multimodal Semantic Representation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13387)
*Thye Shan Ng,Caren Soyeon Han,Eun-Jung Holden*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SPANER proposes a modality-agnostic PEFT framework with a shared prompt that anchors diverse inputs into a unified semantic space, enabling cross-modal alignment with extensibility to new modalities; it achieves competitive few-shot retrieval while maintaining semantic coherence across modalities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modality-specific embedding structures hinder cross-modal generalization. Aligning embedding spaces, not just tuning adapters, is essential for scalable multimodal learning.

Method: Introduce Shared Prompt AligNER (SPANER) that uses a shared prompt as a conceptual anchor to embed inputs from different modalities into a common semantic space. The design is modality-agnostic and extensible (e.g., adding audio) without changing core architecture; evaluated on vision-language and audio-visual benchmarks within a few-shot retrieval setup.

Result: SPANER achieves competitive few-shot retrieval performance and maintains high semantic coherence in the learned multimodal embedding space across tested benchmarks.

Conclusion: Aligning embedding structures is crucial for scalable multimodal learning. A shared-prompt approach like SPANER can unify heterogeneous modalities and accommodate new ones without major architectural changes.

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) have
significantly improved performance on downstream tasks such as few-shot
retrieval. However, most existing approaches focus on task-specific gains while
neglecting the structure of the multimodal embedding space. As a result,
modality-specific representations often remain isolated, limiting cross-modal
generalisation. In this work, we introduce Shared Prompt AligNER (SPANER), a
modality-agnostic PEFT framework designed to embed inputs from diverse
modalities into a unified semantic space. At its core, SPANER employs a shared
prompt mechanism that acts as a conceptual anchor, enabling semantically
related instances to converge spatially regardless of modality. This shared
prompt design is inherently extensible, supporting the seamless integration of
additional modalities, such as audio, without altering the core architecture.
Through comprehensive experiments across vision-language and audio-visual
benchmarks, SPANER demonstrates competitive few-shot retrieval performance
while preserving high semantic coherence in the learned embedding space. Our
results highlight the importance of aligning embedding structures, rather than
merely tuning adapter weights, for scalable multimodal learning.

### [100] [TASER: Table Agents for Schema-guided Extraction and Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13404)
*Nicole Cho,Kirsty Fielding,William Watson,Sumitra Ganesh,Manuela Veloso*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A continuously learning, agentic table extraction system (TASER) extracts unstructured, multi-page financial tables into schema-conforming outputs using table-detection/classification/extraction/recommendation agents guided by an initial schema; a Recommender Agent refines the schema and finalizes outputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world financial documents contain vast, heterogeneous instrument types and tables that are messy and multi-page; most have no bounding boxes, making extraction challenging. A continuous, schema-guided, agent-based approach can improve robustness and adaptability for real-world tables.

Method: TASER uses table agents for detection, classification, extraction, and recommendations powered by an initial schema. A Recommender Agent reviews outputs, suggests schema revisions, and makes final recommendations. The model is trained on a large, manually labeled dataset (22,584 pages; 3,213 tables; 731,685,511,687 holdings) and evaluated against baselines such as Table Transformer. The system emphasizes continuous learning, with larger batch sizes boosting actionable recommendations.

Result: Outperforms table detection models (Table Transformer) by 10.1%. Larger batch sizes lead to a 104.3% increase in actionable schema recommendations and a 9.8% increase in extracted holdings.

Conclusion: Agentic, schema-guided extraction shows promise for robust understanding of real-world financial tables. TASER is accompanied by TASERTab, a real-world financial table dataset released to the research community.

Abstract: Real-world financial documents report essential information about an entity's
financial holdings that can span millions of different financial instrument
types. Yet, these details are often buried in messy, multi-page, fragmented
tables - for example, 99.4% of the tables in our dataset have no bounding boxes
with the maximum number of rows amounting to 426 per table across 44 pages. To
tackle these unique challenges from real-world tables, we present a
continuously learning, agentic table extraction system, TASER (Table Agents for
Schema-guided Extraction and Recommendation) that extracts highly unstructured,
multi-page, heterogeneous tables into normalized, schema-conforming outputs.
Our table agents execute on table detection, classification, extraction, and
recommendations by leveraging an initial schema. Then, our Recommender Agent
reviews the outputs, recommends schema revisions, and decides on the final
recommendations, enabling TASER to outperform existing table detection models
such as Table Transformer by 10.1%. Within this continuous learning process, we
highlight that larger batch sizes result in a 104.3% increase in schema
recommendations that are actionable and utilized, resulting in a 9.8% increase
in extracted holdings - highlighting the importance of a continuous learning
process. To train TASER, we have manually labeled 22,584 pages (28,150,449
tokens), 3,213 tables for $731,685,511,687 of holdings culminating in one of
the first real financial table datasets. We release our dataset TASERTab to
enable the research community to access real-world financial tables and
outputs. Our results highlight the promise of agentic, schema-guided extraction
systems for robust understanding of real-world financial tables.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome exponential growth of literature and domain specialization; enable broad cross-disciplinary understanding and theory formation; advance toward embodied AI that can test hypotheses in the real world.

Method: Domain-agnostic AI agent that generates hypotheses, designs experiments, collects data (three psychology studies, plus one new online data collection with 288 participants), creates analysis pipelines via long coding sessions, and produces manuscripts.

Result: Demonstrates capability to conduct non-trivial research with theoretical reasoning and methodological rigor comparable to experienced researchers; however, limitations in conceptual nuance and theoretical interpretation.

Conclusion: A step toward embodied AI enabling autonomous exploration of scientific space, potentially accelerating discovery; raises questions about scientific understanding and attribution of scientific credit.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence systems are transforming scientific discovery by
accelerating specific research tasks, from protein structure prediction to
materials design, yet remain confined to narrow domains requiring substantial
human oversight. The exponential growth of scientific literature and increasing
domain specialisation constrain researchers' capacity to synthesise knowledge
across disciplines and develop unifying theories, motivating exploration of
more general-purpose AI systems for science. Here we show that a
domain-agnostic, agentic AI system can independently navigate the scientific
workflow - from hypothesis generation through data collection to manuscript
preparation. The system autonomously designed and executed three psychological
studies on visual working memory, mental rotation, and imagery vividness,
executed one new online data collection with 288 participants, developed
analysis pipelines through 8-hour+ continuous coding sessions, and produced
completed manuscripts. The results demonstrate the capability of AI scientific
discovery pipelines to conduct non-trivial research with theoretical reasoning
and methodological rigour comparable to experienced researchers, though with
limitations in conceptual nuance and theoretical interpretation. This is a step
toward embodied AI that can test hypotheses through real-world experiments,
accelerating discovery by autonomously exploring regions of scientific space
that human cognitive and resource constraints might otherwise leave unexplored.
It raises important questions about the nature of scientific understanding and
the attribution of scientific credit.

### [103] [Discrete Optimization of Min-Max Violation and its Applications Across Computational Sciences](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13437)
*Cheikh Ahmed,Mahdi Mostajabdaveh,Samin Aref,Zirui Zhou*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Defines Discrete Min-Max Violation (DMMV): a general discrete optimization problem that minimizes the largest constraint violation. Proposes a GPU-accelerated heuristic and demonstrates its usefulness on post-training quantization, discrete tomography, and FIR filter design, with notable gains over baselines and implications for a broad class of worst-case optimization tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Provide a context-free framework for worst-case constrained optimization across diverse domains, enabling scalable solutions for discrete decision variables and enabling performance guarantees in practical applications.

Method: Formally define DMMV, study its theoretical properties, and develop a GPU-accelerated heuristic that exploits DMMV structure. Validate on three use cases (language-model quantization, discrete tomography, FIR design) and compare against existing methods (including Gurobi) to assess solution quality and speed.

Result: Quantization: ~14% average improvement over existing methods. Discrete tomography: ~16% reconstruction error reduction under uniform noise and ~6x GPU speedup. FIR filter design: ~50% ripple reduction versus Gurobi."

Conclusion: DMMV offers a versatile, context-free optimization framework. The proposed GPU-accelerated heuristic delivers substantial performance gains across multiple problems, justifying broader exploration and open-source release to foster further research.

Abstract: We introduce the Discrete Min-Max Violation (DMMV) as a general optimization
problem which seeks an assignment of discrete values to variables that
minimizes the largest constraint violation. This context-free mathematical
formulation is applicable to a wide range of use cases that have worst-case
performance requirements. After defining the DMMV problem mathematically, we
explore its properties to establish a foundational understanding. To tackle
DMMV instance sizes of practical relevance, we develop a GPU-accelerated
heuristic that takes advantage of the mathematical properties of DMMV for
speeding up the solution process. We demonstrate the versatile applicability of
our heuristic by solving three optimization problems as use cases: (1)
post-training quantization of language models, (2) discrete tomography, and (3)
Finite Impulse Response (FIR) filter design. In quantization without outlier
separation, our heuristic achieves 14% improvement on average over existing
methods. In discrete tomography, it reduces reconstruction error by 16% under
uniform noise and accelerates computations by a factor of 6 on GPU. For FIR
filter design, it nearly achieves 50% ripple reduction compared to using the
commercial integer optimization solver, Gurobi. Our comparative results point
to the benefits of studying DMMV as a context-free optimization problem and the
advantages that our proposed heuristic offers on three distinct problems. Our
GPU-accelerated heuristic will be made open-source to further stimulate
research on DMMV and its other applications. The code is available at

### [104] [LM Agents May Fail to Act on Their Own Risk Knowledge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13465)
*Yuzhi Tang,Tianxiao Li,Elizabeth Li,Chris J. Maddison,Honghua Dong,Yangjun Ruan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper reveals a gap between risk knowledge and safety execution in language-model agents, proposes a risk verifier and an abstractor to mitigate risks, and reports a 55.3% reduction in risky actions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Safety-critical LM agents often know risks in theory but fail to apply them in practice; scaling model capabilities alone does not fix safety; a systematic, multi-dimensional evaluation is needed to bridge knowledge and action across risk, trajectory analysis, and action avoidance.

Method: Introduce a three-dimensional evaluation framework: (1) risk knowledge, (2) risk identification in execution trajectories, (3) actual risk-averse behavior. Identify a near-perfect knowledge level (>98% pass) but degraded performance in applying risk in trajectories (down >23%) and risky actions (pass <26%). Develop a risk verifier that critiques proposed actions and an abstractor that converts trajectories into abstract representations to aid risk detection; evaluate across general LMs and specialized models (e.g., DeepSeek-R1).

Result: The study uncovers two major gaps (generator–validator-like split) and demonstrates a significant safety improvement: the risk verifier/abstractor system reduces risky action execution by 55.3% compared with vanilla-prompted agents.

Conclusion: Simply scaling model capability does not automatically improve safety. A structured framework with a risk verifier and an abstractor can substantially reduce unsafe actions, offering a practical path to safer LM agents.

Abstract: Language model (LM) agents have demonstrated significant potential for
automating real-world tasks, yet they pose a diverse array of potential, severe
risks in safety-critical scenarios. In this work, we identify a significant gap
between LM agents' risk awareness and safety execution abilities: while they
often answer "Yes" to queries like "Is executing `sudo rm -rf /*' dangerous?",
they will likely fail to identify such risks in instantiated trajectories or
even directly perform these risky actions when acting as agents. To
systematically investigate this, we develop a comprehensive evaluation
framework to examine agents' safety across three progressive dimensions: 1)
their knowledge about potential risks, 2) their ability to identify
corresponding risks in execution trajectories, and 3) their actual behaviors to
avoid executing these risky actions. Our evaluation reveals two critical
performance gaps that resemble the generator-validator gaps observed in LMs:
while agents demonstrate near-perfect risk knowledge ($>98\%$ pass rates), they
fail to apply this knowledge when identifying risks in actual scenarios (with
performance dropping by $>23\%$) and often still execute risky actions ($<26\%$
pass rates). Notably, this trend persists across more capable LMs as well as in
specialized reasoning models like DeepSeek-R1, indicating that simply scaling
model capabilities or inference compute does not inherently resolve safety
concerns. Instead, we take advantage of these observed gaps to develop a risk
verifier that independently critiques the proposed actions by agents, with an
abstractor that converts specific execution trajectories into abstract
descriptions where LMs can more effectively identify the risks. Our overall
system achieves a significant reduction of risky action execution by $55.3\%$
over vanilla-prompted agents.

*Junyeong Park,Hyeonseo Cho,Sungjin Ahn*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CrafterDojo creates a lightweight, Minecraft-like testbed for general-purpose embodied AI by introducing three foundation models (CrafterVPT for behavior priors, CrafterCLIP for vision-language grounding, CrafterSteve-1 for instruction following), plus data/toolkits (CrafterPlay, CrafterCaption), reference agents, benchmarks, and an open-source codebase to speed prototyping in Crafter.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The AI field seeks general-purpose embodied agents. Minecraft offers rich complexity but is slow; Crafter is a faster, lighter alternative yet lacked foundation models. This work motivates bridging that gap by providing foundation models and tooling to enable rapid prototyping in Crafter, accelerating progress toward general-purpose embodied AI.

Method: Develop three foundation models tailored to Crafter (behavior priors, vision-language grounding, instruction following). Create supporting data-generation pipelines and datasets (CrafterPlay for behavior data, CrafterCaption for captions). Provide reference agent implementations, benchmarks, and an open-source codebase to enable easy adoption and experimentation.

Result: A cohesive suite (CrafterVPT, CrafterCLIP, CrafterSteve-1) plus dataset/toolkits (CrafterPlay, CrafterCaption), reference agents, benchmarks, and an open-source codebase that together turn Crafter into a lightweight, prototyping-friendly Minecraft-like testbed for embodied AI research.

Conclusion: CrafterDojo enables rapid prototyping of general-purpose embodied agents in Crafter by delivering foundation models and end-to-end tooling, reducing the gap with Minecraft-scale research while preserving Crafter’s efficiency.

Abstract: Developing general-purpose embodied agents is a core challenge in AI.
Minecraft provides rich complexity and internet-scale data, but its slow speed
and engineering overhead make it unsuitable for rapid prototyping. Crafter
offers a lightweight alternative that retains key challenges from Minecraft,
yet its use has remained limited to narrow tasks due to the absence of
foundation models that have driven progress in the Minecraft setting. In this
paper, we present CrafterDojo, a suite of foundation models and tools that
unlock the Crafter environment as a lightweight, prototyping-friendly, and
Minecraft-like testbed for general-purpose embodied agent research. CrafterDojo
addresses this by introducing CrafterVPT, CrafterCLIP, and CrafterSteve-1 for
behavior priors, vision-language grounding, and instruction following,
respectively. In addition, we provide toolkits for generating behavior and
caption datasets (CrafterPlay and CrafterCaption), reference agent
implementations, benchmark evaluations, and a complete open-source codebase.

### [106] [Toward Better EHR Reasoning in LLMs: Reinforcement Learning with Expert Attention Guidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13579)
*Yue Fang,Yuxin Guo,Jiaran Gao,Hongxin Ding,Xinke Jiang,Weibin Liao,Yongxin Xu,Yinghao Zhu,Zhibang Yang,Liantao Ma,Junfeng Zhao,Yasha Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: EAG-RL is a two-stage training framework that intrinsically enhances LLMs for EHR reasoning by using expert guidance: Monte Carlo Tree Search to initialize reasoning and RL to align attention with expert features, yielding ~14.6% intrinsic improvement and better robustness/generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs excel in medical text but struggle with temporally structured, high-dimensional EHR data; existing hybrid approaches use LLMs only as retrievers and do not improve intrinsic reasoning or generalization.

Method: Two-stage training: (1) expert-guided Monte Carlo Tree Search to construct high-quality stepwise reasoning trajectories and initialize the LLM policy; (2) reinforcement learning to optimize the policy by aligning the LLM's attention with clinically salient features identified by task-specific DL models (expert EHR models).

Result: Intrinsic EHR reasoning ability improved by 14.62% on average; improved robustness to feature perturbations; better generalization to unseen clinical domains; released code at the provided repository.

Conclusion: EAG-RL demonstrates practical potential for real-world clinical deployment by enhancing LLM intrinsic reasoning over EHR data, mitigating limitations of DL-only hybrids and enabling domain-generalization across tasks and datasets.

Abstract: Improving large language models (LLMs) for electronic health record (EHR)
reasoning is essential for enabling accurate and generalizable clinical
predictions. While LLMs excel at medical text understanding, they underperform
on EHR-based prediction tasks due to challenges in modeling temporally
structured, high-dimensional data. Existing approaches often rely on hybrid
paradigms, where LLMs serve merely as frozen prior retrievers while downstream
deep learning (DL) models handle prediction, failing to improve the LLM's
intrinsic reasoning capacity and inheriting the generalization limitations of
DL models. To this end, we propose EAG-RL, a novel two-stage training framework
designed to intrinsically enhance LLMs' EHR reasoning ability through expert
attention guidance, where expert EHR models refer to task-specific DL models
trained on EHR data. Concretely, EAG-RL first constructs high-quality, stepwise
reasoning trajectories using expert-guided Monte Carlo Tree Search to
effectively initialize the LLM's policy. Then, EAG-RL further optimizes the
policy via reinforcement learning by aligning the LLM's attention with
clinically salient features identified by expert EHR models. Extensive
experiments on two real-world EHR datasets show that EAG-RL improves the
intrinsic EHR reasoning ability of LLMs by an average of 14.62%, while also
enhancing robustness to feature perturbations and generalization to unseen
clinical domains. These results demonstrate the practical potential of EAG-RL
for real-world deployment in clinical prediction tasks. Our code have been
available at https://github.com/devilran6/EAG-RL.

### [107] [Breaking the SFT Plateau: Multimodal Structured Reinforcement Learning for Chart-to-Code Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13587)
*Lei Chen,Xuanle Zhao,Zhixiong Zeng,Jing Huang,Liming Zheng,Yufeng Zhong,Lin Ma*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MSRL breaks through the SFT plateau in chart-to-code generation by using a multimodal, structured reinforcement learning framework and a two-stage curriculum, yielding substantial gains over SFT and competitive results with advanced models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reinforcement learning fine-tuning for chart-to-code tasks remains underexplored due to plateauing benefits from SFT and the need for shaped rewards that encourage structured outputs from complex, information-rich images.

Method: Construct a large real-world corpus (3M chart-code pairs) and train with Multimodal Structured Reinforcement Learning (MSRL). MSRL uses multi-granularity rewards: (1) textual, rule-based rewards ensuring code correctness at a granular level; (2) visual, model-based rewards that measure structural similarity by rendering code to images and evaluating with an evaluator model. Training employs a two-stage curriculum for stability.

Result: MSRL significantly breaks the SFT plateau with notable gains (e.g., +6.2% on ChartMimic and +9.9% on ReachQA), achieving competitive performance with advanced closed-source models.

Conclusion: A multimodal, structured reward approach within a staged curriculum effectively elevates chart-to-code generation beyond SFT, indicating broader potential for RL in tasks requiring reasoning over rich visual data and generation of structured outputs.

Abstract: While reinforcement learning (RL) has proven highly effective for general
reasoning in vision-language models, its application to tasks requiring
in-depth understanding of information-rich images and generation of structured
outputs remains underexplored. Chart-to-code generation exemplifies this
challenge, demanding complex reasoning over visual charts to generate
structured code. Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) alone is often insufficient,
highlighting the need for effective RL strategies that appropriately reward
structured outputs. We systematically investigate the performance plateau in
SFT through large-scale experiments and propose Multimodal Structured
Reinforcement Learning (MSRL) for chart-to-code generation, which substantially
breaks through this plateau. We construct the largest training corpus to date,
containing 3 million chart-code pairs from real-world arXiv tables to mitigate
simplistic patterns of prior synthetic data. Despite reaching state-of-the-art
performance, our experiments show that scaling SFT data eventually hits a
plateau where further increases yield negligible improvements. Our MSRL method
leverages a multi-granularity structured reward system using multimodal textual
and visual feedback. At the textual level, rule-based rewards validate
fine-grained code details. At the visual level, model-based rewards assess
structural similarity by rendering generated code into images and employing an
evaluator model. We implement this within a two-stage curriculum for training
stability. Results demonstrate that MSRL significantly breaks the SFT plateau,
improving high-level metrics by 6.2% and 9.9% on ChartMimic and ReachQA
benchmarks respectively, achieving competitive performance with advanced
closed-source models.

### [108] [V2P: From Background Suppression to Center Peaking for Robust GUI Grounding Task](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13634)
*Jikai Chen,Long Chen,Dong Wang,Leilei Gan,Chenyi Zhuang,Jinjie Gu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Valley-to-Peak (V2P) improves GUI grounding by suppressing background attention and modeling GUI interactions as 2D Gaussian heatmaps, leading to precise localization and strong benchmark results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Precise GUI element localization is essential for GUI agents; existing methods suffer from attention drift due to background distractions and from center–edge labeling ambiguity, causing click imprecision.

Method: Introduce a suppression attention mechanism to minimize focus on background regions, and model GUI interactions as 2D Gaussian heatmaps where weight decays from the center toward the edges; Gaussian variance is determined by the target size, guiding the model to concentrate on the most essential point.

Result: The method achieves 92.3% on ScreenSpot-v2 and 50.5% on ScreenSpot-Pro; ablation studies confirm the contribution of each component and demonstrate generalizability for precise GUI grounding tasks.

Conclusion: V2P effectively isolates the target region and teaches the model to concentrate on the essential point of the UI element, offering a generalizable approach for precise GUI grounding.

Abstract: Precise localization of GUI elements is crucial for the development of GUI
agents. Traditional methods rely on bounding box or center-point regression,
neglecting spatial interaction uncertainty and visual-semantic hierarchies.
Recent methods incorporate attention mechanisms but still face two key issues:
(1) ignoring processing background regions causes attention drift from the
desired area, and (2) uniform labeling fails to distinguish between center and
edges of the target UI element, leading to click imprecision. Inspired by how
humans visually process and interact with GUI elements, we propose the
Valley-to-Peak (V2P) method to address these issues. To mitigate background
distractions, V2P introduces a suppression attention mechanism that minimizes
the model's focus on irrelevant regions to highlight the intended region. For
the issue of center-edge distinction, V2P applies a Fitts' Law-inspired
approach by modeling GUI interactions as 2D Gaussian heatmaps where the weight
gradually decreases from the center towards the edges. The weight distribution
follows a Gaussian function, with the variance determined by the target's size.
Consequently, V2P effectively isolates the target area and teaches the model to
concentrate on the most essential point of the UI element. The model trained by
V2P achieves the performance with 92.3% and 50.5% on two benchmarks
ScreenSpot-v2 and ScreenSpot-Pro. Ablations further confirm each component's
contribution, highlighting V2P's generalizability for precise GUI grounding
tasks.

*Daniel Daza,Alberto Bernardi,Luca Costabello,Christophe Gueret,Masoud Mansoury,Michael Cochez,Martijn Schut*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Introduces Neural Query Reranker (NQR) to handle soft constraints in QA over incomplete knowledge graphs; interactive reranking with incremental feedback; extends benchmarks with soft-constraint datasets; maintains robust base QA performance while capturing soft preferences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world queries often involve vague or context-dependent constraints that are not well captured by hard logic. Existing QA over incomplete KGs focuses on first-order logic and direct traversal, but cannot effectively encode soft preferences. An interactive, learnable mechanism is needed to adapt answers to user preferences without degrading original QA results.

Method: Propose Neural Query Reranker (NQR) that adjusts answer scores by incorporating soft constraints. NQR operates interactively, refining answers based on incremental examples of preferred and non-preferred entities. The approach extends QA benchmarks by generating datasets with soft constraints and evaluates whether NQR can capture soft constraints while preserving query answering performance.

Result: Experiments indicate that NQR can effectively capture soft constraints and adapt answer rankings accordingly, while maintaining robust query answering performance on the underlying tasks.

Conclusion: NQR addresses a gap in KGQA by supporting soft, context-dependent constraints and enabling interactive refinement of results. It lays groundwork for richer constraint modeling and future work on more complex soft-constraint types and scalability.

Abstract: Methods for query answering over incomplete knowledge graphs retrieve
entities that are likely to be answers, which is particularly useful when such
answers cannot be reached by direct graph traversal due to missing edges.
However, existing approaches have focused on queries formalized using
first-order-logic. In practice, many real-world queries involve constraints
that are inherently vague or context-dependent, such as preferences for
attributes or related categories. Addressing this gap, we introduce the problem
of query answering with soft constraints. We propose a Neural Query Reranker
(NQR) designed to adjust query answer scores by incorporating soft constraints
without disrupting the original answers to a query. NQR operates interactively,
refining answers based on incremental examples of preferred and non-preferred
entities. We extend existing QA benchmarks by generating datasets with soft
constraints. Our experiments demonstrate that NQR can capture soft constraints
while maintaining robust query answering performance.

*Rehan Raza,Guanjin Wang,Kevin Wong,Hamid Laga,Marco Fisichella*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ITL-LIME introduces instance-based transfer learning to LIME to improve explanation fidelity and stability under data scarcity by using real source-domain instances and a contrastive encoder for weighting, replacing random perturbations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LIME's randomness in perturbation and sampling can cause locality issues and unstable explanations when training data are limited. This work aims to enhance fidelity by leveraging related real instances from a source domain to better approximate the local decision boundary.

Method: Cluster the source domain to create prototype-representative clusters. For a target instance, retrieve real source instances from the most similar prototype cluster. Combine these with the target's neighboring real instances. Build a contrastive-learning-based encoder to weight instances by proximity to the target. Train the surrogate model on this weighted, combined set to generate explanations.

Result: No empirical results are reported in the abstract; the paper proposes that this ITL-LIME framework will improve explanation fidelity and stability in data-constrained settings.

Conclusion: ITL-LIME integrates instance-based transfer learning into LIME to address data scarcity issues, using real source-domain instances and contrastive weighting to produce more robust, faithful local explanations.

Abstract: Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) methods, such as Local
Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME), have advanced the
interpretability of black-box machine learning models by approximating their
behavior locally using interpretable surrogate models. However, LIME's inherent
randomness in perturbation and sampling can lead to locality and instability
issues, especially in scenarios with limited training data. In such cases, data
scarcity can result in the generation of unrealistic variations and samples
that deviate from the true data manifold. Consequently, the surrogate model may
fail to accurately approximate the complex decision boundary of the original
model. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Instance-based Transfer
Learning LIME framework (ITL-LIME) that enhances explanation fidelity and
stability in data-constrained environments. ITL-LIME introduces instance
transfer learning into the LIME framework by leveraging relevant real instances
from a related source domain to aid the explanation process in the target
domain. Specifically, we employ clustering to partition the source domain into
clusters with representative prototypes. Instead of generating random
perturbations, our method retrieves pertinent real source instances from the
source cluster whose prototype is most similar to the target instance. These
are then combined with the target instance's neighboring real instances. To
define a compact locality, we further construct a contrastive learning-based
encoder as a weighting mechanism to assign weights to the instances from the
combined set based on their proximity to the target instance. Finally, these
weighted source and target instances are used to train the surrogate model for
explanation purposes.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Situational knowledge graphs from household actions (derived from video) present unique challenges for link prediction; standard LP methods often fail, even against simple baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve situational awareness for household robots and video-based analysis by completing incomplete knowledge graphs formed from video data; traditional knowledge graphs face special characteristics in this context.

Method: Empirical analysis of link prediction on situational KGs, identifying their distinctive properties and evaluating standard LP algorithms against simple baselines.

Result: Many standard link prediction algorithms are ill-suited for situational KGs and fail to outperform simple baselines.

Conclusion: There is a need for novel, domain-tailored link prediction approaches that account for the specific characteristics of situational knowledge graphs.

Abstract: Knowledge Graphs are used for various purposes, including business
applications, biomedical analyses, or digital twins in industry 4.0. In this
paper, we investigate knowledge graphs describing household actions, which are
beneficial for controlling household robots and analyzing video footage. In the
latter case, the information extracted from videos is notoriously incomplete,
and completing the knowledge graph for enhancing the situational picture is
essential. In this paper, we show that, while a standard link prediction
problem, situational knowledge graphs have special characteristics that render
many link prediction algorithms not fit for the job, and unable to outperform
even simple baselines.

*Yu Li,Zulong Chen,Wenjian Xu,Hong Wen,Yipeng Yu,Man Lung Yiu,Yuyu Yin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MHSNet is a multi-level identity verification framework for deduplicating third-party resumes by fine-tuning BGE-M3 with contrastive learning and using a state-aware Mixture-of-Experts to generate multi-level sparse and dense representations, enabling multi-level semantic comparisons; experiments show effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recruiters must continuously search third-party resumes to enrich a company's talent pool, but these resumes are often incomplete and inaccurate. Deduplicating fetched resumes with existing pool is challenging due to semantic complexity, structural heterogeneity, and information incompleteness.

Method: Fine-tune BGE-M3 using contrastive learning. Use a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) to generate multi-level sparse and dense representations for resumes, enabling corresponding multi-level semantic similarity computations. Employ a state-aware MoE to handle diverse incomplete resumes.

Result: Experimental results verify the effectiveness of MHSNet.

Conclusion: MHSNet provides a robust framework for multi-level, representation-based resume deduplication that handles heterogeneity and incompleteness, improving quality of the talent pool.

Abstract: To maintain the company's talent pool, recruiters need to continuously search
for resumes from third-party websites (e.g., LinkedIn, Indeed). However,
fetched resumes are often incomplete and inaccurate. To improve the quality of
third-party resumes and enrich the company's talent pool, it is essential to
conduct duplication detection between the fetched resumes and those already in
the company's talent pool. Such duplication detection is challenging due to the
semantic complexity, structural heterogeneity, and information incompleteness
of resume texts. To this end, we propose MHSNet, an multi-level identity
verification framework that fine-tunes BGE-M3 using contrastive learning. With
the fine-tuned , Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) generates multi-level sparse and
dense representations for resumes, enabling the computation of corresponding
multi-level semantic similarities. Moreover, the state-aware Mixture-of-Experts
(MoE) is employed in MHSNet to handle diverse incomplete resumes. Experimental

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To advance LLM reasoning toward AGI by integrating neural and symbolic techniques, addressing core reasoning bottlenecks.

Result: Offers a structured framework and taxonomy for neuro-symbolic reasoning approaches; synthesizes findings across literature; highlights key gaps and promising directions; releases supportive GitHub.

Conclusion: Neurosymbolic approaches are promising for enhancing LLM reasoning, but significant challenges remain in integration, evaluation standards, and scalability.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promising results across various
tasks, yet their reasoning capabilities remain a fundamental challenge.
Developing AI systems with strong reasoning capabilities is regarded as a
crucial milestone in the pursuit of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) and
has garnered considerable attention from both academia and industry. Various
techniques have been explored to enhance the reasoning capabilities of LLMs,
with neuro-symbolic approaches being a particularly promising way. This paper
comprehensively reviews recent developments in neuro-symbolic approaches for
enhancing LLM reasoning. We first present a formalization of reasoning tasks
and give a brief introduction to the neurosymbolic learning paradigm. Then, we
discuss neuro-symbolic methods for improving the reasoning capabilities of LLMs
from three perspectives: Symbolic->LLM, LLM->Symbolic, and LLM+Symbolic.
Finally, we discuss several key challenges and promising future directions. We
have also released a GitHub repository including papers and resources related
to this survey: https://github.com/LAMDASZ-ML/Awesome-LLM-Reasoning-with-NeSy.

### [114] [The DeepLog Neurosymbolic Machine](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13697)
*Vincent Derkinderen,Robin Manhaeve,Rik Adriaensen,Lucas Van Praet,Lennert De Smet,Giuseppe Marra,Luc De Raedt*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DeepLog presents a two-tier neurosymbolic AI framework: a declarative language (an annotated neural extension of grounded first-order logic) and an extended algebraic-circuit computational backend, enabling broad representation and efficient GPU-accelerated computation across fuzzy, probabilistic logics and varying usage (architecture vs loss).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a general, declarative, and efficient platform that unifies and emulates a wide range of neurosymbolic systems, abstracting over the choice of logic and where it is applied (in the model vs the loss).

Method: Two core components: (1) DeepLog language — an annotated neural extension of grounded first-order logic that abstracts the type of logic (boolean, fuzzy, probabilistic) and whether logic is used in the architecture or in the loss function; (2) deep computational layer — extended algebraic circuits as computational graphs, forming a neurosymbolic abstract machine with the language as the intermediate layer and circuits as the execution layer. Implemented in software with GPU-oriented algebraic-circuit execution; designed to be declarative so different neurosymbolic models arise from different choices of algebraic structures and logics.

Result: The framework demonstrates generality and efficiency by experimental comparisons across: (a) different fuzzy and probabilistic logics, (b) using logic in the architecture versus in the loss function, and (c) standalone CPU-based versus DeepLog GPU-based implementations.

Conclusion: DeepLog serves as a neurosymbolic abstract machine that unifies model specification and computation under a flexible, declarative paradigm. It enables representing and emulating a wide range of neurosymbolic systems with potential performance gains on GPUs; its modular design invites exploration of various algebraic structures and logics.

Abstract: We contribute a theoretical and operational framework for neurosymbolic AI
called DeepLog. DeepLog introduces building blocks and primitives for
neurosymbolic AI that make abstraction of commonly used representations and
computational mechanisms used in neurosymbolic AI. DeepLog can represent and
emulate a wide range of neurosymbolic systems. It consists of two key
components. The first is the DeepLog language for specifying neurosymbolic
models and inference tasks. This language consists of an annotated neural
extension of grounded first-order logic, and makes abstraction of the type of
logic, e.g. boolean, fuzzy or probabilistic, and whether logic is used in the
architecture or in the loss function. The second DeepLog component is situated
at the computational level and uses extended algebraic circuits as
computational graphs. Together these two components are to be considered as a
neurosymbolic abstract machine, with the DeepLog language as the intermediate
level of abstraction and the circuits level as the computational one. DeepLog
is implemented in software, relies on the latest insights in implementing
algebraic circuits on GPUs, and is declarative in that it is easy to obtain
different neurosymbolic models by making different choices for the underlying
algebraic structures and logics. The generality and efficiency of the DeepLog
neurosymbolic machine is demonstrated through an experimental comparison
between 1) different fuzzy and probabilistic logics, 2) between using logic in
the architecture or in the loss function, and 3) between a standalone CPU-based
implementation of a neurosymbolic AI system and a DeepLog GPU-based one.

### [115] [CausalPlan: Empowering Efficient LLM Multi-Agent Collaboration Through Causality-Driven Planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13721)
*Minh Hoang Nguyen,Van Dai Do,Dung Nguyen,Thin Nguyen,Hung Le*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CausalPlan adds an explicit structural causal reasoning module (SCA) to LLM planning to reduce causally invalid actions in multi-agent tasks, by learning a causal graph from trajectories and reweighting or substituting LLM proposals; demonstrated on Overcooked-AI with several LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often rely on surface correlations, leading to incoherent/invalid actions in dynamic collaboration; need grounded, intervention-consistent planning without fine-tuning.

Method: Two-phase approach: (1) learn Structural Causal Action (SCA) model to infer causal graph over actions and states; (2) use causal scores to reweight LLM-generated proposals or trigger causally grounded alternatives during planning; integrates into decision loop; no LLM fine-tuning; evaluated on Overcooked-AI across five tasks and multiple models.

Result: CausalPlan consistently reduces invalid actions and improves coordination in AI-AI and human-AI settings; outperforms strong RL baselines; demonstrates improved efficiency, interpretability, and generalization.

Conclusion: Explicit causal reasoning within planning is beneficial for multi-agent LLM systems; enabling causality-driven, intervention-consistent behavior without parameter updates.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents-especially smaller, open-source
models-often produce causally invalid or incoherent actions in collaborative
tasks due to their reliance on surface-level correlations rather than grounded
causal reasoning. This limitation undermines their performance in terms of
coordination and planning in dynamic environments. We address this challenge
with CausalPlan, a two-phase framework that integrates explicit structural
causal reasoning into the LLM planning process. At the core of CausalPlan is
the Structural Causal Action (SCA) model, which learns a causal graph from
agent trajectories to capture how prior actions and current environment states
influence future decisions. This structure is then used to guide action
selection by assigning causal scores to LLM-generated proposals, reweighting
them accordingly, or falling back to causally grounded alternatives when
needed. By embedding this causal knowledge directly into the decision loop,
CausalPlan constrains planning to intervention-consistent behaviours without
requiring fine-tuning of the LLM itself. We evaluate CausalPlan on the
Overcooked-AI benchmark across five multi-agent coordination tasks and four
LLMs of varying sizes: Gemma-7B, Llama-8B, Qwen-14B, and Llama-70B.
Experimental results show that CausalPlan consistently reduces invalid actions
and improves collaboration in both AI-AI and human-AI settings, outperforming
strong reinforcement learning baselines. Our findings highlight the value of
causality-driven planning for deploying efficient, interpretable, and
generalisable multi-agent LLM systems.

### [116] [Expertise-aware Multi-LLM Recruitment and Collaboration for Medical Decision-Making](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13754)
*Liuxin Bao,Zhihao Peng,Xiaofei Zhou,Runmin Cong,Jiyong Zhang,Yixuan Yuan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: An expertise-aware multi-LLM recruitment and collaboration framework (EMRC) enhances medical decision-making by dynamically selecting specialized LLMs for each query and fusing their self-assessed confidence with adversarial validation, outperforming single- and multi-LLM baselines on public MDM datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Single LLMs are constrained by static knowledge and limited integration of heterogeneous clinical information; robust, reliable medical decision-making requires leveraging complementary strengths across multiple LLMs through dynamic expert recruitment and collaboration.

Method: Construct an LLM expertise table from a public corpus to capture expertise strengths of multiple LLMs across medical departments and query difficulty levels. Dynamically select optimal LLMs as medical expert agents during inference. Have agents generate responses with self-assessed confidence, then apply confidence fusion and adversarial validation to improve diagnostic reliability. Evaluate on three public MDM datasets, reporting accuracy improvements over baselines.

Result: EMRC outperforms state-of-the-art single- and multi-LLM methods on public MDM datasets; on MMLU-Pro-Health, achieves 74.45% accuracy, a 2.69% improvement over GPT-4-0613, demonstrating effectiveness of expertise-aware recruitment and agent complementarity.

Conclusion: Expertise-aware recruitment and collaborative fusion among LLMs can improve diagnostic accuracy and reliability in medical decision-making by leveraging complementary strengths of multiple models.

Abstract: Medical Decision-Making (MDM) is a complex process requiring substantial
domain-specific expertise to effectively synthesize heterogeneous and
complicated clinical information. While recent advancements in Large Language
Models (LLMs) show promise in supporting MDM, single-LLM approaches are limited
by their parametric knowledge constraints and static training corpora, failing
to robustly integrate the clinical information. To address this challenge, we
propose the Expertise-aware Multi-LLM Recruitment and Collaboration (EMRC)
framework to enhance the accuracy and reliability of MDM systems. It operates
in two stages: (i) expertise-aware agent recruitment and (ii) confidence- and
adversarial-driven multi-agent collaboration. Specifically, in the first stage,
we use a publicly available corpus to construct an LLM expertise table for
capturing expertise-specific strengths of multiple LLMs across medical
department categories and query difficulty levels. This table enables the
subsequent dynamic selection of the optimal LLMs to act as medical expert
agents for each medical query during the inference phase. In the second stage,
we employ selected agents to generate responses with self-assessed confidence
scores, which are then integrated through the confidence fusion and adversarial
validation to improve diagnostic reliability. We evaluate our EMRC framework on
three public MDM datasets, where the results demonstrate that our EMRC
outperforms state-of-the-art single- and multi-LLM methods, achieving superior
diagnostic performance. For instance, on the MMLU-Pro-Health dataset, our EMRC
achieves 74.45% accuracy, representing a 2.69% improvement over the
best-performing closed-source model GPT- 4-0613, which demonstrates the
effectiveness of our expertise-aware agent recruitment strategy and the agent
complementarity in leveraging each LLM's specialized capabilities.

### [117] [Quantifier Instantiations: To Mimic or To Revolt?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13811)
*Jan Jakubův,Mikoláš Janota*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A learning-based instantiation method for quantified SMT using probabilistic CFGs to generate new instantiations from observed samples, enabling exploitation and optional exploration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantified formulas complicate SMT solving; existing instantiation techniques (e-matching, syntax-guided, model-based, conflict-based, enumerative) often complement each other. There is a need for a dynamic, data-driven approach that can learn from solving history to improve coverage and efficiency, balancing exploitation with exploration in quantifier reasoning.

Method: Treat observed instantiations as samples from a latent language. Use a probabilistic context-free grammar (CFG) to learn the distribution over terms and generate new, similar instantiations. The method can mimic successful past instantiations and optionally invert learned term probabilities to increase diversity, thereby balancing exploitation and exploration.

Result: A conceptual framework is proposed; it suggests using probabilistic grammars to guide instantiations and to diversify term generation. The abstract does not report empirical results, but outlines a mechanism to combine existing techniques with learning-based diversification.

Conclusion: The work presents a promising direction to integrate learning-based probabilistic grammars into SMT quantifier instantiation, aiming to improve coverage and balance exploitation/exploration in quantifier reasoning.

Abstract: Quantified formulas pose a significant challenge for Satisfiability Modulo
Theories (SMT) solvers due to their inherent undecidability. Existing
instantiation techniques, such as e-matching, syntax-guided, model-based,
conflict-based, and enumerative methods, often complement each other. This
paper introduces a novel instantiation approach that dynamically learns from
these techniques during solving. By treating observed instantiations as samples
from a latent language, we use probabilistic context-free grammars to generate
new, similar terms. Our method not only mimics successful past instantiations
but also explores diversity by optionally inverting learned term probabilities,
aiming to balance exploitation and exploration in quantifier reasoning.

### [118] [Revisiting RAG Ensemble: A Theoretical and Mechanistic Analysis of Multi-RAG System Collaboration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13828)
*Yifei Chen,Guanting Dong,Yutao Zhu,Zhicheng Dou*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper systematically analyzes ensemble methods for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), offering entropy-based theoretical insights and a practical exploration of four pipelines and three modules. It finds that aggregating multiple RAG systems yields generalizable and robust performance across pipelines and modules, laying a foundation for multi-RAG ensembles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Single RAG frameworks struggle to adapt to diverse downstream tasks. The motivation is to explore how combining multiple RAG systems can leverage complementary strengths to improve robustness and generalization.

Method: The study provides theoretical analysis from an information-entropy perspective and mechanistic analysis at the pipeline and module levels. It defines four pipelines (Branching, Iterative, Loop, Agentic) and three modules (Generator, Retriever, Reranker) and investigates seven research questions, supported by experiments evaluating ensemble performance.

Result: Ensembling multiple RAG systems is generalizable and robust, effective at both the pipeline and module levels.

Conclusion: The work lays the groundwork for multi-RAG ensemble research, offering theoretical justification and practical guidance for designing robust, adaptable multi-RAG systems.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technology has been widely applied in
recent years. However, despite the emergence of various RAG frameworks, a
single RAG framework still cannot adapt well to a broad range of downstream
tasks. Therefore, how to leverage the advantages of multiple RAG systems has
become an area worth exploring. To address this issue, we have conducted a
comprehensive and systematic investigation into ensemble methods based on RAG
systems. Specifically, we have analyzed the RAG ensemble framework from both
theoretical and mechanistic analysis perspectives. From the theoretical
analysis, we provide the first explanation of the RAG ensemble framework from
the perspective of information entropy. In terms of mechanism analysis, we have
explored the RAG ensemble framework from both the pipeline and module levels.
We carefully select four different pipelines (Branching, Iterative, Loop, and
Agentic) and three different modules (Generator, Retriever, and Reranker) to
solve seven different research questions. The experiments show that aggregating
multiple RAG systems is both generalizable and robust, whether at the pipeline
level or the module level. Our work lays the foundation for similar research on
the multi-RAG system ensemble.

### [119] [Improved Generalized Planning with LLMs through Strategy Refinement and Reflection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13876)
*Katharina Stein,Nils Hodel,Daniel Fišer,Jörg Hoffmann,Michael Katz,Alexander Koller*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs improve generalized planning by introducing pseudocode-based strategy debugging, reflection, and multiple-program variants, yielding better generalization across 17 PDDL domains; in 12 domains the best programs solve all tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome errors arising when a single handpicked strategy is passed directly to program generation, causing incorrect generalized plans; to improve robustness and quality of LLM-based generalized planning.

Method: Generate pseudocode strategy; automatically debug pseudocode; add a reflection step where LLM explains plan failure; generate multiple program variants and choose the best; evaluate on 17 benchmark domains.

Result: Substantial improvement in generalized plan quality; never worse; in 12 domains best Python programs solve all tasks that can be generated by the instance generator.

Conclusion: Pseudocode debugging, reflection, and multiple-variant generation reliably enhance LLM-based generalized planning across domains, suggesting broader applicability and robustness.

Abstract: LLMs have recently been used to generate Python programs representing
generalized plans in PDDL planning, i.e., plans that generalize across the
tasks of a given PDDL domain. Previous work proposed a framework consisting of
three steps: the LLM first generates a summary and then a strategy for the
domain, both in natural language, and then implements that strategy as a Python
program, that gets debugged on example planning tasks. In that work, only one
strategy is generated and passed directly to the program generation. If the
strategy is incorrect, its implementation will therefore result in an incorrect
generalized plan. Here, we introduce an approach that generates the strategy in
the form of pseudocode and enables automatic debugging of the pseudocode, hence
allowing us to identify and fix errors prior to the generation of the
generalized plan itself. Additionally, we extend the Python debugging phase
with a reflection step prompting the LLM to pinpoint the reason for the
observed plan failure. Finally, we take inspiration from LLM code generation to
produce several program variants and pick the best one. Running experiments on
17 benchmark domains, we show that these extensions substantially improve (and
never deteriorate) the quality of the generalized plans. In 12 of the domains,
our best Python programs solve all tasks that can be generated with the
respective instance generator.

*Yihao Ang,Yifan Bao,Lei Jiang,Jiajie Tao,Anthony K. H. Tung,Lukasz Szpruch,Hao Ni*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TS-Agent is a modular, agentic framework for time-series modeling in finance that uses a planner and knowledge banks to automate model selection, code refinement, and fine-tuning, improving accuracy, robustness, and interpretability over AutoML and existing agentic baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Finance time-series modeling demands high performance, interpretability, and auditability. AutoML frameworks often lack domain adaptability and evolving objectives, while LLM-based agents offer reasoning, memory, and dynamic code generation to enable flexible workflow automation.

Method: Introduce TS-Agent, a modular agentic framework whose pipeline is an iterative decision process across model selection, code refinement, and fine-tuning. Central components include a planner agent with structured knowledge banks and libraries of models/refinement strategies to guide exploration, improve interpretability, and reduce error propagation. The framework supports adaptive learning, robust debugging, and transparent auditing in financial settings.

Result: Empirical evaluations on diverse financial forecasting and synthetic data generation tasks show TS-Agent consistently outperforms state-of-the-art AutoML and agentic baselines, achieving superior accuracy, robustness, and decision traceability.

Conclusion: TS-Agent provides an adaptive, auditable, and interpretable workflow for time-series modeling in finance, aligning with high-stakes requirements in financial services by enabling robust debugging and traceable decision processes.

Abstract: Time-series data is central to decision-making in financial markets, yet
building high-performing, interpretable, and auditable models remains a major
challenge. While Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) frameworks streamline
model development, they often lack adaptability and responsiveness to
domain-specific needs and evolving objectives. Concurrently, Large Language
Models (LLMs) have enabled agentic systems capable of reasoning, memory
management, and dynamic code generation, offering a path toward more flexible
workflow automation. In this paper, we introduce \textsf{TS-Agent}, a modular
agentic framework designed to automate and enhance time-series modeling
workflows for financial applications. The agent formalizes the pipeline as a
structured, iterative decision process across three stages: model selection,
code refinement, and fine-tuning, guided by contextual reasoning and
experimental feedback. Central to our architecture is a planner agent equipped
with structured knowledge banks, curated libraries of models and refinement
strategies, which guide exploration, while improving interpretability and
reducing error propagation. \textsf{TS-Agent} supports adaptive learning,
robust debugging, and transparent auditing, key requirements for high-stakes
environments such as financial services. Empirical evaluations on diverse
financial forecasting and synthetic data generation tasks demonstrate that
\textsf{TS-Agent} consistently outperforms state-of-the-art AutoML and agentic
baselines, achieving superior accuracy, robustness, and decision traceability.

### [121] [The Collaboration Paradox: Why Generative AI Requires Both Strategic Intelligence and Operational Stability in Supply Chain Management](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13942)
*Soumyadeep Dhar*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Generative AI agents in a multi-echelon supply chain can exhibit a collaboration paradox: despite theoretically superior collaboration via Vendor-Managed Inventory (VMI), they perform worse than non-AI baselines due to inventory hoarding, leading to systemic instability; resilience emerges only from a two-layer design combining high-level proactive policy-setting with low-level proactive replenishment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand emergent strategic behavior of AI-driven agents in economic settings and to assess their impact on a classic supply chain instability (bullwhip), using LLM-powered agents in a controlled simulation.

Method: Computational experiments with LLM-powered agents embedded in a controlled supply-chain simulation designed to isolate behavioral tendencies. Agents operate under VMI-inspired policies; experiments test the effects of coordination, inventory dynamics, and policy layers; development of a two-layer framework combining policy-setting and execution protocols.

Result: Identification of a 'collaboration paradox' where AI collaboration under VMI can worsen performance due to inventory hoarding. Demonstration that resilience requires merging high-level proactive policy-setting with low-level collaborative replenishment, enabling autonomous generation and evaluation of viable strategic choices.

Conclusion: Emergent behaviors of collaborative AI agents can be destabilizing without proper governance. A hybrid, two-layer framework offers a blueprint for stable, effective AI-driven analytics in business settings.

Abstract: The rise of autonomous, AI-driven agents in economic settings raises critical
questions about their emergent strategic behavior. This paper investigates
these dynamics in the cooperative context of a multi-echelon supply chain, a
system famously prone to instabilities like the bullwhip effect. We conduct
computational experiments with generative AI agents, powered by Large Language
Models (LLMs), within a controlled supply chain simulation designed to isolate
their behavioral tendencies. Our central finding is the "collaboration
paradox": a novel, catastrophic failure mode where theoretically superior
collaborative AI agents, designed with Vendor-Managed Inventory (VMI)
principles, perform even worse than non-AI baselines. We demonstrate that this
paradox arises from an operational flaw where agents hoard inventory, starving
the system. We then show that resilience is only achieved through a synthesis
of two distinct layers: high-level, AI-driven proactive policy-setting to
establish robust operational targets, and a low-level, collaborative execution
protocol with proactive downstream replenishment to maintain stability. Our
final framework, which implements this synthesis, can autonomously generate,
evaluate, and quantify a portfolio of viable strategic choices. The work
provides a crucial insight into the emergent behaviors of collaborative AI
agents and offers a blueprint for designing stable, effective AI-driven systems
for business analytics.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A framework for refining and customizing pretrained LLMs to generate and assist with PyChrono simulations, achieving measurable improvements in script quality and usability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Lower the entry barrier to using PyChrono and similar simulation tools by turning LLMs into effective virtual assistants for experts, capable of generating usable scripts and answering API questions.

Method: Develop a general framework to refine and customize both open- and closed-source LLMs to generate PyChrono scripts; apply the approach across a range of tasks from basic pendulum simulations to complex vehicle-on-terrain experiments; include capabilities for answering simulator API questions and recommending modeling approaches.

Result: Quantifiable improvements in the quality of generated PyChrono scripts; generated scripts provide strong starting points for user refinement; LLMs can answer API questions and offer modeling recommendations.

Conclusion: The proposed framework is general and transferable to other domains, with the potential to lower the entry barrier for simulation tools.

Abstract: This contribution is concerned with the following issue: can pretrained large
language models (LLMs) be refined and customized to the point where they become
virtual assistants helping experts with the effective use of a simulation tool?
In this case study, the ``simulation tool'' considered is PyChrono, an open
source multi-physics dynamics engine for multibody systems. We present a
framework for refining and customizing both open- and closed-source LLMs to
harness the power of AI in generating scripts that perform PyChrono virtual
experiments. We refine and customize several classes of LLMs through a process
that leads to a quantifiable improvement in the quality of the generated
PyChrono simulation scripts. These scripts can range from simple
single-pendulum simulations to complex virtual experiments involving full
vehicles on deformable terrain. While the generated scripts are rarely perfect,
they often serve as strong starting points for the user to modify and improve
on. Additionally, the LLM can answer specific API questions about the
simulator, or recommend modeling approaches. The framework discussed is general
and can be applied to lower the entry barrier for simulation tools associated
with other application domains.

*Christian Blum,Pedro Pinacho-Davidson*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: BRKGA-based solution to the Longest Run Subsequence problem achieves state-of-the-art results, with comparisons to a Max-Min Ant System and CPLEX; highlights efficiency of evaluation, but indicates room for improvement for large alphabets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The LRS problem is NP-hard and relevant to genome reassembly; there is a need for effective optimization methods and efficient evaluation of candidate solutions; the work benchmarks BRKGA against established approaches to establish its competitiveness.

Method: Develop a Biased Random Key Genetic Algorithm (BRKGA) to solve LRS, with a focus on efficiently converting gray-value vectors into valid LRS solutions; implement a Max-Min Ant System for comparison; also apply the CPLEX ILP solver to solve all considered instances for baseline benchmarking.

Result: BRKGA is presented as a state-of-the-art technique for the LRS problem, outperforming or matching existing methods on tested instances; however, performance gains are not uniform across all instances—there is room for improvement, particularly with large alphabet sizes.

Conclusion: BRKGA shows strong promise for solving LRS and constitutes a competitive state-of-the-art method, with future work needed to enhance scalability and performance for large alphabets and to optimize evaluation efficiency.

Abstract: The longest run subsequence (LRS) problem is an NP-hard combinatorial
optimization problem belonging to the class of subsequence problems from
bioinformatics. In particular, the problem plays a role in genome reassembly.
In this paper, we present a solution to the LRS problem using a Biased Random
Key Genetic Algorithm (BRKGA). Our approach places particular focus on the
computational efficiency of evaluating individuals, which involves converting
vectors of gray values into valid solutions to the problem. For comparison
purposes, a Max-Min Ant System is developed and implemented. This is in
addition to the application of the integer linear programming solver CPLEX for
solving all considered problem instances. The computation results show that the
proposed BRKGA is currently a state-of-the-art technique for the LRS problem.
Nevertheless, the results also show that there is room for improvement,
especially in the context of input strings based on large alphabet sizes.

TL;DR: ComputerRL introduces an API-GUI framework for autonomous desktop AI, a distributed RL infrastructure for scalable training, and Entropulse (RL + supervised fine-tuning) to prevent entropy collapse. Demonstrates state-of-the-art OSWorld performance (48.1% with AutoGLM-OS-9B) on desktop-automation tasks, using GLM-4-9B-0414 and Qwen2.5-14B models.

Result: AutoGLM-OS-9B (based on GLM-4-9B-0414) achieves 48.1% OSWorld accuracy, a new state-of-the-art for desktop automation; Evidence of improved generality of agents when operating complex desktops.

Conclusion: The framework and training strategy advance scalable, robust desktop agents and have been adopted in AutoGLM (Liu et al., 2024a), highlighting potential for broader desktop automation capabilities across models.

Abstract: We introduce ComputerRL, a framework for autonomous desktop intelligence that
enables agents to operate complex digital workspaces skillfully. ComputerRL
features the API-GUI paradigm, which unifies programmatic API calls and direct
GUI interaction to address the inherent mismatch between machine agents and
human-centric desktop environments. Scaling end-to-end RL training is crucial
for improvement and generalization across diverse desktop tasks, yet remains
challenging due to environmental inefficiency and instability in extended
training. To support scalable and robust training, we develop a distributed RL
infrastructure capable of orchestrating thousands of parallel virtual desktop
environments to accelerate large-scale online RL. Furthermore, we propose
Entropulse, a training strategy that alternates reinforcement learning with
supervised fine-tuning, effectively mitigating entropy collapse during extended
training runs. We employ ComputerRL on open models GLM-4-9B-0414 and
Qwen2.5-14B, and evaluate them on the OSWorld benchmark. The AutoGLM-OS-9B
based on GLM-4-9B-0414 achieves a new state-of-the-art accuracy of 48.1%,
demonstrating significant improvements for general agents in desktop
automation. The algorithm and framework are adopted in building AutoGLM (Liu et
al., 2024a)

### [125] [BERT-VQA: Visual Question Answering on Plots](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13184)
*Tai Vu,Robert Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A VisualBERT-based VQA model (BERT-VQA) using a pretrained ResNet-101 image encoder was developed to address plot-based VQA and tested against a LSTM/CNN baseline. The cross-modality fusion in VisualBERT was not essential for aligning plot elements with questions, challenging the core hypothesis and offering insights into the difficulty of plot VQA and model architecture choices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Plot-based VQA is a challenging, domain-specific task that requires aligning visual plot components with natural language questions; the study investigates whether sophisticated cross-modal fusion (VisualBERT) provides a real advantage over simpler baselines.

Method: Proposed architecture BERT-VQA (VisualBERT-based) with a pretrained ResNet-101 image encoder, with possible joint fusion; trained and evaluated against a baseline consisting of an LSTM, a CNN, and a shallow classifier; comparison focuses on the necessity of the cross-modality module for plot-QA.

Result: The core hypothesis that the VisualBERT cross-modality module is essential was disproved; the VisualBERT-based approach did not demonstrate the expected advantage over the baseline in aligning plot components to questions, indicating the difficulty of the plot VQA task and questioning the utility of complex cross-modal fusion for this domain.

Conclusion: The work provides valuable insights into plot VQA difficulty and suggests that common cross-modal fusion architectures may not be universally beneficial; architecture choices should consider the domain characteristics of plot-based questions and tasks.

Abstract: Visual question answering has been an exciting challenge in the field of
natural language understanding, as it requires deep learning models to exchange
information from both vision and language domains. In this project, we aim to
tackle a subtask of this problem, namely visual question answering on plots. To
achieve this, we developed BERT-VQA, a VisualBERT-based model architecture with
a pretrained ResNet 101 image encoder, along with a potential addition of joint
fusion. We trained and evaluated this model against a baseline that consisted
of a LSTM, a CNN, and a shallow classifier. The final outcome disproved our
core hypothesis that the cross-modality module in VisualBERT is essential in
aligning plot components with question phrases. Therefore, our work provided
valuable insights into the difficulty of the plot question answering challenge
as well as the appropriateness of different model architectures in solving this
problem.

### [126] [Contextual Attention-Based Multimodal Fusion of LLM and CNN for Sentiment Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13196)
*Meriem Zerkouk,Miloud Mihoubi,Belkacem Chikhaoui*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A multimodal sentiment analysis model for crisis contexts that fuses CNN-based image features with LLM-powered text via GPT and prompt engineering, using contextual-attention fusion on CrisisMMD to improve informativity detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Crisis management benefits from accurate public sentiment understanding; traditional unimodal methods miss intermodal cues; leveraging LLMs for text and CNN for images can enhance multimodal comprehension.

Method: End-to-end architecture combining CNN-based image feature extractors with LLM-based text processing, prompt-engineered to extract sentiment-related features; a contextual attention fusion mechanism models intermodal relationships; trained on CrisisMMD; classifies into informative vs noninformative; evaluation on multiple disasters.

Result: 2.43% accuracy gain and 5.18% F1-score over baselines; significant improvements in classifying informative/noninformative posts across various disasters; demonstrates effectiveness of contextual attention fusion and multimodal integration.

Conclusion: The approach advances AI-driven crisis management by more accurately interpreting multimodal crisis signals, enabling better real-time interventions and bridging multimodal AI with disaster response.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel approach for multimodal sentiment analysis on
social media, particularly in the context of natural disasters, where
understanding public sentiment is crucial for effective crisis management.
Unlike conventional methods that process text and image modalities separately,
our approach seamlessly integrates Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based
image analysis with Large Language Model (LLM) based text processing,
leveraging Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) and prompt engineering to
extract sentiment relevant features from the CrisisMMD dataset. To effectively
model intermodal relationships, we introduce a contextual attention mechanism
within the fusion process. Leveraging contextual-attention layers, this
mechanism effectively captures intermodality interactions, enhancing the
model's comprehension of complex relationships between textual and visual data.
The deep neural network architecture of our model learns from these fused
features, leading to improved accuracy compared to existing baselines.
Experimental results demonstrate significant advancements in classifying social
media data into informative and noninformative categories across various
natural disasters. Our model achieves a notable 2.43% increase in accuracy and
5.18% in F1-score, highlighting its efficacy in processing complex multimodal
data. Beyond quantitative metrics, our approach provides deeper insight into
the sentiments expressed during crises. The practical implications extend to
real time disaster management, where enhanced sentiment analysis can optimize
the accuracy of emergency interventions. By bridging the gap between multimodal
analysis, LLM powered text understanding, and disaster response, our work
presents a promising direction for Artificial Intelligence (AI) driven crisis
management solutions. Keywords:

### [127] [Strategies for training point distributions in physics-informed neural networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13216)
*Santosh Humagain,Toni Schneidereit*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PINNs' performance hinges on training point distribution. This study compares five data-generation strategies on two ODEs and two PDEs, introduces sine-based points inspired by Chebyshev nodes, and examines reproducibility. It finds that sampling strategy affects accuracy and that the impact correlates with the underlying equation characteristics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and quantify how the choice of training data distribution in physics-informed neural networks affects solution accuracy and reliability when solving differential equations.

Method: Two ordinary differential equations and two partial differential equations are tested. Five training-data generation strategies are evaluated using shallow networks (one or two hidden layers). A novel sine-based training-point strategy is introduced, inspired by Chebyshev nodes. Experiments consider variations in initialization (random vs fixed seeds) to assess reproducibility.

Result: Training-point distributions significantly influence solution accuracy. The best strategy depends on the equation type, indicating a link between problem characteristics and sampling choice. The sine-based strategy yields distinctive effects, and reproducibility issues arise with certain initializations.

Conclusion: Sampling strategy for PINNs is a core component that should be tailored to the differential equation at hand. The study highlights the need to align data generation with equation properties and to account for reproducibility concerns when evaluating PINN performance.

Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks approach the approximation of differential
equations by directly incorporating their structure and given conditions in a
loss function. This enables conditions like, e.g., invariants to be easily
added during the modelling phase. In addition, the approach can be considered
as mesh free and can be utilised to compute solutions on arbitrary grids after
the training phase. Therefore, physics-informed neural networks are emerging as
a promising alternative to solving differential equations with methods from
numerical mathematics. However, their performance highly depends on a large
variety of factors. In this paper, we systematically investigate and evaluate a
core component of the approach, namely the training point distribution. We test
two ordinary and two partial differential equations with five strategies for
training data generation and shallow network architectures, with one and two
hidden layers. In addition to common distributions, we introduce sine-based
training points, which are motivated by the construction of Chebyshev nodes.
The results are challenged by using certain parameter combinations like, e.g.,
random and fixed-seed weight initialisation for reproducibility. The results
show the impact of the training point distributions on the solution accuracy
and we find evidence that they are connected to the characteristics of the
differential equation.

*Su Chen,Xiaohua Qi,Xixun Lin,Yanmin Shang,Xiaolin Xu,Yangxi Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces DGNPP, a topology-aware temporal interaction network model for event-time prediction in temporal graphs, combining static topology embeddings with dynamic temporal updates via a graph neural point process.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior work on temporal interaction networks treated the problem as coarse-grained multi-sequence prediction and largely ignored how network topology influences interactions.

Method: Proposes two modules: (1) Node Aggregation Layer to capture topology and produce static user/item representations, and (2) Self Attentive Layer to update embeddings over time. The model combines dynamic and static embeddings in the event intensity function and trains via maximum likelihood estimation.

Result: On three public datasets, DGNPP achieves superior performance for both event prediction and time prediction, with high efficiency and clear superiority over baseline models, addressing the limitations of previous approaches.

Conclusion: DGNPP effectively models temporal interactions by integrating topology-aware static embeddings with time-evolving dynamic representations, yielding accurate and efficient predictions.

Abstract: Learning temporal interaction networks(TIN) is previously regarded as a
coarse-grained multi-sequence prediction problem, ignoring the network topology
structure influence. This paper addresses this limitation and a Deep Graph
Neural Point Process(DGNPP) model for TIN is proposed. DGNPP consists of two
key modules: the Node Aggregation Layer and the Self Attentive Layer. The Node
Aggregation Layer captures topological structures to generate static
representation for users and items, while the Self Attentive Layer dynamically
updates embeddings over time. By incorporating both dynamic and static
embeddings into the event intensity function and optimizing the model via
maximum likelihood estimation, DGNPP predicts events and occurrence time
effectively. Experimental evaluations on three public datasets demonstrate that
DGNPP achieves superior performance in event prediction and time prediction
tasks with high efficiency, significantly outperforming baseline models and
effectively mitigating the limitations of prior approaches.

*Mizuki Ohira,Toshimichi Saito*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: An RNN-based clustering method uses network dynamics (multiple fixed points and basins of attraction) to partition large binary S-P charts into smaller charts; introduces an average caution index as a feature to describe response-pattern singularity; experiments indicate effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To manage the increasing complexity of binary educational data (S-P charts) by a simple, dynamics-driven clustering approach that yields interpretable subcharts.

Method: A recurrent neural network with multiple fixed points; clusters emerge from basins of attraction corresponding to small S-P charts; evaluation uses an average caution index to quantify pattern singularity; experimental validation to assess clustering performance.

Result: Fundamental experiments show effectiveness of the clustering approach.

Conclusion: The proposed network-dynamics clustering offers a scalable way to partition large binary educational datasets into smaller, meaningful charts, though details on metrics, baselines, and scalability require clarification.

Abstract: This paper studies an application of a recurrent neural network to clustering
method for the S-P chart: a binary data set used widely in education. As the
number of students increases, the S-P chart becomes hard to handle. In order to
classify the large chart into smaller charts, we present a simple clustering
method based on the network dynamics. In the method, the network has multiple
fixed points and basins of attraction give clusters corresponding to small S-P
charts. In order to evaluate the clustering performance, we present an
important feature quantity: average caution index that characterizes
singularity of students answer oatterns. Performing fundamental experiments,
effectiveness of the method is confirmed.

### [130] [RISE: Enhancing VLM Image Annotation with Self-Supervised Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13229)
*Suhang Hu,Wei Hu,Yuhang Su,Fan Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RISE is a two-stage, self-supervised framework for vision-language models that improves reasoning and annotation quality without manually annotated CoTs: (1) Reason stage generates grounded, verifiable CoTs via reinforcement learning; (2) Inspire/Strengthen uses high-quality CoTs to supervise-fine-tune and RL-fine-tune, achieving better performance and explainability than SFT and Visual-RFT.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SFT ignores underlying rationales and reasoning traces; Visual-RFT yields inconsistent, low-quality CoTs due to lack of high-quality, verified CoTs pre-training. There is a need for self-supervised, verifiable reasoning to improve VLM performance and explainability.

Method: Two-stage framework: (i) Reason stage (RISE-CoT): reinforcement-learning based annotation-reasoning-annotation loop that generates visually grounded, logically consistent CoTs and verifies their ability to reconstruct annotations without leakage; (ii) Inspire/Strengthen (RISE-R1): filter high-quality CoTs via RISE-CoT rewards, perform supervised fine-tuning on the high-quality CoT subset, then reinforcement fine-tuning to produce interpretable reasoning and accurate annotations.

Result: RISE-trained Qwen2-VL-2B outperforms SFT and Visual-RFT on complex and simple image annotation tasks, with robust performance and enhanced explainability.

Conclusion: RISE provides a self-supervised solution for advancing vision-language reasoning, enabling interpretable CoTs and improved annotations without requiring manually annotated explanations.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) struggle with complex image annotation tasks,
such as emotion classification and context-driven object detection, which
demand sophisticated reasoning. Standard Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) focuses
solely on annotation outcomes, ignoring underlying rationales, while Visual
Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (Visual-RFT) produces inconsistent Chains of Thought
(CoTs) due to the absence of high-quality, verified CoTs during pre-training.
We introduce RISE (Reason-Inspire-Strengthen-Expertise), a two-stage framework
to overcome these limitations. In the Reason stage (RISE-CoT), a reinforcement
learning-driven "annotation-reasoning-annotation" closed-loop generates
visually grounded, logically consistent CoTs by verifying their ability to
reconstruct original annotations without direct leakage. The Inspire and
Strengthen stage (RISE-R1) leverages a high-quality CoT subset, filtered by
RISE-CoT rewards, for supervised fine-tuning, followed by reinforcement
fine-tuning to produce interpretable reasoning and accurate annotations,
achieving Expertise in complex visual tasks. Evaluated on complex and simple
image annotation tasks, RISE-trained Qwen2-VL-2B outperforms SFT and
Visual-RFT, achieving robust performance and enhanced explainability. RISE
offers a self-supervised solution for advancing VLM reasoning without requiring
manually annotated CoTs.

### [131] [Data driven feedback linearization of nonlinear control systems via Lie derivatives and stacked regression approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13241)
*Lakshmi Priya P. K.,Andreas Schwung*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A data-driven framework that uses stacked sparse regression and relative degree theory to uncover the true governing equations of a nonlinear system and synthesize a feedback-linearizing controller via Lie derivatives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Discovering the governing equations and designing effective feedback controllers for nonlinear systems is challenging due to unknown nonlinear factors and potential hidden/internal dynamics; existing methods may not guarantee exact linearization.

Method: Identify the system from data using a sparse regression algorithm enhanced with stacked regression to incorporate prior dynamic behavior; then design a feedback controller by applying Lie derivatives to a dictionary of output functions to form an augmented constraint that enforces zero internal dynamics, using relative degree conditions to ensure (and verify) feedback linearization.

Result: The abstract presents a methodological framework; it does not report empirical results or validations, but claims a novel combination of stacked regression and relative degree theory to discover and feedback‑linearize the governing equations of a physical model.

Conclusion: The paper proposes a unified data-driven approach that pairs equation discovery with control synthesis to enable feedback linearization of nonlinear systems; its practical impact depends on validation, robustness to noise, and computational feasibility, which are not detailed in the abstract.

Abstract: Discovering the governing equations of a physical system and designing an
effective feedback controller remains one of the most challenging and intensive
areas of ongoing research. This task demands a deep understanding of the system
behavior, including the nonlinear factors that influence its dynamics. In this
article, we propose a novel methodology for identifying a feedback linearized
physical system based on known prior dynamic behavior. Initially, the system is
identified using a sparse regression algorithm, subsequently a feedback
controller is designed for the discovered system by applying Lie derivatives to
the dictionary of output functions to derive an augmented constraint which
guarantees that no internal dynamics are observed. Unlike the prior related
works, the novel aspect of this article combines the approach of stacked
regression algorithm and relative degree conditions to discover and feedback
linearize the true governing equations of a physical model.

### [132] [Physically Plausible Data Augmentations for Wearable IMU-based Human Activity Recognition Using Physics Simulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13284)
*Nobuyuki Oishi,Philip Birch,Daniel Roggen,Paula Lago*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Physically Plausible Data Augmentation (PPDA) via physics simulation improves HAR performance and reduces data needs compared with traditional STDA; first systematic study.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a scarcity of high-quality labeled data in sensor-based HAR, which hurts model performance and generalization. Standard STDA often yields physically implausible augmentations that can mislead labels.

Method: Propose PPDA that uses physics simulation on motion capture or video-based pose data to generate augmented sensor signals. Variabilities include altering body movements, sensor placements, and hardware effects. Compare PPDA against STDA on three public datasets of daily activities and workouts. Evaluate augmentations individually and in combination, and test data-efficiency by varying the number of training subjects.

Result: PPDA consistently improves macro F1 scores (average gain 3.7 percentage points, up to 13 pp) over STDA. With PPDA, models achieve competitive performance with up to 60% fewer training subjects than using STDA.

Conclusion: This work shows the importance of physical plausibility in data augmentation for sensor-based HAR. Physics-based simulation can generate useful synthetic IMU data for deep learning HAR models, offering a cost-effective, scalable solution to annotation scarcity.

Abstract: The scarcity of high-quality labeled data in sensor-based Human Activity
Recognition (HAR) hinders model performance and limits generalization across
real-world scenarios. Data augmentation is a key strategy to mitigate this
issue by enhancing the diversity of training datasets. Signal
Transformation-based Data Augmentation (STDA) techniques have been widely used
in HAR. However, these methods are often physically implausible, potentially
resulting in augmented data that fails to preserve the original meaning of the
activity labels. In this study, we introduce and systematically characterize
Physically Plausible Data Augmentation (PPDA) enabled by physics simulation.
PPDA leverages human body movement data from motion capture or video-based pose
estimation and incorporates various realistic variabilities through physics
simulation, including modifying body movements, sensor placements, and
hardware-related effects. We compare the performance of PPDAs with traditional
STDAs on three public datasets of daily activities and fitness workouts. First,
we evaluate each augmentation method individually, directly comparing PPDAs to
their STDA counterparts. Next, we assess how combining multiple PPDAs can
reduce the need for initial data collection by varying the number of subjects
used for training. Experiments show consistent benefits of PPDAs, improving
macro F1 scores by an average of 3.7 pp (up to 13 pp) and achieving competitive
performance with up to 60% fewer training subjects than STDAs. As the first
systematic study of PPDA in sensor-based HAR, these results highlight the
advantages of pursuing physical plausibility in data augmentation and the
potential of physics simulation for generating synthetic Inertial Measurement
Unit data for training deep learning HAR models. This cost-effective and
scalable approach therefore helps address the annotation scarcity challenge in
HAR.

### [133] [Towards Human-AI Complementarity in Matching Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13285)
*Adrian Arnaiz-Rodriguez,Nina Corvelo Benz,Suhas Thejaswi,Nuria Oliver,Manuel Gomez-Rodriguez*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A collaborative matching system (comatch) that defers uncertain decisions to humans to optimize overall performance; in a large 800-participant study it outperforms both human-only and algorithm-only matching, with open-source resources available.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the lack of human–AI complementarity in data-driven matching. In high-stakes domains, decisions should leverage both algorithmic confidence and human judgment to improve outcomes beyond either party alone.

Method: Introduce comatch, an algorithmic matcher that only automates decisions it is confident about and defers the rest to human decision makers. It optimizes the balance between automated and deferred decisions to maximize performance. Evaluation via a large-scale human-subject study (n=800) comparing comatch to human-only and algorithm-only baselines.

Result: Comatch produced matching outcomes superior to both human participants and purely algorithmic matching. The study provides empirical support for human–AI collaboration in matching tasks.

Conclusion: Collaborative matching can achieve superior performance through selective automation. The approach supports evidence-based design of human–AI systems in high-stakes settings and is openly available (data and implementation) for replication and adaptation.

Abstract: Data-driven algorithmic matching systems promise to help human decision
makers make better matching decisions in a wide variety of high-stakes
application domains, such as healthcare and social service provision. However,
existing systems are not designed to achieve human-AI complementarity:
decisions made by a human using an algorithmic matching system are not
necessarily better than those made by the human or by the algorithm alone. Our
work aims to address this gap. To this end, we propose collaborative matching
(comatch), a data-driven algorithmic matching system that takes a collaborative
approach: rather than making all the matching decisions for a matching task
like existing systems, it selects only the decisions that it is the most
confident in, deferring the rest to the human decision maker. In the process,
comatch optimizes how many decisions it makes and how many it defers to the
human decision maker to provably maximize performance. We conduct a large-scale
human subject study with $800$ participants to validate the proposed approach.
The results demonstrate that the matching outcomes produced by comatch
outperform those generated by either human participants or by algorithmic
matching on their own. The data gathered in our human subject study and an
implementation of our system are available as open source at
https://github.com/Networks-Learning/human-AI-complementarity-matching.

### [134] [Hierarchical Conformal Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13288)
*Floris den Hengst,Inès Blin,Majid Mohammadi,Syed Ihtesham Hussain Shah,Taraneh Younesian*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes Hierarchical Conformal Classification (HCC): extends conformal prediction by leveraging class hierarchies to produce multi-level, hierarchy-aware prediction sets with finite-sample coverage; shows you can reduce the candidate solution space while preserving coverage; empirical benchmarks across modalities and a user study favor hierarchical predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard conformal prediction treats labels as flat, ignoring semantic or hierarchical relationships. Incorporating class hierarchies can improve interpretability, usefulness, and alignment with human annotations, while preserving finite-sample coverage guarantees.

Method: Formulates HCC as a constrained optimization over hierarchy-based prediction sets that may include nodes at different levels. Proves that a small, structured subset of candidate solutions suffices to maintain coverage and optimality. Develops algorithms to identify this subset. Evaluates on three benchmarks (audio, image, text) and includes a user study comparing hierarchical vs. flat prediction sets.

Result: Prediction sets respect the hierarchy and maintain coverage guarantees. The candidate search space is dramatically reduced without sacrificing optimality, improving computational efficiency. Empirical benchmarks demonstrate advantages of hierarchically structured CP, and annotators prefer hierarchical prediction sets in user studies.

Conclusion: Incorporating class hierarchies into conformal prediction is beneficial across domains. The constrained optimization framework provides a principled way to fuse structure with uncertainty quantification, with broad applicability to hierarchical or structured label spaces and improved human interpretability.

Abstract: Conformal prediction (CP) is a powerful framework for quantifying uncertainty
in machine learning models, offering reliable predictions with finite-sample
coverage guarantees. When applied to classification, CP produces a prediction
set of possible labels that is guaranteed to contain the true label with high
probability, regardless of the underlying classifier. However, standard CP
treats classes as flat and unstructured, ignoring domain knowledge such as
semantic relationships or hierarchical structure among class labels. This paper
presents hierarchical conformal classification (HCC), an extension of CP that
incorporates class hierarchies into both the structure and semantics of
prediction sets. We formulate HCC as a constrained optimization problem whose
solutions yield prediction sets composed of nodes at different levels of the
hierarchy, while maintaining coverage guarantees. To address the combinatorial
nature of the problem, we formally show that a much smaller, well-structured
subset of candidate solutions suffices to ensure coverage while upholding
optimality. An empirical evaluation on three new benchmarks consisting of
audio, image, and text data highlights the advantages of our approach, and a
user study shows that annotators significantly prefer hierarchical over flat
prediction sets.

### [135] [Efficient Constraint-Aware Flow Matching via Randomized Exploration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13316)
*Zhengyan Huan,Jacob Boerma,Li-Ping Liu,Shuchin Aeron*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Constrained Flow Matching (FM) methods for two settings: differentiable constraint distances and oracle-based constraints, using penalty or learned mean flow with randomization; a two-stage, more efficient approach; shows improved constraint satisfaction while preserving the target distribution; includes adversarial example generation via a black-box classifier; code released.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extend Flow Matching to constrained sampling under two practical scenarios: (i) when a differentiable distance to the constraint set is available, and (ii) when only a membership oracle can query the constraint set. The goal is to enable high-fidelity sampling that respects constraints while remaining computationally efficient and broadly applicable (e.g., black-box classifiers).

Method: Case (a): augment the FM objective with a penalty term for the distance between samples and the constraint set. Case (b): use randomization and learn a mean flow whose outputs are likely to satisfy the constraints; replace convex or barrier-based constraints with a randomized, oracle-driven strategy; introduce a two-stage approach where both stages approximate the same original flow, but only the second stage probes constraints via randomization, yielding computational efficiency.

Result: Numerical experiments on synthetic constrained generation show that the proposed methods improve constraint satisfaction while maintaining the target distribution. The two-stage approach is more computationally efficient. Demonstrated an application to training an adversarial example generator using queries to a hard-label black-box classifier. Code is released at the provided GitHub link.

Conclusion: The work presents practical constrained FM methods for both differentiable and oracle-based constraints, showing favorable constraint satisfaction without sacrificing distributional accuracy. It highlights a two-stage strategy as a computationally efficient alternative and points to future research directions and broader applications (e.g., adversarial example generation).

Abstract: We consider the problem of generating samples via Flow Matching (FM) with an
additional requirement that the generated samples must satisfy given
constraints. We consider two scenarios, viz.: (a) when a differentiable
distance function to the constraint set is given, and (b) when the constraint
set is only available via queries to a membership oracle. For case (a), we
propose a simple adaptation of the FM objective with an additional term that
penalizes the distance between the constraint set and the generated samples.
For case (b), we propose to employ randomization and learn a mean flow that is
numerically shown to have a high likelihood of satisfying the constraints. This
approach deviates significantly from existing works that require simple convex
constraints, knowledge of a barrier function, or a reflection mechanism to
constrain the probability flow. Furthermore, in the proposed setting we show
that a two-stage approach, where both stages approximate the same original flow
but with only the second stage probing the constraints via randomization, is
more computationally efficient. Through several synthetic cases of constrained
generation, we numerically show that the proposed approaches achieve
significant gains in terms of constraint satisfaction while matching the target
distributions. As a showcase for a practical oracle-based constraint, we show
how our approach can be used for training an adversarial example generator,
using queries to a hard-label black-box classifier. We conclude with several
future research directions. Our code is available at

### [136] [Decoding Communications with Partial Information](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13326)
*Dylan Cope,Peter McBurney*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Partial observability in language acquisition is tackled by a learning-based algorithm that decodes private information from the environment, actions, and messages to facilitate learning, demonstrated on toy examples and discussed formally for general settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To relax the common assumption that learners observe all relevant information and to study how language understanding can proceed when information is hidden and must be inferred from indirect cues.

Method: Introduce a learning-based decoding algorithm to infer private state; illustrate with toy problems; formally explore challenges that arise when generalizing beyond simple cases.

Result: Toy-setting demonstrations show the algorithm can recover hidden information to support language acquisition and outline the practical and theoretical challenges for scaling to more general settings.

Conclusion: Partial observability poses core challenges to imitation-based language learning, but decoding hidden information from environmental cues and actions provides a viable route; further work needed to generalize formally.

Abstract: Machine language acquisition is often presented as a problem of imitation
learning: there exists a community of language users from which a learner
observes speech acts and attempts to decode the mappings between utterances and
situations. However, an interesting consideration that is typically unaddressed
is partial observability, i.e. the learner is assumed to see all relevant
information. This paper explores relaxing this assumption, thereby posing a
more challenging setting where such information needs to be inferred from
knowledge of the environment, the actions taken, and messages sent. We see
several motivating examples of this problem, demonstrate how they can be solved
in a toy setting, and formally explore challenges that arise in more general
settings. A learning-based algorithm is then presented to perform the decoding
of private information to facilitate language acquisition.

### [137] [A Dual-Attention Graph Network for fMRI Data Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13328)
*Amirali Arbab,Zeinab Davarani,Mehran Safayani*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A dynamic, attention-driven framework for ASD fMRI classification using time-varying graphs processed by GCNs and transformers, achieving 63.2% accuracy and 60.0 AUC on ABIDE subset, outperforming static graph baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations of static functional connectivity in fMRI ASD diagnosis and to capture rich spatiotemporal brain patterns by learning dynamic inter-regional interactions.

Method: Dynamic graph creation via transformer-based attention to infer time-varying functional connections; construction of time-varying graphs; processing with Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) and transformers for hierarchical spatio-temporal feature fusion (GCN-transformer fusion).

Result: On a subset of the ABIDE dataset, the model achieved 63.2% accuracy and 60.0 AUC, outperforming static graph-based approaches (e.g., GCN: 51.8).

Conclusion: Joint modeling of dynamic connectivity and spatio-temporal context via attention-driven dynamic graphs and GCN-transformer fusion is effective for fMRI ASD classification.

Abstract: Understanding the complex neural activity dynamics is crucial for the
development of the field of neuroscience. Although current functional MRI
classification approaches tend to be based on static functional connectivity or
cannot capture spatio-temporal relationships comprehensively, we present a new
framework that leverages dynamic graph creation and spatiotemporal attention
mechanisms for Autism Spectrum Disorder(ASD) diagnosis. The approach used in
this research dynamically infers functional brain connectivity in each time
interval using transformer-based attention mechanisms, enabling the model to
selectively focus on crucial brain regions and time segments. By constructing
time-varying graphs that are then processed with Graph Convolutional Networks
(GCNs) and transformers, our method successfully captures both localized
interactions and global temporal dependencies. Evaluated on the subset of ABIDE
dataset, our model achieves 63.2 accuracy and 60.0 AUC, outperforming static
graph-based approaches (e.g., GCN:51.8). This validates the efficacy of joint
modeling of dynamic connectivity and spatio-temporal context for fMRI
classification. The core novelty arises from (1) attention-driven dynamic graph
creation that learns temporal brain region interactions and (2) hierarchical
spatio-temporal feature fusion through GCNtransformer fusion.

TL;DR: X-MoE is a cross-platform MoE training system that enables scalable, padding-free, mixed-parallelism training of large expert models on non-NVIDIA hardware, achieving up to 545B parameters on 1024 AMD GPUs with high throughput, surpassing prior methods under the same budget; code released.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MoE architectures incur activation memory overhead and heavy all-to-all communication; current MoE training systems are tuned for NVIDIA GPUs, underutilizing non-NVIDIA platforms and leaving substantial computational potential untapped.

Method: Introduce padding-free MoE training with cross-platform kernels, redundancy-bypassing dispatch, and hybrid parallelism with sequence-sharded MoE blocks. Evaluated on Frontier with AMD MI250X GPUs, enabling DeepSeek-style MoEs up to 545B parameters across 1024 GPUs.

Result: Scales DeepSeek-style MoEs to 545B parameters on 1024 GPUs, which is 10x larger than the largest trainable model with existing methods under the same hardware budget, while maintaining high training throughput; source code available at the provided GitHub URL.

Conclusion: X-MoE demonstrates scalable cross-platform MoE training for next-generation architectures, unlocking substantial computational potential on non-NVIDIA hardware and enabling very large MoE models.

Abstract: Emerging expert-specialized Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures, such as
DeepSeek-MoE, deliver strong model quality through fine-grained expert
segmentation and large top-k routing. However, their scalability is limited by
substantial activation memory overhead and costly all-to-all communication.
Furthermore, current MoE training systems - primarily optimized for NVIDIA GPUs
- perform suboptimally on non-NVIDIA platforms, leaving significant
computational potential untapped. In this work, we present X-MoE, a novel MoE
training system designed to deliver scalable training performance for
next-generation MoE architectures. X-MoE achieves this via several novel
techniques, including efficient padding-free MoE training with cross-platform
kernels, redundancy-bypassing dispatch, and hybrid parallelism with
sequence-sharded MoE blocks. Our evaluation on the Frontier supercomputer,
powered by AMD MI250X GPUs, shows that X-MoE scales DeepSeek-style MoEs up to
545 billion parameters across 1024 GPUs - 10x larger than the largest trainable
model with existing methods under the same hardware budget, while maintaining
high training throughput. The source code of X-MoE is available at

### [139] [Dimension lower bounds for linear approaches to function approximation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13346)
*Daniel Hsu*

TL;DR: A linear-algebraic framework yields dimension and sample-size lower bounds for linear methods approximating L^2 functions, extending Barron's n-width results to kernel methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantify fundamental limits of linear function approximators in L^2 and determine the sample complexity of kernel-based methods using a simple, algebraic argument related to Kolmogorov n-widths.

Method: A linear algebraic argument is used to translate function-approximation limits into dimension and sample-size bounds, drawing on Barron (1993) style n-width reasoning and applying it to kernel methods.

Result: Derives dimension lower bounds for linear methods solving L^2 function approximation problems and corresponding sample size lower bounds for kernel methods.

Conclusion: The approach provides a straightforward route to fundamental limits for linear methods in L^2 approximation, extending classical n-width constraints to kernel-based learning and clarifying the necessary sample sizes to achieve a given accuracy.

Abstract: This short note presents a linear algebraic approach to proving dimension
lower bounds for linear methods that solve $L^2$ function approximation
problems. The basic argument has appeared in the literature before (e.g.,
Barron, 1993) for establishing lower bounds on Kolmogorov $n$-widths. The
argument is applied to give sample size lower bounds for kernel methods.

### [140] [Counterfactual Probabilistic Diffusion with Expert Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13355)
*Wenhao Mu,Zhi Cao,Mehmed Uludag,Alexander Rodríguez*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A diffusion-based time-series framework (ODE-Diff) that uses signals from imperfect expert models as structured priors to predict counterfactual distributions in complex dynamical systems, improving both point predictions and distributional accuracy by bridging mechanistic and data-driven approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Counterfactual forecasting in domains like public health and medicine often suffers from data scarcity and reliance on point estimates. There is a need for reliable, interpretable causal inference that leverages existing mechanistic knowledge alongside data-driven models.

Method: A time-series diffusion model guided by high-level signals extracted from imperfect expert models, which serve as structured priors. This bridges mechanistic (expert) models with data-driven generative modeling to improve counterfactual prediction under limited data.

Result: Evaluations on semi-synthetic COVID-19 simulations, synthetic pharmacological dynamics, and real-world case studies show that ODE-Diff outperforms strong baselines in both point prediction and distributional accuracy.

Conclusion: ODE-Diff offers more reliable and interpretable causal inference by integrating mechanistic guidance with diffusion-based generation, particularly beneficial in data-scarce settings.

Abstract: Predicting counterfactual distributions in complex dynamical systems is
essential for scientific modeling and decision-making in domains such as public
health and medicine. However, existing methods often rely on point estimates or
purely data-driven models, which tend to falter under data scarcity. We propose
a time series diffusion-based framework that incorporates guidance from
imperfect expert models by extracting high-level signals to serve as structured
priors for generative modeling. Our method, ODE-Diff, bridges mechanistic and
data-driven approaches, enabling more reliable and interpretable causal
inference. We evaluate ODE-Diff across semi-synthetic COVID-19 simulations,
synthetic pharmacological dynamics, and real-world case studies, demonstrating
that it consistently outperforms strong baselines in both point prediction and
distributional accuracy.

### [141] [Adaptive Conformal Prediction Intervals Over Trajectory Ensembles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13362)
*Ruipu Li,Daniel Menacho,Alexander Rodríguez*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A conformal prediction framework to calibrate ensemble trajectory predictions into calibrated prediction intervals with coverage guarantees, using online updates and inter-step dependency optimization to yield sharp, potentially discontinuous intervals that respect temporal structure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Trajectory forecasts from probabilistic models or multiple predictors are uncertain and often uncalibrated; there is a need for valid, adaptive uncertainty bounds that capture temporal dependencies across time.

Method: A unified conformal-prediction framework that converts sampled trajectories into calibrated intervals. It introduces an online update step to incorporate new information and an optimization step to capture inter-step dependencies, enabling discontinuous intervals around each trajectory and sharper, temporal-aware uncertainty estimates.

Result: The approach provides theoretical coverage guarantees and yields sharper, more adaptive uncertainty estimates that respect temporal dependencies and can produce discontinuous prediction intervals.

Conclusion: The paper presents a unified, theoretically grounded method to calibrate trajectory ensembles into reliable, sharp uncertainty intervals across time, with practical benefits for domains like autonomous driving, weather, and epidemics.

Abstract: Future trajectories play an important role across domains such as autonomous
driving, hurricane forecasting, and epidemic modeling, where practitioners
commonly generate ensemble paths by sampling probabilistic models or leveraging
multiple autoregressive predictors. While these trajectories reflect inherent
uncertainty, they are typically uncalibrated. We propose a unified framework
based on conformal prediction that transforms sampled trajectories into
calibrated prediction intervals with theoretical coverage guarantees. By
introducing a novel online update step and an optimization step that captures
inter-step dependencies, our method can produce discontinuous prediction
intervals around each trajectory, naturally capture temporal dependencies, and
yield sharper, more adaptive uncertainty estimates.

### [142] [Batching-Aware Joint Model Onloading and Offloading for Hierarchical Multi-Task Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13380)
*Seohyeon Cha,Kevin Chan,Gustavo de Veciana,Haris Vikalo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A unified framework (J3O) jointly optimizes which multi-task models to onload at clients/edge servers and how to offload queries across the hierarchy to maximize inference accuracy under memory, compute, and communication constraints; demonstrates near-optimal accuracy with low runtime.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world applications require concurrent multi-task inference (e.g., detection, segmentation, depth) on resource-constrained edge devices; existing work focuses on single-task models and ignores joint onloading/offloading across a hierarchy.

Method: Formulates joint onloading/offloading as a mixed-integer program; proposes J3O, an alternating algorithm that (i) greedily selects models to onload using Lagrangian-relaxed submodular optimization, and (ii) finds optimal offloading via constrained linear programming; extends to edge batching to handle heterogeneous task loads.

Result: Empirical results show J3O achieves >97% of the optimal accuracy while incurring <15% of the runtime required by the optimal solver across multi-task benchmarks.

Conclusion: J3O offers a scalable, near-optimal solution for joint onloading and offloading of multi-task models in edge-edge-cloud hierarchies and handles batching at the edge, improving accuracy-runtime efficiency for resource-constrained systems.

Abstract: The growing demand for intelligent services on resource-constrained edge
devices has spurred the development of collaborative inference systems that
distribute workloads across end devices, edge servers, and the cloud. While
most existing frameworks focus on single-task, single-model scenarios, many
real-world applications (e.g., autonomous driving and augmented reality)
require concurrent execution of diverse tasks including detection,
segmentation, and depth estimation. In this work, we propose a unified
framework to jointly decide which multi-task models to deploy (onload) at
clients and edge servers, and how to route queries across the hierarchy
(offload) to maximize overall inference accuracy under memory, compute, and
communication constraints. We formulate this as a mixed-integer program and
introduce J3O (Joint Optimization of Onloading and Offloading), an alternating
algorithm that (i) greedily selects models to onload via Lagrangian-relaxed
submodular optimization and (ii) determines optimal offloading via constrained
linear programming. We further extend J3O to account for batching at the edge,
maintaining scalability under heterogeneous task loads. Experiments show J3O
consistently achieves over $97\%$ of the optimal accuracy while incurring less
than $15\%$ of the runtime required by the optimal solver across multi-task
benchmarks.

### [143] [Semi-Supervised Anomaly Detection Pipeline for SOZ Localization Using Ictal-Related Chirp](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13406)
*Nooshin Bahador,Milad Lankarany*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Two-step LOF-based outlier detection on chirp time-frequency features plus weighted spatial correlation for SOZ localization; higher concordance in good outcomes; weighted index surpasses exact matching.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantify spatial concordance between clinically defined seizure onset zones and statistically anomalous channels identified via chirp analysis to improve SOZ localization.

Method: Step 1: LOF unsupervised outlier detection on spectro-temporal chirp features (onset freq, offset freq, duration) with adaptive neighborhood (N=20, contamination=0.2). Step 2: Spatial correlation analysis using exact co-occurrence and weighted index similarity incorporating hemispheric congruence and electrode proximity.

Result: LOF detects outliers effectively; index-based matching weighted by proximity outperforms exact matching. Index precision higher for seizure-free (mean 0.903) and successful surgical outcomes (0.865); lower concordance in failure cases (0.460).

Conclusion: Chirp-based outlier detection combined with weighted spatial metrics provides a complementary method for SOZ localization, particularly in patients with successful outcomes.

Abstract: This study presents a quantitative framework for evaluating the spatial
concordance between clinically defined seizure onset zones (SOZs) and
statistically anomalous channels identified through time-frequency analysis of
chirp events. The proposed pipeline employs a two-step methodology: (1)
Unsupervised Outlier Detection, where Local Outlier Factor (LOF) analysis with
adaptive neighborhood selection identifies anomalous channels based on
spectro-temporal features of chirp (Onset frequency, offset frequency, and
temporal duration); and (2) Spatial Correlation Analysis, which computes both
exact co-occurrence metrics and weighted index similarity, incorporating
hemispheric congruence and electrode proximity. Key findings demonstrate that
the LOF-based approach (N neighbors=20, contamination=0.2) effectively detects
outliers, with index matching (weighted by channel proximity) outperforming
exact matching in SOZ localization. Performance metrics (precision, recall, F1)
were highest for seizure-free patients (Index Precision mean: 0.903) and those
with successful surgical outcomes (Index Precision mean: 0.865), whereas
failure cases exhibited lower concordance (Index Precision mean: 0.460). The
key takeaway is that chirp-based outlier detection, combined with weighted
spatial metrics, provides a complementary method for SOZ localization,
particularly in patients with successful surgical outcomes.

*Kamran Chitsaz,Roshan Balaji,Quentin Fournier,Nirav Pravinbhai Bhatt,Sarath Chandar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: NovoMolGen is a transformer-based Mol-LLM pretrained on 1.5B molecules; it reveals a weak link between pretraining metrics and downstream performance and achieves state-of-the-art in unconstrained and goal-directed molecule generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how standard language-modeling choices (representations, tokenization, model size, data scale) affect Mol-LLM performance in de-novo molecular design, given vast chemical space and emerging Mol-LLMs.

Method: Pretrain the NovoMolGen family on 1.5 billion molecules and perform systematic analyses by varying textual representations, tokenization strategies, model sizes, and dataset scales; evaluate on downstream generation tasks (both unconstrained and goal-directed) and compare with prior Mol-LLMs and specialized models.

Result: A weak correlation was found between pretraining performance metrics and downstream molecule-generation performance; molecular training dynamics differ from general NLP; NovoMolGen achieves state-of-the-art results, substantially outperforming prior Mol-LLMs and specialized models in both unconstrained and goal-directed generation.

Conclusion: NovoMolGen provides a robust foundation for efficient and effective molecular modeling, clarifying how design choices in Mol-LLMs impact de-novo molecule generation and setting a new performance baseline.

Abstract: Designing de-novo molecules with desired property profiles requires efficient
exploration of the vast chemical space ranging from $10^{23}$ to $10^{60}$
possible synthesizable candidates. While various deep generative models have
been developed to design small molecules using diverse input representations,
Molecular Large Language Models (Mol-LLMs) based on string representations have
emerged as a scalable approach capable of exploring billions of molecules.
However, there remains limited understanding regarding how standard language
modeling practices such as textual representations, tokenization strategies,
model size, and dataset scale impact molecular generation performance. In this
work, we systematically investigate these critical aspects by introducing
NovoMolGen, a family of transformer-based foundation models pretrained on 1.5
billion molecules for de-novo molecule generation. Through extensive empirical
analyses, we identify a weak correlation between performance metrics measured
during pretraining and actual downstream performance, revealing important
distinctions between molecular and general NLP training dynamics. NovoMolGen
establishes new state-of-the-art results, substantially outperforming prior
Mol-LLMs and specialized generative models in both unconstrained and
goal-directed molecular generation tasks, thus providing a robust foundation
for advancing efficient and effective molecular modeling strategies.

### [145] [Decentralized Contextual Bandits with Network Adaptivity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13411)
*Chuyun Deng,Huiwen Jia*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces two network-aware contextual linear bandit algorithms, NetLinUCB and Net-SGD-UCB, for distributed learning over networks with partial information sharing. They decompose learning into global/local components, achieve sublinear regret $O(\,\sqrt{N}\,)$ (vs. $O(N)$ for naive approaches), and reduce communication by sharing summaries of homogeneous features. NetLinUCB excels in low-noise, fine-grained heterogeneity; Net-SGD-UCB is robust to high-dimensional, high-variance contexts. Validated in simulated pricing environments against benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Contextual linear bandits over networks face partial information sharing: existing approaches are either fully centralized or fully isolated. There is a need for methods that exploit shared structure across locations while limiting communication, to accelerate learning in networked environments.

Method: Two algorithms, NetLinUCB and Net-SGD-UCB, that decompose learning into global and local components with dynamically updated network weights. Agents share summaries of homogeneous features to reduce communication relative to full centralization. Theoretical regret bounds show reduction from $O(N)$ to sublinear $O(\sqrt{N})$. NetLinUCB favors low-noise, finely heterogeneous settings; Net-SGD-UCB is robust in high-dimensional, high-variance contexts.

Result: Regret analysis demonstrates sublinear learning complexity $O(\sqrt{N})$ instead of linear in N. Empirical evaluation in simulated pricing tasks shows improvements over standard benchmarks, with complementary strengths: NetLinUCB for low-noise regimes and Net-SGD-UCB for high-dimensional, high-variance contexts.

Conclusion: Network-aware information sharing enables efficient distributed learning in networked contextual bandits by balancing global structure exploitation and local specialization, reducing communication costs and improving regret performance. The two algorithms offer complementary advantages across different noise and dimensionality regimes.

Abstract: We consider contextual linear bandits over networks, a class of sequential
decision-making problems where learning occurs simultaneously across multiple
locations and the reward distributions share structural similarities while also
exhibiting local differences. While classical contextual bandits assume either
fully centralized data or entirely isolated learners, much remains unexplored
in networked environments when information is partially shared. In this paper,
we address this gap by developing two network-aware Upper Confidence Bound
(UCB) algorithms, NetLinUCB and Net-SGD-UCB, which enable adaptive information
sharing guided by dynamically updated network weights. Our approach decompose
learning into global and local components and as a result allow agents to
benefit from shared structure without full synchronization. Both algorithms
incur lighter communication costs compared to a fully centralized setting as
agents only share computed summaries regarding the homogeneous features. We
establish regret bounds showing that our methods reduce the learning complexity
associated with the shared structure from $O(N)$ to sublinear $O(\sqrt{N})$,
where $N$ is the size of the network. The two algorithms reveal complementary
strengths: NetLinUCB excels in low-noise regimes with fine-grained
heterogeneity, while Net-SGD-UCB is robust to high-dimensional, high-variance
contexts. We further demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods across
simulated pricing environments compared to standard benchmarks.

*Jeremy Carleton,Debajoy Mukherjee,Srinivas Shakkottai,Dileep Kalathil*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A lightweight, inference-time framework (MAVIS) for multi-objective alignment of LLMs using per-objective value models and a tilting function to steer outputs by user-specified weights, without retraining the base model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable flexible, user-specific trade-offs among conflicting objectives (e.g., helpfulness, harmlessness, humor) without the cost of fine-tuning a model for every objective configuration.

Method: Train small value models, each corresponding to a distinct objective. At inference, combine these value models with user-specified weights to build a tilting function that reweights the base model’s output distribution toward desired trade-offs. The value models are learned via an iterative algorithm that guarantees monotonic improvement of a KL-regularized policy.

Result: Empirically, MAVIS outperforms baselines that fine-tune separate objective-specific models or that try to combine them post hoc, and it approaches the performance of an idealized setting where the model is fine-tuned for exact user preferences.

Conclusion: MAVIS provides a flexible, computation-efficient approach to dynamic, multi-objective alignment at inference time, reducing the need for retraining while achieving strong alignment performance.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed across diverse
applications that demand balancing multiple, often conflicting, objectives --
such as helpfulness, harmlessness, or humor. Aligning outputs to user-specific
preferences in such multi-objective settings typically requires fine-tuning
models for each objective or preference configuration, which is computationally
expensive and inflexible. We introduce MAVIS -- Multi-Objective Alignment via
Value-Guided Inference-Time Search -- a lightweight inference-time alignment
framework that enables dynamic control over LLM behavior without modifying the
base model's weights. MAVIS trains a set of small value models, each
corresponding to a distinct objective. At inference time, these value models
are combined using user-specified weights to produce a tilting function that
adjusts the base model's output distribution toward desired trade-offs. The
value models are trained using a simple iterative algorithm that ensures
monotonic improvement of the KL-regularized policy. We show empirically that
MAVIS outperforms baselines that fine-tune per-objective models and combine
them post hoc, and even approaches the performance of the idealized setting
where models are fine-tuned for a user's exact preferences.

### [147] [EventTSF: Event-Aware Non-Stationary Time Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13434)
*Yunfeng Ge,Ming Jin,Yiji Zhao,Hongyan Li,Bo Du,Chang Xu,Shirui Pan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: EventTSF introduces event-aware non-stationary time-series forecasting by fusing historical series with textual events via autoregressive diffusion with flow matching and a multimodal diffusion transformer, addressing synchronization, semantic uncertainty, and alignment, achieving notable accuracy gains and faster training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Non-stationary time series in critical domains are influenced by cross-modal events (texts). Existing single-modality models fail to capture fine-grained interactions due to synchronization, uncertainty, and alignment issues. There is a need for multimodal, temporally-aligned forecasting that leverages textual events.

Method: Autoregressive diffusion with step-wise flow matching; event-adaptive flow timesteps guided by event semantics; a multimodal U-shaped diffusion transformer to fuse temporal and textual modalities at multiple resolutions; end-to-end training for next-step forecasts.

Result: Outperforms 12 baselines across 8 datasets (synthetic and real-world) with about +10.7% higher forecasting accuracy and 1.13× faster training efficiency.

Conclusion: Integrating textual events into an autoregressive diffusion framework with adaptive flow and multimodal fusion yields robust, event-aware forecasts in non-stationary settings, illustrating the value of cross-modal temporal modeling.

Abstract: Time series forecasting plays a vital role in critical domains like energy
and transportation, where non-stationary dynamics are deeply intertwined with
events in other modalities such as texts. However, incorporating natural
language-based external events to improve non-stationary forecasting remains
largely unexplored, as most approaches still rely on a single modality,
resulting in limited contextual knowledge and model underperformance. Enabling
fine-grained multimodal interactions between temporal and textual data is
challenged by three fundamental issues: (1) the difficulty of fine-grained
synchronization between time-varying discrete textual events and continuous
time series; (2) the inherent temporal uncertainty introduced by textual
semantics; and (3) the misalignment between textual event embeddings and
multi-resolution temporal patterns. In this work, we address these challenges
by introducing event-aware non-stationary time series forecasting (EventTSF),
an autoregressive generation framework that integrates historical time series
with textual events to make subsequent forecasts. Specifically, EventTSF uses
autoregressive diffusion with flow matching at each step to capture nuanced
temporal-event interactions. To handle event-induced uncertainty, flow matching
timesteps are adaptively controlled according to event semantic signals. The
underlying denoiser employs a multimodal U-shaped diffusion transformer that
efficiently fuses temporal and textual modalities across different resolutions.
Extensive experiments on 8 synthetic and real-world datasets show that EventTSF
outperforms 12 baselines across diverse event-aware non-stationary time series
forecasting scenarios, achieving substantial improvements of 10.7% higher
forecasting accuracy and $1.13\times$ faster training efficiency.

### [148] [SVDformer: Direction-Aware Spectral Graph Embedding Learning via SVD and Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13435)
*Jiayu Fang,Zhiqi Shao,S T Boris Choy,Junbin Gao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SVDformer merges SVD with Transformer to create direction-aware graph representations by refining spectral components via self-attention and leveraging singular vectors/values to model directional multi-scale edge interactions, achieving state-of-the-art results on node classification in six directed-graph benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Directed graphs require capturing both directional semantics and global structural patterns. Existing GNNs rely on isotropic or localized filtering, which fails to jointly model directionality and spectral structure. A framework that jointly models spectral components and edge directions can improve representation learning on directed graphs.

Method: SVDformer refines singular value embeddings with multi-head self-attention to adaptively enhance spectral components and enable learnable low-pass/high-pass graph filtering without preset spectral kernels. It treats singular vectors as directional projection bases and singular values as scaling factors, using a Transformer to model multi-scale interactions between incoming/outgoing edge patterns via attention, thereby explicitly preserving edge directionality during propagation.

Result: Extensive experiments on six directed graph benchmarks show that SVDformer consistently outperforms state-of-the-art GNNs and direction-aware baselines on node classification tasks.

Conclusion: SVDformer establishes a new paradigm for learning representations on directed graphs by synergizing SVD and Transformer architectures to handle directionality and spectral information more effectively.

Abstract: Directed graphs are widely used to model asymmetric relationships in
real-world systems. However, existing directed graph neural networks often
struggle to jointly capture directional semantics and global structural
patterns due to their isotropic aggregation mechanisms and localized filtering
mechanisms. To address this limitation, this paper proposes SVDformer, a novel
framework that synergizes SVD and Transformer architecture for direction-aware
graph representation learning. SVDformer first refines singular value
embeddings through multi-head self-attention, adaptively enhancing critical
spectral components while suppressing high-frequency noise. This enables
learnable low-pass/high-pass graph filtering without requiring spectral
kernels. Furthermore, by treating singular vectors as directional projection
bases and singular values as scaling factors, SVDformer uses the Transformer to
model multi-scale interactions between incoming/outgoing edge patterns through
attention weights, thereby explicitly preserving edge directionality during
feature propagation. Extensive experiments on six directed graph benchmarks
demonstrate that SVDformer consistently outperforms state-of-the-art GNNs and
direction-aware baselines on node classification tasks, establishing a new
paradigm for learning representations on directed graphs.

TL;DR: Metalearning-driven dynamic search-space design for AutoML reduces compute and narrows search space while preserving performance; demonstrates integration with Auto-Sklearn and provides insights on meta-features and explainability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AutoML faces high computational costs and risk of overfitting due to large search spaces and generic optimization methods.

Method: Leverage historical meta-knowledge to identify promising regions of the search space; dynamically design search space for AutoML; validate via experiments showing runtime and space reductions; analyze meta-feature selection and explainability.

Result: 89% runtime reduction with Random Search; reductions in search space for preprocessors and classifiers to ~14% and ~27% of original; competitive performance when adapted to Auto-Sklearn; provides insights on meta-features and trade-offs.

Conclusion: Dynamic metalearning-based search-space design is an effective strategy to accelerate AutoML while controlling overfitting; offers practical insights for meta-feature selection and explainability; suggests potential integration with existing AutoML systems.

Abstract: Automated machine learning (AutoML) has democratized the design of machine
learning based systems, by automating model selection, hyperparameter tuning
and feature engineering. However, the high computational cost associated with
traditional search and optimization strategies, such as Random Search, Particle
Swarm Optimization and Bayesian Optimization, remains a significant challenge.
Moreover, AutoML systems typically explore a large search space, which can lead
to overfitting. This paper introduces a metalearning method for dynamically
designing search spaces for AutoML system. The proposed method uses historical
metaknowledge to select promising regions of the search space, accelerating the
optimization process. According to experiments conducted for this study, the
proposed method can reduce runtime by 89\% in Random Search and search space by
(1.8/13 preprocessor and 4.3/16 classifier), without compromising significant
predictive performance. Moreover, the proposed method showed competitive
performance when adapted to Auto-Sklearn, reducing its search space.
Furthermore, this study encompasses insights into meta-feature selection,
meta-model explainability, and the trade-offs inherent in search space
reduction strategies.

*Heewon Park,Mugon Joe,Miru Kim,Minhae Kwon*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ASAP is a lightweight, unsupervised method that adapts learning rates for online label shift by mapping cosine distance of consecutive unlabeled outputs to a bounded range, improving accuracy and efficiency without labels or ensembles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Online label shift degrades model performance over time and requires careful learning-rate tuning; existing solutions often rely on labeled data or extra machinery, hindering practical deployment.

Method: ASAP computes the cosine distance between the current and previous unlabeled outputs (softmax vectors) and maps it into a bounded range to produce an adaptive learning rate; it requires no labels, no ensembles, and uses only the prior softmax output for fast, lightweight adaptation.

Result: Across multiple datasets and shift scenarios, ASAP consistently improves accuracy and efficiency, demonstrating practical unsupervised model adaptation.

Conclusion: ASAP enables stable and effective unsupervised adaptation to label drift with a simple, low-cost approach suitable for real-world deployment.

Abstract: In real-world applications, machine learning models face online label shift,
where label distributions change over time. Effective adaptation requires
careful learning rate selection: too low slows adaptation and too high causes
instability. We propose ASAP (Adaptive Shift Aware Post-training), which
dynamically adjusts the learning rate by computing the cosine distance between
current and previous unlabeled outputs and mapping it within a bounded range.
ASAP requires no labels, model ensembles, or past inputs, using only the
previous softmax output for fast, lightweight adaptation. Experiments across
multiple datasets and shift scenarios show ASAP consistently improves accuracy
and efficiency, making it practical for unsupervised model adaptation.

*Ruobing Jiang,Mengzhe Liu,Haobing Liu,Yanwei Yu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A hierarchical multi-label classifier (HCAL) that merges multi-task learning with prototype contrastive learning, adaptive task weighting, and prototype perturbation to boost hierarchical consistency and accuracy, introducing Hierarchical Violation Rate (HVR) for evaluation; demonstrated improvements on three datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address critical challenges in hierarchical multi-label classification: maintaining structural consistency under varying label dependencies and balancing loss weights in multi-task learning (mitigating the one-strong-many-weak bias), while improving robustness and generalization.

Method: Propose HCAL, a classifier that integrates prototype-based label modeling with child-to-parent feature aggregation. It employs prototype contrastive learning and an adaptive loss-weighting mechanism driven by task convergence rates. A prototype perturbation strategy injects controlled noise to expand decision boundaries. Introduces Hierarchical Violation Rate (HVR) to quantify hierarchical consistency.

Result: Extensive experiments on three datasets show higher classification accuracy and a reduced Hierarchical Violation Rate compared with baseline models.

Conclusion: HCAL yields improved hierarchical consistency and accuracy, resists hierarchical violations, and gains robustness through adaptive weighting and prototype perturbation; HVR provides a quantitative measure for hierarchical generalization.

Abstract: Hierarchical Multi-Label Classification (HMC) faces critical challenges in
maintaining structural consistency and balancing loss weighting in Multi-Task
Learning (MTL). In order to address these issues, we propose a classifier
called HCAL based on MTL integrated with prototype contrastive learning and
adaptive task-weighting mechanisms. The most significant advantage of our
classifier is semantic consistency including both prototype with explicitly
modeling label and feature aggregation from child classes to parent classes.
The other important advantage is an adaptive loss-weighting mechanism that
dynamically allocates optimization resources by monitoring task-specific
convergence rates. It effectively resolves the "one-strong-many-weak"
optimization bias inherent in traditional MTL approaches. To further enhance
robustness, a prototype perturbation mechanism is formulated by injecting
controlled noise into prototype to expand decision boundaries. Additionally, we
formalize a quantitative metric called Hierarchical Violation Rate (HVR) as to
evaluate hierarchical consistency and generalization. Extensive experiments
across three datasets demonstrate both the higher classification accuracy and
reduced hierarchical violation rate of the proposed classifier over baseline
models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: t-SNE-based, interpretable embeddings of chirp features enable clinical stratification; RF/k-NN achieve up to 88.8% accuracy for optimal-case detection, aided by SHAP-based local feature attribution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: to create an interpretable, visualization-driven pipeline that preserves local structure in high-dimensional chirp features and supports clinical decision-making through class separation and feature attribution.

Method: apply t-SNE to chirp-derived temporal, spectral, and frequency features to obtain 2D embeddings; formulate three classification tasks on embeddings; train and evaluate four classifiers (Random Forest, SVM, Logistic Regression, k-Nearest Neighbors) with stratified 5-fold cross-validation; use SHAP explanations on the t-SNE predictor to generate feature-influence maps in embedding space.

Result: Random Forest and k-NN yielded best performance, achieving up to 88.8% accuracy for identifying optimal cases (successful outcomes with minimal clinical difficulty); SHAP maps revealed spatially localized feature importance that aligns with regional clustering in the embedding.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates the viability of interpretable embeddings combined with local feature attribution to support clinical stratification and decision-making, emphasizing the role of chirp features in shaping the latent structure.

Abstract: This study presents a pipeline leveraging t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor
Embedding (t-SNE) for interpretable visualizations of chirp features across
diverse outcome scenarios. The dataset, comprising chirp-based temporal,
spectral, and frequency metrics. Using t-SNE, local neighborhood relationships
were preserved while addressing the crowding problem through Student
t-distribution-based similarity optimization. Three classification tasks were
formulated on the 2D t-SNE embeddings: (1) distinguishing clinical success from
failure/no-resection, (2) separating high-difficulty from low-difficulty cases,
and (3) identifying optimal cases, defined as successful outcomes with minimal
clinical difficulty. Four classifiers, namely, Random Forests, Support Vector
Machines, Logistic Regression, and k-Nearest Neighbors, were trained and
evaluated using stratified 5-fold cross-validation. Across tasks, the Random
Forest and k-NN classifiers demonstrated superior performance, achieving up to
88.8% accuracy in optimal case detection (successful outcomes with minimal
clinical difficulty). Additionally, feature influence sensitivity maps were
generated using SHAP explanations applied to model predicting t-SNE
coordinates, revealing spatially localized feature importance within the
embedding space. These maps highlighted how specific chirp attributes drive
regional clustering and class separation, offering insights into the latent
structure of the data. The integrated framework showcases the potential of
interpretable embeddings and local feature attribution for clinical
stratification and decision support.

*Pengyu Lai,Yixiao Chen,Hui Xu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DyMixOp uses inertial-manifold theory and a Local-Global-Mixing (LGM) transformation to map infinite-dimensional nonlinear PDE dynamics into a finite latent space, enabling a dynamics-informed neural operator with strong accuracy, especially in convection-dominated problems, while remaining efficient.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transforming and simulating nonlinear PDEs in infinite dimensions is challenging due to nonlinearizable dynamics and spectral bias in existing neural operators. An interpretable, finite-dimensional representation is desired to capture essential nonlinear interactions and temporal evolution with good scalability.

Method: Introduce DyMixOp, a neural operator framework grounded in inertial manifold theory that reduces PDE dynamics to a finite latent space. It features Local-Global-Mixing (LGM) transformations inspired by turbulence convection to capture fine-scale details and nonlinear interactions, and a dynamics-informed architecture that stacks multiple LGM layers to approximate linear and nonlinear dynamics over time.

Result: DyMixOp achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse PDE benchmarks, with significantly reduced prediction errors. Notably, it attains improvements up to 86.7% in convection-dominated scenarios and maintains computational efficiency and scalability.

Conclusion: The approach provides a principled, scalable, and interpretable neural operator for PDEs by reducing infinite-dimensional dynamics to a finite latent representation while preserving essential nonlinear interactions, demonstrating strong generalization across convection-dominated and multiscale PDEs.

Abstract: A primary challenge in using neural networks to approximate nonlinear
dynamical systems governed by partial differential equations (PDEs) is
transforming these systems into a suitable format, especially when dealing with
non-linearizable dynamics or the need for infinite-dimensional spaces for
linearization. This paper introduces DyMixOp, a novel neural operator framework
for PDEs that integrates insights from complex dynamical systems to address
this challenge. Grounded in inertial manifold theory, DyMixOp transforms
infinite-dimensional nonlinear PDE dynamics into a finite-dimensional latent
space, establishing a structured foundation that maintains essential nonlinear
interactions and enhances physical interpretability. A key innovation is the
Local-Global-Mixing (LGM) transformation, inspired by convection dynamics in
turbulence. This transformation effectively captures both fine-scale details
and nonlinear interactions, while mitigating spectral bias commonly found in
existing neural operators. The framework is further strengthened by a
dynamics-informed architecture that connects multiple LGM layers to approximate
linear and nonlinear dynamics, reflecting the temporal evolution of dynamical
systems. Experimental results across diverse PDE benchmarks demonstrate that
DyMixOp achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly reducing
prediction errors, particularly in convection-dominated scenarios reaching up
to 86.7\%, while maintaining computational efficiency and scalability.

*Jixian Li,Timbwaoga Aime Judicael Ouermi,Mengjiao Han,Chris R. Johnson*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes an uncertainty visualization called 'uncertainty tube' for neural network–predicted particle trajectories, using a superelliptical tube to capture non-symmetric uncertainty and integrating standard UQ methods (Deep Ensembles, MC Dropout, SWAG); validated on synthetic and simulation data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To quantify and visualize uncertainty in neural-network–predicted particle paths, addressing trustworthiness and reliability in applications where uncertainty matters.

Method: Introduce an uncertainty visualization called the uncertainty tube. Design a superelliptical tube to capture nonsymmetric uncertainty around predicted trajectories. Leverage established uncertainty quantification techniques (Deep Ensembles, MC Dropout, SWAG) for practical estimation, and demonstrate the approach on synthetic and simulation datasets.

Result: The method demonstrates practical utility and efficiency, showing the tube can represent non-symmetric uncertainty in NN-derived particle paths across multiple UQ techniques on synthetic and simulation data.

Conclusion: The uncertainty tube provides a concise, intuitive, and computationally efficient visualization of NN uncertainty for particle trajectories and is compatible with various UQ methods, enhancing trust in NN-based predictions.

Abstract: Predicting particle trajectories with neural networks (NNs) has substantially
enhanced many scientific and engineering domains. However, effectively
quantifying and visualizing the inherent uncertainty in predictions remains
challenging. Without an understanding of the uncertainty, the reliability of NN
models in applications where trustworthiness is paramount is significantly
compromised. This paper introduces the uncertainty tube, a novel,
computationally efficient visualization method designed to represent this
uncertainty in NN-derived particle paths. Our key innovation is the design and
implementation of a superelliptical tube that accurately captures and
intuitively conveys nonsymmetric uncertainty. By integrating well-established
uncertainty quantification techniques, such as Deep Ensembles, Monte Carlo
Dropout (MC Dropout), and Stochastic Weight Averaging-Gaussian (SWAG), we
demonstrate the practical utility of the uncertainty tube, showcasing its
application on both synthetic and simulation datasets.

### [155] [Explainability of Algorithms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13529)
*Andrés Páez*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The chapter analyzes two forms of opacity in AI— epistemic opacity due to technical complexity and intentional opacity due to proprietary concealment— and surveys explainable AI approaches, concluding that while progress exists, explainability remains fraught with challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Opacity hinders the ethical development of AI; clarifying what opacity means and its ethical consequences is essential, as is evaluating methods to overcome it.

Method: Conceptual analysis and literature review across AI ethics and computer science; division into two parts: definition/ethics of opacity and survey of explanation methods; argumentative synthesis rather than empirical results.

Result: Identifies two distinct opacity types (epistemic and proprietary); discusses ethical implications; provides a survey of XAI approaches and their limitations; notes persistent challenges in achieving satisfactory explainability.

Conclusion: Explainable AI has not yet solved opacity; significant challenges remain, and continued effort is required to realize ethically accountable and transparent AI systems.

Abstract: The opaqueness of many complex machine learning algorithms is often mentioned
as one of the main obstacles to the ethical development of artificial
intelligence (AI). But what does it mean for an algorithm to be opaque? Highly
complex algorithms such as artificial neural networks process enormous volumes
of data in parallel along multiple hidden layers of interconnected nodes,
rendering their inner workings epistemically inaccessible to any human being,
including their designers and developers; they are "black boxes" for all their
stakeholders. But opaqueness is not always the inevitable result of technical
complexity. Sometimes, the way an algorithm works is intentionally hidden from
view for proprietary reasons, especially in commercial automated decision
systems, creating an entirely different type of opaqueness. In the first part
of the chapter, we will examine these two ways of understanding opacity and the
ethical implications that stem from each of them. In the second part, we
explore the different explanatory methods that have been developed in computer
science to overcome an AI system's technical opaqueness. As the analysis shows,
explainable AI (XAI) still faces numerous challenges.

*Ziyan Wu,Ivan Korolija,Rui Tang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MuFlex is an open-source multi-building RL benchmarking platform enabling synchronized EnergyPlus simulations via Gym, demonstrated on four buildings to reduce peak demand while preserving IAQ using SAC.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations of existing testbeds that focus on single buildings or rely on simplified/data-driven models, and to provide a flexible, open, interoperable benchmarking tool for multi-building demand flexibility coordination under realistic physics.

Method: Develop MuFlex platform with synchronous information exchange across EnergyPlus models, adheres to the OpenAI Gym interface, enabling modular RL implementations; validated via a case study coordinating four office buildings with Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) and carefully tuned hyperparameters.

Result: Coordinating the four buildings reduces total peak demand below a specified threshold while maintaining indoor environmental quality.

Conclusion: MuFlex provides a scalable, open-source benchmark for multi-building flexibility control, enabling fair benchmarking and interpretable RL strategies; demonstrates the feasibility of coordinated demand response among multiple buildings using RL.

Abstract: With the increasing penetration of renewable generation on the power grid,
maintaining system balance requires coordinated demand flexibility from
aggregations of buildings. Reinforcement learning (RL) has been widely explored
for building controls because of its model-free nature. Open-source simulation
testbeds are essential not only for training RL agents but also for fairly
benchmarking control strategies. However, most building-sector testbeds target
single buildings; multi-building platforms are relatively limited and typically
rely on simplified models (e.g., Resistance-Capacitance) or data-driven
approaches, which lack the ability to fully capture the physical intricacies
and intermediate variables necessary for interpreting control performance.
Moreover, these platforms often impose fixed inputs, outputs, and model
formats, restricting their applicability as benchmarking tools across diverse
control scenarios. To address these gaps, MuFlex, a scalable, open-source
platform for benchmarking and testing control strategies for multi-building
flexibility coordination, was developed in this study. MuFlex enables
synchronous information exchange across EnergyPlus building models and adheres
to the latest OpenAI Gym interface, providing a modular, standardized RL
implementation. The platform capabilities were demonstrated in a case study
coordinating demand flexibility across four office buildings using the Soft
Actor-Critic algorithm with carefully fine-tuned hyperparameters. The results
show that aggregating the four buildings flexibility reduced total peak demand
below a specified threshold while maintaining indoor environmental quality.

*Rituparna Datta,Jiaming Cui,Gregory R. Madden,Anil Vullikanti*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A hybrid neural-network/mechanistic metapopulation model (CALYPSO) for MRSA spread that improves multi-scale forecasts and supports policy analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Public health threat of MRSA; limitations of purely statistical/ML or purely mechanistic models; need interpretable, data-integrated forecasting and policy evaluation.

Method: Integrates neural networks with mechanistic metapopulation models; uses insurance claims, commuting data, healthcare transfers to learn region/time-specific parameters; forecasts at county, facility, region, state; enables counterfactual analyses.

Result: Forecasting accuracy improved by >4.5% over ML baselines; identifies high-risk regions; enables cost-effective resource allocation strategies for infection prevention.

Conclusion: CALYPSO bridges ML and epidemiology to provide interpretable, scalable MRSA forecasting and policy analysis across multiple spatial resolutions.

Abstract: Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is a critical public
health threat within hospitals as well as long-term care facilities. Better
understanding of MRSA risks, evaluation of interventions and forecasting MRSA
rates are important public health problems. Existing forecasting models rely on
statistical or neural network approaches, which lack epidemiological
interpretability, and have limited performance. Mechanistic epidemic models are
difficult to calibrate and limited in incorporating diverse datasets. We
present CALYPSO, a hybrid framework that integrates neural networks with
mechanistic metapopulation models to capture the spread dynamics of infectious
diseases (i.e., MRSA) across healthcare and community settings. Our model
leverages patient-level insurance claims, commuting data, and healthcare
transfer patterns to learn region- and time-specific parameters governing MRSA
spread. This enables accurate, interpretable forecasts at multiple spatial
resolutions (county, healthcare facility, region, state) and supports
counterfactual analyses of infection control policies and outbreak risks. We
also show that CALYPSO improves statewide forecasting performance by over 4.5%
compared to machine learning baselines, while also identifying high-risk
regions and cost-effective strategies for allocating infection prevention
resources.

### [158] [Collapsing ROC approach for risk prediction research on both common and rare variants](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13552)
*Changshuai Wei,Qing Lu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a collapsing ROC (CROC) approach to risk prediction using both common and rare genetic variants; shows improvements over FROC and rare-variant-only scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve clinical utility of genetic risk prediction by incorporating rare variants, addressing the accuracy limitations of models based only on common variants.

Method: Extend forward ROC (FROC) to collapsing ROC (CROC) with procedures for rare variant handling; evaluate on GAW17 mini-exome data (533 SNPs across 37 genes).

Result: CROC using all SNPs yields AUC 0.605 vs FROC 0.585 with common variants; when reducing common variants, CROC remains more accurate; in rare-variant-only scenario, CROC AUC 0.603 vs FROC 0.524.

Conclusion: CROC is a more accurate framework for risk prediction that leverages both common and rare variants, indicating potential for improved public health and clinical decision-making, especially as rare variants are incorporated.

Abstract: Risk prediction that capitalizes on emerging genetic findings holds great
promise for improving public health and clinical care. However, recent risk
prediction research has shown that predictive tests formed on existing common
genetic loci, including those from genome-wide association studies, have lacked
sufficient accuracy for clinical use. Because most rare variants on the genome
have not yet been studied for their role in risk prediction, future disease
prediction discoveries should shift toward a more comprehensive risk prediction
strategy that takes into account both common and rare variants. We are
proposing a collapsing receiver operating characteristic CROC approach for risk
prediction research on both common and rare variants. The new approach is an
extension of a previously developed forward ROC FROC approach, with additional
procedures for handling rare variants. The approach was evaluated through the
use of 533 single-nucleotide polymorphisms SNPs in 37 candidate genes from the
Genetic Analysis Workshop 17 mini-exome data set. We found that a prediction
model built on all SNPs gained more accuracy AUC = 0.605 than one built on
common variants alone AUC = 0.585. We further evaluated the performance of two
approaches by gradually reducing the number of common variants in the analysis.
We found that the CROC method attained more accuracy than the FROC method when
the number of common variants in the data decreased. In an extreme scenario,
when there are only rare variants in the data, the CROC reached an AUC value of
0.603, whereas the FROC had an AUC value of 0.524.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A generative probabilistic model (GenHAI) models MRSA test-result sequences during a single hospitalization to aid hospital administrators in risk mitigation; evaluated against ML baselines on two real-world datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MRSA poses high risk in hospitalized patients; there is a need for a model that can answer predictive, causal, and counterfactual questions to guide mitigation strategies using patient-to-patient and process-level data; probabilistic programming enables such inquiries.

Method: Introduce GenHAI, a generative probabilistic model for sequences of MRSA test outcomes in a hospitalization. Built within a probabilistic programming framework; capable of answering predictive, causal, and counterfactual questions. Evaluation against discriminative and generative ML models on two real-world datasets.

Result: GenHAI demonstrates efficacy by outperforming or competitively matching baselines across two real-world datasets, highlighting the value of a generative, probabilistic approach for MRSA sequence modeling.

Conclusion: GenHAI offers a flexible, interpretable tool for hospital administrators to assess and mitigate MRSA infection risk, enabling predictive, causal, and counterfactual analyses within hospital settings.

Abstract: The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), in 2019, designated
Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) as a serious antimicrobial
resistance threat. The risk of acquiring MRSA and suffering life-threatening
consequences due to it remains especially high for hospitalized patients due to
a unique combination of factors, including: co-morbid conditions, immuno
suppression, antibiotic use, and risk of contact with contaminated hospital
workers and equipment. In this paper, we present a novel generative
probabilistic model, GenHAI, for modeling sequences of MRSA test results
outcomes for patients during a single hospitalization. This model can be used
to answer many important questions from the perspectives of hospital
administrators for mitigating the risk of MRSA infections. Our model is based
on the probabilistic programming paradigm, and can be used to approximately
answer a variety of predictive, causal, and counterfactual questions. We
demonstrate the efficacy of our model by comparing it against discriminative
and generative machine learning models using two real-world datasets.

### [160] [A Generalized Learning Framework for Self-Supervised Contrastive Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13596)
*Lingyu Si,Jingyao Wang,Wenwen Qiang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A generalized self-supervised contrastive learning framework (GLF) with an aligning and constraining part unifies BYOL, Barlow Twins, and SwAV, and introduces Adaptive Distribution Calibration (ADC) to induce intra-class compactness and inter-class separability without labels; theory and experiments show ADC's effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To unify existing SSCL methods under a common framework and address the lack of labels by designing a constraining component that preserves class information in feature space.

Method: Propose GLF comprising an aligning part and a constraining part; show BYOL, Barlow Twins, and SwAV as instantiations of GLF with different constraining terms; introduce ADC (Adaptive Distribution Calibration), a plug-and-play, iterative module that adjusts the similarity distribution so that samples near or far from an anchor in input space become correspondingly near or far in feature space, promoting intra-class compactness and inter-class separability without labels.

Result: Theoretical analysis supports the desired properties of ADC; extensive empirical evaluations demonstrate that ADC outperforms baseline SSCL methods, validating the proposed framework and calibration approach.

Conclusion: GLF with ADC provides a practical, label-free approach to learning discriminative representations by enforcing intra-class compactness and inter-class separability through adaptive distribution calibration, unifying several leading SSCL methods.

Abstract: Self-supervised contrastive learning (SSCL) has recently demonstrated
superiority in multiple downstream tasks. In this paper, we generalize the
standard SSCL methods to a Generalized Learning Framework (GLF) consisting of
two parts: the aligning part and the constraining part. We analyze three
existing SSCL methods: BYOL, Barlow Twins, and SwAV, and show that they can be
unified under GLF with different choices of the constraining part. We further
propose empirical and theoretical analyses providing two insights into
designing the constraining part of GLF: intra-class compactness and inter-class
separability, which measure how well the feature space preserves the class
information of the inputs. However, since SSCL can not use labels, it is
challenging to design a constraining part that satisfies these properties. To
address this issue, we consider inducing intra-class compactness and
inter-class separability by iteratively capturing the dynamic relationship
between anchor and other samples and propose a plug-and-play method called
Adaptive Distribution Calibration (ADC) to ensure that samples that are near or
far from the anchor point in the original input space are closer or further
away from the anchor point in the feature space. Both the theoretical analysis
and the empirical evaluation demonstrate the superiority of ADC.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the need for scalable and interpretable probabilistic inference when models operate with low-precision or quantized parameters, by enabling continuous distributions to be learned and reasoned about in a discrete parameter space.

Method: Develop a tractable learning framework using probabilistic circuits for 2D densities and quantized neural networks, enabling inference in a discrete parameter space that approximates continuous distributions.

Result: Demonstrates inference efficiency and maintained accuracy across various models; the approach scales to complex distributions and offers clearer insights into model behavior.

Conclusion: This work advances scalable and interpretable ML by leveraging discrete approximations for probabilistic computations, showing that probabilistic inference over quantized spaces can be both effective and insightful.

Abstract: The machine learning community has recently put effort into quantized or
low-precision arithmetics to scale large models. This paper proposes performing
probabilistic inference in the quantized, discrete parameter space created by
these representations, effectively enabling us to learn a continuous
distribution using discrete parameters. We consider both 2D densities and
quantized neural networks, where we introduce a tractable learning approach
using probabilistic circuits. This method offers a scalable solution to manage
complex distributions and provides clear insights into model behavior. We
validate our approach with various models, demonstrating inference efficiency
without sacrificing accuracy. This work advances scalable, interpretable
machine learning by utilizing discrete approximations for probabilistic
computations.

### [162] [Bounding Causal Effects and Counterfactuals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13607)
*Tobias Maringgele*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Systematic evaluation and unification of partial-identification bounding methods for causal effects, with an extension of entropy-based bounds to counterfactual queries (PNS), an empirical study across diverse data-generating processes, and practical guidance via a decision tree and a predictor, all integrated in an open-source package.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Causal inference often relies on unverifiable assumptions; partial identification offers bounds reflecting uncertainty but is underutilized due to fragmented methods and lack of practical guidance. A unified, empirical comparison can make partial identification more actionable.

Method: Implement and unify state-of-the-art bounding approaches (symbolic, optimization-based, information-theoretic). Extend an entropy-bounded method to PNS. Evaluate across thousands of randomized simulations with discrete and continuous data-generating processes. Assess bound tightness, computational efficiency, and robustness to assumption violations. Derive a practical decision tree for method selection and train a machine learning model to predict the best-performing method from observable data. Release all implementations in an open-source Python package, CausalBoundingEngine, with a unified interface.

Result: A comprehensive empirical comparison of bounding methods, an extended entropy-bounded approach applicable to PNS, a decision-tree-based guidance framework, and a predictive model to select methods. All methods are packaged in CausalBoundingEngine for easy use and comparison.

Conclusion: Partial identification methods become more usable in practice when provided within a unified framework that includes extensions to broader queries (like PNS), empirical performance data, and practical decision tools. The work lowers barriers to adoption by delivering guidance, automation, and open-source tooling.

Abstract: Causal inference often hinges on strong assumptions - such as no unmeasured
confounding or perfect compliance - that are rarely satisfied in practice.
Partial identification offers a principled alternative: instead of relying on
unverifiable assumptions to estimate causal effects precisely, it derives
bounds that reflect the uncertainty inherent in the data. Despite its
theoretical appeal, partial identification remains underutilized in applied
work, in part due to the fragmented nature of existing methods and the lack of
practical guidance. This thesis addresses these challenges by systematically
comparing a diverse set of bounding algorithms across multiple causal
scenarios. We implement, extend, and unify state-of-the-art methods - including
symbolic, optimization-based, and information-theoretic approaches - within a
common evaluation framework. In particular, we propose an extension of a
recently introduced entropy-bounded method, making it applicable to
counterfactual queries such as the Probability of Necessity and Sufficiency
(PNS). Our empirical study spans thousands of randomized simulations involving
both discrete and continuous data-generating processes. We assess each method
in terms of bound tightness, computational efficiency, and robustness to
assumption violations. To support practitioners, we distill our findings into a
practical decision tree for algorithm selection and train a machine learning
model to predict the best-performing method based on observable data
characteristics.
  All implementations are released as part of an open-source Python package,
CausalBoundingEngine, which enables users to apply and compare bounding methods
through a unified interface.

*Wenxuan Ye,Xueli An,Onur Ayan,Junfan Wang,Xueqiang Yan,Georg Carle*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FedOL enables heterogeneous clients to contribute to a larger server model in one shot through knowledge distillation on unlabeled public data, reducing communication and preserving privacy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Privacy constraints prevent sharing raw data, and resource-heterogeneous clients conflict with traditional FL that requires uniform architectures and multiple rounds. There is a need for a one-shot, communication-efficient method that scales to mobile devices while leveraging a powerful server model.

Method: Clients share only model predictions on a public unlabeled dataset. A one-shot distillation framework allows heterogeneous client architectures to contribute to a larger server model. An iterative objective refines pseudo-labels and the server model, mitigating bias from skewed local data. A tailored pseudo-label generation strategy integrates diverse knowledge from clients.

Result: Simulation results show FedOL significantly outperforms existing baselines, delivering a cost-effective solution for mobile networks where clients have private data but limited computing resources.

Conclusion: FedOL provides a practical, one-shot distillation-based FL approach that accommodates heterogeneous client models, reduces communication overhead, preserves privacy, and improves the learning of a larger server model.

Abstract: Large models, renowned for superior performance, outperform smaller ones even
without billion-parameter scales. While mobile network servers have ample
computational resources to support larger models than client devices, privacy
constraints prevent clients from directly sharing their raw data. Federated
Learning (FL) enables decentralized clients to collaboratively train a shared
model by exchanging model parameters instead of transmitting raw data. Yet, it
requires a uniform model architecture and multiple communication rounds, which
neglect resource heterogeneity, impose heavy computational demands on clients,
and increase communication overhead. To address these challenges, we propose
FedOL, to construct a larger and more comprehensive server model in one-shot
settings (i.e., in a single communication round). Instead of model parameter
sharing, FedOL employs knowledge distillation, where clients only exchange
model prediction outputs on an unlabeled public dataset. This reduces
communication overhead by transmitting compact predictions instead of full
model weights and enables model customization by allowing heterogeneous model
architectures. A key challenge in this setting is that client predictions may
be biased due to skewed local data distributions, and the lack of ground-truth
labels in the public dataset further complicates reliable learning. To mitigate
these issues, FedOL introduces a specialized objective function that
iteratively refines pseudo-labels and the server model, improving learning
reliability. To complement this, FedOL incorporates a tailored pseudo-label
generation and knowledge distillation strategy that effectively integrates
diverse knowledge. Simulation results show that FedOL significantly outperforms
existing baselines, offering a cost-effective solution for mobile networks
where clients possess valuable private data but limited computational
resources.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: T2W is a diffusion-transformer framework that generates task-specific neural network weights from natural language, improving generalization to unseen tasks and enabling weight enhancement and text-guided model fusion; it also provides an open dataset and code.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current neural weight-generation approaches struggle to generalize to unseen tasks and to explore practical applications; there is a need to connect textual semantics with weight-space dynamics for broad applicability.

Method: T2W hierarchically processes network parameters into uniform blocks, incorporates CLIP text embeddings via a prior attention mechanism, uses a diffusion-transformer architecture, and applies adversarial training with weight-space augmentation to improve generalization.

Result: On CIFAR-100, Caltech-256, and TinyImageNet, T2W generates high-quality weights for unseen tasks, outperforms optimization-based initialization, and enables applications such as weight enhancement and text-guided model fusion.

Conclusion: The work bridges textual semantics and weight-space dynamics, advancing practical neural parameter synthesis; it provides an open-source text–weight dataset and code on GitHub.

Abstract: How far are we really from automatically generating neural networks? While
neural network weight generation shows promise, current approaches struggle
with generalization to unseen tasks and practical application exploration. To
address this, we propose T2W, a diffusion transformer framework that generates
task-specific weights conditioned on natural language descriptions. T2W
hierarchically processes network parameters into uniform blocks, integrates
text embeddings from CLIP via a prior attention mechanism, and employs
adversarial training with weight-space augmentation to enhance generalization.
Experiments on Cifar100, Caltech256, and TinyImageNet demonstrate T2W's ability
to produce high-quality weights for unseen tasks, outperforming
optimization-based initialization and enabling novel applications such as
weight enhancement and text-guided model fusion. Our work bridges textual
semantics with weight-space dynamics, supported by an open-source dataset of
text-weight pairs, advancing the practicality of generative models in neural
network parameter synthesis. Our code is available on Github.

### [165] [Explainable Learning Rate Regimes for Stochastic Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13639)
*Zhuang Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes an automatic, parameter-free learning-rate schedule guided by the intrinsic variation of stochastic gradients via stochastic second-order ideas, eliminating manual tuning and improving SGD variants.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual learning-rate tuning is costly, brittle, and power- and time-inefficient in practice; an explainable, automatic LR adjustment would streamline training.

Method: Derives a learning-rate regime that increases when the norm of stochastic gradients decreases and decreases when the norm increases, leveraging stochastic second-order reasoning; implemented as an automatic procedure with no extra hyperparameters.

Result: Demonstrates efficiency, robustness, and scalability of the automatic LR regime across SGD, SGDM, and SIGNSGD on standard machine learning tasks.

Conclusion: An automatic, parameter-free, explainable LR regime that adapts to gradient variation and generalizes across common SGD variants, reducing manual tuning burden.

Abstract: Modern machine learning is trained by stochastic gradient descent (SGD),
whose performance critically depends on how the learning rate (LR) is adjusted
and decreased over time. Yet existing LR regimes may be intricate, or need to
tune one or more additional hyper-parameters manually whose bottlenecks include
huge computational expenditure, time and power in practice. This work, in a
natural and direct manner, clarifies how LR should be updated automatically
only according to the intrinsic variation of stochastic gradients. An
explainable LR regime by leveraging stochastic second-order algorithms is
developed, behaving a similar pattern to heuristic algorithms but implemented
simply without any parameter tuning requirement, where it is of an automatic
procedure that LR should increase (decrease) as the norm of stochastic
gradients decreases (increases). The resulting LR regime shows its efficiency,
robustness, and scalability in different classical stochastic algorithms,

### [166] [Personalized Subgraph Federated Learning with Sheaf Collaboration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13642)
*Wenfei Liang,Yanan Zhao,Rui She,Yiming Li,Wee Peng Tay*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FedSheafHN introduces a sheaf diffusion-based collaboration graph to unify client descriptors and uses a hypernetwork to generate personalized models in subgraph federated learning, achieving better performance and convergence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Heterogeneity of local subgraphs in subgraph FL causes performance variation; need unified client representations and efficient personalized models.

Method: Embed each client's subgraph into a server-constructed collaboration graph using graph-level embeddings; apply sheaf diffusion to enrich client representations; use server-optimized hypernetwork to generate customized models for each client.

Result: Empirically outperforms existing personalized subgraph FL methods on various graph datasets; fast model convergence; generalizes to new clients.

Conclusion: The FedSheafHN framework effectively handles heterogeneity and improves personalization in subgraph FL; the sheaf collaboration mechanism and hypernetwork enable robust and scalable personalized models.

Abstract: Graph-structured data is prevalent in many applications. In subgraph
federated learning (FL), this data is distributed across clients, each with a
local subgraph. Personalized subgraph FL aims to develop a customized model for
each client to handle diverse data distributions. However, performance
variation across clients remains a key issue due to the heterogeneity of local
subgraphs. To overcome the challenge, we propose FedSheafHN, a novel framework
built on a sheaf collaboration mechanism to unify enhanced client descriptors
with efficient personalized model generation. Specifically, FedSheafHN embeds
each client's local subgraph into a server-constructed collaboration graph by
leveraging graph-level embeddings and employing sheaf diffusion within the
collaboration graph to enrich client representations. Subsequently, FedSheafHN
generates customized client models via a server-optimized hypernetwork.
Empirical evaluations demonstrate that FedSheafHN outperforms existing
personalized subgraph FL methods on various graph datasets. Additionally, it
exhibits fast model convergence and effectively generalizes to new clients.

### [167] [GRAFT: Gradient-Aware Fast MaxVol Technique for Dynamic Data Sampling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13653)
*Ashish Jha,Anh huy Phan,Razan Dibo,Valentin Leplat*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GRAFT is a scalable in-training subset selection method that uses low-rank representations and a Fast MaxVol sampler to pick diverse, subspace-spanning mini-subsets and dynamically adjust subset size, preserving training trajectory while reducing compute and emissions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training modern neural networks on large datasets is computationally and environmentally costly; reducing wasted computation via smart subset selection aims to maintain performance while lowering wall-clock time, energy use, and CO2 emissions.

Method: For each batch, extract a low-rank feature representation; apply a Fast MaxVol sampler to select a small, diverse subset that spans the batch's dominant subspace; dynamically adjust the subset size using a gradient-approximation criterion; train on the selected subset rather than the full batch to preserve the training trajectory.

Result: GRAFT matches or exceeds recent selection baselines in accuracy and efficiency across benchmarks, while reducing wall-clock time, energy consumption, and CO2 emissions.

Conclusion: GRAFT provides a scalable, efficient in-training subset selection approach that preserves training dynamics and offers favorable trade-offs among accuracy, efficiency, and environmental impact.

Abstract: Training modern neural networks on large datasets is computationally and
environmentally costly. We introduce GRAFT, a scalable in-training subset
selection method that (i) extracts a low-rank feature representation for each
batch, (ii) applies a Fast MaxVol sampler to select a small, diverse subset
that spans the batch's dominant subspace, and (iii) dynamically adjusts the
subset size using a gradient-approximation criterion. By operating in low-rank
subspaces and training on carefully chosen examples instead of full batches,
GRAFT preserves the training trajectory while reducing wall-clock time, energy
consumption, and $\mathrm{CO}_2$ emissions. Across multiple benchmarks, GRAFT
matches or exceeds recent selection baselines in both accuracy and efficiency,
providing a favorable trade-off between accuracy, efficiency, and emissions.

### [168] [Input Time Scaling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13654)
*Rapheal Huang,Weilong Guo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces Input Time Scaling, a query-time augmentation paradigm for LLMs, showing that input-level strategies during training and inference can boost performance, even with lower-quality data; reveals training-testing co-design and Less is More phenomena; reports strong 32B-model results on AIME and ensemble gains; commits to open-sourcing datasets and pipelines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenge the dominant focus on data quantity/quality alone by exploring input-time strategies that leverage meta-knowledge and query refinement to unlock higher reasoning with possibly imperfect data.

Method: Apply input-time query strategies during both training and testing, using meta-knowledge to refine prompts; explore adding irrelevant information, randomly selecting examples from minimally filtered datasets, and dataset size/quality variations; evaluate on Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct and related models; test ensemble via majority voting; emphasize training-testing co-design.

Result: Achieves SOTA performance among 32B models on AIME24 (76.7%) and AIME25 (76.7%) pass@1; with a three-model majority vote, AIME24 remains 76.7% and AIME25 improves to 80%; starting from DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B, best result could be 86.7% on AIME24 and 76.7% on AIME25; evidence supporting training-testing co-design and compatibility with the Less is More paradigm.

Conclusion: Input Time Scaling offers a complementary scaling pathway to traditional data/training scaling. Data quality/quantity effects are nuanced, with surprising benefits from lower-quality or augmented inputs. Ongoing openness (datasets, pipelines, checkpoints) aims to enhance reproducibility and further research.

Abstract: Current Large Language Models (LLMs) are usually post-trained on large-scale
carefully curated datasets (data & training scaling) and doing reasoning in
test time (inference time scaling). In this work, we present a new scaling
paradigm, Input Time Scaling, to complement previous scaling methods by putting
resources on queries (input time). During training and testing, we combine
meta-knowledge from LLMs to refine inputs with different strategies. We also
find a new phenomenon, training-testing co-design there. We need to apply query
strategies during both training and testing. Only applying strategies on
training or testing would seriously degrade the performance. We are also
surprised to find that seemingly low data quality datasets can gain high
performance. Adding irrelevant information to the queries, randomly selecting
examples from a minimally filtered dataset, can even perform the best. These
findings contradict the widely held inductive bias, "garbage in, garbage out".
Curating datasets with seemingly high-quality data can even potentially limit
the performance ceiling. In addition, models trained on more data with similar
quality (15k VS 1k) perform worse, simple dataset size scaling should also be
carefully inspected. The good news is that our findings are compatible with the
Less is More phenomenon. A small set of examples is enough to evoke high-level
reasoning ability. With experiments on models trained on Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct,
we are able to reach SOTA performance among 32B models on AIME24(76.7%) and
AIME25(76.7%) pass@1. We can further achieve AIME24(76.7%) and AIME25(80%) with
a majority vote of three models. Starting from DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B,
the best result would be 86.7% on AIME24 and 76.7% on AIME25. To facilitate
reproducibility and further research, we are working on open-source our
datasets, data pipelines, evaluation results, and checkpoints.

### [169] [In-Context Decision Making for Optimizing Complex AutoML Pipelines](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13657)
*Amir Rezaei Balef,Katharina Eggensperger*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PS-PFN extends CASH to adapt modern ML pipelines using Posterior Sampling for max k-armed bandits, leveraging prior-data fitted networks (PFNs) to estimate the posterior of the best achievable value. It supports cost-aware pulls and per-arm PFNs, showing superior results on benchmarks. Code available.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The growing heterogeneity of ML pipelines (fine-tuning, ensembling, adaptation) makes traditional CASH insufficient. There is a need to efficiently select and adapt pipelines with varying costs, using data-driven priors to speed up learning.

Method: Extend Posterior Sampling for the max k-armed bandit to a CASH-like setting. Use PFNs to estimate the posterior distribution of the maximum reward via in-context learning. Incorporate cost-aware arm pulls and allow different PFNs modeling reward distributions per arm. Evaluate on one novel and two standard benchmarks; release code/data.

Result: PS-PFN demonstrates superior performance compared to other bandit strategies and AutoML baselines on the benchmark tasks.

Conclusion: PS-PFN provides an effective framework for selecting and adapting modern ML pipelines within CASH, leveraging PFN-based posterior estimation and cost-aware exploration to improve efficiency and performance; code and data are publicly available.

Abstract: Combined Algorithm Selection and Hyperparameter Optimization (CASH) has been
fundamental to traditional AutoML systems. However, with the advancements of
pre-trained models, modern ML workflows go beyond hyperparameter optimization
and often require fine-tuning, ensembling, and other adaptation techniques.
While the core challenge of identifying the best-performing model for a
downstream task remains, the increasing heterogeneity of ML pipelines demands
novel AutoML approaches. This work extends the CASH framework to select and
adapt modern ML pipelines. We propose PS-PFN to efficiently explore and exploit
adapting ML pipelines by extending Posterior Sampling (PS) to the max k-armed
bandit problem setup. PS-PFN leverages prior-data fitted networks (PFNs) to
efficiently estimate the posterior distribution of the maximal value via
in-context learning. We show how to extend this method to consider varying
costs of pulling arms and to use different PFNs to model reward distributions
individually per arm. Experimental results on one novel and two existing
standard benchmark tasks demonstrate the superior performance of PS-PFN
compared to other bandit and AutoML strategies. We make our code and data
available at https://github.com/amirbalef/CASHPlus.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A differentiable self-attention-based communication module for multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) that integrates with value-decomposition methods, uses a fixed parameter budget independent of the number of agents, and achieves state-of-the-art performance on SMAC maps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable effective communication among learning agents in MARL without relying on complex, non-differentiable protocols. Existing approaches are often hard to optimize end-to-end and scale poorly with the number of agents, hindering cooperative performance.

Method: Introduce a self-attention-based communication module that exchanges information between agents. The module is fully differentiable and produces messages in a reward-driven manner. It can be integrated with any action-value function decomposition method and acts as an extension to such decompositions, with a fixed number of trainable parameters regardless of the number of agents.

Result: Experimental results on the SMAC benchmark show that the proposed module delivers state-of-the-art performance on several maps, demonstrating its effectiveness and scalability.

Conclusion: A differentiable, scalable communication mechanism based on self-attention can enhance MARL by enabling reward-driven messaging and easy integration with existing value-decomposition frameworks, achieving superior performance on challenging benchmarks.

Abstract: Communication is essential for the collective execution of complex tasks by
human agents, motivating interest in communication mechanisms for multi-agent
reinforcement learning (MARL). However, existing communication protocols in
MARL are often complex and non-differentiable. In this work, we introduce a
self-attention-based communication module that exchanges information between
the agents in MARL. Our proposed approach is fully differentiable, allowing
agents to learn to generate messages in a reward-driven manner. The module can
be seamlessly integrated with any action-value function decomposition method
and can be viewed as an extension of such decompositions. Notably, it includes
a fixed number of trainable parameters, independent of the number of agents.
Experimental results on the SMAC benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach, which achieves state-of-the-art performance on several maps.

### [171] [Heavy-tailed Linear Bandits: Adversarial Robustness, Best-of-both-worlds, and Beyond](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13679)
*Canzhe Zhao,Shinji Ito,Shuai Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This work introduces a general FTRL-based framework for adversarial heavy-tailed bandits, yielding the first best-of-both-worlds guarantees for heavy-tailed MABs and extending to heavy-tailed linear bandits; it also introduces HT-SPM learning rate and variance-reduced estimators to achieve robust regret bounds under heavy-tailed noise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Heavy-tailed observations and adversarial regimes pose significant challenges in bandit learning. While heavy-tailed linear bandits and MABs have been studied, prior work largely focuses on stochastic settings or restricted heavy-tailed MABs. There is a need for a general adversarial framework for heavy-tailed rewards that does not rely on truncation or non-negativity assumptions and can extend to linear settings.

Method: Propose a follow-the-regularized-leader (FTRL) algorithm over loss estimates shifted by a carefully designed bonus function. This yields a best-of-both-worlds (BOBW) result for heavy-tailed MABs in adversarial and stochastic regimes. Extend to finite-arm heavy-tailed linear bandits using a variance-reduced loss estimator and a data-dependent learning rate. Introduce heavy-ta-tailed noise aware stability-penalty matching (HT-SPM) to guarantee BOBW bounds under suitable conditions.

Result: For multi-armed bandits: worst-case regret of order Õ(T^{1/ε}) in the adversarial regime; gap-dependent Õ(log T) in the stochastic regime. For linear bandits with finite arms: regret Õ(d^{1/2} T^{1/ε}). HT-SPM provides BOBW guarantees for general heavy-tailed bandit problems; with a variance-reduced linear loss estimator, it delivers the first BOBW result for heavy-tailed linear bandits.

Conclusion: The paper presents a general framework that unifies adversarial and stochastic analysis under heavy-tailed noise, achieving the first best-of-both-worlds guarantees for heavy-tailed MABs and extending to heavy-tailed linear bandits. It introduces HT-SPM as a data-dependent mechanism to achieve BOBW, opening avenues for broader applications and refinements in heavy-tailed online learning.

Abstract: Heavy-tailed bandits have been extensively studied since the seminal work of
\citet{Bubeck2012BanditsWH}. In particular, heavy-tailed linear bandits,
enabling efficient learning with both a large number of arms and heavy-tailed
noises, have recently attracted significant attention
\citep{ShaoYKL18,XueWWZ20,ZhongHYW21,Wang2025heavy,tajdini2025improved}.
However, prior studies focus almost exclusively on stochastic regimes, with few
exceptions limited to the special case of heavy-tailed multi-armed bandits
(MABs) \citep{Huang0H22,ChengZ024,Chen2024uniINF}.
  In this work, we propose a general framework for adversarial heavy-tailed
bandit problems, which performs follow-the-regularized-leader (FTRL) over the
loss estimates shifted by a bonus function. Via a delicate setup of the bonus
function, we devise the first FTRL-type best-of-both-worlds (BOBW) algorithm
for heavy-tailed MABs, which does not require the truncated non-negativity
assumption and achieves an $\widetilde{O}(T^{\frac{1}{\varepsilon}})$
worst-case regret in the adversarial regime as well as an $\widetilde{O}(\log
T)$ gap-dependent regret in the stochastic regime. We then extend our framework
to the linear case, proposing the first algorithm for adversarial heavy-tailed
linear bandits with finite arm sets. This algorithm achieves an
$\widetilde{O}(d^{\frac{1}{2}}T^{\frac{1}{\varepsilon}})$ regret, matching the
best-known worst-case regret bound in stochastic regimes. Moreover, we propose
a general data-dependent learning rate, termed \textit{heavy-tailed noise aware
stability-penalty matching} (HT-SPM). We prove that HT-SPM guarantees BOBW
regret bounds for general heavy-tailed bandit problems once certain conditions
are satisfied. By using HT-SPM and, in particular, a variance-reduced linear
loss estimator, we obtain the first BOBW result for heavy-tailed linear
bandits.

*Nikolai Antonov,Prěmysl Šůcha,Mikoláš Janota,Jan Hůla*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A data-driven, feasibility-guaranteed heuristic for single-machine scheduling to minimize the total weight of tardy jobs, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Exact algorithms excel on typical instances but deteriorate in certain regions of the problem space. Data-driven approaches can offer scalable, structure-aware performance, but ensuring feasible solutions remains a key challenge in ML-based methods.

Method: A novel data-driven scheduling heuristic that blends machine learning with problem-specific characteristics. It learns scheduling guidance from job features (weight, duration, due date, deadline) and enforces feasibility to produce valid schedules, addressing a common ML shortcoming. The study also conducts a systematic exploration of ML models with a detailed model-selection process.

Result: Experimental results show significant improvements over the state-of-the-art in optimality gap, the number of optimal solutions, and adaptability across varied data scenarios.

Conclusion: Demonstrates the viability of data-driven scheduling with feasibility guarantees, provides practical model-selection guidance, and suggests flexibility and potential applicability to broader scheduling problems and real-world data.

Abstract: Existing research on single-machine scheduling is largely focused on exact
algorithms, which perform well on typical instances but can significantly
deteriorate on certain regions of the problem space. In contrast, data-driven
approaches provide strong and scalable performance when tailored to the
structure of specific datasets. Leveraging this idea, we focus on a
single-machine scheduling problem where each job is defined by its weight,
duration, due date, and deadline, aiming to minimize the total weight of tardy
jobs. We introduce a novel data-driven scheduling heuristic that combines
machine learning with problem-specific characteristics, ensuring feasible
solutions, which is a common challenge for ML-based algorithms. Experimental
results demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms the
state-of-the-art in terms of optimality gap, number of optimal solutions, and
adaptability across varied data scenarios, highlighting its flexibility for
practical applications. In addition, we conduct a systematic exploration of ML
models, addressing a common gap in similar studies by offering a detailed model
selection process and providing insights into why the chosen model is the best
fit.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Federated learning for supply-chain credit assessment with explainable AI: PBCS-based client selection, FedProx with homomorphic encryption, and a transformer encoder, delivering accurate, private, and interpretable credit decisions on real-world data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address privacy, information silos, class imbalance, Non-IID data, and the need for interpretability in supply chain credit scoring.

Method: Introduce Trans-XFed: a FedProx-based FL framework enhanced with homomorphic encryption and a transformer encoder; implement a performance-based client selection (PBCS) strategy using local F1 scores to mitigate imbalance and Non-IID effects; apply integrated gradients for explanations.

Result: Experimental results on real-world supply chain datasets show improved credit assessment accuracy compared with baselines while maintaining transparency and privacy.

Conclusion: Trans-XFed demonstrates that privacy-preserving, explainable, and accurate credit scoring is achievable in supply chains, though practical deployment must consider computational overhead, security of encryption, and interpretability validation.

Abstract: This paper proposes a Trans-XFed architecture that combines federated
learning with explainable AI techniques for supply chain credit assessment. The
proposed model aims to address several key challenges, including privacy,
information silos, class imbalance, non-identically and independently
distributed (Non-IID) data, and model interpretability in supply chain credit
assessment. We introduce a performance-based client selection strategy (PBCS)
to tackle class imbalance and Non-IID problems. This strategy achieves faster
convergence by selecting clients with higher local F1 scores. The FedProx
architecture, enhanced with homomorphic encryption, is used as the core model,
and further incorporates a transformer encoder. The transformer encoder block
provides insights into the learned features. Additionally, we employ the
integrated gradient explainable AI technique to offer insights into
decision-making. We demonstrate the effectiveness of Trans-XFed through
experimental evaluations on real-world supply chain datasets. The obtained
results show its ability to deliver accurate credit assessments compared to
several baselines, while maintaining transparency and privacy.

### [174] [DREAMS: Preserving both Local and Global Structure in Dimensionality Reduction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13747)
*Noël Kury,Dmitry Kobak,Sebastian Damrich*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DREAMS is a regularization-based dimensionality reduction method that interpolates between local structure (t-SNE) and global structure (PCA) to produce embeddings that preserve multi-scale structure in 2D visualizations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing DR methods typically preserve either local or global structure, not both, leaving a gap for faithful multi-scale visualization of high-dimensional data.

Method: Introduce DREAMS (Dimensionality Reduction Enhanced Across Multiple Scales) by adding a simple regularization term that combines t-SNE's local structure with PCA's global structure, yielding a spectrum of embeddings between t-SNE and PCA that balance both aspects efficiently.

Result: On seven real-world datasets (five single-cell transcriptomics, one population genetics), DREAMS qualitatively and quantitatively outperforms previous approaches in preserving structure across multiple scales.

Conclusion: DREAMS provides a practical and scalable means to achieve multi-scale structure preservation in 2D embeddings by bridging local and global information through regularization.

Abstract: Dimensionality reduction techniques are widely used for visualizing
high-dimensional data in two dimensions. Existing methods are typically
designed to preserve either local (e.g. $t$-SNE, UMAP) or global (e.g. MDS,
PCA) structure of the data, but none of the established methods can represent
both aspects well. In this paper, we present DREAMS (Dimensionality Reduction
Enhanced Across Multiple Scales), a method that combines the local structure
preservation of $t$-SNE with the global structure preservation of PCA via a
simple regularization term. Our approach generates a spectrum of embeddings
between the locally well-structured $t$-SNE embedding and the globally
well-structured PCA embedding, efficiently balancing both local and global
structure preservation. We benchmark DREAMS across seven real-world datasets,
including five from single-cell transcriptomics and one from population
genetics, showcasing qualitatively and quantitatively its superior ability to
preserve structure across multiple scales compared to previous approaches.

### [175] [Order Optimal Regret Bounds for Sharpe Ratio Optimization in the Bandit Setting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13749)
*Mohammad Taha Shah,Sabrina Khurshid,Gourab Ghatak*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Thompson Sampling for Sharpe-ratio optimization in Gaussian bandits achieves logarithmic regret with a tailored regret decomposition; provides upper and matching lower bounds and empirically outperforms baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sharpe ratio combines mean and variance; risk-aware sequential decision making; standard TS for cumulative reward doesn't capture risk; need learning guarantees under SR objective.

Method: Introduce SRTS: Thompson Sampling tailored to Sharpe ratio with unknown Gaussian rewards; develop a Sharpe-specific regret decomposition; derive upper regret bound and a matching lower bound; prove logarithmic regret; use Bayesian updates for mean and variance; empirical simulations compare against existing algorithms.

Result: Regret scales logarithmically with time; distribution-dependent factors reflect difficulty of distinguishing arms on SR; lower bound matches upper bound up to constants; empirical results show substantial improvements over baselines.

Conclusion: Validated that TS approaches can be adapted to risk-adjusted objectives like SR; theoretical guarantees and empirical gains; opens path for risk-aware bandit optimization.

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the problem of sequential decision-making for
Sharpe ratio (SR) maximization in a stochastic bandit setting. We focus on the
Thompson Sampling (TS) algorithm, a Bayesian approach celebrated for its
empirical performance and exploration efficiency, under the assumption of
Gaussian rewards with unknown parameters. Unlike conventional bandit objectives
focusing on maximizing cumulative reward, Sharpe ratio optimization instead
introduces an inherent tradeoff between achieving high returns and controlling
risk, demanding careful exploration of both mean and variance. Our theoretical
contributions include a novel regret decomposition specifically designed for
the Sharpe ratio, highlighting the role of information acquisition about the
reward distribution in driving learning efficiency. Then, we establish
fundamental performance limits for the proposed algorithm \texttt{SRTS} in
terms of an upper bound on regret. We also derive the matching lower bound and
show the order-optimality. Our results show that Thompson Sampling achieves
logarithmic regret over time, with distribution-dependent factors capturing the
difficulty of distinguishing arms based on risk-adjusted performance. Empirical
simulations show that our algorithm significantly outperforms existing
algorithms.

### [176] [Depth-Breadth Synergy in RLVR: Unlocking LLM Reasoning Gains with Adaptive Exploration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13755)
*Zhicheng Yang,Zhijiang Guo,Yinya Huang,Yongxin Wang,Dongchun Xie,Yiwei Wang,Xiaodan Liang,Jing Tang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Reward (RLVR) benefits from treating depth (problem hardness) and breadth (training data volume) as separate factors. The paper identifies a bias in GRPO that underweights hard problems, introduces Difficulty Adaptive Rollout Sampling (DARS) to adaptively emphasize difficult samples, and shows that large breadth with full-batch updates further boosts reasoning metrics. A combined DARS-B approach yields gains in Pass@K and Pass@1 without extra inference cost, suggesting depth and breadth are orthogonal levers for RLVR performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To unlock deeper reasoning capabilities in large language models via RLVR, the authors address two under-explored dimensions—depth (how hard problems to sample) and breadth (how many instances to train per iteration). They reveal an unintended bias in GRPO that undervalues hard problems, which limits reasoning advancement.

Method: 1) Diagnose GRPO bias and the impact of rollout size; 2) Propose Difficulty Adaptive Rollout Sampling (DARS) that re-weights hard problems through targeted multi-stage rollouts to increase positive rollouts for hard instances; 3) Scale breadth by using full-batch updates over multiple epochs, replacing PPO mini-batches; 4) Combine both approaches into DARS-B to co-optimize depth and breadth.

Result: DARS improves Pass@K without extra inference cost and robustly increases success on harder problems; naive enlargement of rollout size can hurt Pass@K; large-breadth training significantly improves Pass@1 and sustains high token-level entropy (ongoing exploration); DARS-B yields simultaneous gains in Pass@K and Pass@1.

Conclusion: Depth and breadth are orthogonal dimensions in RLVR. Adaptive depth exploration (DARS) and high-breadth training complement each other, jointly enhancing reasoning power without added inference cost.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Reward (RLVR) has emerged as a
powerful paradigm for unlocking reasoning capabilities in large language
models, yet its full potential is hindered by two under-explored dimensions:
Depth-the hardest problem a model can sample; Breadth-the number of instances
consumed in a single iteration. We dissect the popular GRPO algorithm and
reveal a systematic bias: the cumulative-advantage disproportionately weights
samples with medium accuracy, while down-weighting the low-accuracy instances
that are crucial for pushing reasoning boundaries. To rectify the depth
neglect, we introduce Difficulty Adaptive Rollout Sampling (DARS), which
re-weights hard problems through targeted multi-stage rollouts, thereby
increasing the number of positive rollouts for hard problems. Empirically,
naively enlarging rollout size only accelerates convergence and even hurts
Pass@K. Our DARS, in contrast, delivers consistent Pass@K gains without extra
inference cost at convergence. Just as we adaptively expanded the depth of
exploration, we now ask whether aggressively scaling the breadth of training
data can further amplify reasoning gains. To this end, we intensely scale batch
size and replace PPO's mini-batch iterations with full-batch updates over
multiple epochs. Increasing breadth significantly enhances Pass@1 performance.
Large-breadth training sustains high token-level entropy, indicating continued
exploration and reduced gradient noise. We further present DARS-B, which
augments DARS with large breadth, and demonstrate simultaneous gains in Pass@K
and Pass@1. The results confirm that breadth and adaptive exploration across
depth operate as orthogonal dimensions in RLVR, which are key to unleashing the
reasoning power of RLVR.

*Tian Sun,Yuqi Chen,Weiwei Sun*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PENGUIN introduces Periodic-Nested Group Attention to improve long-term time series forecasting by explicitly modeling multiple periodicities with grouped, multi-query attention and a periodic-nested relative attention bias, yielding superior results over MLP/Transformer baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Although Transformer-based models have advanced forecasting, effectively capturing long-range and periodic patterns in time series remains challenging. There is a need to explicitly model periodic structures (e.g., daily/weekly cycles) and to incorporate relative position biases to improve attention.

Method: Propose Periodic-Nested Group Attention (PENGUIN): a grouped attention mechanism where each group targets a specific periodicity using multi-query attention, augmented with a periodic-nested relative attention bias to directly capture periodic structures. The approach handles multiple coexisting periodicities by dividing attention into groups corresponding to different periods.

Result: Extensive experiments on diverse benchmarks show that PENGUIN consistently outperforms both MLP-based and Transformer-based forecasting models.

Conclusion: Explicitly modeling periodic structures and incorporating relative attention bias within a grouped, multi-query attention framework yields improved long-term time series forecasting performance, making PENGUIN a simple yet effective enhancement over existing Transformer-based approaches.

Abstract: Long-term time series forecasting (LTSF) is a fundamental task with
wide-ranging applications. Although Transformer-based models have made
significant breakthroughs in forecasting, their effectiveness for time series
forecasting remains debatable. In this paper, we revisit the significance of
self-attention and propose a simple yet effective mechanism, Periodic-Nested
Group Attention, namely PENGUIN. Our approach highlights the importance of
explicitly modeling periodic patterns and incorporating relative attention bias
for effective time series modeling. To this end, we introduce a periodic-nested
relative attention bias that captures periodic structures directly. To handle
multiple coexisting periodicities (e.g., daily and weekly cycles), we design a
grouped attention mechanism, where each group targets a specific periodicity
using a multi-query attention mechanism. Extensive experiments across diverse
benchmarks demonstrate that PENGUIN consistently outperforms both MLP-based and
Transformer-based models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Adaptive client selection in Federated Learning (ISP) yields up to 30% communication savings without sacrificing final accuracy, validated on vision transformers, real-world ECG classification, and with gradient compression.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Federated Learning reduces centralized data needs but suffers from high communication costs, especially with heterogeneous and dynamic client participation. The choice of how many clients participate per round is underexplored yet crucial for efficiency and scalability.

Method: Introduce Intelligent Selection of Participants (ISP), an adaptive mechanism that dynamically determines the optimal number of clients per training round to balance communication efficiency and model accuracy. Validation spans diverse setups including vision transformers, real-world ECG classification, and scenarios with gradient compression.

Result: ISP achieves consistent communication savings of up to 30% without a loss in final model quality across tested settings.

Conclusion: Adaptive selection of the number of participating clients is a distinct and impactful aspect of federated learning. ISP demonstrates that optimizing per-round client counts can substantially improve communication efficiency while preserving accuracy, with cross-domain applicability and particular relevance to ECG deployment.

Abstract: Rapid scaling of deep learning models has enabled performance gains across
domains, yet it introduced several challenges. Federated Learning (FL) has
emerged as a promising framework to address these concerns by enabling
decentralized training. Nevertheless, communication efficiency remains a key
bottleneck in FL, particularly under heterogeneous and dynamic client
participation. Existing methods, such as FedAvg and FedProx, or other
approaches, including client selection strategies, attempt to mitigate
communication costs. However, the problem of choosing the number of clients in
a training round remains extremely underexplored. We introduce Intelligent
Selection of Participants (ISP), an adaptive mechanism that dynamically
determines the optimal number of clients per round to enhance communication
efficiency without compromising model accuracy. We validate the effectiveness
of ISP across diverse setups, including vision transformers, real-world ECG
classification, and training with gradient compression. Our results show
consistent communication savings of up to 30\% without losing the final
quality. Applying ISP to different real-world ECG classification setups
highlighted the selection of the number of clients as a separate task of
federated learning.

### [180] [Assessing Trustworthiness of AI Training Dataset using Subjective Logic -- A Use Case on Bias](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13813)
*Koffi Ismael Ouattara,Ioannis Krontiris,Theo Dimitrakos,Frank Kargl*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a formal, uncertainty-aware framework for assessing dataset-level trustworthiness (e.g., bias) using Subjective Logic, instantiated on a bias property and validated on a traffic sign dataset in centralized and federated settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of dataset-level trust assessments for properties like bias, especially as AI systems rely on diverse training data and evidence can be incomplete or conflicting.

Method: Develops a Subjective Logic-based framework for trust propositions about training datasets, quantifying uncertainty; instantiates the bias property, and evaluates on a traffic sign recognition dataset in centralized and federated contexts.

Result: The approach captures class imbalance, remains interpretable, and demonstrates robustness in both centralized and federated settings.

Conclusion: This work provides the first formal framework for dataset-level trustworthiness (uncertainty-aware) for global properties such as bias, with empirical validation on a dataset and potential applicability to broader properties.

Abstract: As AI systems increasingly rely on training data, assessing dataset
trustworthiness has become critical, particularly for properties like fairness
or bias that emerge at the dataset level. Prior work has used Subjective Logic
to assess trustworthiness of individual data, but not to evaluate
trustworthiness properties that emerge only at the level of the dataset as a
whole. This paper introduces the first formal framework for assessing the
trustworthiness of AI training datasets, enabling uncertainty-aware evaluations
of global properties such as bias. Built on Subjective Logic, our approach
supports trust propositions and quantifies uncertainty in scenarios where
evidence is incomplete, distributed, and/or conflicting. We instantiate this
framework on the trustworthiness property of bias, and we experimentally
evaluate it based on a traffic sign recognition dataset. The results
demonstrate that our method captures class imbalance and remains interpretable
and robust in both centralized and federated contexts.

*Samuel Stocksieker,Denys pommeret,Arthur Charpentier*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A VAE-based latent-space data augmentation for imbalanced regression on tabular data using a disentangled VAE and smoothed bootstrap, yielding competitive results on IR benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Imbalanced distributions harm predictive performance, especially in regression; existing methods are mainly for classification; need a regression-focused IR approach. VAEs offer latent-space representations but struggle with imbalance; propose a tailored data-generation strategy.

Method: Model data with Variational Autoencoders to learn latent representations. To counter imbalance, generate data via a disentangled VAE plus a Smoothed Bootstrap in the latent space, creating a balanced augmentation strategy. Evaluate by numerical comparisons to competitors on IR benchmark datasets.

Result: Numerical comparisons show the proposed method achieves competitive performance against IR competitors on benchmark datasets; no explicit numbers provided in abstract.

Conclusion: Disentangled VAE with latent-space smoothed bootstrap is an effective data-generation approach for imbalanced regression on tabular data, enhancing learning under IR benchmarks; further empirical validation suggested.

Abstract: Imbalanced distribution learning is a common and significant challenge in
predictive modeling, often reducing the performance of standard algorithms.
Although various approaches address this issue, most are tailored to
classification problems, with a limited focus on regression. This paper
introduces a novel method to improve learning on tabular data within the
Imbalanced Regression (IR) framework, which is a critical problem. We propose
using Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) to model and define a latent
representation of data distributions. However, VAEs can be inefficient with
imbalanced data like other standard approaches. To address this, we develop an
innovative data generation method that combines a disentangled VAE with a
Smoothed Bootstrap applied in the latent space. We evaluate the efficiency of
this method through numerical comparisons with competitors on benchmark
datasets for IR.

### [182] [One Shot vs. Iterative: Rethinking Pruning Strategies for Model Compression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13836)
*Mikołaj Janusz,Tomasz Wojnar,Yawei Li,Luca Benini,Kamil Adamczewski*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Systematic comparison of one-shot vs iterative pruning shows tradeoffs: one-shot excels at light pruning, iterative shines at heavy pruning; proposes patience-based pruning and a hybrid method; code available.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite wide use of iterative pruning, rigorous, comprehensive benchmarking across settings has been lacking; need rigorous definitions and benchmarks across structured and unstructured pruning, across criteria and modalities to guide practitioners.

Method: Conducted one of the first thorough comparisons with rigorous definitions; benchmarked across structured and unstructured pruning; tested multiple pruning criteria and modalities; evaluated across pruning ratios; provided empirical analysis.

Result: One-shot pruning performs better at lower pruning ratios; iterative pruning performs better at higher ratios; each method has distinct advantages; a patience-based/pruning approach can outperform traditional methods in some scenarios.

Conclusion: Push for patience-based pruning and hybrid strategies tailored to goals and constraints; provide practical guidance for practitioners; source code available at GitHub.

Abstract: Pruning is a core technique for compressing neural networks to improve
computational efficiency. This process is typically approached in two ways:
one-shot pruning, which involves a single pass of training and pruning, and
iterative pruning, where pruning is performed over multiple cycles for
potentially finer network refinement. Although iterative pruning has
historically seen broader adoption, this preference is often assumed rather
than rigorously tested. Our study presents one of the first systematic and
comprehensive comparisons of these methods, providing rigorous definitions,
benchmarking both across structured and unstructured settings, and applying
different pruning criteria and modalities. We find that each method has
specific advantages: one-shot pruning proves more effective at lower pruning
ratios, while iterative pruning performs better at higher ratios. Building on
these findings, we advocate for patience-based pruning and introduce a hybrid
approach that can outperform traditional methods in certain scenarios,
providing valuable insights for practitioners selecting a pruning strategy
tailored to their goals and constraints. Source code is available at

### [183] [FedUP: Efficient Pruning-based Federated Unlearning for Model Poisoning Attacks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13853)
*Nicolò Romandini,Cristian Borcea,Rebecca Montanari,Luca Foschini*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FedUP is a lightweight federated unlearning method that prunes high-magnitude weights to remove malicious influence in FedAvg without full retraining, effective against colluding adversaries and scalable across IID/Non-IID data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Federated learning is vulnerable to model poisoning from malicious clients; traditional unlearning requires retraining or trust in clients, which fails when some participants are malicious or colluding. There is a need for efficient, robust unlearning that does not rely on trusted collaborators.

Method: FedUP uses only the last training-round weights to identify and zero out the highest-magnitude connections that diverge most between benign and malicious updates, effectively isolating malicious contributions by pruning over-influential connections while preserving benign information. This is done without complete retraining and under a strong threat model where up to nearly 50% of clients may be malicious and know the aggregation process.

Result: Experiments across IID and Non-IID data with label-flipping and backdoor attacks show FedUP reduces malicious influence such that the accuracy on malicious data matches a model retrained from scratch, while maintaining benign performance. It is faster and uses less storage than the state-of-the-art FU methods.

Conclusion: FedUP provides an effective, robust, and efficient solution for federated unlearning under aggressive adversaries by targeted pruning based on last-round weights, offering practical unlearning without full retraining and with strong performance guarantees across data distributions.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) can be vulnerable to attacks, such as model
poisoning, where adversaries send malicious local weights to compromise the
global model. Federated Unlearning (FU) is emerging as a solution to address
such vulnerabilities by selectively removing the influence of detected
malicious contributors on the global model without complete retraining.
However, unlike typical FU scenarios where clients are trusted and cooperative,
applying FU with malicious and possibly colluding clients is challenging
because their collaboration in unlearning their data cannot be assumed. This
work presents FedUP, a lightweight FU algorithm designed to efficiently
mitigate malicious clients' influence by pruning specific connections within
the attacked model. Our approach achieves efficiency by relying only on
clients' weights from the last training round before unlearning to identify
which connections to inhibit. Isolating malicious influence is non-trivial due
to overlapping updates from benign and malicious clients. FedUP addresses this
by carefully selecting and zeroing the highest magnitude weights that diverge
the most between the latest updates from benign and malicious clients while
preserving benign information. FedUP is evaluated under a strong adversarial
threat model, where up to 50%-1 of the clients could be malicious and have full
knowledge of the aggregation process. We demonstrate the effectiveness,
robustness, and efficiency of our solution through experiments across IID and
Non-IID data, under label-flipping and backdoor attacks, and by comparing it
with state-of-the-art (SOTA) FU solutions. In all scenarios, FedUP reduces
malicious influence, lowering accuracy on malicious data to match that of a
model retrained from scratch while preserving performance on benign data. FedUP
achieves effective unlearning while consistently being faster and saving
storage compared to the SOTA.

*Rouqaiah Al-Refai,Pankaja Priya Ramasamy,Ragini Ramesh,Patricia Arias-Cabarcos,Philipp Terhörst*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: An expert survey updates biometric modality evaluation, replacing the 1998 framework with current insights; face recognition improves, fingerprint vulnerabilities reduce reliability; expert ratings align with dataset uncertainty; disagreements point to open research challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a reliable, up-to-date framework for selecting biometric modalities in applications amid rapid tech progress and new vulnerabilities, addressing the gap left by the 1998 framework.

Method: Survey of 24 biometric specialists assessing modality properties; analysis of rating changes; assessment of inter-expert agreement; comparison with uncertainty across 55 biometric datasets.

Result: Notable shifts in modality properties (face up; fingerprint down); high agreement among experts; strong alignment between expert ratings and dataset uncertainty; disagreements highlight remaining challenges.

Conclusion: Integrating expert insight with empirical evidence yields a robust, current evaluation framework and points to key open challenges for future biometric research.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of authentication systems and their increasing reliance
on biometrics for faster and more accurate user verification experience,
highlight the critical need for a reliable framework to evaluate the
suitability of biometric modalities for specific applications. Currently, the
most widely known evaluation framework is a comparative table from 1998, which
no longer adequately captures recent technological developments or emerging
vulnerabilities in biometric systems. To address these challenges, this work
revisits the evaluation of biometric modalities through an expert survey
involving 24 biometric specialists. The findings indicate substantial shifts in
property ratings across modalities. For example, face recognition, shows
improved ratings due to technological progress, while fingerprint, shows
decreased reliability because of emerging vulnerabilities and attacks. Further
analysis of expert agreement levels across rated properties highlighted the
consistency of the provided evaluations and ensured the reliability of the
ratings. Finally, expert assessments are compared with dataset-level
uncertainty across 55 biometric datasets, revealing strong alignment in most
modalities and underscoring the importance of integrating empirical evidence
with expert insight. Moreover, the identified expert disagreements reveal key
open challenges and help guide future research toward resolving them.

### [185] [Fisher-Orthogonal Projection Methods for Natural Gradient Descent with Large Batches](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13898)
*Yishun Lu,Wesley Armour*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FOP (Fisher-Orthogonal Projection) is proposed to restore the effectiveness of second-order methods at very large batch sizes by using a variance-aware update that combines the average gradient with a gradient-difference component orthogonal to the Fisher metric, enabling scalable training with better generalization and faster convergence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large batch sizes reduce gradient noise, which undermines the ability of first-order optimizers to escape sharp minima. Second-order methods like KFAC suffer from excessive damping at large batches, erasing curvature advantages and performing like simple SGD. There is a need for an update rule that preserves curvature benefits without being destabilized by large batches.

Method: FOP constructs a variance-aware update by using gradients from two sub-batches. It augments the average gradient with a component from the gradient difference that is orthogonal to the average under the Fisher metric, thereby maintaining informative curvature cues while stabilizing updates at large batch sizes.

Result: The method claims to restore the effectiveness of the second-order approach at very large batch sizes, enabling scalable training with improved generalization and faster convergence compared to standard large-batch optimizers.

Conclusion: FOP offers a variance-aware, Fisher-orthogonal update strategy that preserves curvature information in large-batch training, making second-order methods practical for scalable deep learning.

Abstract: Modern GPUs are equipped with large amounts of high-bandwidth memory,
enabling them to support mini-batch sizes of up to tens of thousands of
training samples. However, most existing optimizers struggle to perform
effectively at such a large batch size. As batch size increases, gradient noise
decreases due to averaging over many samples, limiting the ability of
first-order methods to escape sharp or suboptimal minima and reach the global
minimum. Meanwhile, second-order methods like the natural gradient with
Kronecker-Factored Approximate Curvature (KFAC) often require excessively high
damping to remain stable at large batch sizes. This high damping effectively
washes out the curvature information that gives these methods their advantage,
reducing their performance to that of simple gradient descent. In this paper,
we introduce Fisher-Orthogonal Projection (FOP), a novel technique that
restores the effectiveness of the second-order method at very large batch
sizes, enabling scalable training with improved generalization and faster
convergence. FOP constructs a variance-aware update direction by leveraging
gradients from two sub-batches, enhancing the average gradient with a component
of the gradient difference that is orthogonal to the average under the
Fisher-metric.

### [186] [Revisiting Diffusion Q-Learning: From Iterative Denoising to One-Step Action Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13904)
*Thanh Nguyen,Chang D. Yoo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: OFQL introduces one-step action generation for diffusion-based offline RL by reframing Diffusion Q-Learning within the Flow Matching framework, learning an average velocity field to enable direct action sampling, eliminating multi-step sampling and recursive gradient updates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DQL relies on multi-step denoising for action generation during training and inference, which is computationally expensive and sensitive to error accumulation. A one-step, efficient approach is desirable but naive one-step application hurts performance. There is a need for a theoretically grounded method that enables one-step generation without extra models or distillation.

Method: OFQL reformulates DQL within the sample-efficient Flow Matching (FM) framework and replaces conventional curved FM trajectories with an average velocity field that directly generates actions in one step. This avoids auxiliary models, distillation, and multi-phase training, and uses FM to learn a velocity-based generative process.

Result: On D4RL benchmarks, OFQL outperforms DQL and other diffusion-based baselines, while significantly reducing training and inference time due to one-step generation and avoidance of recursive gradient updates.

Conclusion: OFQL enables fast, robust one-step diffusion-based offline RL by combining DQL with Flow Matching to learn an average velocity field, removing the need for multi-step sampling and iterative updates, and achieving strong empirical performance with improved efficiency.

Abstract: The generative power of diffusion models (DMs) has recently enabled
high-performing decision-making algorithms in offline reinforcement learning
(RL), achieving state-of-the-art results across standard benchmarks. Among
them, Diffusion Q-Learning (DQL) stands out as a leading method for its
consistently strong performance. Nevertheless, DQL remains limited in practice
due to its reliance on multi-step denoising for action generation during both
training and inference. Although one-step denoising is desirable, simply
applying it to DQL leads to a drastic performance drop. In this work, we
revisit DQL and identify its core limitations. We then propose One-Step Flow
Q-Learning (OFQL), a novel framework that enables efficient one-step action
generation during both training and inference, without requiring auxiliary
models, distillation, or multi-phase training. Specifically, OFQL reformulates
DQL within the sample-efficient Flow Matching (FM) framework. While
conventional FM induces curved generative trajectories that impede one-step
generation, OFQL instead learns an average velocity field that facilitates
direct, accurate action generation. Collectively, OFQL eliminates the need for
multi-step sampling and recursive gradient updates in DQL, resulting in faster
and more robust training and inference. Extensive experiments on the D4RL
benchmark demonstrate that OFQL outperforms DQL and other diffusion-based
baselines, while substantially reducing both training and inference time
compared to DQL.

*Tianheng Ling,Vipin Singh,Chao Qian,Felix Biessmann,Gregor Schiele*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Edge-based, energy-efficient sewer overflow forecasting using quantized Transformer/LSTM on FPGA; highlights a trade-off between accuracy and energy at 8-bit precision; Transformer favors accuracy, LSTM favors ultra-low energy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mitigate sewer overflow risk amid extreme weather by enabling reliable, local forecasting on edge devices, reducing cloud dependency and communication outages.

Method: End-to-end edge forecasting framework with lightweight Transformer and LSTM models, integer-only quantization, automated hardware-aware deployment to AMD Spartan-7 FPGA; 8-bit models tested on 24 hours of historical data.

Result: 8-bit Transformer: MSE 0.0376 with 0.370 mJ per inference; 8-bit LSTM: MSE 0.0432 with 0.009 mJ per inference; LSTM trains faster? (longer training time reported); energy-accuracy trade-off evident; code available on GitHub.

Conclusion: Local, energy-efficient forecasting is viable for resilient sewer systems; choose LSTM for ultra-low energy or Transformer for higher accuracy; model deployment should align with priorities.

Abstract: Extreme weather events, intensified by climate change, increasingly challenge
aging combined sewer systems, raising the risk of untreated wastewater
overflow. Accurate forecasting of sewer overflow basin filling levels can
provide actionable insights for early intervention, helping mitigating
uncontrolled discharge. In recent years, AI-based forecasting methods have
offered scalable alternatives to traditional physics-based models, but their
reliance on cloud computing limits their reliability during communication
outages. To address this, we propose an end-to-end forecasting framework that
enables energy-efficient inference directly on edge devices. Our solution
integrates lightweight Transformer and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models,
compressed via integer-only quantization for efficient on-device execution.
Moreover, an automated hardware-aware deployment pipeline is used to search for
optimal model configurations by jointly minimizing prediction error and energy
consumption on an AMD Spartan-7 XC7S15 FPGA. Evaluated on real-world sewer
data, the selected 8-bit Transformer model, trained on 24 hours of historical
measurements, achieves high accuracy (MSE 0.0376) at an energy cost of 0.370 mJ
per inference. In contrast, the optimal 8-bit LSTM model requires significantly
less energy (0.009 mJ, over 40x lower) but yields 14.89% worse accuracy (MSE
0.0432) and much longer training time. This trade-off highlights the need to
align model selection with deployment priorities, favoring LSTM for ultra-low
energy consumption or Transformer for higher predictive accuracy. In general,
our work enables local, energy-efficient forecasting, contributing to more
resilient combined sewer systems. All code can be found in the GitHub
Repository (https://github.com/tianheng-ling/EdgeOverflowForecast).

### [188] [Categorical Policies: Multimodal Policy Learning and Exploration in Continuous Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13922)
*SM Mazharul Islam,Manfred Huber*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Multimodal continuous-control policy via a latent categorical variable improves exploration and learning speed over Gaussian policies, evaluated on the DeepMind Control Suite.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Gaussian policies are often unimodal, which limits exploration and adaptation in complex, sparse-reward continuous control tasks where multiple behavioral modes may be advantageous.

Method: Propose a latent categorical distribution to select between behavior modes and generate actions conditioned on the chosen mode, with two differentiable sampling schemes to preserve end-to-end gradient-based optimization of a multimodal policy.

Result: On DeepMind Control Suite tasks, the multimodal (categorical) policy yields faster convergence and outperforms standard Gaussian policies due to improved exploration.

Conclusion: Categorical policies provide a principled mechanism for representing multimodality and structured exploration in continuous-control RL, improving performance and robustness.

Abstract: A policy in deep reinforcement learning (RL), either deterministic or
stochastic, is commonly parameterized as a Gaussian distribution alone,
limiting the learned behavior to be unimodal. However, the nature of many
practical decision-making problems favors a multimodal policy that facilitates
robust exploration of the environment and thus to address learning challenges
arising from sparse rewards, complex dynamics, or the need for strategic
adaptation to varying contexts. This issue is exacerbated in continuous control
domains where exploration usually takes place in the vicinity of the predicted
optimal action, either through an additive Gaussian noise or the sampling
process of a stochastic policy. In this paper, we introduce Categorical
Policies to model multimodal behavior modes with an intermediate categorical
distribution, and then generate output action that is conditioned on the
sampled mode. We explore two sampling schemes that ensure differentiable
discrete latent structure while maintaining efficient gradient-based
optimization. By utilizing a latent categorical distribution to select the
behavior mode, our approach naturally expresses multimodality while remaining
fully differentiable via the sampling tricks. We evaluate our multimodal policy
on a set of DeepMind Control Suite environments, demonstrating that through
better exploration, our learned policies converge faster and outperform
standard Gaussian policies. Our results indicate that the Categorical
distribution serves as a powerful tool for structured exploration and
multimodal behavior representation in continuous control.

*Bastian Schäfer,Lennart Purucker,Maciej Janowski,Frank Hutter*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Survey of 53 AutoFE methods reveals major usability issues: they are hard to use, poorly documented, lack active communities, and do not support user-set time/memory constraints; calls for usable, budget-aware AutoFE tools.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Assess the practicality and real-world usability of automated feature engineering methods for practitioners, beyond raw predictive accuracy.

Method: A qualitative and empirical survey of 53 AutoFE methods, focusing on usability aspects such as documentation quality, ease of use, community activity, configurability, and support for time/memory budgets.

Result: Across methods, usability is poor: difficult to adopt, insufficient documentation, no active communities, and no mechanisms to enforce time/memory constraints; highlights a gap between algorithmic development and practical usability.

Conclusion: Future AutoFE research should prioritize usability-oriented design, comprehensive documentation, active user communities, and built-in budget constraints to make AutoFE practically usable for practitioners.

Abstract: Tabular data, consisting of rows and columns, is omnipresent across various
machine learning applications. Each column represents a feature, and features
can be combined or transformed to create new, more informative features. Such
feature engineering is essential to achieve peak performance in machine
learning. Since manual feature engineering is expensive and time-consuming, a
substantial effort has been put into automating it. Yet, existing automated
feature engineering (AutoFE) methods have never been investigated regarding
their usability for practitioners. Thus, we investigated 53 AutoFE methods. We
found that these methods are, in general, hard to use, lack documentation, and
have no active communities. Furthermore, no method allows users to set time and
memory constraints, which we see as a necessity for usable automation. Our
survey highlights the need for future work on usable, well-engineered AutoFE
methods.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes two tabular SSP algorithms and a function-approximation SSP algorithm, with convergence guarantees and favorable empirical performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SSP is a fundamental RL problem class; many RL cost criteria can be cast as SSP, so convergent, scalable algorithms are valuable.

Method: Introduces two tabular algorithms for SSP in the tabular setting and one algorithm for SSP with function approximation; proves almost-sure convergence for all.

Result: Empirical results show tabular algorithms outperform established convergent RL methods; the function-approximation approach yields reliable performance compared with alternatives.

Conclusion: The work provides convergent SSP algorithms for both tabular and function-approximation regimes and demonstrates practical effectiveness.

Abstract: In this paper we propose two algorithms in the tabular setting and an
algorithm for the function approximation setting for the Stochastic Shortest
Path (SSP) problem. SSP problems form an important class of problems in
Reinforcement Learning (RL), as other types of cost-criteria in RL can be
formulated in the setting of SSP. We show asymptotic almost-sure convergence
for all our algorithms. We observe superior performance of our tabular
algorithms compared to other well-known convergent RL algorithms. We further
observe reliable performance of our function approximation algorithm compared
to other algorithms in the function approximation setting.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AutoScale uses multi-task optimization (MTO) metrics to guide linear scalarization weight selection, achieving strong performance with much less hyperparameter search.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Explain why fixed scalarization weights work, and reduce costly weight search by linking scalarization to MTO insights.

Method: Establish a direct connection between linear scalarization and MTO methods; analyze trends (e.g., gradient magnitude similarity) across weights; propose AutoScale—a two-phase framework that uses MTO metrics to choose scalarization weights without exhaustive search.

Result: AutoScale achieves superior or competitive performance with high efficiency across diverse datasets, including a new large-scale benchmark, without expensive weight tuning.

Conclusion: Interpreting scalarization weights through MTO metrics explains their effectiveness; AutoScale provides a practical, generalizable approach to weight selection, making linear scalarization competitive with complex MTO methods.

Abstract: Recent multi-task learning studies suggest that linear scalarization, when
using well-chosen fixed task weights, can achieve comparable to or even better
performance than complex multi-task optimization (MTO) methods. It remains
unclear why certain weights yield optimal performance and how to determine
these weights without relying on exhaustive hyperparameter search. This paper
establishes a direct connection between linear scalarization and MTO methods,
revealing through extensive experiments that well-performing scalarization
weights exhibit specific trends in key MTO metrics, such as high gradient
magnitude similarity. Building on this insight, we introduce AutoScale, a
simple yet effective two-phase framework that uses these MTO metrics to guide
weight selection for linear scalarization, without expensive weight search.
AutoScale consistently shows superior performance with high efficiency across
diverse datasets including a new large-scale benchmark.

### [192] [Multi-User Contextual Cascading Bandits for Personalized Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13981)
*Jiho Park,Huiwen Jia*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces MCCB, a multi-user contextual cascading bandit model; presents UCBBP and AUCBBP algorithms with regret bounds and empirical validation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Motivated by realistic online advertising where multiple users interact with sequentially displayed items; classical contextual bandits fail to capture cascading feedback, parallel session exploration, and heterogeneous arm rewards; a scalable, theoretically grounded framework is needed.

Method: Define the Multi-User Contextual Cascading Bandit (MCCB) model incorporating cascading feedback from sequential exposure, parallel context sessions for selective exploration, and heterogeneous arm-level rewards. Propose UCBBP (UCB with Backward Planning) with regret ontilde{O}(sqrt{THN}) and AUCBBP (Active UCB with Backward Planning) with regret ontilde{O}(sqrt{T+HN}). Provide theoretical regret guarantees and validate via numerical experiments.

Result: Regret bounds established for both algorithms; empirical experiments demonstrate effectiveness across various settings.

Conclusion: The MCCB framework captures realistic multi-user sequential exposure; backward planning enhances efficiency; AUCBBP scales better with context (users); both algorithms perform well in experiments; future work could extend to non-stationarity, richer feedback, or deployment considerations.

Abstract: We introduce a Multi-User Contextual Cascading Bandit model, a new
combinatorial bandit framework that captures realistic online advertising
scenarios where multiple users interact with sequentially displayed items
simultaneously. Unlike classical contextual bandits, MCCB integrates three key
structural elements: (i) cascading feedback based on sequential arm exposure,
(ii) parallel context sessions enabling selective exploration, and (iii)
heterogeneous arm-level rewards. We first propose Upper Confidence Bound with
Backward Planning (UCBBP), a UCB-style algorithm tailored to this setting, and
prove that it achieves a regret bound of $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{THN})$ over $T$
episodes, $H$ session steps, and $N$ contexts per episode. Motivated by the
fact that many users interact with the system simultaneously, we introduce a
second algorithm, termed Active Upper Confidence Bound with Backward Planning
(AUCBBP), which shows a strict efficiency improvement in context scaling, i.e.,
user scaling, with a regret bound of $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{T+HN})$. We validate
our theoretical findings via numerical experiments, demonstrating the empirical
effectiveness of both algorithms under various settings.

Abstract: We introduce the Knob-Meter-Rule (KMR) framework, a unified formalism for
representing and reasoning about model efficiency techniques in deep learning.
By abstracting diverse methods, including pruning, quantization, knowledge
distillation, and parameter-efficient architectures, into a consistent set of
controllable knobs, deterministic rules, and measurable meters, KMR provides a
mathematically precise and modular perspective on efficiency optimization. The
framework enables systematic composition of multiple techniques, flexible

*Sergey Salishev,Ian Akhremchik*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A differentiable, learnable-bit-width quantization method using STE with exterior-point penalties achieves competitive accuracy at ultra-low bit-widths (W1A1) while maintaining STE efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantized neural networks can be viewed as a chain of noisy channels; as bit-width shrinks, capacity drops, creating bottlenecks. The FP checkpoint sets the maximum input rate; understanding capacity dynamics helps identify where to allocate precision and how to fine-tune effectively.

Method: Treats quantization as a differentiable optimization problem with learnable bit-width, noise scale, and clamp bounds using a Straight-Through Estimator (STE); employs an exterior-point penalty to enforce a target bit-width and mild distillation-based smoothing to stabilize training; tracks capacity dynamics across layers during progressive bit-width reduction.

Result: Attains competitive accuracy down to W1A1 while preserving the efficiency advantages of STE; demonstrates effective bottleneck identification and dynamic bit-width optimization.

Conclusion: A simple, differentiable, bottleneck-aware quantization framework can push ultra-low-bit quantization further without sacrificing much performance, offering a practical route to efficient quantized inference.

Abstract: Quantized neural networks can be viewed as a chain of noisy channels, where
rounding in each layer reduces capacity as bit-width shrinks; the
floating-point (FP) checkpoint sets the maximum input rate. We track capacity
dynamics as the average bit-width decreases and identify resulting quantization
bottlenecks by casting fine-tuning as a smooth, constrained optimization
problem. Our approach employs a fully differentiable Straight-Through Estimator
(STE) with learnable bit-width, noise scale and clamp bounds, and enforces a
target bit-width via an exterior-point penalty; mild metric smoothing (via
distillation) stabilizes training. Despite its simplicity, the method attains
competitive accuracy down to the extreme W1A1 setting while retaining the
efficiency of STE.

*Mohammad Izadi,Mehran Safayani*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ASDFormer is a Transformer-based model with a Mixture of Pooling-Classifier Experts (MoE) that captures ROI- and community-level functional connectivity patterns to diagnose ASD, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy on ABIDE and enabling biomarker discovery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ASD involves disrupted large-scale brain connectivity. fMRI BOLD signals across ROIs form networks; patterns within and between communities are particularly informative for ASD. Robust methods for capturing these patterns are needed for diagnosis and biomarker discovery.

Method: ASDFormer combines Transformer architecture with a Mixture of Pooling-Classifier Experts (MoE). It uses multiple specialized expert branches and attention mechanisms to adaptively emphasize different brain regions and connectivity patterns relevant to autism, applied to ABIDE data.

Result: The model achieves state-of-the-art diagnostic accuracy on the ABIDE dataset and identifies robust functional connectivity disruptions linked to ASD, supporting its utility for biomarker discovery.

Conclusion: Integrating attention-based Transformers with MoE yields improved classification performance and interpretable ASD biomarkers, highlighting a promising approach for neuroimaging-based diagnosis and biomarker discovery.

Abstract: Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a complex neurodevelopmental condition
marked by disruptions in brain connectivity. Functional MRI (fMRI) offers a
non-invasive window into large-scale neural dynamics by measuring
blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signals across the brain. These signals can
be modeled as interactions among Regions of Interest (ROIs), which are grouped
into functional communities based on their underlying roles in brain function.
Emerging evidence suggests that connectivity patterns within and between these
communities are particularly sensitive to ASD-related alterations. Effectively
capturing these patterns and identifying interactions that deviate from typical
development is essential for improving ASD diagnosis and enabling biomarker
discovery. In this work, we introduce ASDFormer, a Transformer-based
architecture that incorporates a Mixture of Pooling-Classifier Experts (MoE) to
capture neural signatures associated with ASD. By integrating multiple
specialized expert branches with attention mechanisms, ASDFormer adaptively
emphasizes different brain regions and connectivity patterns relevant to
autism. This enables both improved classification performance and more
interpretable identification of disorder-related biomarkers. Applied to the
ABIDE dataset, ASDFormer achieves state-of-the-art diagnostic accuracy and
reveals robust insights into functional connectivity disruptions linked to ASD,
highlighting its potential as a tool for biomarker discovery.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A typed-topology framework on finite datasets in R^2 yields a track-and-branch representation encoded as a typed-II pseudotree, enabling new algorithms for convex hull, holes, clustering, and anomaly detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend topological data analysis to finite datasets by introducing typed topological spaces, capturing the inner structure of data and providing new algorithmic tools for data analysis.

Method: Introduce a special set of open-set types to form a typed topology on a dataset X in R^2; analyze the natural quotient space where X is organized into tracks; decompose tracks into ordered components represented by integer sequences; model cross-track relations as branches within a typed-II pseudotree; propose algorithmic frameworks for convex hull, holes, clustering, and anomaly detection using these structures.

Result: Formal development of typed topology on X, construction of tracks, components, integer-sequence encoding, and the typed-II pseudotree, establishing a structural platform for new data-analysis algorithms.

Conclusion: Typed topology on finite planar datasets provides a new structural lens and a foundation for algorithms addressing convex hulls, holes, clustering, and anomaly detection through the typed-II pseudotree representation.

Abstract: A datatset $X$ on $R^2$ is a finite topological space. Current research of a
dataset focuses on statistical methods and the algebraic topological method
\cite{carlsson}. In \cite{hu}, the concept of typed topological space was
introduced and showed to have the potential for studying finite topological
spaces, such as a dataset. It is a new method from the general topology
perspective. A typed topological space is a topological space whose open sets
are assigned types. Topological concepts and methods can be redefined using
open sets of certain types. In this article, we develop a special set of types
and its related typed topology on a dataset $X$. Using it, we can investigate
the inner structure of $X$. In particular, $R^2$ has a natural quotient space,
in which $X$ is organized into tracks, and each track is split into components.
Those components are in a order. Further, they can be represented by an integer
sequence. Components crossing tracks form branches, and the relationship can be
well represented by a type of pseudotree (called typed-II pseudotree). Such
structures provide a platform for new algorithms for problems such as
calculating convex hull, holes, clustering and anomaly detection.

### [197] [Efficient Knowledge Graph Unlearning with Zeroth-order Information](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14013)
*Yang Xiao,Ruimeng Ye,Bohan Liu,Xiaolong Ma,Bo Hui*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: An efficient KG unlearning method using a Taylor-expansion influence function with Fisher-approximate inverse-Hessian, enabling fast data-removal without full retraining and outperforming baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is growing demand (e.g., Right to be Forgotten) to remove training data and its influence from models. Full retraining is costly, and knowledge graphs have complex structures and semantic relations that make unlearning challenging; a scalable, efficient approach is needed for large-scale KGs.

Method: Define an influence function forKG unlearning and approximate model sensitivity to data removal without computing first- and second-order derivatives. Use Taylor expansion to estimate parameter changes after data removal. To avoid heavy gradients, employ Fisher information matrices and zeroth-order optimization to approximate the inverse-Hessian–vector product without constructing computational graphs.

Result: Experiments show the proposed method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art graph unlearning baselines in unlearning efficiency and quality. The authors release their code at the given GitHub URL.

Conclusion: An efficient, scalable KG unlearning approach is feasible via influence-function-based approximations that reduce computational cost while preserving unlearning quality; the method is particularly suitable for large-scale knowledge graphs.

Abstract: Due to regulations like the Right to be Forgotten, there is growing demand
for removing training data and its influence from models. Since full retraining
is costly, various machine unlearning methods have been proposed. In this
paper, we firstly present an efficient knowledge graph (KG) unlearning
algorithm. We remark that KG unlearning is nontrivial due to the distinctive
structure of KG and the semantic relations between entities. Also, unlearning
by estimating the influence of removed components incurs significant
computational overhead when applied to large-scale knowledge graphs. To this
end, we define an influence function for KG unlearning and propose to
approximate the model's sensitivity without expensive computation of
first-order and second-order derivatives for parameter updates. Specifically,
we use Taylor expansion to estimate the parameter changes caused by data
removal. Given that the first-order gradients and second-order derivatives
dominate the computational load, we use the Fisher matrices and zeroth-order
optimization to approximate the inverse-Hessian vector product without
constructing the computational graphs. Our experimental results demonstrate
that the proposed method outperforms other state-of-the-art graph unlearning
baselines significantly in terms of unlearning efficiency and unlearning
quality. Our code is released at https://github.com/NKUShaw/ZOWFKGIF.

### [198] [BLIPs: Bayesian Learned Interatomic Potentials](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14022)
*Dario Coscia,Pim de Haan,Max Welling*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: BLIPs: a variational Bayesian framework for MLIPs that yields calibrated uncertainty and robust performance, especially in data-scarce or out-of-distribution regimes; supports fine-tuning of pretrained MLIPs with minimal overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLIPs lack uncertainty estimates and degrade in data-scarce or out-of-distribution scenarios; calibrated uncertainties are needed for active learning and trustworthy simulation against quantum calculations.

Method: Adaptive variational dropout within a scalable, architecture-agnostic Bayesian framework; integrates with energy/forces, supports (equivariant) message-passing, and is compatible with fine-tuning of pretrained MLIPs.

Result: Improved predictive accuracy versus standard MLIPs; trustworthy calibrated uncertainties, particularly in data-scarce or heavy out-of-distribution regimes; fine-tuning pretrained MLIPs with BLIP yields additional gains and calibrated uncertainties.

Conclusion: BLIP provides scalable, uncertainty-aware MLIPs with minimal inference overhead, compatible with (equivariant) MP architectures, and beneficial for active learning and accurate quantum-calibration in simulations.

Abstract: Machine Learning Interatomic Potentials (MLIPs) are becoming a central tool
in simulation-based chemistry. However, like most deep learning models, MLIPs
struggle to make accurate predictions on out-of-distribution data or when
trained in a data-scarce regime, both common scenarios in simulation-based
chemistry. Moreover, MLIPs do not provide uncertainty estimates by
construction, which are fundamental to guide active learning pipelines and to
ensure the accuracy of simulation results compared to quantum calculations. To
address this shortcoming, we propose BLIPs: Bayesian Learned Interatomic
Potentials. BLIP is a scalable, architecture-agnostic variational Bayesian
framework for training or fine-tuning MLIPs, built on an adaptive version of
Variational Dropout. BLIP delivers well-calibrated uncertainty estimates and
minimal computational overhead for energy and forces prediction at inference
time, while integrating seamlessly with (equivariant) message-passing
architectures. Empirical results on simulation-based computational chemistry
tasks demonstrate improved predictive accuracy with respect to standard MLIPs,
and trustworthy uncertainty estimates, especially in data-scarse or heavy
out-of-distribution regimes. Moreover, fine-tuning pretrained MLIPs with BLIP
yields consistent performance gains and calibrated uncertainties.

### [199] [Learning from Preferences and Mixed Demonstrations in General Settings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14027)
*Jason R Brown,Carl Henrik Ek,Robert D Mullins*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces LEOPARD, a scalable method to learn objective rewards from heterogeneous human feedback (preferences and ranked demonstrations) using reward-rational partial orderings; shows improved performance with limited data and benefits from combining feedback types.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reward design in reinforcement learning is difficult for complex tasks; existing approaches that combine preferences and demonstrations are often ad-hoc, domain-specific, or non-scalable. A flexible, scalable framework for learning from diverse human data is needed.

Method: Proposes reward-rational partial orderings over observations as a unifying framing and presents LEOPARD (Learning Estimated Objectives from Preferences And Ranked Demonstrations). LEOPARD learns estimated reward functions from various feedback types (including negative demonstrations) by modeling the likelihood of observed rankings/demonstrations under a reward model, enabling learning across a broad range of domains.

Result: LEOPARD outperforms existing baselines when only limited preference and demonstration feedback is available. It can learn from a wide spectrum of feedback data, including negative demonstrations, and combining multiple feedback types often yields better performance.

Conclusion: LEOPARD offers a practical, flexible approach to learning from human feedback in reinforcement learning, supporting efficient reward learning across domains and highlighting the benefit of integrating multiple feedback modalities.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning is a general method for learning in sequential
settings, but it can often be difficult to specify a good reward function when
the task is complex. In these cases, preference feedback or expert
demonstrations can be used instead. However, existing approaches utilising both
together are often ad-hoc, rely on domain-specific properties, or won't scale.
We develop a new framing for learning from human data, \emph{reward-rational
partial orderings over observations}, designed to be flexible and scalable.
Based on this we introduce a practical algorithm, LEOPARD: Learning Estimated
Objectives from Preferences And Ranked Demonstrations. LEOPARD can learn from a
broad range of data, including negative demonstrations, to efficiently learn
reward functions across a wide range of domains. We find that when a limited
amount of preference and demonstration feedback is available, LEOPARD
outperforms existing baselines by a significant margin. Furthermore, we use
LEOPARD to investigate learning from many types of feedback compared to just a
single one, and find that combining feedback types is often beneficial.

*Hyeonjin Choi,Jinse Kim,Dong-yeon Yoo,Ju-sung Sun,Jung-won Lee*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: Uncertainty-Aware Learning Policy combines physicians' background knowledge with chest X-ray lesion data to improve lung nodule detection and reduce diagnostic uncertainty.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Physicians' interpretations vary with experience and fatigue; AI often lacks contextual knowledge and suffers from diagnostic uncertainty; this undermines trust and adoption of AI in clinical practice.

Method: Develop an Uncertainty-Aware Learning Policy that jointly learns physicians' background knowledge and chest X-ray lesion information; train on Ajou University Hospital data (2,517 lesion-free images; 656 nodule images); evaluate using IoU 0.2 and FPPI=2; report diagnostic sensitivity and entropy as uncertainty metric.

Result: Achieved 92% IoU at threshold 0.2 with FPPI=2; 10% improvement in sensitivity over a baseline model; entropy (uncertainty) reduced by 0.2.

Conclusion: Incorporating physicians' background knowledge into AI diagnosis reduces uncertainty and improves performance, supporting more trustworthy AI-assisted chest X-ray analysis.

Abstract: Early detection and rapid intervention of lung cancer are crucial.
Nonetheless, ensuring an accurate diagnosis is challenging, as physicians'
ability to interpret chest X-rays varies significantly depending on their
experience and degree of fatigue. Although medical AI has been rapidly
advancing to assist in diagnosis, physicians' trust in such systems remains
limited, preventing widespread clinical adoption. This skepticism fundamentally
stems from concerns about its diagnostic uncertainty. In clinical diagnosis,
physicians utilize extensive background knowledge and clinical experience. In
contrast, medical AI primarily relies on repetitive learning of the target
lesion to generate diagnoses based solely on that data. In other words, medical
AI does not possess sufficient knowledge to render a diagnosis, leading to
diagnostic uncertainty. Thus, this study suggests an Uncertainty-Aware Learning
Policy that can address the issue of knowledge deficiency by learning the
physicians' background knowledge alongside the Chest X-ray lesion information.
We used 2,517 lesion-free images and 656 nodule images, all obtained from Ajou
University Hospital. The proposed model attained 92% (IoU 0.2 / FPPI 2) with a
10% enhancement in sensitivity compared to the baseline model while also
decreasing entropy as a measure of uncertainty by 0.2.

### [201] [Diff-MSM: Differentiable MusculoSkeletal Model for Simultaneous Identification of Human Muscle and Bone Parameters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13303)
*Yingfan Zhou,Philip Sanderink,Sigurd Jager Lemming,Cheng Fang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A differentiable musculoskeletal model (Diff-MSM) enables end-to-end identification of muscle and bone parameters from observable motion without measuring joint torques, achieving high accuracy and outperforming baselines in simulations; potential for health, rehab, and sports science.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Personalized Hill-type muscle and bone parameters are difficult to measure in vivo, particularly joint torques, yet are essential for accurate, safe simulations of human-robot interactions. A differentiable pipeline can infer internal parameters from external measurements.

Method: Propose Diff-MSM, an end-to-end differentiable framework that backpropagates from measured muscle activation through joint torque to resulting motion to identify subject-specific muscle and bone parameters. The method avoids measuring internal joint torques, uses automatic differentiation, and is evaluated via extensive simulations against state-of-the-art baselines. Initial guesses are sampled from a normal distribution centered at the ground truth with 10% standard deviation.

Result: The approach significantly outperforms baselines, delivering high-accuracy parameter estimates. For example, with initial muscle-parameter guesses drawn from a Normal(mean=ground truth, std=10% of ground truth), the average percentage error in estimated values can be as low as 0.05%. The method demonstrates robust identification of subject-specific parameters across simulations.

Conclusion: Diff-MSM provides a powerful, end-to-end parameter identification method for personalized musculoskeletal models, with potential applications in muscle health monitoring, rehabilitation, and sports science, and shows promise for safer, more accurate human-robot interaction simulations.

Abstract: High-fidelity personalized human musculoskeletal models are crucial for
simulating realistic behavior of physically coupled human-robot interactive
systems and verifying their safety-critical applications in simulations before
actual deployment, such as human-robot co-transportation and rehabilitation
through robotic exoskeletons. Identifying subject-specific Hill-type muscle
model parameters and bone dynamic parameters is essential for a personalized
musculoskeletal model, but very challenging due to the difficulty of measuring
the internal biomechanical variables in vivo directly, especially the joint
torques. In this paper, we propose using Differentiable MusculoSkeletal Model
(Diff-MSM) to simultaneously identify its muscle and bone parameters with an
end-to-end automatic differentiation technique differentiating from the
measurable muscle activation, through the joint torque, to the resulting
observable motion without the need to measure the internal joint torques.
Through extensive comparative simulations, the results manifested that our
proposed method significantly outperformed the state-of-the-art baseline
methods, especially in terms of accurate estimation of the muscle parameters
(i.e., initial guess sampled from a normal distribution with the mean being the
ground truth and the standard deviation being 10% of the ground truth could end
up with an average of the percentage errors of the estimated values as low as
0.05%). In addition to human musculoskeletal modeling and simulation, the new
parameter identification technique with the Diff-MSM has great potential to
enable new applications in muscle health monitoring, rehabilitation, and sports
science.

Motivation: Enable remote monitoring and steering of a mobile robot in real time using low-cost, readily available hardware and open software.

Method: Two Raspberry Pi 4 units (front mobile base and central processing unit) with camera, mic, speaker, FFmpeg streaming; YOLOv3 for object detection; Python speech recognition, translation, and TTS for multilingual voice control; Kinect RGB-D for visual input and obstacle cues; indoor tests showing interactive frame-rate perception on CPU; discusses sensor fusion with ultrasonic, potential GPU acceleration, and future face/text recognition.

Result: Demonstrates real-time object detection and command recognition on CPU; reliable multilingual commands translated to actions; streaming live feed to user; reproducible with off-the-shelf hardware; identifies practical limits and extensions.

Conclusion: Open hardware/software design is reproducible; limitations acknowledged; potential extensions include sensor fusion, GPU acceleration, and adding face/text recognition to enhance interaction and safety.

Abstract: We build a mobile surveillance robot that streams video in real time and
responds to speech so a user can monitor and steer it from a phone or browser.
The system uses two Raspberry Pi 4 units: a front unit on a differential drive
base with camera, mic, and speaker, and a central unit that serves the live
feed and runs perception. Video is sent with FFmpeg. Objects in the scene are
detected using YOLOv3 to support navigation and event awareness. For voice
interaction, we use Python libraries for speech recognition, multilingual
translation, and text-to-speech, so the robot can take spoken commands and read
back responses in the requested language. A Kinect RGB-D sensor provides visual
input and obstacle cues. In indoor tests the robot detects common objects at
interactive frame rates on CPU, recognises commands reliably, and translates
them to actions without manual control. The design relies on off-the-shelf
hardware and open software, making it easy to reproduce. We discuss limits and
practical extensions, including sensor fusion with ultrasonic range data, GPU
acceleration, and adding face and text recognition.

### [203] [Incremental Generalized Hybrid A*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13392)
*Sidharth Talia,Oren Salzman,Siddhartha Srinivasa*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Incremental Generalized Hybrid A* (IGHA*) is an anytime tree-search method for kinodynamic planning that reduces expansions and matches or surpasses HA*, enabling real-time planning for car-like robots in complex terrains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-time kinodynamic planning in very large search trees is essential for autonomous off-road and on-road navigation. Traditional HA* uses a grid-based dominance pruning whose effectiveness hinges on grid resolution, while solving two-point boundary-value problems can be costly for large graphs.

Method: IGHA* is an incremental, anytime tree-search framework that dynamically organizes vertex expansions without rigid pruning, providing theoretical guarantees that it matches or outperforms HA*. It applies to both on-road kinematic and off-road kinodynamic planning for a car-like robot by leveraging a tree of motion primitives.

Result: Variants of IGHA* use about 6x fewer expansions to reach the best solution compared to an optimized HA* implementation. In high-fidelity simulations, IGHA* outperforms HA* when integrated with an MPC loop. Real-time performance is demonstrated in simulation and on a small-scale off-road vehicle.

Conclusion: IGHA* offers faster, more robust planning for complex dynamics without the rigidity of grid-based pruning, enabling real-time performance for challenging kinodynamic planning tasks and providing accessible code for practitioners.

Abstract: We address the problem of efficiently organizing search over very large
trees, which arises in many applications ranging from autonomous driving to
aerial vehicles. Here, we are motivated by off-road autonomy, where real-time
planning is essential. Classical approaches use graphs of motion primitives and
exploit dominance to mitigate the curse of dimensionality and prune expansions
efficiently. However, for complex dynamics, repeatedly solving two-point
boundary-value problems makes graph construction too slow for fast kinodynamic
planning. Hybrid A* (HA*) addressed this challenge by searching over a tree of
motion primitives and introducing approximate pruning using a grid-based
dominance check. However, choosing the grid resolution is difficult: too coarse
risks failure, while too fine leads to excessive expansions and slow planning.
We propose Incremental Generalized Hybrid A* (IGHA*), an anytime tree-search
framework that dynamically organizes vertex expansions without rigid pruning.
IGHA* provably matches or outperforms HA*. For both on-road kinematic and
off-road kinodynamic planning queries for a car-like robot, variants of IGHA*
use 6x fewer expansions to the best solution compared to an optimized version
of HA*. In simulated off-road experiments in a high fidelity simulator, IGHA*
outperforms HA*M when both are used in the loop with a model predictive
controller. We demonstrate real-time performance both in simulation and on a
small-scale off-road vehicle, enabling fast, robust planning under complex
dynamics. Code: https://github.com/personalrobotics/IGHAStar

*Jiming Ren,Xuan Lin,Roman Mineyev,Karen M. Feigh,Samuel Coogan,Ye Zhao*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Benders Decomposition-based approach to task and motion planning under Signal Temporal Logic constraints for bipedal locomotion, decomposing a monolithic MIP into a master plan and kinematics subproblems to improve tractability; achieves faster planning than alternatives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: NP-hard nature of task and motion planning under STL; non-convex kinematic constraints (reachability, footstep rotation) make MIPs intractable; need scalable decomposition to handle complexity.

Method: Apply Benders decomposition: a master problem proposes a task plan that satisfies the temporal logic constraints, while a sequence of subproblems checks kinematic and dynamic feasibility (nonlinear constraints) and provides Benders cuts to refine the master problem iteratively.

Result: Experiments show faster planning compared to alternative algorithms for solving the resulting nonlinear-constrained optimization problem.

Conclusion: Benders decomposition offers a scalable, iterative framework to tackle TAMP problems under STL constraints for bipedal locomotion, improving computational tractability over monolithic nonlinear MIPs.

Abstract: Task and motion planning under Signal Temporal Logic constraints is known to
be NP-hard. A common class of approaches formulates these hybrid problems,
which involve discrete task scheduling and continuous motion planning, as
mixed-integer programs (MIP). However, in applications for bipedal locomotion,
introduction of non-convex constraints such as kinematic reachability and
footstep rotation exacerbates the computational complexity of MIPs. In this
work, we present a method based on Benders Decomposition to address scenarios
where solving the entire monolithic optimization problem is prohibitively
intractable. Benders Decomposition proposes an iterative cutting-plane
technique that partitions the problem into a master problem to prototype a plan
that meets the task specification, and a series of subproblems for kinematics
and dynamics feasibility checks. Our experiments demonstrate that this method
achieves faster planning compared to alternative algorithms for solving the
resulting optimization program with nonlinear constraints.

Conclusion: Commercial gaming platforms can function as practical benchmarks for evaluating embodied AI and guiding future benchmarking efforts; the approach lowers cost/entry barriers and enables real-world, human-comparable evaluation.

Abstract: Recent advances in whole-body robot control have enabled humanoid and legged
robots to execute increasingly agile and coordinated movements. However,
standardized benchmarks for evaluating robotic athletic performance in
real-world settings and in direct comparison to humans remain scarce. We
present Switch4EAI(Switch-for-Embodied-AI), a low-cost and easily deployable

representative example, our system captures, reconstructs, and retargets
in-game choreography for robotic execution. We validate the system on a Unitree
G1 humanoid with an open-source whole-body controller, establishing a
quantitative baseline for the robot's performance against a human player. In
the paper, we discuss these results, which demonstrate the feasibility of using
commercial games platform as physically grounded benchmarks and motivate future
work to for benchmarking embodied AI.

Method: Use vision-language models to generate counterfactual language labels and corresponding actions to augment existing robot datasets (no new data collection). Retrain or fine-tune VLA policies on this augmented data to improve instruction following.

Result: Counterfactual relabeling significantly improves instruction-following in VLA policies, achieving better diversity/granularity in language grounding and a 27% increase in navigation task success rate, competitive with state-of-the-art across three indoor/outdoor environments.

Conclusion: Counterfactual relabeling is an effective, data-efficient strategy to enhance grounding and instruction-following in VLA robots, with broad applicability to improving fine-grained language understanding in robotic tasks.

Abstract: Generalist robots should be able to understand and follow user instructions,
but current vision-language-action (VLA) models struggle with following
fine-grained commands despite providing a powerful architecture for mapping
open-vocabulary natural language instructions to robot actions. One cause for
this is a lack of semantic diversity and language grounding in existing robot
datasets and, specifically, a lack of fine-grained task diversity for similar
observations. To address this, we present a novel method to augment existing
robot datasets by leveraging vision language models to create counterfactual
labels. Our method improves the language-following capabilities of VLAs by
increasing the diversity and granularity of language grounding for robot
datasets by generating counterfactual language and actions. We evaluate the
resulting model's ability to follow language instructions, ranging from simple
object-centric commands to complex referential tasks, by conducting visual
language navigation experiments in 3 different indoor and outdoor environments.
Our experiments demonstrate that counterfactual relabeling, without any
additional data collection, significantly improves instruction-following in VLA
policies, making them competitive with state-of-the-art methods and increasing
success rate by 27% on navigation tasks.

### [207] [Modeling and Control of AWOISV: A Filtered Tube-Based MPC Approach for Simultaneous Tracking of Lateral Position and Heading Angle](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13457)
*Xu Yang,Jun Ni,Hengyang Feng,Feiyu Wang,Tiezhen Wang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: An all-wheel omni-directional independent steering vehicle (AWOISV) model and control framework using a θ_R-β_R representation and a v-β-r dynamic model, controlled by a filtered tube-based LTV-MPC to achieve precise simultaneous position and heading tracking across all motion modes, confirmed by co-simulation and HIL experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need for high maneuverability and seamless mode switching in AWD independent-steering platforms; existing models struggle to decouple longitudinal and lateral dynamics and to handle arbitrary heading adjustments with real-time guarantees.

Method: Develop theoretical θ_R-β_R steering representation based on center of rotation; derive generalized v-β-r dynamic model with inputs θ_R, β_R and states v, β, r; decouple longitudinal and lateral motions; propose FT-LTVMPC for robust tracking; validate with co-sim and HIL experiments.

Result: FT-LTVMPC enables high-precision tracking of lateral position and heading; robust to parameter uncertainties and model inaccuracies; demonstrates real-time performance.

Conclusion: The proposed framework provides a viable, robust control solution for AWOISVs across all motion modes, enabling precise steering, yaw, and diagonal maneuvers.

Abstract: An all-wheel omni-directional independent steering vehicle (AWOISV) is a
specialized all-wheel independent steering vehicle with each wheel capable of
steering up to 90{\deg}, enabling unique maneuvers like yaw and diagonal
movement. This paper introduces a theoretical steering radius angle and
sideslip angle (\( \theta_R \)-\(\beta_R \)) representation, based on the
position of the instantaneous center of rotation relative to the wheel rotation
center, defining the motion modes and switching criteria for AWOISVs. A
generalized \( v\)-\(\beta\)-\(r \) dynamic model is developed with forward
velocity \(v\), sideslip angle \(\beta\), and yaw rate \(r\) as states, and
\(\theta_R\) and \(\beta_R\) as control inputs. This model decouples
longitudinal and lateral motions into forward and rotational motions, allowing
seamless transitions across all motion modes under specific conditions. A
filtered tube-based linear time-varying MPC (FT-LTVMPC) strategy is proposed,
achieving simultaneous tracking of lateral position and arbitrary heading
angles, with robustness to model inaccuracies and parameter uncertainties.
Co-simulation and hardware-in-loop (HIL) experiments confirm that FT-LTVMPC
enables high-precision control of both position and heading while ensuring
excellent real-time performance.

*Rohan Chandra,Shubham Singh,Abhishek Jha,Dannon Andrade,Hriday Sainathuni,Katia Sycara*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Survey proposing a unified taxonomy for Social Mini-Games (SMG) navigation within multi-robot navigation to address fragmentation and enable standardized baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SMG literature is fragmented across centralized vs decentralized, observability, cooperation assumptions and conflicting objectives (safety vs liveness). A unified taxonomy and evaluation protocols are needed to guide research and aid practitioners.

Method: Define and apply a unified taxonomy to catalog existing SMG solvers, classify methods accordingly, discuss assumptions and evaluation metrics, and propose baseline and protocol guidance.

Result: First comprehensive catalog of SMG solvers using a unified taxonomy; clarifies inconsistent assumptions; identifies gaps and evaluation needs; provides guidance for future research and practical deployment.

Conclusion: SMG navigation requires its own taxonomy and evaluation standards; this survey lays the foundation for consistent benchmarks and progress.

Abstract: The ``Last Mile Challenge'' has long been considered an important, yet
unsolved, challenge for autonomous vehicles, public service robots, and
delivery robots. A central issue in this challenge is the ability of robots to
navigate constrained and cluttered environments (e.g., doorways, hallways,
corridor intersections), often while competing for space with other robots and
humans. We refer to these environments as ``Social Mini-Games'' (SMGs). SMGs
are tightly coupled, high-agency interactions that arise within general
multi-robot navigation (MRN) scenarios. They are identified through certain
distinct characteristics and require specialized metrics to evaluate them.
Traditional navigation approaches designed for MRN do not perform well in SMGs,
which has led to focused research on dedicated SMG solvers (navigation methods
specialized to navigate in SMGs), which has flourished in recent years.
However, publications on SMG navigation research make different assumptions (on
centralized versus decentralized, observability, communication, cooperation,
etc.), and have different objective functions (safety versus liveness). These
assumptions and objectives are sometimes implicitly assumed or described
informally. This makes it difficult to establish appropriate baselines for
comparison in research papers, as well as making it difficult for practitioners
to find the papers relevant to their concrete application. Such ad-hoc
representation of the field also presents a barrier to new researchers wanting
to start research in this area. SMG navigation research requires its own
taxonomy, definitions, and evaluation protocols to guide effective research
moving forward. This survey is the first to catalog SMG solvers using a
well-defined and unified taxonomy and to classify existing methods accordingly.

### [209] [ROVER: Robust Loop Closure Verification with Trajectory Prior in Repetitive Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13488)
*Jingwen Yu,Jiayi Yang,Anjun Hu,Jiankun Wang,Ping Tan,Hong Zhang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: ROVER uses trajectory priors to verify loop closures by re-estimating the trajectory with the candidate loop and scoring its consistency with the prior trajectory, reducing false positives in repetitive environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Appearance-based loop closure can be unreliable in repetitive environments; false positives can severely damage SLAM. There's a gap: leverage robot motion constraints (trajectory) as a prior for loop verification.

Method: For each loop candidate: perform pose-graph optimization to estimate the trajectory with the loop; compute a score reflecting how well this trajectory fits the prior trajectory when the loop is removed (trajectory prior); accept/reject the loop based on score. Integrates with existing SLAM and provides source code and dataset.

Result: Benchmarks and real-world experiments show effectiveness; demonstrates robustness and efficiency; integrated into state-of-the-art SLAM systems.

Conclusion: Incorporating a trajectory prior into loop closure verification significantly reduces false positives in challenging repetitive environments and can be adopted to enhance SLAM robustness without heavy changes.

Abstract: Loop closure detection is important for simultaneous localization and mapping
(SLAM), which associates current observations with historical keyframes,
achieving drift correction and global relocalization. However, a falsely
detected loop can be fatal, and this is especially difficult in repetitive
environments where appearance-based features fail due to the high similarity.
Therefore, verification of a loop closure is a critical step in avoiding false
positive detections. Existing works in loop closure verification predominantly
focus on learning invariant appearance features, neglecting the prior knowledge
of the robot's spatial-temporal motion cue, i.e., trajectory. In this letter,
we propose ROVER, a loop closure verification method that leverages the
historical trajectory as a prior constraint to reject false loops in
challenging repetitive environments. For each loop candidate, it is first used
to estimate the robot trajectory with pose-graph optimization. This trajectory
is then submitted to a scoring scheme that assesses its compliance with the
trajectory without the loop, which we refer to as the trajectory prior, to
determine if the loop candidate should be accepted. Benchmark comparisons and
real-world experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.
Furthermore, we integrate ROVER into state-of-the-art SLAM systems to verify
its robustness and efficiency. Our source code and self-collected dataset are
available at https://github.com/jarvisyjw/ROVER.

### [210] [Unified Hierarchical MPC in Task Executing for Modular Manipulators across Diverse Morphologies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13513)
*Maolin Lei,Edoardo Romiti,Arturo Laurenzi,Cheng Zhou,Wanli Xing,Liang Lu,Nikos G. Tsagarakis*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A unified two-level Hierarchical MPC for modular manipulators that adapts to different morphologies with minimal tuning, delivering smooth joint trajectories by combining high-level trajectory prediction with low-level predictive-model refinement, including second-order kinematic information within a linear framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable accurate, robust control across varying manipulator morphologies while reducing controller tuning and handling near-singular configurations.

Method: Proposes a two-tier MPC: a high-level MPC predicts future states and provides trajectory guidance; a low-level MPC refines actions by updating the predictive model using high-level information and incorporates secondary linearization to capture second-order kinematic information within a linear model.

Result: Extensive evaluations across multiple morphologies show improved precision and reliability; successful execution of pick-and-place tasks in real-world scenarios.

Conclusion: The H-MPC framework offers a unified, adaptable control approach for modular manipulators, balancing model simplicity with higher-order kinematic accuracy and robust performance across morphologies.

Abstract: This work proposes a unified Hierarchical Model Predictive Control (H-MPC)
for modular manipulators across various morphologies, as the controller can
adapt to different configurations to execute the given task without extensive
parameter tuning in the controller. The H-MPC divides the control process into
two levels: a high-level MPC and a low-level MPC. The high-level MPC predicts
future states and provides trajectory information, while the low-level MPC
refines control actions by updating the predictive model based on this
high-level information. This hierarchical structure allows for the integration
of kinematic constraints and ensures smooth joint-space trajectories, even near
singular configurations. Moreover, the low-level MPC incorporates secondary
linearization by leveraging predictive information from the high-level MPC,
effectively capturing the second-order Taylor expansion information of the
kinematic model while still maintaining a linearized model formulation. This
approach not only preserves the simplicity of a linear control model but also
enhances the accuracy of the kinematic representation, thereby improving
overall control precision and reliability. To validate the effectiveness of the
control policy, we conduct extensive evaluations across different manipulator
morphologies and demonstrate the execution of pick-and-place tasks in
real-world scenarios.

### [211] [A Three-Level Whole-Body Disturbance Rejection Control Framework for Dynamic Motions in Legged Robots](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13531)
*Bolin Li,Gewei Zuo,Zhixiang Wang,Xiaotian Ke,Lijun Zhu,Han Ding*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A three-level whole-body disturbance rejection framework (T-WB-DRC) with a moving horizon extended state observer (MH-ESO) enhances stability and robustness of legged robots under uncertainties, demonstrated in simulation and quadruped hardware experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Legged robots suffer from model uncertainties, external disturbances, and faults that degrade stability and task performance (e.g., payload transport). Existing two-level schemes may be insufficient for robust, fault-tolerant operation.

Method: Introduce a moving horizon extended state observer (MH-ESO) to estimate uncertainties and filter noise; develop a three-level whole-body disturbance rejection control framework (T-WB-DRC) that leverages plans based on dynamics with and without uncertainties; validate via Gazebo simulations on humanoid and quadruped robots and through extensive hardware experiments on a quadruped.

Result: MH-ESO enables effective uncertainty estimation and disturbance compensation; T-WB-DRC improves disturbance rejection, payload transportation, and fault tolerance in simulations and real-world tests; quadruped experiments confirm robustness under varied disturbances.

Conclusion: The proposed framework offers a robust, uncertainty-aware approach for whole-body control of legged robots, enabling reliable operation under disturbances and faults and advancing practical deployment in real-world tasks.

Abstract: This paper presents a control framework designed to enhance the stability and
robustness of legged robots in the presence of uncertainties, including model
uncertainties, external disturbances, and faults. The framework enables the
full-state feedback estimator to estimate and compensate for uncertainties in
whole-body dynamics of the legged robots. First, we propose a novel moving
horizon extended state observer (MH-ESO) to estimate uncertainties and mitigate
noise in legged systems, which can be integrated into the framework for
disturbance compensation. Second, we introduce a three-level whole-body
disturbance rejection control framework (T-WB-DRC). Unlike the previous
two-level approach, this three-level framework considers both the plan based on
whole-body dynamics without uncertainties and the plan based on dynamics with
uncertainties, significantly improving payload transportation, external
disturbance rejection, and fault tolerance. Third, simulations of both humanoid
and quadruped robots in the Gazebo simulator demonstrate the effectiveness and
versatility of T-WB-DRC. Finally, extensive experimental trials on a quadruped
robot validate the robustness and stability of the system when using T-WB-DRC
under various disturbance conditions.

### [212] [MimicFunc: Imitating Tool Manipulation from a Single Human Video via Functional Correspondence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13534)
*Chao Tang,Anxing Xiao,Yuhong Deng,Tianrun Hu,Wenlong Dong,Hanbo Zhang,David Hsu,Hong Zhang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: MimicFunc enables one-shot functional generalization for tool manipulation by learning a function-centered frame from a single RGB-D human video, allowing cross-tool transfer to novel tools and generating rollouts to train visuomotor policies without teleoperation data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The key challenge is achieving function-level generalization across intra-function variations among functionally similar tools. Humans can adapt to different tools after observing a single demonstration, but robots struggle to establish correspondences at the function level due to geometric differences.

Method: MimicFunc introduces a function frame, a function-centric local coordinate frame built from keypoint-based abstractions, to establish functional correspondences and imitate tool manipulation. It enables one-shot generalization from a single RGB-D human video to novel tools for functionally equivalent tasks. The generated rollouts can be used to train visuomotor policies without labor-intensive teleoperation data.

Result: Experiments show that MimicFunc enables robots to generalize from a single RGB-D human video to manipulating novel tools for functionally equivalent tasks. The generated rollouts are suitable for training visuomotor policies for novel objects without requiring teleoperation data. Code and video are provided by the authors.

Conclusion: A function-frame approach facilitates robust cross-tool generalization under significant intra-function variations and reduces data collection burdens, supporting scalable visuomotor policy learning.

Abstract: Imitating tool manipulation from human videos offers an intuitive approach to
teaching robots, while also providing a promising and scalable alternative to
labor-intensive teleoperation data collection for visuomotor policy learning.
While humans can mimic tool manipulation behavior by observing others perform a
task just once and effortlessly transfer the skill to diverse tools for
functionally equivalent tasks, current robots struggle to achieve this level of
generalization. A key challenge lies in establishing function-level
correspondences, considering the significant geometric variations among
functionally similar tools, referred to as intra-function variations. To
address this challenge, we propose MimicFunc, a framework that establishes
functional correspondences with function frame, a function-centric local
coordinate frame constructed with keypoint-based abstraction, for imitating
tool manipulation skills. Experiments demonstrate that MimicFunc effectively
enables the robot to generalize the skill from a single RGB-D human video to
manipulating novel tools for functionally equivalent tasks. Furthermore,
leveraging MimicFunc's one-shot generalization capability, the generated
rollouts can be used to train visuomotor policies without requiring
labor-intensive teleoperation data collection for novel objects. Our code and
video are available at https://sites.google.com/view/mimicfunc.

### [213] [Assessing Pedestrian Behavior Around Autonomous Cleaning Robots in Public Spaces: Findings from a Field Observation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13699)
*Maren Raab,Linda Miller,Zhe Zeng,Pascal Jansen,Martin Baumann,Johannes Kraus*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Field study on how autonomous cleaning robots' type and movement pattern affect pedestrian movement in public spaces; distraction (phone use) did not change pedestrian behavior significantly; robot type and movement pattern influenced lateral adaptations and proximity, with larger sweeping and offset rectangular patterns causing more adaptations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how robot morphology and motion strategies influence pedestrian navigation and safety, including distracted pedestrians, to inform design of transparent, safer human-robot interactions in shared spaces.

Method: In a field setting, videotaped unaware pedestrians (N=498) passing two autonomous cleaning robots. Analyzed distraction status (≈8% distracted by smartphones), robot type (smaller cleaning robot vs larger sweeping robot), and movement pattern (circular vs offset rectangular). Measured lateral adaptations and their distances.

Result: Distracted vs undistracted pedestrians showed no significant differences in movement around the robots. Robot type and pattern affected movement: larger sweeping robot and offset rectangular pattern increased the number of lateral adaptations; offset rectangular also led to more close lateral adaptations. Distances of lateral adaptations varied by robot type.

Conclusion: Initial insights into pedestrian movement around autonomous cleaning robots in public spaces; highlights the influence of robot form and motion strategy on pedestrian behavior, informing HRI design to enhance transparency and reduce risks; further studies needed to generalize across environments and robot types.

Abstract: As autonomous robots become more common in public spaces, spontaneous
encounters with laypersons are more frequent. For this, robots need to be
equipped with communication strategies that enhance momentary transparency and
reduce the probability of critical situations. Adapting these robotic
strategies requires consideration of robot movements, environmental conditions,
and user characteristics and states. While numerous studies have investigated
the impact of distraction on pedestrians' movement behavior, limited research
has examined this behavior in the presence of autonomous robots. This research
addresses the impact of robot type and robot movement pattern on distracted and
undistracted pedestrians' movement behavior. In a field setting, unaware
pedestrians were videotaped while moving past two working, autonomous cleaning
robots. Out of N=498 observed pedestrians, approximately 8% were distracted by
smartphones. Distracted and undistracted pedestrians did not exhibit
significant differences in their movement behaviors around the robots. Instead,
both the larger sweeping robot and the offset rectangular movement pattern
significantly increased the number of lateral adaptations compared to the
smaller cleaning robot and the circular movement pattern. The offset
rectangular movement pattern also led to significantly more close lateral
adaptations. Depending on the robot type, the movement patterns led to
differences in the distances of lateral adaptations. The study provides initial
insights into pedestrian movement behavior around an autonomous cleaning robot
in public spaces, contributing to the growing field of HRI research.

### [214] [Blast Hole Seeking and Dipping -- The Navigation and Perception Framework in a Mine Site Inspection Robot](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13785)
*Liyang Liu,Ehsan Mihankhah,Nathan Wallace,Javier Martinez,Andrew J. Hill*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: DIPPeR is an autonomous mine-site inspection system that uses LiDAR-based perception to detect and track blast holes for precise down-hole sensor placement, employing a 2D depth-image projection of cone-shaped drill-waste for robust segmentation and dynamic parameter adjustment during navigation; validated in simulation and field tests.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual hole inspection in open-pit mining is slow, costly, and limited in revealing hole geometry and contents. Automating hole seeking and sensor positioning promises material-savings in downstream processing and improved safety.

Method: Process onboard LiDAR point clouds to extract cone-shaped drill-waste; project 3D cone points into a virtual depth image; perform 2D segmentation to reveal a circular hole at image center and a collared cone face; use a robust detection module with non-maximum suppression to identify the hole center and ensure precise sensor placement; dynamically adjust projection parameters during navigation to cope with varying point sparsity and hole opening size, enabling continuous target tracking; validate in high-fidelity simulations and on-site field tests (video available).

Result: The system enables robust autonomous hole-seeking and down-hole inspection, achieving precise sensor placement and collision avoidance, with successful demonstrations in both simulated and real environments.

Conclusion: The pipeline provides a robust, adaptive solution for autonomous blast-hole inspection that can reduce manual inspection costs and improve safety and efficiency in mining operations, supported by simulation and field-test evidence.

Abstract: In open-pit mining, holes are drilled into the surface of the excavation site
and detonated with explosives to facilitate digging. These blast holes need to
be inspected internally for investigation of downhole material types and
properties. Knowing these properties can lead to significant savings in
material handling costs in downstream processes. Manual hole inspection is slow
and expensive, with major limitations in revealing the geometric and geological
properties of the holes and their contents. This has been the motivation for
the development of our autonomous mine-site inspection robot - "DIPPeR". In
this paper, the automation aspect of the project is explained. We present a
robust blast hole seeking and detection framework that enables target-based
navigation and accurate down-hole sensor positioning. The pipeline first
processes point-cloud data collected by the on-board LiDAR sensors, extracting
the cone-shaped volume of drill-waste above the ground. By projecting the 3D
cone points into a virtual depth image, segmentation is achieved in the 2D
domain, yielding a circular hole at the image centre and a collared cone face.
We then identify the hole centre using a robust detection module while
suppressing non-maximum candidates, ensuring precise sensor placement for
down-hole inspection and avoiding collisions with the cavity wall. To enable
autonomous hole-seeking, the pipeline automatically adjusts its projection
parameters during robot navigation to account for variations in point sparsity
and hole opening size, ensuring a consistent hole appearance in 2D images. This
allows continuous tracking of the target hole as the robot approaches the goal
point. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our navigation and perception system
in both high-fidelity simulation environments and on-site field tests. A
demonstration video is available at

*Haitham El-Hussieny*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A data-driven DK-MPC framework for quadrotors using a deep Koopman operator to linearize dynamics for efficient MPC; shows improved tracking and lower compute time in simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High computational cost and limited real-time performance of nonlinear MPC for quadrotors; need data-driven models to capture nonlinear dynamics while enabling fast control.

Method: Train deep Koopman operator on flight data to obtain latent linear dynamics; apply MPC in latent space over finite horizon; evaluate on trajectory-following and point-stabilization tasks; compare to conventional nonlinear MPC.

Result: Outperforms nonlinear MPC in tracking accuracy and uses significantly less computation time in numerical experiments.

Conclusion: DK-MPC provides a promising avenue to handle complex quadrotor dynamics with real-time capable control; future work includes agility and robustness to disturbances.

Abstract: This paper presents a data-driven control framework for quadrotor systems
that integrates a deep Koopman operator with model predictive control (DK-MPC).
The deep Koopman operator is trained on sampled flight data to construct a
high-dimensional latent representation in which the nonlinear quadrotor
dynamics are approximated by linear models. This linearization enables the
application of MPC to efficiently optimize control actions over a finite
prediction horizon, ensuring accurate trajectory tracking and stabilization.
The proposed DK-MPC approach is validated through a series of
trajectory-following and point-stabilization numerical experiments, where it
demonstrates superior tracking accuracy and significantly lower computation
time compared to conventional nonlinear MPC. These results highlight the
potential of Koopman-based learning methods to handle complex quadrotor
dynamics while meeting the real-time requirements of embedded flight control.
Future work will focus on extending the framework to more agile flight
scenarios and improving robustness against external disturbances.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: SGDT: a hierarchical neuro-symbolic framework that uses a symbolic planner to generate subgoals for a goal-conditioned Decision Transformer to perform low-level multi-robot manipulation, enabling interpretable and generalizable collaboration; evaluated in zero-shot and few-shot settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RL is data-hungry and MDP-centric; real-world multi-robot manipulation has long-horizon dependencies; DTs offer offline sequence modeling but have limited application to multi-robot scenarios; need deployable, interpretable approaches.

Method: Neuro-symbolic planner yields symbolic subgoals; a GCDT uses subgoals to guide low-level decisions in a multi-robot setting; hierarchical architecture combining symbolic planning with causal transformers.

Result: Evaluation across varied task scenarios including zero-shot and few-shot; demonstrates feasibility and potential benefits of the DT-based approach for multi-robot manipulation; specific quantitative results not provided in abstract.

Conclusion: First DT-based approach for multi-robot manipulation; SGDT enables structured, interpretable, and generalizable multi-robot collaboration via a hierarchical neuro-symbolic framework.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has demonstrated great potential in robotic
operations. However, its data-intensive nature and reliance on the Markov
Decision Process (MDP) assumption limit its practical deployment in real-world
scenarios involving complex dynamics and long-term temporal dependencies, such
as multi-robot manipulation. Decision Transformers (DTs) have emerged as a
promising offline alternative by leveraging causal transformers for sequence
modeling in RL tasks. However, their applications to multi-robot manipulations
still remain underexplored. To address this gap, we propose a novel framework,
Symbolically-Guided Decision Transformer (SGDT), which integrates a
neuro-symbolic mechanism with a causal transformer to enable deployable
multi-robot collaboration. In the proposed SGDT framework, a neuro-symbolic
planner generates a high-level task-oriented plan composed of symbolic
subgoals. Guided by these subgoals, a goal-conditioned decision transformer
(GCDT) performs low-level sequential decision-making for multi-robot
manipulation. This hierarchical architecture enables structured, interpretable,
and generalizable decision making in complex multi-robot collaboration tasks.
We evaluate the performance of SGDT across a range of task scenarios, including
zero-shot and few-shot scenarios. To our knowledge, this is the first work to
explore DT-based technology for multi-robot manipulation.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Integrates semantic privileged information from LLMs into SVM+ to align driving-style recognition with human reasoning, using DriBehavGPT to generate textual behavior descriptions; SPI is used during training, while inference remains sensor-based; yields ~7.6%–7.9% F1 improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing driving style recognition relies on low-level sensor features and neglects human-interpretable reasoning, leading to misalignment with expert judgments. Incorporating semantic descriptions via SPI from LLMs aims to bridge this gap and produce more interpretable models.

Method: DriBehavGPT generates natural-language descriptions of driving behaviors. These descriptions are encoded into machine-learning representations via text embeddings and dimensionality reduction, then used as Semantically Privileged Information in SVM+ training. Training utilizes SPI; inference uses only sensor data.

Result: The SPI-enhanced framework outperforms conventional methods, achieving F1-score improvements of 7.6% for car-following and 7.9% for lane-changing, demonstrated across diverse real-world driving scenarios.

Conclusion: Semantic behavioral representations are pivotal for improving recognition accuracy and interpretability in driving systems. SPI enables human-centric, interpretable models without adding inference overhead.

Abstract: Existing driving style recognition systems largely depend on low-level
sensor-derived features for training, neglecting the rich semantic reasoning
capability inherent to human experts. This discrepancy results in a fundamental
misalignment between algorithmic classifications and expert judgments. To
bridge this gap, we propose a novel framework that integrates Semantic
Privileged Information (SPI) derived from large language models (LLMs) to align
recognition outcomes with human-interpretable reasoning. First, we introduce
DriBehavGPT, an interactive LLM-based module that generates natural-language
descriptions of driving behaviors. These descriptions are then encoded into
machine learning-compatible representations via text embedding and
dimensionality reduction. Finally, we incorporate them as privileged
information into Support Vector Machine Plus (SVM+) for training, enabling the
model to approximate human-like interpretation patterns. Experiments across
diverse real-world driving scenarios demonstrate that our SPI-enhanced
framework outperforms conventional methods, achieving F1-score improvements of
7.6% (car-following) and 7.9% (lane-changing). Importantly, SPI is exclusively
used during training, while inference relies solely on sensor data, ensuring
computational efficiency without sacrificing performance. These results
highlight the pivotal role of semantic behavioral representations in improving
recognition accuracy while advancing interpretable, human-centric driving
systems.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A comprehensive survey of data management for Embodied AI, evaluating five storage architectures and five retrieval paradigms, identifying a trade-off between long-term semantic coherence and real-time performance, outlining bottlenecks, and proposing a roadmap with physics-aware models and standardized benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Embodied AI agents generate vast, heterogeneous multimodal data streams from the physical world. Effective data management must provide physical grounding, low-latency access, and dynamic scalability, which existing systems struggle to deliver. The paper argues for principled data management to enable robust, open-world embodied intelligence.

Method: Systematic evaluation of five storage architectures (Graph Databases, Multi-Model Databases, Data Lakes, Vector Databases, Time-Series Databases) and five retrieval paradigms (Fusion Strategy-Based Retrieval, Representation Alignment-Based Retrieval, Graph-Structure-Based Retrieval, Generation Model-Based Retrieval, Efficient Retrieval-Based Optimization); comprehensive literature review of over 180 related studies; synthesis of bottlenecks and a forward-looking research agenda.

Result: Reveals a fundamental tension between achieving long-term semantic coherence and maintaining real-time responsiveness in EAI data management. Identifies bottlenecks such as the Physical Grounding Gap, cross-modal integration, dynamic adaptation, and open-world generalization. Proposes a research agenda including physics-aware data models, adaptive storage-retrieval co-optimization, and standardized benchmarking to guide future work.

Conclusion: Provides a principled roadmap for designing robust, high-performance data management frameworks for next-generation autonomous embodied systems, emphasizing physics-aware modeling, storage-retrieval co-optimization, and standardized benchmarks.

Abstract: Embodied AI (EAI) agents continuously interact with the physical world,
generating vast, heterogeneous multimodal data streams that traditional
management systems are ill-equipped to handle. In this survey, we first
systematically evaluate five storage architectures (Graph Databases,
Multi-Model Databases, Data Lakes, Vector Databases, and Time-Series
Databases), focusing on their suitability for addressing EAI's core
requirements, including physical grounding, low-latency access, and dynamic
scalability. We then analyze five retrieval paradigms (Fusion Strategy-Based
Retrieval, Representation Alignment-Based Retrieval, Graph-Structure-Based
Retrieval, Generation Model-Based Retrieval, and Efficient Retrieval-Based
Optimization), revealing a fundamental tension between achieving long-term
semantic coherence and maintaining real-time responsiveness. Based on this

*Martijn Cramer,Yanming Wu,David De Schepper,Eric Demeester*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Explores enhancing cobots in sheet-metal SMEs with mobile, reconfigurable assistants using 3D recognition/localisation; discusses opportunities, challenges, and a concrete implementation example from ACRO project.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-mix-low-volume sheet-metal production challenges in SMEs lead to costly manual labor and underutilization of skilled workers; existing automation is insufficient, prompting a shift to adaptable cobotic solutions.

Method: Conceptual analysis of integrating 3D object recognition/localisation into cobotic systems; outlines key implementation steps for industrial settings; uses insights from a past ACRO project with an industry partner as a concrete example.

Result: Identifies opportunities and challenges in cobot-enhanced production; provides a process blueprint for deployment; demonstrates feasibility through a real-world implementation example from ACRO project.

Conclusion: Combining mobile, reconfigurable cobots with 3D recognition/localisation can improve flexibility and reduce costs in SMEs, though integration, skills, and workflow adaptation present ongoing challenges that require structured deployment steps.

Abstract: Due to high-mix-low-volume production, sheet-metal workshops today are
challenged by small series and varying orders. As standard automation solutions
tend to fall short, SMEs resort to repetitive manual labour impacting
production costs and leading to tech-skilled workforces not being used to their
full potential. The COOCK+ ROBUST project aims to transform cobots into mobile
and reconfigurable production assistants by integrating existing technologies,
including 3D object recognition and localisation. This article explores both
the opportunities and challenges of enhancing cobotic systems with these
technologies in an industrial setting, outlining the key steps involved in the
process. Additionally, insights from a past project, carried out by the ACRO
research unit in collaboration with an industrial partner, serves as a concrete
implementation example throughout.

### [220] [Toward an Interaction-Centered Approach to Robot Trustworthiness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13976)
*Carlo Mazzola,Hassan Ali,Kristína Malinovská,Igor Farkaš*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Proposes an interaction-based framework to foster trustworthy HRI by aligning human trust with robot skills through two pillars—human awareness and transparency—and four bridging components, in a concept paper guiding future design.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Trustworthiness in embodied robots is essential for safe and effective human-robot interaction; misplaced or overtrust poses safety and ethical risks, necessitating mechanisms to align human trust with actual robot capabilities.

Method: Conceptual, interaction-based framework outlined in a position paper. It centers on two pillars (human awareness and transparency) and introduces four components to bridge the gap between perceived trust and true capabilities.

Result: A conceptual framework and four bridging components are proposed; no empirical results are presented.

Conclusion: Integrating human awareness and transparency can align robot behavior with human expectations while giving humans comprehension and control, reducing mis/trust and promoting safe, ethical HRI.

Abstract: As robots get more integrated into human environments, fostering
trustworthiness in embodied robotic agents becomes paramount for an effective
and safe human-robot interaction (HRI). To achieve that, HRI applications must
promote human trust that aligns with robot skills and avoid misplaced trust or
overtrust, which can pose safety risks and ethical concerns. To achieve that,
HRI applications must promote human trust that aligns with robot skills and
avoid misplaced trust or overtrust, which can pose safety risks and ethical
concerns. In this position paper, we outline an interaction-based framework for
building trust through mutual understanding between humans and robots. We
emphasize two main pillars: human awareness and transparency, referring to the
robot ability to interpret human actions accurately and to clearly communicate
its intentions and goals, respectively. By integrating these two pillars,
robots can behave in a manner that aligns with human expectations and needs
while providing their human partners with both comprehension and control over
their actions. We also introduce four components that we think are important
for bridging the gap between a human-perceived sense of trust and a robot true
capabilities.

### [221] [The Social Context of Human-Robot Interactions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13982)
*Sydney Thompson,Kate Candon,Marynel Vázquez*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A survey reveals inconsistent use of 'social context' in HRI; it introduces a unified conceptual model to describe social contexts, applies it to prior work, identifies attributes for planning, modeling, and evaluation, and discusses open research questions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address miscommunication and fragmentation caused by varied definitions of 'social context' in HRI and to provide a shared framework for understanding and modeling social context in human-robot interactions.

Method: Systematic literature survey of HRI papers to collect definitions and uses of 'social context'; development of a conceptual model; application of the model to existing work; discussion of contextual attributes; outlining open research questions.

Result: Proposes a conceptual model for describing social context in HRI; builds a framework of attributes to guide planning, behavior modeling, and post-interaction insights; maps the model onto existing studies to unify disparate definitions.

Conclusion: The proposed model offers a path toward better understanding and modeling of social contexts in HRI and highlights several open research questions for refinement and validation across studies.

Abstract: The Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) community often highlights the social
context of an interaction as a key consideration when designing, implementing,
and evaluating robot behavior. Unfortunately, researchers use the term "social
context" in varied ways. This can lead to miscommunication, making it
challenging to draw connections between related work on understanding and
modeling the social contexts of human-robot interactions. To address this gap,
we survey the HRI literature for existing definitions and uses of the term
"social context". Then, we propose a conceptual model for describing the social
context of a human-robot interaction. We apply this model to existing work, and
we discuss a range of attributes of social contexts that can help researchers
plan for interactions, develop behavior models for robots, and gain insights
after interactions have taken place. We conclude with a discussion of open
research questions in relation to understanding and modeling the social
contexts of human-robot interactions.

*Yifu Yuan,Haiqin Cui,Yaoting Huang,Yibin Chen,Fei Ni,Zibin Dong,Pengyi Li,Yan Zheng,Jianye Hao*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Proposes a pointing-based, embodiment-agnostic intermediate representation to bridge perception and action; introduces Embodied-R1 (3B VLM) and Embodied-Points-200K, uses reinforced fine-tuning to achieve strong zero-shot generalization in embodied tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generalization in embodied AI suffers from the seeing-to-doing gap due to data scarcity and embodiment heterogeneity; a unified representation that transfers across tasks and embodiments is needed.

Method: Define four core embodied pointing abilities; construct Embodied-Points-200K from diverse datasets; train Embodied-R1 via a two-stage Reinforced Fine-tuning curriculum with a multi-task reward design.

Result: State-of-the-art on 11 embodied spatial and pointing benchmarks; zero-shot: SIMPLEREnv 56.2% and 87.5% across 8 real-world XArm tasks without task-specific fine-tuning; 62% improvement over strong baselines; robust to diverse visual disturbances.

Conclusion: A pointing-centric representation combined with reinforced fine-tuning provides a generalizable pathway to close the perception-action gap in robotics.

Abstract: Generalization in embodied AI is hindered by the "seeing-to-doing gap," which
stems from data scarcity and embodiment heterogeneity. To address this, we
pioneer "pointing" as a unified, embodiment-agnostic intermediate
representation, defining four core embodied pointing abilities that bridge
high-level vision-language comprehension with low-level action primitives. We
introduce Embodied-R1, a 3B Vision-Language Model (VLM) specifically designed
for embodied reasoning and pointing. We use a wide range of embodied and
general visual reasoning datasets as sources to construct a large-scale
dataset, Embodied-Points-200K, which supports key embodied pointing
capabilities. We then train Embodied-R1 using a two-stage Reinforced
Fine-tuning (RFT) curriculum with a specialized multi-task reward design.
Embodied-R1 achieves state-of-the-art performance on 11 embodied spatial and
pointing benchmarks. Critically, it demonstrates robust zero-shot
generalization by achieving a 56.2% success rate in the SIMPLEREnv and 87.5%
across 8 real-world XArm tasks without any task-specific fine-tuning,
representing a 62% improvement over strong baselines. Furthermore, the model
exhibits high robustness against diverse visual disturbances. Our work shows
that a pointing-centric representation, combined with an RFT training paradigm,
offers an effective and generalizable pathway to closing the perception-action
gap in robotics.

### [223] [Train Once, Deploy Anywhere: Realize Data-Efficient Dynamic Object Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14042)
*Zhuoling Li,Xiaoyang Wu,Zhenhua Xu,Hengshuang Zhao*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: GEM is an entropy-based framework enabling few-shot generalization for dynamic object manipulation via imitation learning, achieving cross-domain generalization and real-world deployment with high success.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reduce dependence on labor-intensive demonstrations while maintaining strong generalization across backgrounds, robot embodiments, dynamics, and object shapes.

Method: Formulates an entropy-based theoretical framework for imitation learning, introduces GEM system, and validates through extensive sim-to-real experiments including a real canteen deployment without in-scene demonstrations.

Result: GEM generalizes across diverse environment backgrounds, robot embodiments, motion dynamics, and object geometries; real-world deployment achieved over 97% success on 10,000+ operations without in-scene demonstrations.

Conclusion: Entropy-guided imitation learning can achieve strong generalization in dynamic object manipulation with minimal demonstrations, enabling scalable deployment in varied manufacturing contexts.

Abstract: Realizing generalizable dynamic object manipulation is important for
enhancing manufacturing efficiency, as it eliminates specialized engineering
for various scenarios. To this end, imitation learning emerges as a promising
paradigm, leveraging expert demonstrations to teach a policy manipulation
skills. Although the generalization of an imitation learning policy can be
improved by increasing demonstrations, demonstration collection is
labor-intensive. To address this problem, this paper investigates whether
strong generalization in dynamic object manipulation is achievable with only a
few demonstrations. Specifically, we develop an entropy-based theoretical
framework to quantify the optimization of imitation learning. Based on this
framework, we propose a system named Generalizable Entropy-based Manipulation
(GEM). Extensive experiments in simulated and real tasks demonstrate that GEM
can generalize across diverse environment backgrounds, robot embodiments,
motion dynamics, and object geometries. Notably, GEM has been deployed in a
real canteen for tableware collection. Without any in-scene demonstration, it
achieves a success rate of over 97% across more than 10,000 operations.
