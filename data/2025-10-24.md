### [1] [Fourier-Based GAN Fingerprint Detection using ResNet50](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19840)
*Sai Teja Erukude,Viswa Chaitanya Marella,Suhasnadh Reddy Veluru*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper reports a frequency-domain detector for StyleGAN images using 2D DFT inputs to a ResNet50, achieving high performance (92.8% accuracy, AUC 0.95) and outperforming spatial-domain models, indicating GANs leave exploitable Fourier-domain fingerprints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As GANs produce highly realistic images, there is a growing need for reliable forensics methods. Frequency-domain signatures may reveal artifacts not apparent in the spatial domain, offering robust detection for industrial AI systems.

Method: Apply a two-dimensional Discrete Fourier Transform to images to obtain Fourier-domain representations, then train a ResNet50 classifier to distinguish real versus StyleGAN-generated images. Compare performance against a model trained on raw spatial-domain images.

Result: The frequency-domain approach achieves 92.8% accuracy and an AUC of 0.95, outperforming the spatial-domain baseline, indicating GAN-generated images possess distinctive frequency-domain fingerprints.

Conclusion: Frequency-domain features provide a robust cue for GAN image forensics; integrating signal processing with deep learning can enhance authenticity verification in industrial AI systems.

Abstract: The rapid rise of photorealistic images produced from Generative Adversarial
Networks (GANs) poses a serious challenge for image forensics and industrial
systems requiring reliable content authenticity. This paper uses
frequency-domain analysis combined with deep learning to solve the problem of
distinguishing StyleGAN-generated images from real ones. Specifically, a
two-dimensional Discrete Fourier Transform (2D DFT) was applied to transform
images into the Fourier domain, where subtle periodic artifacts become
detectable. A ResNet50 neural network is trained on these transformed images to
differentiate between real and synthetic ones. The experiments demonstrate that
the frequency-domain model achieves a 92.8 percent and an AUC of 0.95,
significantly outperforming the equivalent model trained on raw spatial-domain
images. These results indicate that the GAN-generated images have unique
frequency-domain signatures or "fingerprints". The method proposed highlights
the industrial potential of combining signal processing techniques and deep
learning to enhance digital forensics and strengthen the trustworthiness of
industrial AI systems.

### [2] [Transformed Multi-view 3D Shape Features with Contrastive Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19955)
*Márcus Vinícius Lobo Costa,Sherlon Almeida da Silva,Bárbara Caroline Benato,Leo Sampaio Ferraz Ribeiro,Moacir Antonelli Ponti*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ViT-based architectures with contrastive objectives improve 3D shape representation learning for multi-view analysis; achieves ~90.6% accuracy on ModelNet10, bridging supervised/self-supervised contrastive methods with 3D shape understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of CNNs in capturing global 3D shape semantics and reduce reliance on large labeled datasets. Explore Vision Transformers (ViTs) combined with modern contrastive objectives to unify contrastive learning with 3D shape understanding.

Method: Utilize Vision Transformer backbones trained with both supervised contrastive and self-supervised contrastive objectives on multi-view 3D data; perform extensive empirical evaluation on downstream 3D tasks to assess global vs local shape representations.

Result: Supervised contrastive losses reached about 90.6% accuracy on ModelNet10, indicating competitive performance of ViT-plus-contrastive approaches for 3D shape representation learning.

Conclusion: ViTs paired with contrastive objectives effectively capture global shape semantics and refine local discriminative features, offering an empirical, unified pathway for integrating contrastive learning with 3D shape understanding.

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenges in representation learning of 3D shape
features by investigating state-of-the-art backbones paired with both
contrastive supervised and self-supervised learning objectives. Computer vision
methods struggle with recognizing 3D objects from 2D images, often requiring
extensive labeled data and relying on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) that
may overlook crucial shape relationships. Our work demonstrates that Vision
Transformers (ViTs) based architectures, when paired with modern contrastive
objectives, achieve promising results in multi-view 3D analysis on our
downstream tasks, unifying contrastive and 3D shape understanding pipelines.
For example, supervised contrastive losses reached about 90.6% accuracy on
ModelNet10. The use of ViTs and contrastive learning, leveraging ViTs' ability
to understand overall shapes and contrastive learning's effectiveness,
overcomes the need for extensive labeled data and the limitations of CNNs in
capturing crucial shape relationships. The success stems from capturing global
shape semantics via ViTs and refining local discriminative features through
contrastive optimization. Importantly, our approach is empirical, as it is
grounded on extensive experimental evaluation to validate the effectiveness of
combining ViTs with contrastive objectives for 3D representation learning.

### [3] [FutrTrack: A Camera-LiDAR Fusion Transformer for 3D Multiple Object Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19981)
*Martha Teiko Teye,Ori Maoz,Matthias Rottmann*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FutrTrack presents a modular camera-LiDAR 3D MOT framework built on a transformer-based temporal smoother and a fusion-driven tracker; it leverages multimodal BEV features and query-based tracking to improve identity maintenance without explicit motion models, achieving strong nuScenes results (aMOTA 74.7) and showing data-efficient, pretrain-free performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address jitter, occlusion, and cross-view re-identification in 3D MOT by integrating multimodal cues and transformer-based tracking; reduce reliance on hand-crafted motion models and large pretraining.

Method: A two-stage, transformer-based refinement: (1) temporal smoother over a moving window to refine trajectories; (2) a fusion-driven tracker that combines detector bounding boxes with multimodal BEV features from cameras and LiDAR, enabling query-based tracking without an explicit motion model.

Result: On nuScenes and KITTI, FutrTrack demonstrates that multimodal features significantly benefit query-based transformer tracking; achieves aMOTA of 74.7 on nuScenes test set, reduces identity switches, and remains competitive, with claimed data efficiency and no pretraining.

Conclusion: FutrTrack shows that robust, multimodal transformer-based tracking can outperform single-sensor approaches and be competitive with neural-motion trackers, while offering an efficient, modular solution that works well with limited data and without pretraining.

Abstract: We propose FutrTrack, a modular camera-LiDAR multi-object tracking framework
that builds on existing 3D detectors by introducing a transformer-based
smoother and a fusion-driven tracker. Inspired by query-based tracking
frameworks, FutrTrack employs a multimodal two-stage transformer refinement and
tracking pipeline. Our fusion tracker integrates bounding boxes with multimodal
bird's-eye-view (BEV) fusion features from multiple cameras and LiDAR without
the need for an explicit motion model. The tracker assigns and propagates
identities across frames, leveraging both geometric and semantic cues for
robust re-identification under occlusion and viewpoint changes. Prior to
tracking, we refine sequences of bounding boxes with a temporal smoother over a
moving window to refine trajectories, reduce jitter, and improve spatial
consistency. Evaluated on nuScenes and KITTI, FutrTrack demonstrates that
query-based transformer tracking methods benefit significantly from multimodal
sensor features compared with previous single-sensor approaches. With an aMOTA
of 74.7 on the nuScenes test set, FutrTrack achieves strong performance on 3D
MOT benchmarks, reducing identity switches while maintaining competitive
accuracy. Our approach provides an efficient framework for improving
transformer-based trackers to compete with other neural-network-based methods
even with limited data and without pretraining.

### [4] [Improving Predictive Confidence in Medical Imaging via Online Label Smoothing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20011)
*Kushan Choudhury,Shubhrodeep Roy,Ankur Chanda,Shubhajit Biswas,Somenath Kuiry*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Online Label Smoothing (OLS) dynamically updates soft labels during training to reflect the model’s own predictions, improving accuracy and calibration on RadImageNet across several architectures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning models often produce overconfident predictions in medical image classification. Traditional label smoothing ignores relationships between classes, prompting the need for a dynamic, model-aware smoothing approach.

Method: Implement OLS that adjusts non-target label probabilities during training based on the model’s prediction patterns. Evaluate on RadImageNet using ResNet-50, MobileNetV2, and VGG-19, comparing against hard labels, standard label smoothing, and teacher-free knowledge distillation. Assess both classification performance (Top-1/Top-5) and representation learning (embedding geometry).

Result: OLS consistently improves Top-1 and Top-5 accuracy over hard labels, conventional label smoothing, and teacher-free KD across the three architectures. It also yields more compact and well-separated feature embeddings, indicating enhanced representation learning.

Conclusion: OLS strengthens predictive performance and calibration, offering a practical, effective solution for trustworthy AI in medical imaging.

Abstract: Deep learning models, especially convolutional neural networks, have achieved
impressive results in medical image classification. However, these models often
produce overconfident predictions, which can undermine their reliability in
critical healthcare settings. While traditional label smoothing offers a simple
way to reduce such overconfidence, it fails to consider relationships between
classes by treating all non-target classes equally. In this study, we explore
the use of Online Label Smoothing (OLS), a dynamic approach that adjusts soft
labels throughout training based on the model's own prediction patterns. We
evaluate OLS on the large-scale RadImageNet dataset using three widely used
architectures: ResNet-50, MobileNetV2, and VGG-19. Our results show that OLS
consistently improves both Top-1 and Top-5 classification accuracy compared to
standard training methods, including hard labels, conventional label smoothing,
and teacher-free knowledge distillation. In addition to accuracy gains, OLS
leads to more compact and well-separated feature embeddings, indicating
improved representation learning. These findings suggest that OLS not only
strengthens predictive performance but also enhances calibration, making it a
practical and effective solution for developing trustworthy AI systems in the
medical imaging domain.

### [5] [A Unified Detection Pipeline for Robust Object Detection in Fisheye-Based Traffic Surveillance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20016)
*Neema Jakisa Owor,Joshua Kofi Asamoah,Tanner Wambui Muturi,Anneliese Jakisa Owor,Blessing Agyei Kyem,Andrews Danyo,Yaw Adu-Gyamfi,Armstrong Aboah*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A fisheye-aware detection framework improves object detection under strong distortion by pre/post processing and ensemble of detectors, achieving competitive performance on AI City Challenge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fisheye imagery has strong radial distortion and nonuniform resolution, causing degraded object appearance near image boundaries, hindering standard detectors; there is a need for robustness across the distorted field.

Method: A simple yet effective pre- and post-processing pipeline to stabilize detections across the image; train multiple state-of-the-art detectors on fisheye traffic data; ensemble their outputs to boost accuracy.

Result: Achieved F1 score 0.6366 on AI City Challenge Track 4 (2025), placing 8th out of 62 teams.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates robustness to fisheye distortions and shows the benefit of pre/post processing plus ensemble in improving detection under severe distortion.

Abstract: Fisheye cameras offer an efficient solution for wide-area traffic
surveillance by capturing large fields of view from a single vantage point.
However, the strong radial distortion and nonuniform resolution inherent in
fisheye imagery introduce substantial challenges for standard object detectors,
particularly near image boundaries where object appearance is severely
degraded. In this work, we present a detection framework designed to operate
robustly under these conditions. Our approach employs a simple yet effective
pre and post processing pipeline that enhances detection consistency across the
image, especially in regions affected by severe distortion. We train several
state-of-the-art detection models on the fisheye traffic imagery and combine
their outputs through an ensemble strategy to improve overall detection
accuracy. Our method achieves an F1 score of0.6366 on the 2025 AI City
Challenge Track 4, placing 8thoverall out of 62 teams. These results
demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in addressing issues inherent to
fisheye imagery.

### [6] [Extreme Views: 3DGS Filter for Novel View Synthesis from Out-of-Distribution Camera Poses](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20027)
*Damian Bowness,Charalambos Poullis*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A real-time, render-aware filter for 3D Gaussian Splatting that mitigates extrapolation artifacts by using gradient-derived sensitivity scores to suppress unstable anisotropic regions, enabling higher fidelity rendering without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extrapolations far from training viewpoints produce noisy, uncertain density/color/geometry in 3DGS models; a real-time method is needed to preserve visual fidelity during free navigation.

Method: Compute sensitivity scores from intermediate gradients that target anisotropic orientation instabilities, apply a render-aware filter during rendering, and integrate seamlessly into existing 3DGS pipelines without retraining.

Result: Significant gains in visual quality, realism, and consistency over NeRF-based approaches such as BayesRays; method runs in real-time within the rendering pipeline; code and results are provided at the project link.

Conclusion: The approach effectively reduces generative uncertainty in extrapolated views, enabling robust, real-time 3DGS rendering across unseen viewpoints.

Abstract: When viewing a 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) model from camera positions
significantly outside the training data distribution, substantial visual noise
commonly occurs. These artifacts result from the lack of training data in these
extrapolated regions, leading to uncertain density, color, and geometry
predictions from the model.
  To address this issue, we propose a novel real-time render-aware filtering
method. Our approach leverages sensitivity scores derived from intermediate
gradients, explicitly targeting instabilities caused by anisotropic
orientations rather than isotropic variance. This filtering method directly
addresses the core issue of generative uncertainty, allowing 3D reconstruction
systems to maintain high visual fidelity even when users freely navigate
outside the original training viewpoints.
  Experimental evaluation demonstrates that our method substantially improves
visual quality, realism, and consistency compared to existing Neural Radiance
Field (NeRF)-based approaches such as BayesRays. Critically, our filter
seamlessly integrates into existing 3DGS rendering pipelines in real-time,
unlike methods that require extensive post-hoc retraining or fine-tuning.

### [7] [BrainPuzzle: Hybrid Physics and Data-Driven Reconstruction for Transcranial Ultrasound Tomography](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20029)
*Shengyu Chen,Shihang Feng,Yi Luo,Xiaowei Jia,Youzuo Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Hybrid physics-informed deep learning for transcranial SoS mapping: stage-1 time-reversal migration fragments; stage-2 transformer-based fusion with graph attention; partial movable array; synthetic data show improved accuracy and completeness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transcranial ultrasound faces skull-induced velocity variations, attenuation, phase aberrations, and limited clinical full-aperture access. Pure physics-based FWI is hampered by weak signals and incomplete coverage, while purely data-driven methods struggle under low SNR and sparse sensing.

Method: Stage 1: apply reverse-time migration (time-reversal acoustics) to multi-angle acquisitions to generate migration fragments that preserve structural details at low SNR. Stage 2: use a transformer-based super-resolution encoder–decoder with a graph-based attention unit to fuse fragments into a coherent, quantitative SoS image. Employ a partial-array acquisition with a movable low-count transducer set to improve feasibility; the hybrid method compensates for missing aperture.

Result: Two synthetic datasets show BrainPuzzle achieves superior SoS reconstruction accuracy and image completeness compared to baselines.

Conclusion: A hybrid physics–machine-learning framework can overcome skull-induced challenges and sparse aperture limitations, enabling more accurate and complete quantitative ultrasound brain imaging with potential clinical impact.

Abstract: Ultrasound brain imaging remains challenging due to the large difference in
sound speed between the skull and brain tissues and the difficulty of coupling
large probes to the skull. This work aims to achieve quantitative transcranial
ultrasound by reconstructing an accurate speed-of-sound (SoS) map of the brain.
Traditional physics-based full-waveform inversion (FWI) is limited by weak
signals caused by skull-induced attenuation, mode conversion, and phase
aberration, as well as incomplete spatial coverage since full-aperture arrays
are clinically impractical. In contrast, purely data-driven methods that learn
directly from raw ultrasound data often fail to model the complex nonlinear and
nonlocal wave propagation through bone, leading to anatomically plausible but
quantitatively biased SoS maps under low signal-to-noise and sparse-aperture
conditions. To address these issues, we propose BrainPuzzle, a hybrid two-stage
framework that combines physical modeling with machine learning. In the first
stage, reverse time migration (time-reversal acoustics) is applied to
multi-angle acquisitions to produce migration fragments that preserve
structural details even under low SNR. In the second stage, a transformer-based
super-resolution encoder-decoder with a graph-based attention unit (GAU) fuses
these fragments into a coherent and quantitatively accurate SoS image. A
partial-array acquisition strategy using a movable low-count transducer set
improves feasibility and coupling, while the hybrid algorithm compensates for
the missing aperture. Experiments on two synthetic datasets show that
BrainPuzzle achieves superior SoS reconstruction accuracy and image
completeness, demonstrating its potential for advancing quantitative ultrasound
brain imaging.

### [8] [Exposing Blindspots: Cultural Bias Evaluation in Generative Image Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20042)
*Huichan Seo,Sieun Choi,Minki Hong,Yi Zhou,Junseo Kim,Lukman Ismaila,Naome Etori,Mehul Agarwal,Zhixuan Liu,Jihie Kim,Jean Oh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A cross-country, era-aware benchmark for evaluating culture bias in generative image models, covering both T2I and I2I, revealing Global-North bias, erosion of cultural fidelity with iterative edits, and superficial cue-based edits; provides standardized data, prompts, and evaluation protocols for reproducible, culture-centered bias diagnostics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address a gap where cultural bias has been studied mainly in text-to-image systems, leaving image-to-image editors underexplored. Propose a unified, reproducible protocol across six countries, 8 categories/36 subcategories, and era-aware prompts to diagnose culture sensitivity in both generation and editing.

Method: Open models with fixed settings; evaluate across country, era, and category dimensions using a standardized protocol. Combine automatic metrics, a culture-aware retrieval-augmented VQA, and expert human judgments from native reviewers. Use an 8-category/36-subcategory schema and era-aware prompts. Release the complete image corpus, prompts, and configurations for reproducibility.

Result: Three key findings: (1) Country-agnostic prompts lead to Global-North, modern-leaning depictions that flatten cross-country distinctions; (2) Iterative I2I editing erodes cultural fidelity even when metrics stay flat or improve; (3) I2I models apply superficial cues (palette shifts, generic props) rather than era-consistent, context-aware changes, often retaining source identity for Global-South targets.

Conclusion: Culture-sensitive edits remain unreliable with current systems. The authors provide standardized data, prompts, and human evaluation protocols to enable a reproducible, culture-centered benchmark for diagnosing and tracking cultural bias in generative image models.

Abstract: Generative image models produce striking visuals yet often misrepresent
culture. Prior work has examined cultural bias mainly in text-to-image (T2I)
systems, leaving image-to-image (I2I) editors underexplored. We bridge this gap
with a unified evaluation across six countries, an 8-category/36-subcategory
schema, and era-aware prompts, auditing both T2I generation and I2I editing
under a standardized protocol that yields comparable diagnostics. Using open
models with fixed settings, we derive cross-country, cross-era, and
cross-category evaluations. Our framework combines standard automatic metrics,
a culture-aware retrieval-augmented VQA, and expert human judgments collected
from native reviewers. To enable reproducibility, we release the complete image
corpus, prompts, and configurations. Our study reveals three findings: (1)
under country-agnostic prompts, models default to Global-North, modern-leaning
depictions that flatten cross-country distinctions; (2) iterative I2I editing
erodes cultural fidelity even when conventional metrics remain flat or improve;
and (3) I2I models apply superficial cues (palette shifts, generic props)
rather than era-consistent, context-aware changes, often retaining source
identity for Global-South targets. These results highlight that
culture-sensitive edits remain unreliable in current systems. By releasing
standardized data, prompts, and human evaluation protocols, we provide a
reproducible, culture-centered benchmark for diagnosing and tracking cultural
bias in generative image models.

### [9] [Filter-Based Reconstruction of Images from Events](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20071)
*Bernd Pfrommer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A lightweight, asynchronous, filter-based method (FIBAR) for reconstructing intensity images from event-camera data using an IIR temporal filter, stale-pixel regulation, and optional Gaussian smoothing, enabling CPU-based readouts with fast throughput; trades some image quality for speed and simplicity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Event cameras produce sparse, high-temporal-resolution data, making intensity reconstruction challenging. Most effective approaches rely on neural networks on GPUs, which are resource-intensive. There is a need for a simple, CPU-friendly, asynchronous reconstruction method that can read out at arbitrary times and support downstream tasks.

Method: Apply a temporal digital IIR filter to integrate intensity changes signaled by events. Detect and regulate a window of recently updated (stale) pixels to suppress reconstruction noise. Assume absence of events at a location implies low image gradient; blur stale pixels with a Gaussian filter. Make the method asynchronous, allowing image read-out at any time. Implemented on a modern laptop CPU, achieving 42(140) million events/s with/without spatial filtering. Compare qualitatively to a neural-network method (FireNet). Code available.

Result: FIBAR runs efficiently on CPU, achieving high event throughput (42(140) M events/s). The reconstructions are noisier and exhibit ghosting compared to neural-network baselines but are still useful for certain tasks such as fiducial-marker detection. The paper provides qualitative comparisons demonstrating the differences in image quality and shows that a simple filter-based pipeline can yield usable results without heavy training or GPU resources.

Conclusion: A simple, asynchronous, filter-based approach provides a viable alternative to DNN-based methods for event-camera image reconstruction. It enables arbitrary-time readouts and runs efficiently on consumer hardware, but at the cost of higher noise and ghost artifacts. It is suitable for basic tasks like fiducial detection and serves as a lightweight baseline that could be improved with hybrid or post-filtering strategies.

Abstract: Reconstructing an intensity image from the events of a moving event camera is
a challenging task that is typically approached with neural networks deployed
on graphics processing units. This paper presents a much simpler, FIlter Based
Asynchronous Reconstruction method (FIBAR). First, intensity changes signaled
by events are integrated with a temporal digital IIR filter. To reduce
reconstruction noise, stale pixels are detected by a novel algorithm that
regulates a window of recently updated pixels. Arguing that for a moving
camera, the absence of events at a pixel location likely implies a low image
gradient, stale pixels are then blurred with a Gaussian filter. In contrast to
most existing methods, FIBAR is asynchronous and permits image read-out at an
arbitrary time. It runs on a modern laptop CPU at about 42(140) million
events/s with (without) spatial filtering enabled. A few simple qualitative
experiments are presented that show the difference in image reconstruction
between FIBAR and a neural network-based approach (FireNet). FIBAR's
reconstruction is noisier than neural network-based methods and suffers from
ghost images. However, it is sufficient for certain tasks such as the detection
of fiducial markers. Code is available at

### [10] [Data-Adaptive Transformed Bilateral Tensor Low-Rank Representation for Clustering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20077)
*Hui Chen,Xinjie Wang,Xianchao Xiu,Wanquan Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes TBTLRR, a data-adaptive, transformed bilateral tensor low-rank representation model for image clustering that learns unitary transforms to define a tensor nuclear norm, leveraging both global and local correlations, with l1/2 and Frobenius regularization, solved via an ADMM-inspired algorithm with proven convergence and strong clustering performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing tensor low-rank methods rely on fixed transformations and struggle with noise robustness. There is a need for data-adaptive transforms and a bilateral (local-global) view to better capture correlations in image data under real-world noise.

Method: Introduce TBTLRR: (1) learn arbitrary unitary transforms to form a data-adaptive tensor nuclear norm; (2) exploit bilateral structure to capture local sample-feature correlations; (3) regularize with l1/2-norm and Frobenius norm to handle complex noise; (4) solve the nonconvex problem with an ADMM-inspired optimization algorithm and prove convergence.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate that TBTLRR outperforms state-of-the-art clustering methods, validating its robustness and effectiveness in capturing global and local correlations under noise. Code will be released at the provided GitHub link.

Conclusion: TBTLRR provides a robust, data-adaptive framework for tensor low-rank representation in image clustering, leveraging both global and local correlations and offering convergent, efficient optimization with superior clustering performance.

Abstract: Tensor low-rank representation (TLRR) has demonstrated significant success in
image clustering. However, most existing methods rely on fixed transformations
and suffer from poor robustness to noise. In this paper, we propose a novel
transformed bilateral tensor low-rank representation model called TBTLRR, which
introduces a data-adaptive tensor nuclear norm by learning arbitrary unitary
transforms, allowing for more effective capture of global correlations. In
addition, by leveraging the bilateral structure of latent tensor data, TBTLRR
is able to exploit local correlations between image samples and features.
Furthermore, TBTLRR integrates the $\ell_{1/2}$-norm and Frobenius norm
regularization terms for better dealing with complex noise in real-world
scenarios. To solve the proposed nonconvex model, we develop an efficient
optimization algorithm inspired by the alternating direction method of
multipliers (ADMM) and provide theoretical convergence. Extensive experiments
validate its superiority over the state-of-the-art methods in clustering. The
code will be available at https://github.com/xianchaoxiu/TBTLRR.

*Lorenzo Arboit,Dennis N. Schneider,Britty Baby,Vinkle Srivastav,Pietro Mascagni,Nicolas Padoy*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Endoshare is a source-available, cross-platform tool to merge, standardize, and de-identify endoscopic videos in MIS, showing high usability and adoption potential, but requiring compliance and interoperability validation for deployment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome heterogeneity in recording formats and privacy concerns in surgical video sharing, enabling standardized, privacy-preserving video management for training, research, and quality improvement.

Method: Software development lifecycle with iterative, user-centered feedback; internal usability heuristics survey; external clinician survey combining heuristics with Technology Acceptance Model; benchmarking across hardware; development of a privacy-by-design architecture.

Result: Prototype scored high in usability (clinicians 4.68±0.40/5; 4.03±0.51/5; lowest label clarity 4.00±0.93/5); after refinement, ten surgeons reported high perceived usefulness (5.07±1.75/7), ease of use (5.15±1.71/7), heuristic usability (4.38±0.48/5), and strong recommendation (9.20±0.79/10); processing time varied with mode, video duration (both p≤0.001), and hardware (p=0.041).

Conclusion: Endoshare provides a transparent, user-friendly pipeline for standardized, privacy-preserving surgical video management; compliance certification and broader interoperability validation are needed to establish it as a deployable alternative to proprietary systems.

Abstract: Video-based assessment and surgical data science can advance surgical
training, research, and quality improvement. However, widespread use remains
limited by heterogeneous recording formats and privacy concerns associated with
video sharing. We present Endoshare, a source-available, cross-platform
application for merging, standardizing, and de-identifying endoscopic videos in
minimally invasive surgery. Development followed the software development life
cycle with iterative, user-centered feedback. During the analysis phase, an
internal survey of clinicians and computer scientists based on ten usability
heuristics identified key requirements that guided a privacy-by-design
architecture. In the testing phase, an external clinician survey combined the
same heuristics with Technology Acceptance Model constructs to assess usability
and adoption, complemented by benchmarking across different hardware
configurations. Four clinicians and four computer scientists initially tested
the prototype, reporting high usability (4.68 +/- 0.40/5 and 4.03 +/- 0.51/5),
with the lowest score (4.00 +/- 0.93/5) relating to label clarity. After
refinement, the testing phase surveyed ten surgeons who reported high perceived
usefulness (5.07 +/- 1.75/7), ease of use (5.15 +/- 1.71/7), heuristic
usability (4.38 +/- 0.48/5), and strong recommendation (9.20 +/- 0.79/10).
Processing time varied with processing mode, video duration (both p <= 0.001),
and machine computational power (p = 0.041). Endoshare provides a transparent,
user-friendly pipeline for standardized, privacy-preserving surgical video
management. Compliance certification and broader interoperability validation
are needed to establish it as a deployable alternative to proprietary systems.

### [12] [Attentive Convolution: Unifying the Expressivity of Self-Attention with Convolutional Efficiency](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20092)
*Hao Yu,Haoyu Chen,Yan Jiang,Wei Peng,Zhaodong Sun,Samuel Kaski,Guoying Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Attentive Convolution (ATConv) reformulates convolution to inject SA-style adaptive routing and lateral inhibition, bridging CNNs and self-attention with linear complexity. With 3x3 kernels, ATConv-based AttNet achieves strong ImageNet results (84.4% Top-1 with 27M params) and improves diffusion-model quality (FID drop of 0.15 at 400k steps) with faster sampling; code released.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Self-attention offers strong expressivity but has quadratic complexity; conventional convolutions are efficient but lack SA-like expressivity. The paper seeks to identify the core principles that give SA its edge and integrate them into CNN design to obtain high performance with efficiency.

Method: Introduce Attentive Convolution (ATConv), a principled reformulation of convolution that incorporates two SA-inspired principles: (1) Adaptive routing, which modulates how positional information is propagated based on semantic content; (2) Lateral inhibition, which enables score competition among tokens to suppress redundancy. Build AttNet, a CNN family using ATConv (notably with 3x3 kernels) and evaluate in vision tasks and diffusion models.

Result: ATConv with 3x3 kernels consistently surpasses various SA mechanisms on fundamental vision tasks. AttNet reaches 84.4% ImageNet-1K Top-1 with 27M parameters. In diffusion-based image generation, replacing SA with ATConv in SiT-XL/2 reduces ImageNet FID by 0.15 in 400k steps and enables faster sampling.

Conclusion: ATConv provides a principled, efficient route to capture SA-like expressivity within CNNs, closing much of the performance gap while maintaining low computational cost. AttNet demonstrates strong practical performance, and the approach is applicable to diffusion models. Code is publicly available.

Abstract: Self-attention (SA) has become the cornerstone of modern vision backbones for
its powerful expressivity over traditional Convolutions (Conv). However, its
quadratic complexity remains a critical bottleneck for practical applications.
Given that Conv offers linear complexity and strong visual priors, continuing
efforts have been made to promote the renaissance of Conv. However, a
persistent performance chasm remains, highlighting that these modernizations
have not yet captured the intrinsic expressivity that defines SA. In this
paper, we re-examine the design of the CNNs, directed by a key question: what
principles give SA its edge over Conv? As a result, we reveal two fundamental
insights that challenge the long-standing design intuitions in prior research
(e.g., Receptive field). The two findings are: (1) \textit{Adaptive routing}:
SA dynamically regulates positional information flow according to semantic
content, whereas Conv employs static kernels uniformly across all positions.
(2) \textit{Lateral inhibition}: SA induces score competition among token
weighting, effectively suppressing redundancy and sharpening representations,
whereas Conv filters lack such inhibitory dynamics and exhibit considerable
redundancy. Based on this, we propose \textit{Attentive Convolution} (ATConv),
a principled reformulation of the convolutional operator that intrinsically
injects these principles. Interestingly, with only $3\times3$ kernels, ATConv
consistently outperforms various SA mechanisms in fundamental vision tasks.
Building on ATConv, we introduce AttNet, a CNN family that can attain
\textbf{84.4\%} ImageNet-1K Top-1 accuracy with only 27M parameters. In
diffusion-based image generation, replacing all SA with the proposed $3\times
3$ ATConv in SiT-XL/2 reduces ImageNet FID by 0.15 in 400k steps with faster
sampling. Code is available at: github.com/price112/Attentive-Convolution.

*Jiho Park,Sieun Choi,Jaeyoon Seo,Jihie Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes StableSketcher to generate hand-drawn sketches with high prompt fidelity by VAE latent-decoding fine-tuning and a VQA-based RL reward; introduces SketchDUO dataset with instance-level sketches, captions, and Q&A; claims improved stylistic fidelity and prompt alignment over Stable Diffusion; code/dataset to be released.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bridge the gap between diffusion-based image synthesis and the creation of pixel-based, human-drawn sketches, which require different stylistic and semantic alignment than typical photo-realistic images. Current datasets lack well-aligned, instance-level sketch data with rich textual annotations.

Method: Fine-tune the VAE to better model sketch latent spaces for diffusion-based generation. Introduce a reinforcement learning objective with a reward grounded in visual question answering to optimize text-image alignment and semantic consistency during generation. Create SketchDUO, a dataset pairing instance-level sketches with captions and QA pairs to support evaluation and training.

Result: Empirically, StableSketcher yields sketches with improved stylistic fidelity and better prompt alignment compared to a Stable Diffusion baseline. SketchDUO is introduced as the first dataset with instance-level sketches paired with captions and QA pairs.

Conclusion: StableSketcher advances sketch synthesis by aligning generated sketches more closely with prompts and stylistic cues; SketchDUO fills a dataset gap for evaluation and training incorporating sketches with richer textual annotations. Code and dataset to be released.

Abstract: Although recent advancements in diffusion models have significantly enriched
the quality of generated images, challenges remain in synthesizing pixel-based
human-drawn sketches, a representative example of abstract expression. To
combat these challenges, we propose StableSketcher, a novel framework that
empowers diffusion models to generate hand-drawn sketches with high prompt
fidelity. Within this framework, we fine-tune the variational autoencoder to
optimize latent decoding, enabling it to better capture the characteristics of
sketches. In parallel, we integrate a new reward function for reinforcement
learning based on visual question answering, which improves text-image
alignment and semantic consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
StableSketcher generates sketches with improved stylistic fidelity, achieving
better alignment with prompts compared to the Stable Diffusion baseline.
Additionally, we introduce SketchDUO, to the best of our knowledge, the first
dataset comprising instance-level sketches paired with captions and
question-answer pairs, thereby addressing the limitations of existing datasets
that rely on image-label pairs. Our code and dataset will be made publicly
available upon acceptance.

*Ziheng Zhang,Xinyue Ma,Arpita Chowdhury,Elizabeth G. Campolongo,Matthew J. Thompson,Net Zhang,Samuel Stevens,Hilmar Lapp,Tanya Berger-Wolf,Yu Su,Wei-Lun Chao,Jianyang Gu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces BIOCAP, a biological foundation model trained with synthetic descriptive captions generated by multimodal LLMs to align images with richer textual supervision, improving species classification and text-image retrieval beyond label-only methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Descriptive captions can reveal diagnostic biological traits and reduce reliance on spurious correlations, but collecting faithful, instance-specific captions at scale is challenging in organismal biology. Synthetic captions guided by domain knowledge can bridge this gap.

Method: Generate synthetic, descriptive captions using multimodal large language models guided by Wikipedia-derived visual information and taxon-tailored prompts; train BIOCAP (BIOCLIP with Captions) to align image and caption modalities, leveraging the richer supervision from captions.

Result: BIOCAP achieves strong performance in species classification and text-image retrieval, demonstrating that descriptive captions provide valuable supervision beyond labels and help bridge biological images with multimodal foundation models.

Conclusion: Descriptive captions are a valuable source of supervision for biological multimodal models, and synthetic captions produced by MLLMs can unlock robust, instance-aware language supervision at scale.

Abstract: This work investigates descriptive captions as an additional source of
supervision for biological multimodal foundation models. Images and captions
can be viewed as complementary samples from the latent morphospace of a
species, each capturing certain biological traits. Incorporating captions
during training encourages alignment with this shared latent structure,
emphasizing potentially diagnostic characters while suppressing spurious
correlations. The main challenge, however, lies in obtaining faithful,
instance-specific captions at scale. This requirement has limited the
utilization of natural language supervision in organismal biology compared with
many other scientific domains. We complement this gap by generating synthetic
captions with multimodal large language models (MLLMs), guided by
Wikipedia-derived visual information and taxon-tailored format examples. These
domain-specific contexts help reduce hallucination and yield accurate,
instance-based descriptive captions. Using these captions, we train BIOCAP
(i.e., BIOCLIP with Captions), a biological foundation model that captures rich
semantics and achieves strong performance in species classification and
text-image retrieval. These results demonstrate the value of descriptive
captions beyond labels in bridging biological images with multimodal foundation
models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A system that detects and tracks fast-moving small objects in 3D using RGB-D, merging deep learning detection with a physics-based tracker and an outlier correction module; evaluated on a racquetball dataset and outperforming Kalman-filter trackers by up to 70% reduction in Average Displacement Error.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fast-moving tiny objects in 3D are underexplored; existing CV trackers struggle with occlusions and rapid changes; need robust perception for autonomous systems.

Method: A combined pipeline: deep learning-based detection, physics-based tracking incorporating kinematic equations to predict states and handle outliers/missed detections, plus an outlier detection/correction module.

Result: On a custom racquetball dataset, the approach surpasses Kalman-filter based trackers with up to 70% lower Average Displacement Error, demonstrating real-time 3D detection/tracking of small objects.

Conclusion: Integrating physics-based models with deep learning improves 3D tracking of fast-moving small objects and has strong potential for robotics perception applications.

Abstract: While computer vision has advanced considerably for general object detection
and tracking, the specific problem of fast-moving tiny objects remains
underexplored. This paper addresses the significant challenge of detecting and
tracking rapidly moving small objects using an RGB-D camera. Our novel system
combines deep learning-based detection with physics-based tracking to overcome
the limitations of existing approaches. Our contributions include: (1) a
comprehensive system design for object detection and tracking of fast-moving
small objects in 3D space, (2) an innovative physics-based tracking algorithm
that integrates kinematics motion equations to handle outliers and missed
detections, and (3) an outlier detection and correction module that
significantly improves tracking performance in challenging scenarios such as
occlusions and rapid direction changes. We evaluated our proposed system on a
custom racquetball dataset. Our evaluation shows our system surpassing kalman
filter based trackers with up to 70\% less Average Displacement Error. Our
system has significant applications for improving robot perception on
autonomous platforms and demonstrates the effectiveness of combining
physics-based models with deep learning approaches for real-time 3D detection
and tracking of challenging small objects.

### [16] [Inverse Image-Based Rendering for Light Field Generation from Single Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20132)
*Hyunjun Jung,Hae-Gon Jeon*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A neural inverse image-based rendering method that generates light-field views from a single image by learning light flows and cross-attention among source rays, iteratively updating occluded content; it generalizes across datasets without retraining and outperforms state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To broaden the benefits of light-field rendering by removing reliance on bulky multi-view capture setups and heavy computation, enabling novel-view synthesis from a single image without explicit 3D reconstruction.

Method: A neural renderer stores the light flows of source rays from the input image, uses cross-attention to relate these rays, and predicts the color of a target ray. After rendering a new view, the generated content is merged back into the source rays and the process repeats to ensure occluded regions are consistently filled. The system is trained on synthetic data and tested on challenging datasets without retraining, and it achieves better performance than relevant state-of-the-art methods.

Result: The approach works well across various challenging datasets without additional retraining after the initial synthetic training and outperforms relevant state-of-the-art novel view synthesis methods.

Conclusion: Inverse image-based rendering offers a practical pathway to generate light-field views from a single image, expanding applicability of light-field techniques by removing the need for specialized capture hardware and explicit 3D geometry reconstruction.

Abstract: A concept of light-fields computed from multiple view images on regular grids
has proven its benefit for scene representations, and supported realistic
renderings of novel views and photographic effects such as refocusing and
shallow depth of field. In spite of its effectiveness of light flow
computations, obtaining light fields requires either computational costs or
specialized devices like a bulky camera setup and a specialized microlens
array. In an effort to broaden its benefit and applicability, in this paper, we
propose a novel view synthesis method for light field generation from only
single images, named inverse image-based rendering. Unlike previous attempts to
implicitly rebuild 3D geometry or to explicitly represent objective scenes, our
method reconstructs light flows in a space from image pixels, which behaves in
the opposite way to image-based rendering. To accomplish this, we design a
neural rendering pipeline to render a target ray in an arbitrary viewpoint. Our
neural renderer first stores the light flow of source rays from the input
image, then computes the relationships among them through cross-attention, and
finally predicts the color of the target ray based on these relationships.
After the rendering pipeline generates the first novel view from a single input
image, the generated out-of-view contents are updated to the set of source
rays. This procedure is iteratively performed while ensuring the consistent
generation of occluded contents. We demonstrate that our inverse image-based
rendering works well with various challenging datasets without any retraining
or finetuning after once trained on synthetic dataset, and outperforms relevant
state-of-the-art novel view synthesis methods.

*Jiachen Liang,Ruibing Hou,Minyang Hu,Hong Chang,Shiguang Shan,Xilin Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LogitGap is a post-hoc OOD detector that exploits the relationship between the top logit and the remaining logits, with a training-free strategy to select informative logits, achieving state-of-the-art results on both vision-language and vision-only models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Out-of-distribution detection is crucial for reliable open-world deployment. Existing post-hoc methods underutilize the rich information in the model's logits space. This work aims to improve ID-OOD separability by leveraging the relationship between the maximum logit and other logits, and by focusing on a compact, informative subset of logits.

Method: Propose LogitGap, a post-hoc OOD detector that scores samples based on the gap between the maximum logit and the remaining logits. Further refine with a training-free strategy that automatically identifies the most informative logits to use for scoring.

Result: Empirical results show that LogitGap achieves state-of-the-art OOD detection performance across diverse benchmarks, including both vision-language and vision-only models. The approach is supported by theoretical analysis and extensive experiments; code is available at the provided URL.

Conclusion: LogitGap provides an effective and efficient post-hoc OOD detection method by leveraging logit-space relationships and automatically selecting informative logits, yielding strong, broadly applicable improvements over existing methods.

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is critical for ensuring the reliability
of deep learning models in open-world applications. While post-hoc methods are
favored for their efficiency and ease of deployment, existing approaches often
underexploit the rich information embedded in the model's logits space. In this
paper, we propose LogitGap, a novel post-hoc OOD detection method that
explicitly exploits the relationship between the maximum logit and the
remaining logits to enhance the separability between in-distribution (ID) and
OOD samples. To further improve its effectiveness, we refine LogitGap by
focusing on a more compact and informative subset of the logit space.
Specifically, we introduce a training-free strategy that automatically
identifies the most informative logits for scoring. We provide both theoretical
analysis and empirical evidence to validate the effectiveness of our approach.
Extensive experiments on both vision-language and vision-only models
demonstrate that LogitGap consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance
across diverse OOD detection scenarios and benchmarks. Code is available at

*Penghao Wang,Yiyang He,Xin Lv,Yukai Zhou,Lan Xu,Jingyi Yu,Jiayuan Gu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PartNeXt: a textured, large-scale 3D part dataset with hierarchical labels across 50 categories, enabling robust 3D part segmentation and 3D-LLM QA; shows improvements over PartNet; enables gains when training Point-SAM.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D part datasets (e.g., PartNet) use untextured geometry and rely on expert labeling, limiting realism, scalability, and open-vocabulary evaluation. A textured, richly labeled dataset is needed for advances in segmentation, reasoning, and real-world robotics/graphics.

Method: Construct PartNeXt with 23k textured 3D models annotated with fine-grained, hierarchical part labels over 50 categories. Benchmark on two tasks: (1) class-agnostic part segmentation (evaluating existing methods like PartField, SAMPart3D on fine-grained/leaf parts); (2) 3D part-centric question answering (a benchmark for 3D-LLMs). Train Point-SAM on PartNeXt and compare to PartNet to assess gains.

Result: PartNeXt enables new evaluation challenges: state-of-the-art methods struggle with fine-grained leaf parts; the 3D-LLM QA benchmark reveals substantial gaps in open-vocabulary part grounding. Training Point-SAM on PartNeXt yields substantial gains over PartNet, demonstrating higher quality and diversity of annotations and texture-aware labels.

Conclusion: PartNeXt provides scalable, texture-aware, multi-task data that advances structured 3D understanding, enabling more realistic segmentation, richer 3D reasoning, and stronger foundation models for 3D vision, graphics, and robotics.

Abstract: Understanding objects at the level of their constituent parts is fundamental
to advancing computer vision, graphics, and robotics. While datasets like
PartNet have driven progress in 3D part understanding, their reliance on
untextured geometries and expert-dependent annotation limits scalability and
usability. We introduce PartNeXt, a next-generation dataset addressing these
gaps with over 23,000 high-quality, textured 3D models annotated with
fine-grained, hierarchical part labels across 50 categories. We benchmark
PartNeXt on two tasks: (1) class-agnostic part segmentation, where
state-of-the-art methods (e.g., PartField, SAMPart3D) struggle with
fine-grained and leaf-level parts, and (2) 3D part-centric question answering,
a new benchmark for 3D-LLMs that reveals significant gaps in open-vocabulary
part grounding. Additionally, training Point-SAM on PartNeXt yields substantial
gains over PartNet, underscoring the dataset's superior quality and diversity.
By combining scalable annotation, texture-aware labels, and multi-task
evaluation, PartNeXt opens new avenues for research in structured 3D
understanding.

### [19] [Monocular Visual 8D Pose Estimation for Articulated Bicycles and Cyclists](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20158)
*Eduardo R. Corral-Soto,Yang Liu,Yuan Ren,Bai Dongfeng,Liu Bingbing*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduces 8D pose estimation for articulated bicycles and cyclists from a single RGB image, estimating bicycle pose plus steering/pedal rotations to infer pose and travel direction; trained with synthetic + real data; shows competitive results vs 6D rigid methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate pose and travel direction of vulnerable road users (VRUs) like cyclists are critical for safety in autonomous driving. Articulated bicycles have moving joints (steering, pedals) that cause the 3D bounding box and orientation to change, making standard 6D pose insufficient.

Method: Proposes category-level 8D pose estimation from a single image: jointly estimate 3D translation and rotation of the bicycle body, plus the rotations of its steering handles and pedals relative to the body; also estimates 3D keypoints; trained with a mix of synthetic and real images to generalize to real-world data.

Result: The approach achieves accurate estimation of 8D pose parameters and 3D keypoints; it yields competitive scores when compared to state-of-the-art category-level 6D pose estimators that rely on rigid canonical templates.

Conclusion: 8D pose estimation for articulated bicycles is feasible and provides a more fine-grained pose state and travel direction, enhancing safety-critical perception in autonomous driving and potentially improving obstacle avoidance and planning.

Abstract: In Autonomous Driving, cyclists belong to the safety-critical class of
Vulnerable Road Users (VRU), and accurate estimation of their pose is critical
for cyclist crossing intention classification, behavior prediction, and
collision avoidance. Unlike rigid objects, articulated bicycles are composed of
movable rigid parts linked by joints and constrained by a kinematic structure.
6D pose methods can estimate the 3D rotation and translation of rigid bicycles,
but 6D becomes insufficient when the steering/pedals angles of the bicycle
vary. That is because: 1) varying the articulated pose of the bicycle causes
its 3D bounding box to vary as well, and 2) the 3D box orientation is not
necessarily aligned to the orientation of the steering which determines the
actual intended travel direction. In this work, we introduce a method for
category-level 8D pose estimation for articulated bicycles and cyclists from a
single RGB image. Besides being able to estimate the 3D translation and
rotation of a bicycle from a single image, our method also estimates the
rotations of its steering handles and pedals with respect to the bicycle body
frame. These two new parameters enable the estimation of a more fine-grained
bicycle pose state and travel direction. Our proposed model jointly estimates
the 8D pose and the 3D Keypoints of articulated bicycles, and trains with a mix
of synthetic and real image data to generalize on real images. We include an
evaluation section where we evaluate the accuracy of our estimated 8D pose
parameters, and our method shows promising results by achieving competitive
scores when compared against state-of-the-art category-level 6D pose estimators
that use rigid canonical object templates for matching.

### [20] [TOMCAT: Test-time Comprehensive Knowledge Accumulation for Compositional Zero-Shot Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20162)
*Xudong Yan,Songhe Feng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel compositional zero-shot learning method (TOMCAT) updates multimodal prototypes at test time by leveraging unsupervised textual and visual data, with an adaptive update weight and a dynamic high-confidence image queue, aligning textual and visual representations to achieve state-of-the-art results on four benchmarks in both closed-world and open-world CZSL.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation:  CZSL suffers from distribution shift when unseen attribute-object compositions are encountered at test time. The paper aims to mitigate this by accumulating broad knowledge from unsupervised data in both text and images to refresh prototypes, thereby improving generalization to unseen compositions.

Method: The approach accumulates knowledge from unlabeled textual and visual data to update multimodal prototypes at test time. An adaptive update weight controls how much prototypes are adjusted. A dynamic priority queue stores high-confidence images to leverage historical visual knowledge during inference. Multimodal collaborative representation learning aligns textual and visual prototypes to maintain semantic consistency between modalities.

Result: Extensive experiments show state-of-the-art performance on four benchmark datasets under both closed-world and open-world CZSL settings.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively mitigates distribution shift in CZSL by adaptive, multimodal prototype updates and dynamic memory strategies, achieving strong cross-modal alignment and improved generalization; code will be available at the authors' repository.

Abstract: Compositional Zero-Shot Learning (CZSL) aims to recognize novel
attribute-object compositions based on the knowledge learned from seen ones.
Existing methods suffer from performance degradation caused by the distribution
shift of label space at test time, which stems from the inclusion of unseen
compositions recombined from attributes and objects. To overcome the challenge,
we propose a novel approach that accumulates comprehensive knowledge in both
textual and visual modalities from unsupervised data to update multimodal
prototypes at test time. Building on this, we further design an adaptive update
weight to control the degree of prototype adjustment, enabling the model to
flexibly adapt to distribution shift during testing. Moreover, a dynamic
priority queue is introduced that stores high-confidence images to acquire
visual knowledge from historical images for inference. Considering the semantic
consistency of multimodal knowledge, we align textual and visual prototypes by
multimodal collaborative representation learning. Extensive experiments
indicate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on four
benchmark datasets under both closed-world and open-world settings. Code will

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: IB-GAN introduces an information-bottleneck-based GAN where an intermediate stochastic layer acts as a learnable latent distribution, enabling disentangled representations. It achieves competitive disentanglement with beta-VAE and outperforms InfoGAN, and shows improved sample quality (lower FID) on CelebA and 3D Chairs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To achieve disentangled representations within GANs by leveraging the Information Bottleneck (IB) framework, addressing limited disentanglement and controllability in existing GAN variants like InfoGAN.

Method: Incorporate the IB principle into GAN training by using an intermediate stochastic layer in the generator that constrains mutual information between the input and generated output. This layer serves as a learnable latent distribution trained end-to-end with the generator, enabling disentangled and interpretable latent factors.

Result: Experimental results on dSprites and Color-dSprites show IB-GAN attains disentanglement scores competitive with beta-VAE and better than InfoGAN. On CelebA and 3D Chairs, the generated samples exhibit improved visual quality and diversity, as reflected by favorable FID scores compared to beta-VAE and InfoGAN.

Conclusion: IB-GAN demonstrates that applying the Information Bottleneck to GANs can yield disentangled, interpretable latent representations without sacrificing, and potentially improving, sample quality relative to existing disentanglement-oriented models like InfoGAN and beta-VAE.

Abstract: We propose a new GAN-based unsupervised model for disentangled representation
learning. The new model is discovered in an attempt to utilize the Information
Bottleneck (IB) framework to the optimization of GAN, thereby named IB-GAN. The
architecture of IB-GAN is partially similar to that of InfoGAN but has a
critical difference; an intermediate layer of the generator is leveraged to
constrain the mutual information between the input and the generated output.
The intermediate stochastic layer can serve as a learnable latent distribution
that is trained with the generator jointly in an end-to-end fashion. As a
result, the generator of IB-GAN can harness the latent space in a disentangled
and interpretable manner. With the experiments on dSprites and Color-dSprites
dataset, we demonstrate that IB-GAN achieves competitive disentanglement scores
to those of state-of-the-art \b{eta}-VAEs and outperforms InfoGAN. Moreover,
the visual quality and the diversity of samples generated by IB-GAN are often
better than those by \b{eta}-VAEs and Info-GAN in terms of FID score on CelebA
and 3D Chairs dataset.

*Yun Wang,Junjie Hu,Qiaole Dong,Yongjian Zhang,Yanwei Fu,Tin Lun Lam,Dapeng Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PPMStereo introduces a Pick-and-Play Memory (PPM) module for dynamic stereo matching that maintains a compact, informative memory buffer to model long-range spatio-temporal consistency, enabling temporally consistent depth estimation with efficient computation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Temporally consistent depth estimation from stereo video is essential for AR/VR experiences, but modeling long-range temporal dependencies is computationally expensive. Prior approaches face a trade-off between temporal modeling capacity and efficiency.

Method: A two-stage Pick-and-Play Memory (PPM) module stores a memory buffer for dynamic stereo matching. The 'pick' stage identifies the most relevant frames; the 'play' stage adaptively weights these frames for spatio-temporal aggregation, enabling long-range consistency with low computational overhead.

Result: Extensive experiments show state-of-the-art performance in accuracy and temporal consistency (e.g., on Sintel benchmarks) with reduced computational costs compared to baselines such as BiDAStereo; code is publicly available.

Conclusion: PPMStereo provides an effective, efficient approach to long-range temporal modeling in dynamic stereo matching by using a compact memory buffer and a two-stage pick-and-play strategy, achieving superior temporal consistency and accuracy while reducing computational burden.

Abstract: Temporally consistent depth estimation from stereo video is critical for
real-world applications such as augmented reality, where inconsistent depth
estimation disrupts the immersion of users. Despite its importance, this task
remains challenging due to the difficulty in modeling long-term temporal
consistency in a computationally efficient manner. Previous methods attempt to
address this by aggregating spatio-temporal information but face a fundamental
trade-off: limited temporal modeling provides only modest gains, whereas
capturing long-range dependencies significantly increases computational cost.
To address this limitation, we introduce a memory buffer for modeling
long-range spatio-temporal consistency while achieving efficient dynamic stereo
matching. Inspired by the two-stage decision-making process in humans, we
propose a \textbf{P}ick-and-\textbf{P}lay \textbf{M}emory (PPM) construction
module for dynamic \textbf{Stereo} matching, dubbed as \textbf{PPMStereo}. PPM
consists of a `pick' process that identifies the most relevant frames and a
`play' process that weights the selected frames adaptively for spatio-temporal
aggregation. This two-stage collaborative process maintains a compact yet
highly informative memory buffer while achieving temporally consistent
information aggregation. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of
PPMStereo, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance in both accuracy and
temporal consistency. % Notably, PPMStereo achieves 0.62/1.11 TEPE on the
Sintel clean/final (17.3\% \& 9.02\% improvements over BiDAStereo) with fewer
computational costs. Codes are available at

TL;DR: A protocol to benchmark text-to-video (T2V) and image-to-video (I2V) models as implicit simulators of pedestrian dynamics, using I2V ground-truth frames and a T2V prompt suite, plus a camera-free method to reconstruct 2D trajectories. Finds plausible multi-agent behavior but with failure modes like merging and disappearing pedestrians.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Assess whether large-scale video generation models can serve as general-purpose world simulators for multi-agent scenes, addressing a gap where existing benchmarks focus on single subjects.

Method: For I2V: use start frames from established datasets to enable comparison with ground-truth videos. For T2V: develop a prompt suite to explore diverse pedestrian densities and interactions. Introduce a method to reconstruct 2D bird's-eye-view trajectories from pixel-space without known camera parameters.

Result: Leading models exhibit surprisingly effective priors for plausible multi-agent behavior; however, failure modes such as merging and disappearing people highlight areas for improvement.

Conclusion: The protocol reveals promise of current models as implicit simulators for pedestrian dynamics while identifying specific failure modes and avenues for enhancement in multi-agent consistency and reidentification.

Abstract: Large-scale video generation models have demonstrated high visual realism in
diverse contexts, spurring interest in their potential as general-purpose world
simulators. Existing benchmarks focus on individual subjects rather than scenes
with multiple interacting people. However, the plausibility of multi-agent
dynamics in generated videos remains unverified. We propose a rigorous
evaluation protocol to benchmark text-to-video (T2V) and image-to-video (I2V)
models as implicit simulators of pedestrian dynamics. For I2V, we leverage
start frames from established datasets to enable comparison with a ground truth
video dataset. For T2V, we develop a prompt suite to explore diverse pedestrian
densities and interactions. A key component is a method to reconstruct 2D
bird's-eye view trajectories from pixel-space without known camera parameters.
Our analysis reveals that leading models have learned surprisingly effective
priors for plausible multi-agent behavior. However, failure modes like merging
and disappearing people highlight areas for future improvement.

### [24] [SPAN: Continuous Modeling of Suspicion Progression for Temporal Intention Localization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20189)
*Xinyi Hu,Yuran Wang,Yue Li,Wenxuan Liu,Zheng Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SPAN reframes Temporal Intention Localization as continuous regression to model evolving suspicion, leveraging a Temporal Point Process–like suspicion score, multimodal coefficient modulation, and concept-anchored mapping, achieving superior performance and earlier, more explainable detection on HAI.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Discrete classification cannot capture the gradual evolution and long-term dependencies of suspicious behavior, limiting early intervention and interpretability.

Method: Introduce Suspicion Progression Analysis Network (SPAN) with a continuous suspicion score based on a progression formula inspired by Temporal Point Process; apply Suspicion Coefficient Modulation using multimodal information; use Concept-Anchored Mapping to link actions to predefined intention concepts; evaluate on the HAI dataset.

Result: Outperforms prior methods, reducing MSE by 19.8% and increasing average mAP by 1.78%, with a 2.74% mAP gain in low-frequency cases, demonstrating improved sensitivity to subtle changes and earlier detection.

Conclusion: Continuous modeling of suspicion enables earlier, proactive intervention and enhances explainability, representing a practical and effective advancement in security-oriented video analysis.

Abstract: Temporal Intention Localization (TIL) is crucial for video surveillance,
focusing on identifying varying levels of suspicious intentions to improve
security monitoring. However, existing discrete classification methods fail to
capture the continuous nature of suspicious intentions, limiting early
intervention and explainability. In this paper, we propose the Suspicion
Progression Analysis Network (SPAN), which shifts from discrete classification
to continuous regression, enabling the capture of fluctuating and evolving
suspicious intentions. We reveal that suspicion exhibits long-term dependencies
and cumulative effects, similar to Temporal Point Process (TPP) theory. Based
on these insights, we define a suspicion score formula that models continuous
changes while accounting for temporal characteristics. We also introduce
Suspicion Coefficient Modulation, which adjusts suspicion coefficients using
multimodal information to reflect the varying impacts of suspicious actions.
Additionally, the Concept-Anchored Mapping method is proposed to link
suspicious actions to predefined intention concepts, offering insights into
both the actions and their potential underlying intentions. Extensive
experiments on the HAI dataset show that SPAN significantly outperforms
existing methods, reducing MSE by 19.8% and improving average mAP by 1.78%.
Notably, SPAN achieves a 2.74% mAP gain in low-frequency cases, demonstrating
its superior ability to capture subtle behavioral changes. Compared to discrete
classification systems, our continuous suspicion modeling approach enables
earlier detection and proactive intervention, greatly enhancing system
explainability and practical utility in security applications.

### [25] [A Structured Review and Quantitative Profiling of Public Brain MRI Datasets for Foundation Model Development](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20196)
*Minh Sao Khue Luu,Margaret V. Benedichuk,Ekaterina I. Roppert,Roman M. Kenzhin,Bair N. Tuchinov*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Comprehensive survey of 54 public brain MRI datasets (over 538k images) to quantify data heterogeneity, preprocessing variability, and cross-dataset covariate shift, informing the need for preprocessing-aware and domain-adaptive strategies in foundation-model design.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Foundation models require large, diverse, and consistent data; existing public brain MRI resources show systematic imbalances and variability that could hinder generalization. A structured, multi-level assessment is needed to guide model development.

Method: Analyze 54 public brain MRI datasets (n>538k images) to characterize dataset-level factors (modality, disease coverage, size) and image-level factors (voxel spacing, orientation, intensity). Quantitatively evaluate preprocessing steps (normalization, bias-field correction, skull stripping, registration, interpolation) and assess their impact on voxel statistics and geometry. Conduct a feature-space experiment using a 3D DenseNet121 to measure residual covariate shift after standardized preprocessing.

Result: Found strong imbalance: large healthy cohorts relative to smaller clinical populations; substantial heterogeneity in voxel spacing, orientation, and intensity distributions across datasets. Preprocessing improves within-dataset consistency but leaves residual cross-dataset differences. A 3D DenseNet121 revealed measurable residual covariate shift after standard preprocessing, indicating harmonization alone cannot remove inter-dataset bias.

Conclusion: Preprocessing-aware and domain-adaptive strategies are necessary for creating generalizable brain MRI foundation models. Future work should emphasize harmonization, robust preprocessing pipelines, and domain adaptation to mitigate inter-dataset variability.

Abstract: The development of foundation models for brain MRI depends critically on the
scale, diversity, and consistency of available data, yet systematic assessments
of these factors remain scarce. In this study, we analyze 54 publicly
accessible brain MRI datasets encompassing over 538,031 to provide a
structured, multi-level overview tailored to foundation model development. At
the dataset level, we characterize modality composition, disease coverage, and
dataset scale, revealing strong imbalances between large healthy cohorts and
smaller clinical populations. At the image level, we quantify voxel spacing,
orientation, and intensity distributions across 15 representative datasets,
demonstrating substantial heterogeneity that can influence representation
learning. We then perform a quantitative evaluation of preprocessing
variability, examining how intensity normalization, bias field correction,
skull stripping, spatial registration, and interpolation alter voxel statistics
and geometry. While these steps improve within-dataset consistency, residual
differences persist between datasets. Finally, feature-space case study using a
3D DenseNet121 shows measurable residual covariate shift after standardized
preprocessing, confirming that harmonization alone cannot eliminate
inter-dataset bias. Together, these analyses provide a unified characterization
of variability in public brain MRI resources and emphasize the need for
preprocessing-aware and domain-adaptive strategies in the design of
generalizable brain MRI foundation models.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Prompt design plays a crucial role in text-to-video (T2V) generation, yet
user-provided prompts are often short, unstructured, and misaligned with
training data, limiting the generative potential of diffusion-based T2V models.
We present \textbf{RAPO++}, a cross-stage prompt optimization framework that
unifies training-data--aligned refinement, test-time iterative scaling, and
large language model (LLM) fine-tuning to substantially improve T2V generation
without modifying the underlying generative backbone. In \textbf{Stage 1},
Retrieval-Augmented Prompt Optimization (RAPO) enriches user prompts with
semantically relevant modifiers retrieved from a relation graph and refactors
them to match training distributions, enhancing compositionality and
multi-object fidelity. \textbf{Stage 2} introduces Sample-Specific Prompt
Optimization (SSPO), a closed-loop mechanism that iteratively refines prompts
using multi-source feedback -- including semantic alignment, spatial fidelity,
temporal coherence, and task-specific signals such as optical flow -- yielding
progressively improved video generation quality. \textbf{Stage 3} leverages
optimized prompt pairs from SSPO to fine-tune the rewriter LLM, internalizing
task-specific optimization patterns and enabling efficient, high-quality prompt
generation even before inference. Extensive experiments across five
state-of-the-art T2V models and five benchmarks demonstrate that RAPO++
achieves significant gains in semantic alignment, compositional reasoning,
temporal stability, and physical plausibility, outperforming existing methods
by large margins. Our results highlight RAPO++ as a model-agnostic,
cost-efficient, and scalable solution that sets a new standard for prompt
optimization in T2V generation. The code is available at

TL;DR: EmbodiedBrain introduces a 7B/32B vision-language foundation model for embodied AI, combining an agent-aligned data structure, SFT with Step-GRPO, GRM rewards, and a three-part evaluation framework, achieving state-of-the-art results and open-sourcing all data and models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM/MLLM approaches for embodied tasks suffer from misalignment with agent needs, latency vs. performance trade-offs, and reliance on offline evaluation metrics. A robust, end-to-end embodied agent requires integrated perception, planning, and execution with authentic, scalable evaluation.

Method: EmbodiedBrain architecture in 7B and 32B variants; agent-aligned data structure; training via large-scale Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) plus Step-Augumented Group Relative Policy Optimization (Step-GRPO) to weave preceding steps as Guided Precursors; Generative Reward Model (GRM) at infrastructure level; three-part evaluation (General, Planning, End-to-End Simulation) and a novel, open simulation environment; full open-source release of data, weights, and evaluation methods.

Result: Achieves superior performance across General, Planning, and End-to-End benchmarks, establishing a new state-of-the-art for embodied foundation models.

Conclusion: Paves the path toward generalist embodied agents by releasing data, model weights, and evaluation tools to the community, and providing a robust, scalable framework for embodied AI research.

Abstract: The realization of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) necessitates
Embodied AI agents capable of robust spatial perception, effective task
planning, and adaptive execution in physical environments. However, current
large language models (LLMs) and multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) for embodied tasks
suffer from key limitations, including a significant gap between model design
and agent requirements, an unavoidable trade-off between real-time latency and
performance, and the use of unauthentic, offline evaluation metrics. To address
these challenges, we propose EmbodiedBrain, a novel vision-language foundation
model available in both 7B and 32B parameter sizes. Our framework features an
agent-aligned data structure and employs a powerful training methodology that
integrates large-scale Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) with Step-Augumented Group
Relative Policy Optimization (Step-GRPO), which boosts long-horizon task
success by integrating preceding steps as Guided Precursors. Furthermore, we
incorporate a comprehensive reward system, including a Generative Reward Model
(GRM) accelerated at the infrastructure level, to improve training efficiency.
For enable thorough validation, we establish a three-part evaluation system
encompassing General, Planning, and End-to-End Simulation Benchmarks,
highlighted by the proposal and open-sourcing of a novel, challenging
simulation environment. Experimental results demonstrate that EmbodiedBrain
achieves superior performance across all metrics, establishing a new
state-of-the-art for embodied foundation models. Towards paving the way for the
next generation of generalist embodied agents, we open-source all of our data,

### [29] [FlowCycle: Pursuing Cycle-Consistent Flows for Text-based Editing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20212)
*Yanghao Wang,Zhen Wang,Long Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FlowCycle is an inversion-free, flow-based editing framework that learns a target-aware intermediate state for text-to-image editing by cycle-consistency between source and target, yielding better editability and consistency than existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current corruption-then-restoration methods create target-agnostic intermediate states that reconstruct the source image but ignore the intended edit target, leading to limited edits and inconsistencies when edits differ from the source.

Method: FlowCycle parameterizes the corruption with learnable noises and optimizes them via a cycle-consistent process: iteratively edit from source to target and then recover back to the source with dual consistency constraints, yielding a target-aware intermediate state (inversion-free and flow-based).

Result: Extensive ablations demonstrate FlowCycle achieves superior editing quality and consistency compared with state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: Target-aware intermediate states enable faithful modifications while preserving source consistency, improving text-to-image editing performance over existing approaches.

Abstract: Recent advances in pre-trained text-to-image flow models have enabled
remarkable progress in text-based image editing. Mainstream approaches always
adopt a corruption-then-restoration paradigm, where the source image is first
corrupted into an ``intermediate state'' and then restored to the target image
under the prompt guidance. However, current methods construct this intermediate
state in a target-agnostic manner, i.e., they primarily focus on realizing
source image reconstruction while neglecting the semantic gaps towards the
specific editing target. This design inherently results in limited editability
or inconsistency when the desired modifications substantially deviate from the
source. In this paper, we argue that the intermediate state should be
target-aware, i.e., selectively corrupting editing-relevant contents while
preserving editing-irrelevant ones. To this end, we propose FlowCycle, a novel
inversion-free and flow-based editing framework that parameterizes corruption
with learnable noises and optimizes them through a cycle-consistent process. By
iteratively editing the source to the target and recovering back to the source
with dual consistency constraints, FlowCycle learns to produce a target-aware
intermediate state, enabling faithful modifications while preserving source
consistency. Extensive ablations have demonstrated that FlowCycle achieves
superior editing quality and consistency over state-of-the-art methods.

*Samuel Soutullo,Miguel Yermo,David L. Vilariño,Óscar G. Lorenzo,José C. Cabaleiro,Francisco F. Rivera*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes ALICE-LRI, a sensor-agnostic method for lossless range-image generation from spinning LiDAR point clouds by automatically reverse-engineering intrinsic geometry, enabling perfect point preservation with no data loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional 2D range-image projections introduce geometric inconsistencies and irreversible information loss; many LiDARs lack disclosed calibration data, hindering high-fidelity processing in remote sensing and mapping.

Method: Automatically infer laser configuration, angular distributions, and per-beam calibration corrections to recover the true 3D geometry and enable lossless 2D range-image projection and full point cloud reconstruction, without requiring manufacturer metadata.

Result: Zero points lost across all evaluated KITTI and DurLAR datasets; geometric accuracy within sensor precision; real-time performance; validated downstream with a compression case study showing quality improvements.

Conclusion: A paradigm shift from approximate to lossless LiDAR projections, enabling high-precision remote sensing and broad, sensor-agnostic applicability for complete geometric preservation.

Abstract: 3D LiDAR sensors are essential for autonomous navigation, environmental
monitoring, and precision mapping in remote sensing applications. To
efficiently process the massive point clouds generated by these sensors, LiDAR
data is often projected into 2D range images that organize points by their
angular positions and distances. While these range image representations enable
efficient processing, conventional projection methods suffer from fundamental
geometric inconsistencies that cause irreversible information loss,
compromising high-fidelity applications. We present ALICE-LRI (Automatic LiDAR
Intrinsic Calibration Estimation for Lossless Range Images), the first general,
sensor-agnostic method that achieves lossless range image generation from
spinning LiDAR point clouds without requiring manufacturer metadata or
calibration files. Our algorithm automatically reverse-engineers the intrinsic
geometry of any spinning LiDAR sensor by inferring critical parameters
including laser beam configuration, angular distributions, and per-beam
calibration corrections, enabling lossless projection and complete point cloud
reconstruction with zero point loss. Comprehensive evaluation across the
complete KITTI and DurLAR datasets demonstrates that ALICE-LRI achieves perfect
point preservation, with zero points lost across all point clouds. Geometric
accuracy is maintained well within sensor precision limits, establishing
geometric losslessness with real-time performance. We also present a
compression case study that validates substantial downstream benefits,
demonstrating significant quality improvements in practical applications. This
paradigm shift from approximate to lossless LiDAR projections opens new
possibilities for high-precision remote sensing applications requiring complete
geometric preservation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A self-supervised, dual-contrastive learning framework (CURL) for fetal movement detection from long ultrasound videos, using spatial and temporal contrasts plus task-specific sampling and probabilistic fine-tuning; evaluated on 92 subjects with 30-minute sessions, achieving 78.01% sensitivity and AUROC 81.60%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fetal movement assessment is important but current methods (maternal perception, CTG) are subjective and limited; need objective, robust, scalable FM analysis from continuous ultrasound data.

Method: CURL employs dual-contrastive loss (spatial + temporal) in a self-supervised setting; introduces a task-specific sampling strategy to separate movement/non-movement segments; enables inference on arbitrarily long videos via probabilistic fine-tuning.

Result: On an in-house dataset of 92 subjects with 30-minute sessions, CURL achieves 78.01% sensitivity and AUROC 81.60%, indicating robust motion representations.

Conclusion: Self-supervised contrastive learning can provide reliable, objective fetal movement analysis and support enhanced prenatal monitoring and clinical decision-making; further validation on diverse datasets is warranted.

Abstract: Accurate fetal movement (FM) detection is essential for assessing prenatal
health, as abnormal movement patterns can indicate underlying complications
such as placental dysfunction or fetal distress. Traditional methods, including
maternal perception and cardiotocography (CTG), suffer from subjectivity and
limited accuracy. To address these challenges, we propose Contrastive
Ultrasound Video Representation Learning (CURL), a novel self-supervised
learning framework for FM detection from extended fetal ultrasound video
recordings. Our approach leverages a dual-contrastive loss, incorporating both
spatial and temporal contrastive learning, to learn robust motion
representations. Additionally, we introduce a task-specific sampling strategy,
ensuring the effective separation of movement and non-movement segments during
self-supervised training, while enabling flexible inference on arbitrarily long
ultrasound recordings through a probabilistic fine-tuning approach. Evaluated
on an in-house dataset of 92 subjects, each with 30-minute ultrasound sessions,
CURL achieves a sensitivity of 78.01% and an AUROC of 81.60%, demonstrating its
potential for reliable and objective FM analysis. These results highlight the
potential of self-supervised contrastive learning for fetal movement analysis,
paving the way for improved prenatal monitoring and clinical decision-making.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EditInfinity adapts a binary-quantized generative model (Infinity) for text-driven image editing, enabling precise inversion and editing with minimal tuning, outperforming diffusion-based baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion-based editing suffers from inversion errors due to lack of exact supervision in intermediate steps; leveraging exact intermediate representations in quantized models can enable more faithful inversions and stronger alignment with text prompts.

Method: Propose EditInfinity by adapting Infinity for editing; develop an efficient image inversion mechanism with text prompting rectification and style preservation; introduce a holistic smoothing strategy to ensure fidelity to the source image and semantic alignment with prompts.

Result: Extensive PIE-Bench experiments across add/change/delete show superior performance of EditInfinity compared to state-of-the-art diffusion-based baselines.

Conclusion: Binary-quantized generative models with precise inversion and smoothing strategies can surpass diffusion-based approaches for text-driven image editing while maintaining negligible tuning overhead.

Abstract: Adapting pretrained diffusion-based generative models for text-driven image
editing with negligible tuning overhead has demonstrated remarkable potential.
A classical adaptation paradigm, as followed by these methods, first infers the
generative trajectory inversely for a given source image by image inversion,
then performs image editing along the inferred trajectory guided by the target
text prompts. However, the performance of image editing is heavily limited by
the approximation errors introduced during image inversion by diffusion models,
which arise from the absence of exact supervision in the intermediate
generative steps. To circumvent this issue, we investigate the
parameter-efficient adaptation of VQ-based generative models for image editing,
and leverage their inherent characteristic that the exact intermediate
quantized representations of a source image are attainable, enabling more
effective supervision for precise image inversion. Specifically, we propose
\emph{EditInfinity}, which adapts \emph{Infinity}, a binary-quantized
generative model, for image editing. We propose an efficient yet effective
image inversion mechanism that integrates text prompting rectification and
image style preservation, enabling precise image inversion. Furthermore, we
devise a holistic smoothing strategy which allows our \emph{EditInfinity} to
perform image editing with high fidelity to source images and precise semantic
alignment to the text prompts. Extensive experiments on the PIE-Bench benchmark
across "add", "change", and "delete" editing operations, demonstrate the
superior performance of our model compared to state-of-the-art diffusion-based
baselines. Code available at: https://github.com/yx-chen-ust/EditInfinity.

### [33] [Why LVLMs Are More Prone to Hallucinations in Longer Responses: The Role of Context](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20229)
*Ge Zheng,Jiaye Qian,Jiajin Tang,Sibei Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LVLM hallucinations relate to reliance on context in longer responses rather than length alone; the paper proposes an induce-detect-suppress framework to trigger, detect, and mitigate hallucinations, achieving consistent improvements and validating the context-based hypothesis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Motivate investigation into why LVLMs hallucinate, especially in longer, free-form outputs. Question whether length-induced errors are the sole cause or if there is a deeper mechanism, with a focus on the role of context for coherence and completeness.

Method: Conduct preliminary experiments and develop a novel induce-detect-suppress framework: deliberately induce hallucinations through crafted contexts, use induced instances for early detection of high-risk cases, and suppress potential object-level hallucinations during decoding. Evaluate across multiple benchmarks.

Result: The approach yields consistent, significant improvements in hallucination detection and suppression across benchmarks, supporting the framework and reinforcing the context-based hypothesis.

Conclusion: Provides new insights into hallucinations in LVLMs’ longer responses, emphasizing context over length alone and outlining a step toward deeper exploration of these phenomena.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have made significant progress in recent
years but are also prone to hallucination issues. They exhibit more
hallucinations in longer, free-form responses, often attributed to accumulated
uncertainties. In this paper, we ask: Does increased hallucination result
solely from length-induced errors, or is there a deeper underlying mechanism?
After a series of preliminary experiments and findings, we suggest that the
risk of hallucinations is not caused by length itself but by the increased
reliance on context for coherence and completeness in longer responses.
Building on these insights, we propose a novel "induce-detect-suppress"
framework that actively induces hallucinations through deliberately designed
contexts, leverages induced instances for early detection of high-risk cases,
and ultimately suppresses potential object-level hallucinations during actual
decoding. Our approach achieves consistent, significant improvements across all
benchmarks, demonstrating its efficacy. The strong detection and improved
hallucination mitigation not only validate our framework but, more importantly,
re-validate our hypothesis on context. Rather than solely pursuing performance
gains, this study aims to provide new insights and serves as a first step
toward a deeper exploration of hallucinations in LVLMs' longer responses.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: COS3D introduces a collaborative prompt-segmentation framework with an instance field and language field, enabling open-vocabulary 3D segmentation with improved performance and broader applicability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Open-vocabulary 3D segmentation struggles due to relying on a single 3D language field or precomputed segmentations; integrating language and segmentation cues throughout the pipeline is beneficial.

Method: Define a collaborative field consisting of an instance field and a language field; learn an instance-to-language feature mapping; two-stage training; during inference use adaptive language-to-instance prompt refinement to align the two fields.

Result: Achieves leading performance on two standard benchmarks; demonstrates potential for image-based 3D segmentation, hierarchical segmentation, and robotics; code released.

Conclusion: A collaborative field approach effectively fuses language and segmentation cues across the pipeline, enabling robust open-vocabulary 3D segmentation and broad applicability.

Abstract: Open-vocabulary 3D segmentation is a fundamental yet challenging task,
requiring a mutual understanding of both segmentation and language. However,
existing Gaussian-splatting-based methods rely either on a single 3D language
field, leading to inferior segmentation, or on pre-computed class-agnostic
segmentations, suffering from error accumulation. To address these limitations,
we present COS3D, a new collaborative prompt-segmentation framework that
contributes to effectively integrating complementary language and segmentation
cues throughout its entire pipeline. We first introduce the new concept of
collaborative field, comprising an instance field and a language field, as the
cornerstone for collaboration. During training, to effectively construct the
collaborative field, our key idea is to capture the intrinsic relationship
between the instance field and language field, through a novel
instance-to-language feature mapping and designing an efficient two-stage
training strategy. During inference, to bridge distinct characteristics of the
two fields, we further design an adaptive language-to-instance prompt
refinement, promoting high-quality prompt-segmentation inference. Extensive
experiments not only demonstrate COS3D's leading performance over existing
methods on two widely-used benchmarks but also show its high potential to
various applications,~\ie, novel image-based 3D segmentation, hierarchical
segmentation, and robotics. The code is publicly available at

*Minseok Kang,Minhyeok Lee,Minjung Kim,Donghyeong Kim,Sangyoun Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DualGround introduces a dual-branch, token-role aware VTG model that disentangles global sentence-level and local phrase-level semantics to improve both Moment Retrieval and Highlight Detection, achieving state-of-the-art on QVHighlights and Charades-STA.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VTG approaches treat text tokens uniformly in cross-modal attention and rely heavily on EOS-driven global semantics, neglecting word-level signals that are essential for fine-grained temporal alignment.

Method: A dual-branch architecture with sentence-level and phrase-level pathways. It routes the EOS token through a sentence-level path and clusters word tokens into phrase-level units. It employs token-role-aware cross-modal interactions to align video features with both sentence-level and phrase-level semantics, enabling a structurally disentangled, joint modeling framework for coarse and localized grounding.

Result: State-of-the-art performance on both Moment Retrieval and Highlight Detection tasks across the QVHighlights and Charades-STA benchmarks.

Conclusion: Disentangled semantic modeling that separates global and local semantics enhances video-language grounding, enabling more expressive and context-aware temporal localization by capturing both coarse and fine-grained semantics.

Abstract: Video Temporal Grounding (VTG) aims to localize temporal segments in long,
untrimmed videos that align with a given natural language query. This task
typically comprises two subtasks: Moment Retrieval (MR) and Highlight Detection
(HD). While recent advances have been progressed by powerful pretrained
vision-language models such as CLIP and InternVideo2, existing approaches
commonly treat all text tokens uniformly during crossmodal attention,
disregarding their distinct semantic roles. To validate the limitations of this
approach, we conduct controlled experiments demonstrating that VTG models
overly rely on [EOS]-driven global semantics while failing to effectively
utilize word-level signals, which limits their ability to achieve fine-grained
temporal alignment. Motivated by this limitation, we propose DualGround, a
dual-branch architecture that explicitly separates global and local semantics
by routing the [EOS] token through a sentence-level path and clustering word
tokens into phrase-level units for localized grounding. Our method introduces
(1) tokenrole- aware cross modal interaction strategies that align video
features with sentence-level and phrase-level semantics in a structurally
disentangled manner, and (2) a joint modeling framework that not only improves
global sentence-level alignment but also enhances finegrained temporal
grounding by leveraging structured phrase-aware context. This design allows the
model to capture both coarse and localized semantics, enabling more expressive
and context-aware video grounding. DualGround achieves state-of-the-art
performance on both Moment Retrieval and Highlight Detection tasks across
QVHighlights and Charades- STA benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of
disentangled semantic modeling in video-language alignment.

*Shuhan Hu,Yiru Li,Yuanyuan Li,Yingying Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EDGeo introduces a mask-based positional encoding (MPE) and a context enhancement module (CEM) to achieve robust cross-view object geo-localization, achieving state-of-the-art results on CVOGL and VIGOR-Building with notable accuracy gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cross-view geo-localization currently relies on 2D keypoint-based coordinates that miss object shape information, making it vulnerable to annotation shifts and limiting cross-view matching, particularly for large-span objects in satellite imagery.

Method: Propose mask-based positional encoding using segmentation masks to capture both coordinates and object silhouettes (MPE). Introduce a context enhancement module with horizontal and vertical strip convolutions to model long-range context for elongated objects. Integrate MPE and CEM into EDGeo, an end-to-end framework.

Result: EDGeo achieves state-of-the-art performance on two public datasets (CVOGL and VIGOR-Building), with a 3.39% improvement in localization accuracy in challenging ground-to-satellite scenarios.

Conclusion: A robust positional encoding paradigm and contextual modeling framework for advancing cross-view geo-localization, enabling more accurate and reliable cross-view matching by incorporating object shapes and long-range context.

Abstract: Cross-view object geo-localization enables high-precision object localization
through cross-view matching, with critical applications in autonomous driving,
urban management, and disaster response. However, existing methods rely on
keypoint-based positional encoding, which captures only 2D coordinates while
neglecting object shape information, resulting in sensitivity to annotation
shifts and limited cross-view matching capability. To address these
limitations, we propose a mask-based positional encoding scheme that leverages
segmentation masks to capture both spatial coordinates and object silhouettes,
thereby upgrading the model from "location-aware" to "object-aware."
Furthermore, to tackle the challenge of large-span objects (e.g., elongated
buildings) in satellite imagery, we design a context enhancement module. This
module employs horizontal and vertical strip convolutional kernels to extract
long-range contextual features, enhancing feature discrimination among
strip-like objects. Integrating MPE and CEM, we present EDGeo, an end-to-end

### [37] [Calibrating Multimodal Consensus for Emotion Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20256)
*Guowei Zhong,Junjie Li,Huaiyu Zhu,Ruohong Huan,Yun Pan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Calibrated Multimodal Consensus (CMC) improves MER by self-supervised unimodal pretraining via pseudo labels and a text-agnostic fusion pathway, achieving state-of-the-art or competitive results across four datasets, especially with semantic inconsistencies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Semantic inconsistencies across modalities and text-dominated MER often hurt accuracy; need robust, modality-aware fusion.

Method: CMC includes Pseudo Label Generation Module (PLGM) for pseudo unimodal labels enabling unimodal pretraining in a self-supervised fashion; a Parameter-free Fusion Module (PFM) to avoid forcing heavy reliance on any single modality; and a Multimodal Consensus Router (MCR) to guide multimodal finetuning towards a reliable consensus, mitigating text dominance.

Result: Experimental results show CMC matches or surpasses state-of-the-art on CH-SIMS, CH-SIMS v2, CMU-MOSI, and CMU-MOSEI, with notable advantages in scenarios with semantic inconsistencies on CH-SIMS/CH-SIMS v2.

Conclusion: CMC effectively mitigates cross-modal semantic conflicts and text bias, delivering strong MER performance, with public code at the provided GitHub link.

Abstract: In recent years, Multimodal Emotion Recognition (MER) has made substantial
progress. Nevertheless, most existing approaches neglect the semantic
inconsistencies that may arise across modalities, such as conflicting emotional
cues between text and visual inputs. Besides, current methods are often
dominated by the text modality due to its strong representational capacity,
which can compromise recognition accuracy. To address these challenges, we
propose a model termed Calibrated Multimodal Consensus (CMC). CMC introduces a
Pseudo Label Generation Module (PLGM) to produce pseudo unimodal labels,
enabling unimodal pretraining in a self-supervised fashion. It then employs a
Parameter-free Fusion Module (PFM) and a Multimodal Consensus Router (MCR) for
multimodal finetuning, thereby mitigating text dominance and guiding the fusion
process toward a more reliable consensus. Experimental results demonstrate that
CMC achieves performance on par with or superior to state-of-the-art methods
across four datasets, CH-SIMS, CH-SIMS v2, CMU-MOSI, and CMU-MOSEI, and
exhibits notable advantages in scenarios with semantic inconsistencies on
CH-SIMS and CH-SIMS v2. The implementation of this work is publicly accessible
at https://github.com/gw-zhong/CMC.

*Guangyu Dai,Dong Chen,Siliang Tang,Yueting Zhuang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GMFVAD introduces grained multi-modal features for video anomaly detection by aligning refined video snippets with caption-based text to reduce redundancy, achieving state-of-the-art results on four datasets; ablations attribute gains to redundancy reduction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address redundancy and suboptimal fusion in prior multi-modal VAD methods by exploiting diversity across modalities with fine-grained representations.

Method: Generate fine-grained multi-modal features from video snippets (summary of main content) and incorporate text features from video captions to enhance highlighted portions; integrate these features for anomaly detection; perform ablation studies to verify redundancy reduction as the key factor.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on four major VAD datasets; ablation experiments confirm that improvements stem from reducing redundant visual information.

Conclusion: Grained, caption-informed multi-modal representations can effectively refine visual features for video anomaly detection and reduce redundancy, leading to superior performance.

Abstract: Video anomaly detection (VAD) is a challenging task that detects anomalous
frames in continuous surveillance videos. Most previous work utilizes the
spatio-temporal correlation of visual features to distinguish whether there are
abnormalities in video snippets. Recently, some works attempt to introduce
multi-modal information, like text feature, to enhance the results of video
anomaly detection. However, these works merely incorporate text features into
video snippets in a coarse manner, overlooking the significant amount of
redundant information that may exist within the video snippets. Therefore, we
propose to leverage the diversity among multi-modal information to further
refine the extracted features, reducing the redundancy in visual features, and
we propose Grained Multi-modal Feature for Video Anomaly Detection (GMFVAD).
Specifically, we generate more grained multi-modal feature based on the video
snippet, which summarizes the main content, and text features based on the
captions of original video will be introduced to further enhance the visual
features of highlighted portions. Experiments show that the proposed GMFVAD
achieves state-of-the-art performance on four mainly datasets. Ablation
experiments also validate that the improvement of GMFVAD is due to the
reduction of redundant information.

*Jiayi Zou,Gengyun Jia,Bing-Kun Bao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduces VCR-OOD datasets to test cross-modal generalization in Visual Commonsense Reasoning and proposes a backdoor debiasing approach using a dictionary of correct answers to mitigate prediction shortcuts, with experimental validation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address pervasive biases and shortcut-based predictions in VCR datasets that arise from co-occurrence statistics in both text and images, which hurt cross-modal generalization.

Method: Analyze causal graphs and prediction shortcuts in VCR, apply backdoor adjustment to remove bias, and create a dictionary-based strategy to eliminate shortcuts; propose VCR-OOD-QA and VCR-OOD-VA subsets to evaluate cross-modal generalization.

Result: Debiasing method shows effectiveness across different datasets, improving robustness by reducing reliance on dataset biases and prediction shortcuts.

Conclusion: Backdoor-based debiasing combined with a dictionary of correct answers and the VCR-OOD benchmarks provides a viable approach to improve debiasing and cross-modal generalization in Visual Commonsense Reasoning.

Abstract: Visual Commonsense Reasoning (VCR) refers to answering questions and
providing explanations based on images. While existing methods achieve high
prediction accuracy, they often overlook bias in datasets and lack debiasing
strategies. In this paper, our analysis reveals co-occurrence and statistical
biases in both textual and visual data. We introduce the VCR-OOD datasets,
comprising VCR-OOD-QA and VCR-OOD-VA subsets, which are designed to evaluate
the generalization capabilities of models across two modalities. Furthermore,
we analyze the causal graphs and prediction shortcuts in VCR and adopt a
backdoor adjustment method to remove bias. Specifically, we create a dictionary
based on the set of correct answers to eliminate prediction shortcuts.
Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our debiasing method across
different datasets.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: KINN leverages physics-guided compression and knowledge integration to achieve parameter-efficient, generalizable, and interpretable CV-SAR recognition across benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To resolve the CV-SAR representation trilemma (generalization, interpretability, efficiency) under data scarcity and domain shift by exploiting the rich physical scattering features.

Method: A lightweight Knowledge-Informed Neural Network with a 'compression-aggregation-compression' pipeline: physics-guided dictionary-based compression embeds priors; a sparse-unfolding network extracts physically-grounded signatures; an aggregation stage enriches representations; a final semantic compression with self-distillation; implemented in CNN (0.7M) and Vision Transformer (0.95M).

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art parameter efficiency with strong generalization in data-scarce and out-of-distribution scenarios and improved interpretability across five SAR benchmarks.

Conclusion: KINN offers a viable solution to the CV-SAR representation trilemma and provides a path toward trustworthy, efficient AI in SAR image analysis.

Abstract: Deep learning models for complex-valued Synthetic Aperture Radar (CV-SAR)
image recognition are fundamentally constrained by a representation trilemma
under data-limited and domain-shift scenarios: the concurrent, yet conflicting,
optimization of generalization, interpretability, and efficiency. Our work is
motivated by the premise that the rich electromagnetic scattering features
inherent in CV-SAR data hold the key to resolving this trilemma, yet they are
insufficiently harnessed by conventional data-driven models. To this end, we
introduce the Knowledge-Informed Neural Network (KINN), a lightweight framework
built upon a novel "compression-aggregation-compression" architecture. The
first stage performs a physics-guided compression, wherein a novel dictionary
processor adaptively embeds physical priors, enabling a compact unfolding
network to efficiently extract sparse, physically-grounded signatures. A
subsequent aggregation module enriches these representations, followed by a
final semantic compression stage that utilizes a compact classification head
with self-distillation to learn maximally task-relevant and discriminative
embeddings. We instantiate KINN in both CNN (0.7M) and Vision Transformer
(0.95M) variants. Extensive evaluations on five SAR benchmarks confirm that
KINN establishes a state-of-the-art in parameter-efficient recognition,
offering exceptional generalization in data-scarce and out-of-distribution
scenarios and tangible interpretability, thereby providing an effective
solution to the representation trilemma and offering a new path for trustworthy
AI in SAR image analysis.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes DMC^3 framework for egocentric video QA leveraging counterfactual contrastive learning to address hand-object interactions and multi-event understanding, achieving state-of-the-art results on EgoTaskQA and QAEGO4D.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: First-person perspective introduces unique challenges: simultaneous events, hand-object interactions, and camera-viewpoint biases, which existing pre-training/fine-tuning approaches may not adequately address.

Method: Introduce Dual-Modal Counterfactual Construction (DMC^3) consisting of: (1) counterfactual sample construction generating positive/negative samples via event description paraphrasing and core interaction mining; (2) feeding these samples with the original into a baseline egocentric video QA model; (3) counterfactual sample-involved contrastive optimization using a contrastive loss to align original and positive samples while separating negatives.

Result: Reported results: 52.51% (normal) and 46.04% (indirect) on EgoTaskQA, and 13.2% on QAEGO4D, reported as state-of-the-art.

Conclusion: The DMC^3 framework effectively leverages counterfactual samples and contrastive learning to address the unique challenges of egocentric video QA, improving performance on standard benchmarks.

Abstract: Egocentric Video Question Answering (Egocentric VideoQA) plays an important
role in egocentric video understanding, which refers to answering questions
based on first-person videos. Although existing methods have made progress
through the paradigm of pre-training and fine-tuning, they ignore the unique
challenges posed by the first-person perspective, such as understanding
multiple events and recognizing hand-object interactions. To deal with these
challenges, we propose a Dual-Modal Counterfactual Contrastive Construction
(DMC$^3$) framework, which contains an egocentric videoqa baseline, a
counterfactual sample construction module and a counterfactual sample-involved
contrastive optimization. Specifically, We first develop a counterfactual
sample construction module to generate positive and negative samples for
textual and visual modalities through event description paraphrasing and core
interaction mining, respectively. Then, We feed these samples together with the
original samples into the baseline. Finally, in the counterfactual
sample-involved contrastive optimization module, we apply contrastive loss to
minimize the distance between the original sample features and the positive
sample features, while maximizing the distance from the negative samples.
Experiments show that our method achieve 52.51\% and 46.04\% on the
\textit{normal} and \textit{indirect} splits of EgoTaskQA, and 13.2\% on
QAEGO4D, both reaching the state-of-the-art performance.

TL;DR: Instruction-as-Reasoning treats GUI instructions as dynamic reasoning pathways to improve grounding via SFT+RL, achieving state-of-the-art results across multiple benchmarks with emergent reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Instruction diversity and quality affect GUI grounding performance. Prior work treats instructions as static proxies for user intent, overlooking diversity and instruction flaws.

Method: Two-stage training: (1) supervised fine-tuning on synthesized, diverse instructions to instill multi-perspective reasoning; (2) reinforcement learning to optimize pathway selection and composition. Evaluation on UI grounding benchmarks using UI-Ins-7B and UI-Ins-32B.

Result: State-of-the-art on five grounding benchmarks. UI-Ins-32B: 87.3% on UI-I2E-Bench, 57.0% on ScreenSpot-Pro, 84.9% on MMBench-GUI L2; AndroidWorld 74.1% success with UI-Ins-7B as executor; emergent reasoning and selective pathway composition; mitigates policy collapse; code released.

Conclusion: Instruction-as-Reasoning can enhance GUI grounding by leveraging diverse instructions and dynamic reasoning pathways, achieving strong performance and agentic potential; future work includes deeper analysis of reasoning pathways and scalability.

Abstract: GUI grounding, which maps natural-language instructions to actionable UI
elements, is a core capability of GUI agents. Prior works largely treats
instructions as a static proxy for user intent, overlooking the impact of
instruction diversity and quality on grounding performance. Through a careful
investigation of existing grounding datasets, we find a 23.3% flaw rate in
their instructions and show that inference-time exploitation of instruction
diversity yields up to a substantial 76% relative performance improvement. In
this paper, we introduce the Instruction-as-Reasoning paradigm, treating
instructions as dynamic analytical pathways that offer distinct perspectives
and enabling the model to select the most effective pathway during reasoning.
To achieve this, we propose a two-stage training framework: supervised
fine-tuning (SFT) on synthesized, diverse instructions to instill
multi-perspective reasoning, followed by reinforcement learning (RL) to
optimize pathway selection and composition. Our resulting models, UI-Ins-7B and
UI-Ins-32B, achieve state-of-the-art results on five challenging grounding
benchmarks and exhibit emergent reasoning, selectively composing and
synthesizing novel instruction pathways at inference. In particular, UI-Ins-32B
attains the best grounding accuracy, scoring 87.3% on UI-I2E-Bench, 57.0% on
ScreenSpot-Pro, and 84.9% on MMBench-GUI L2. Furthermore, our model
demonstrates strong agentic potential, achieving a 74.1% success rate on
AndroidWorld using UI-Ins-7B as the executor. Our in-depth analysis reveals
additional insights such as how reasoning can be formulated to enhance rather
than hinder grounding performance, and how our method mitigates policy collapse
in the SFT+RL framework. All code and model checkpoints will be publicly
released in https://github.com/alibaba/UI-Ins.

*Zelin Peng,Zhengqin Xu,Qingyang Liu,Xiaokang Yang,Wei Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HyperET introduces a parameter-efficient, hyperbolic-space alignment framework to bridge the granularity gap between vision and language in multi-modal LLMs. By dynamic hyperbolic radius adjustment and Möbius-matrix parametrizations (diagonal, block-diagonal, banded), it enables cross-modal alignment at arbitrary granularity with less than 1% extra parameters, improving pre-training and fine-tuning results across benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs require massive computational resources partly due to vision encoders (e.g., CLIP, SAM) that lack multi-granularity language alignment. Hyperbolic space, with its natural hierarchical structure, offers a principled way to align visual and textual representations across granularity levels, potentially reducing resource demands.

Method: Propose HyperET, a training paradigm that optimizes visual representations to align with textual counterparts at arbitrary granularity via dynamic hyperbolic radius adjustment in hyperbolic space. It uses learnable Möbius-multiplication matrices with three efficient configurations: diagonal scaling, block-diagonal, and banded matrices, enabling flexible and parameter-efficient parametrization. Applicable to both pre-training and fine-tuning of MLLMs.

Result: Experimental results across multiple MLLM benchmarks show consistent performance improvements over existing pre-training and fine-tuning approaches, with less than 1% additional parameters.

Conclusion: HyperET demonstrates that hyperbolic geometry provides a principled and efficient mechanism to bridge granularity gaps between vision and language, enabling more efficient cross-modal alignment and potentially reducing overall computational resources required for MLLMs.

Abstract: Multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have emerged as a transformative
approach for aligning visual and textual understanding. They typically require
extremely high computational resources (e.g., thousands of GPUs) for training
to achieve cross-modal alignment at multi-granularity levels. We argue that a
key source of this inefficiency lies in the vision encoders they widely equip
with, e.g., CLIP and SAM, which lack the alignment with language at
multi-granularity levels. To address this issue, in this paper, we leverage
hyperbolic space, which inherently models hierarchical levels and thus provides
a principled framework for bridging the granularity gap between visual and
textual modalities at an arbitrary granularity level. Concretely, we propose an
efficient training paradigm for MLLMs, dubbed as HyperET, which can optimize
visual representations to align with their textual counterparts at an arbitrary
granularity level through dynamic hyperbolic radius adjustment in hyperbolic
space. HyperET employs learnable matrices with M\"{o}bius multiplication
operations, implemented via three effective configurations: diagonal scaling
matrices, block-diagonal matrices, and banded matrices, providing a flexible
yet efficient parametrization strategy. Comprehensive experiments across
multiple MLLM benchmarks demonstrate that HyperET consistently improves both
existing pre-training and fine-tuning MLLMs clearly with less than 1\%
additional parameters.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AnyPcc proposes a universal point cloud compression framework that combines a Universal Context Model with Instance-Adaptive Fine-Tuning, achieving state-of-the-art generalization and compression across 15 diverse datasets, with code release planned.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generalization remains difficult in DL-based point cloud geometry compression due to weak contextual modeling and poor handling of out-of-distribution data; robust context models and per-instance adaptation are needed.

Method: Introduce a Universal Context Model leveraging priors from spatial and channel-wise grouping to capture robust dependencies, and an Instance-Adaptive Fine-Tuning (IAFT) strategy that fine-tunes a small subset of weights per instance, embedding them into the bitstream where their cost is outweighed by geometry savings.

Result: Extensive experiments on 15 diverse datasets show state-of-the-art compression performance, validating both robust context modeling and IAFT for OOD data.

Conclusion: AnyPcc offers improved generalization and compression efficiency; IAFT effectively handles OOD data, and the work includes a commitment to releasing code and datasets for reproducibility.

Abstract: Generalization remains a critical challenge for deep learning-based point
cloud geometry compression. We argue this stems from two key limitations: the
lack of robust context models and the inefficient handling of
out-of-distribution (OOD) data. To address both, we introduce AnyPcc, a
universal point cloud compression framework. AnyPcc first employs a Universal
Context Model that leverages priors from both spatial and channel-wise grouping
to capture robust contextual dependencies. Second, our novel Instance-Adaptive
Fine-Tuning (IAFT) strategy tackles OOD data by synergizing explicit and
implicit compression paradigms. It fine-tunes a small subset of network weights
for each instance and incorporates them into the bitstream, where the marginal
bit cost of the weights is dwarfed by the resulting savings in geometry
compression. Extensive experiments on a benchmark of 15 diverse datasets
confirm that AnyPcc sets a new state-of-the-art in point cloud compression. Our
code and datasets will be released to encourage reproducible research.

### [49] [AccuQuant: Simulating Multiple Denoising Steps for Quantizing Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20348)
*Seunghoon Lee,Jeongwoo Choi,Byunggwan Son,Jaehyeon Moon,Jeimin Jeon,Bumsub Ham*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A post-training quantization method, AccuQuant, for diffusion models that accounts for accumulated quantization errors across denoising steps, improves accuracy while reducing memory from O(n) to O(1), and shows strong performance on standard benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantization errors in diffusion models accumulate during the sampling process, making naive PTQ approaches ineffective. There is a need for a PTQ method that explicitly accounts for step-by-step error propagation and that is memory-efficient.

Method: AccuQuant minimizes the discrepancy between the outputs of a full-precision diffusion model and its quantized version over a short sequence of denoising steps, effectively simulating multiple steps during quantization. It contrasts with prior work that mimics training by minimizing per-step discrepancies independently. The authors also introduce an efficient implementation and a novel objective that reduces memory complexity from O(n) to O(1) with respect to the number of denoising steps.

Result: Empirical and analytical results show that quantization errors accumulate over denoising steps and that AccuQuant effectively mitigates this accumulation. The method demonstrates improved efficiency (memory) and strong performance across diffusion models and standard benchmarks.

Conclusion: AccuQuant provides a memory-efficient PTQ approach for diffusion models that explicitly accounts for error accumulation across denoising steps, achieving strong empirical results on standard benchmarks and enabling more practical deployment of quantized diffusion models.

Abstract: We present in this paper a novel post-training quantization (PTQ) method,
dubbed AccuQuant, for diffusion models. We show analytically and empirically
that quantization errors for diffusion models are accumulated over denoising
steps in a sampling process. To alleviate the error accumulation problem,
AccuQuant minimizes the discrepancies between outputs of a full-precision
diffusion model and its quantized version within a couple of denoising steps.
That is, it simulates multiple denoising steps of a diffusion sampling process
explicitly for quantization, accounting the accumulated errors over multiple
denoising steps, which is in contrast to previous approaches to imitating a
training process of diffusion models, namely, minimizing the discrepancies
independently for each step. We also present an efficient implementation
technique for AccuQuant, together with a novel objective, which reduces a
memory complexity significantly from $\mathcal{O}(n)$ to $\mathcal{O}(1)$,
where $n$ is the number of denoising steps. We demonstrate the efficacy and
efficiency of AccuQuant across various tasks and diffusion models on standard
benchmarks.

*Yunpeng Bai,Haoxiang Li,Qixing Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PE-Field extends positional encodings into a 3D field for diffusion transformers, showing that spatial coherence in DiTs is largely driven by PEs. This enables 3D geometry modeling and improves novel view synthesis and controllable editing, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the observation that 2D patch tokens in diffusion transformers lose coherence when PEs are perturbed, suggesting that PEs govern spatial structure. Extend this idea to 3D to enable volumetric reasoning and fine-grained control in DiTs for improved 3D-aware generation and editing.

Method: 1) Empirically analyze patch token independence under perturbations to PEs in DiTs. 2) Propose PE-Field, a 3D extension of positional encodings with depth-aware encodings for volumetric reasoning and hierarchical encodings for sub-patch control. 3) Integrate PE-Field into DiTs and evaluate on single-image novel view synthesis and spatial image editing tasks.

Result: PE-Field-augmented DiTs achieve state-of-the-art performance on single-image novel view synthesis and demonstrate controllable spatial image editing, validating the effectiveness of 3D geometric encoding in diffusion transformers.

Conclusion: Extending positional encodings to a structured 3D field enables explicit 3D geometry modeling in diffusion transformers, improving 3D-aware generation and editing while confirming that PEs play a central role in enforcing spatial coherence.

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have emerged as the dominant architecture for
visual generation, powering state-of-the-art image and video models. By
representing images as patch tokens with positional encodings (PEs), DiTs
combine Transformer scalability with spatial and temporal inductive biases. In
this work, we revisit how DiTs organize visual content and discover that patch
tokens exhibit a surprising degree of independence: even when PEs are
perturbed, DiTs still produce globally coherent outputs, indicating that
spatial coherence is primarily governed by PEs. Motivated by this finding, we
introduce the Positional Encoding Field (PE-Field), which extends positional
encodings from the 2D plane to a structured 3D field. PE-Field incorporates
depth-aware encodings for volumetric reasoning and hierarchical encodings for
fine-grained sub-patch control, enabling DiTs to model geometry directly in 3D
space. Our PE-Field-augmented DiT achieves state-of-the-art performance on
single-image novel view synthesis and generalizes to controllable spatial image
editing.

### [51] [Mitigating Cross-modal Representation Bias for Multicultural Image-to-Recipe Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20393)
*Qing Wang,Chong-Wah Ngo,Yu Cao,Ee-Peng Lim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a causal representation learning framework that predicts and injects overlooked culinary elements into image–recipe representations, improving cross-modal retrieval on mono- and multilingual multicultural datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Images capture visuals but miss cooking processes and subtle recipe details; cross-modal representations are biased toward dominant visuals, especially when data mixes cuisines; need to reveal and utilize recipe-specific elements for better retrieval.

Method: Introduce a causal approach that predicts culinary elements unseen in images and explicitly injects these elements into cross-modal learning to reduce bias.

Result: Experiments on Recipe1M and a newly curated multilingual multicultural cuisine dataset show the method uncovers subtle ingredients and cooking actions and achieves strong retrieval performance across monolingual and multilingual settings.

Conclusion: Causal representation learning helps recover latent recipe details, mitigates modality bias, and enhances image-to-recipe retrieval across diverse cuisines.

Abstract: Existing approaches for image-to-recipe retrieval have the implicit
assumption that a food image can fully capture the details textually documented
in its recipe. However, a food image only reflects the visual outcome of a
cooked dish and not the underlying cooking process. Consequently, learning
cross-modal representations to bridge the modality gap between images and
recipes tends to ignore subtle, recipe-specific details that are not visually
apparent but are crucial for recipe retrieval. Specifically, the
representations are biased to capture the dominant visual elements, resulting
in difficulty in ranking similar recipes with subtle differences in use of
ingredients and cooking methods. The bias in representation learning is
expected to be more severe when the training data is mixed of images and
recipes sourced from different cuisines. This paper proposes a novel causal
approach that predicts the culinary elements potentially overlooked in images,
while explicitly injecting these elements into cross-modal representation
learning to mitigate biases. Experiments are conducted on the standard
monolingual Recipe1M dataset and a newly curated multilingual multicultural
cuisine dataset. The results indicate that the proposed causal representation
learning is capable of uncovering subtle ingredients and cooking actions and
achieves impressive retrieval performance on both monolingual and multilingual
multicultural datasets.

*Saif Ur Rehman Khan,Muhammad Nabeel Asim,Sebastian Vollmer,Andreas Dengel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Dynamic fuzzy knowledge distillation for LC classification using ViT teacher and MobileNet student, with fuzzy-weighted KD, dynamic training waits, image fusion, and GA-selected models, achieving ~99% accuracy across LC25000 and IQOTH/NCCD datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Uncertainty and heterogeneity in lung cancer images make static KD and single-domain models brittle. A dynamic, region-aware distillation and image enhancement pipeline may improve robustness and cross-domain generalization.

Method: Train ViT-B32 as instructor and MobileNet as student. Use fuzzy logic to dynamically adjust distillation weight, focusing on high-confidence regions. Dynamic wait adjustment for training. Preprocess images with Gamma correction and Histogram Equalization, fuse pix1/pix2 via wavelet-based fusion (wavedec2, 224x224). Use Genetic Algorithm to select best pre-trained student from 12 candidates. Evaluate on LC25000 and IQOTH/NCCD datasets.

Result: Achieves 99.16% accuracy on LC25000 histopathology and 99.54% on IQOTH/NCCD CT-scan, demonstrating robustness across imaging domains.

Conclusion: Dynamic fuzzy KD with cross-domain image fusion and GA-based model selection improves uncertainty handling and generalization in LC classification, offering a viable path for high-performance medical imaging models.

Abstract: This paper presents the FuzzyDistillViT-MobileNet model, a novel approach for
lung cancer (LC) classification, leveraging dynamic fuzzy logic-driven
knowledge distillation (KD) to address uncertainty and complexity in disease
diagnosis. Unlike traditional models that rely on static KD with fixed weights,
our method dynamically adjusts the distillation weight using fuzzy logic,
enabling the student model to focus on high-confidence regions while reducing
attention to ambiguous areas. This dynamic adjustment improves the model
ability to handle varying uncertainty levels across different regions of LC
images. We employ the Vision Transformer (ViT-B32) as the instructor model,
which effectively transfers knowledge to the student model, MobileNet,
enhancing the student generalization capabilities. The training process is
further optimized using a dynamic wait adjustment mechanism that adapts the
training procedure for improved convergence and performance. To enhance image
quality, we introduce pixel-level image fusion improvement techniques such as
Gamma correction and Histogram Equalization. The processed images (Pix1 and
Pix2) are fused using a wavelet-based fusion method to improve image resolution
and feature preservation. This fusion method uses the wavedec2 function to
standardize images to a 224x224 resolution, decompose them into multi-scale
frequency components, and recursively average coefficients at each level for
better feature representation. To address computational efficiency, Genetic
Algorithm (GA) is used to select the most suitable pre-trained student model
from a pool of 12 candidates, balancing model performance with computational
cost. The model is evaluated on two datasets, including LC25000
histopathological images (99.16% accuracy) and IQOTH/NCCD CT-scan images
(99.54% accuracy), demonstrating robustness across different imaging domains.

### [53] [Conan: Progressive Learning to Reason Like a Detective over Multi-Scale Visual Evidence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20470)
*Kun Ouyang,Yuanxin Liu,Linli Yao,Yishuo Cai,Hao Zhou,Jie Zhou,Fandong Meng,Xu Sun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Conan: an evidence-grounded, multi-step video reasoning framework that identifies contextual/evidence frames, reasons across frames, and decides when to stop or continue, powered by Conan-91K data and AIR RLVR training; achieves +10% accuracy over a strong baseline and generalizes to long videos.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome hallucinations and mislocalization in existing RL-based (text-only chains) and frame-retrieval approaches for multi-step video reasoning, by grounding reasoning in actual frames and providing adaptive, multi-step decision making.

Method: Propose Conan framework: detect contextual and evidence frames, perform cross-frame reasoning about clues, and adaptively conclude or continue. Create Conan-91K with automatically generated reasoning traces (frame identification, evidence reasoning, action decision). Introduce a progressive cold-start strategy and Identification-Reasoning-Action (AIR) RLVR training to jointly train multi-step visual reasoning.

Result: On six multi-step reasoning benchmarks, Conan surpasses the baseline Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct by over 10% in accuracy, achieving state-of-the-art performance. It also generalizes well to long-video understanding tasks, showing scalability and robustness.

Conclusion: Conan provides an effective, scalable solution for evidence-grounded multi-step video reasoning by combining targeted frame identification, cross-frame evidence reasoning, and adaptive action decisions, supported by a large-scale dataset and a specialized AIR RLVR training regime.

Abstract: Video reasoning, which requires multi-step deduction across frames, remains a
major challenge for multimodal large language models (MLLMs). While
reinforcement learning (RL)-based methods enhance reasoning capabilities, they
often rely on text-only chains that yield ungrounded or hallucinated
conclusions. Conversely, frame-retrieval approaches introduce visual grounding
but still struggle with inaccurate evidence localization. To address these
challenges, we present Conan, a framework for evidence-grounded multi-step
video reasoning. Conan identifies contextual and evidence frames, reasons over
cross-frame clues, and adaptively decides when to conclude or explore further.
To achieve this, we (1) construct Conan-91K, a large-scale dataset of
automatically generated reasoning traces that includes frame identification,
evidence reasoning, and action decision, and (2) design a multi-stage
progressive cold-start strategy combined with an
Identification-Reasoning-Action (AIR) RLVR training framework to jointly
enhance multi-step visual reasoning. Extensive experiments on six multi-step
reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that Conan surpasses the baseline
Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct by an average of over 10% in accuracy, achieving
state-of-the-art performance. Furthermore, Conan generalizes effectively to
long-video understanding tasks, validating its strong scalability and
robustness.

### [54] [Reliable and Reproducible Demographic Inference for Fairness in Face Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20482)
*Alexandre Fournier-Montgieux,Hervé Le Borgne,Adrian Popescu,Bertrand Luvison*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A reproducible, modular demographic attribute inference (DAI) pipeline improves fairness auditing in face analysis by using transfer-learning with pretrained encoders and non-linear heads, plus a new stability/robustness metric; it outperforms baselines, especially for ethnicity, and will be publicly released.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fairness auditing depends on DAI reliability. Theoretical reasons show that more reliable DAI yields less biased, lower-variance fairness estimates. There is a need for transparent, reproducible DAI pipelines to support trustworthy auditing across demographics.

Method: Replace end-to-end training with a modular transfer-learning approach: connect pretrained face recognition encoders to nonlinear classification heads. Evaluate a reproducible DAI pipeline across accuracy, fairness, and a new robustness metric defined via intra-identity consistency. Benchmark gender and ethnicity inference on multiple datasets and training setups. Publicly release dataset metadata, code, pretrained models, and evaluation toolkit.

Result: The proposed approach outperforms strong baselines, with notable gains in ethnicity inference. The robustness metric is applicable to any demographic segmentation and supports more reliable, lower-variance fairness estimates.

Conclusion: This work provides a reliable foundation for demographic inference in fairness auditing, emphasizing transparency and reproducibility through publicly released resources and a modular design that improves robustness and fairness evaluations across demographics.

Abstract: Fairness evaluation in face analysis systems (FAS) typically depends on
automatic demographic attribute inference (DAI), which itself relies on
predefined demographic segmentation. However, the validity of fairness auditing
hinges on the reliability of the DAI process. We begin by providing a
theoretical motivation for this dependency, showing that improved DAI
reliability leads to less biased and lower-variance estimates of FAS fairness.
To address this, we propose a fully reproducible DAI pipeline that replaces
conventional end-to-end training with a modular transfer learning approach. Our
design integrates pretrained face recognition encoders with non-linear
classification heads. We audit this pipeline across three dimensions: accuracy,
fairness, and a newly introduced notion of robustness, defined via
intra-identity consistency. The proposed robustness metric is applicable to any
demographic segmentation scheme. We benchmark the pipeline on gender and
ethnicity inference across multiple datasets and training setups. Our results
show that the proposed method outperforms strong baselines, particularly on
ethnicity, which is the more challenging attribute. To promote transparency and
reproducibility, we will publicly release the training dataset metadata, full
codebase, pretrained models, and evaluation toolkit. This work contributes a
reliable foundation for demographic inference in fairness auditing.

### [55] [EchoDistill: Bidirectional Concept Distillation for One-Step Diffusion Personalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20512)
*Yixiong Yang,Tao Wu,Senmao Li,Shiqi Yang,Yaxing Wang,Joost van de Weijer,Kai Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EchoDistill introduces a bidirectional distillation framework for 1-step diffusion personalization (1-SDP), training a teacher (multi-step) and student (one-step) jointly. It distills concepts from teacher to student and echoes back from student to teacher, with a shared text encoder, adversarial and alignment losses, and a bidirectional echoing refinement. It reports superior personalization performance over existing 1-SDP methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Personalizing text-to-image diffusion models to include novel concepts is limited by the capacity of single-step models. A fast, effective personalization framework is needed that preserves image quality while enabling rapid adaptation to new concepts.

Method: End-to-end training of a teacher (multi-step) and a student (one-step) with shared text encoder. A two-way process: (1) distill concept from teacher to student; (2) echo back from student to teacher. The student is trained with adversarial losses to align with real image distribution and with alignment losses to stay consistent with the teacher. A bidirectional echoing refinement leverages the student’s faster generation to provide feedback to the teacher.

Result: Experiments show significant improvements over existing personalization methods in the 1-SDP setting, establishing a new paradigm for rapid and effective personalization in text-to-image diffusion models.

Conclusion: Bidirectional concept distillation via EchoDistill enhances both the student’s ability to personalize novel concepts and the teacher’s generative quality, enabling faster and more effective 1-SDP personalization.

Abstract: Recent advances in accelerating text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have
enabled the synthesis of high-fidelity images even in a single step. However,
personalizing these models to incorporate novel concepts remains a challenge
due to the limited capacity of one-step models to capture new concept
distributions effectively. We propose a bidirectional concept distillation
framework, EchoDistill, to enable one-step diffusion personalization (1-SDP).
Our approach involves an end-to-end training process where a multi-step
diffusion model (teacher) and a one-step diffusion model (student) are trained
simultaneously. The concept is first distilled from the teacher model to the
student, and then echoed back from the student to the teacher. During the
EchoDistill, we share the text encoder between the two models to ensure
consistent semantic understanding. Following this, the student model is
optimized with adversarial losses to align with the real image distribution and
with alignment losses to maintain consistency with the teacher's output.
Furthermore, we introduce the bidirectional echoing refinement strategy,
wherein the student model leverages its faster generation capability to
feedback to the teacher model. This bidirectional concept distillation
mechanism not only enhances the student ability to personalize novel concepts
but also improves the generative quality of the teacher model. Our experiments
demonstrate that this collaborative framework significantly outperforms
existing personalization methods over the 1-SDP setup, establishing a novel
paradigm for rapid and effective personalization in T2I diffusion models.

### [56] [Metis-HOME: Hybrid Optimized Mixture-of-Experts for Multimodal Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20519)
*Xiaohan Lan,Fanfan Liu,Haibo Qiu,Siqi Yang,Delian Ruan,Peng Shi,Lin Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Metis-HOME introduces a hybrid MoE framework with two branches (thinking for multi-step reasoning and non-thinking for fast inference) plus a trainable router, instantiated on Qwen2.5-VL-7B, to improve both complex reasoning and general capabilities in multimodal LLMs, addressing the reasoning-generalization trade-off.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multimodal reasoning models trade off efficiency and breadth: they rely on expensive, multi-step reasoning that hampers speed, and their emphasis on specialized reasoning can degrade broader general understanding. A unified model that sustains strong reasoning while preserving general capabilities is highly desirable.

Method: Structure the base model into two expert MoE branches—thinking (complex, multi-step reasoning) and non-thinking (fast, general inference like VQA/OCR)—with a lightweight router that routes queries to the appropriate expert. Implemented by converting Qwen2.5-VL-7B into an MoE architecture (Metis-HOME).

Result: The approach substantially enhances complex reasoning abilities and, unexpectedly, also improves general capabilities, reversing the degradation observed in previous reasoning-specialized models.

Conclusion: Metis-HOME offers a new paradigm for versatile, powerful Multimodal LLMs by balancing efficient inference with deep reasoning, potentially resolving the longstanding reasoning-vs-generalization dilemma.

Abstract: Inspired by recent advancements in LLM reasoning, the field of multimodal
reasoning has seen remarkable progress, achieving significant performance gains
on intricate tasks such as mathematical problem-solving. Despite this progress,
current multimodal large reasoning models exhibit two key limitations. They
tend to employ computationally expensive reasoning even for simple queries,
leading to inefficiency. Furthermore, this focus on specialized reasoning often
impairs their broader, more general understanding capabilities. In this paper,
we propose Metis-HOME: a Hybrid Optimized Mixture-of-Experts framework designed
to address this trade-off. Metis-HOME enables a ''Hybrid Thinking'' paradigm by
structuring the original dense model into two distinct expert branches: a
thinking branch tailored for complex, multi-step reasoning, and a non-thinking
branch optimized for rapid, direct inference on tasks like general VQA and OCR.
A lightweight, trainable router dynamically allocates queries to the most
suitable expert. We instantiate Metis-HOME by adapting the Qwen2.5-VL-7B into
an MoE architecture. Comprehensive evaluations reveal that our approach not
only substantially enhances complex reasoning abilities but also improves the
model's general capabilities, reversing the degradation trend observed in other
reasoning-specialized models. Our work establishes a new paradigm for building
powerful and versatile MLLMs, effectively resolving the prevalent
reasoning-vs-generalization dilemma.

*Lixiong Qin,Yang Zhang,Mei Wang,Jiani Hu,Weihong Deng,Weiran Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FiFa (Fake-in-Facext) advances Explainable DeepFake Analysis by grounding explanations in fine-grained facial regions through FICT, enabling Artifact-Grounding Explanations (AGE) with segmentation masks and text. It introduces FiFa-Annotator for annotation and FiFa-MLLM for multi-task learning, achieving SOTA on AGE and XDFA datasets and releasing code/data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current XDFA methods rely on coarse annotations and lack fine-grained grounding between textual forgery explanations and visual artifacts. They also cannot handle arbitrary facial-region queries, leading to weaker alignment with Face Visual Context (Facext). There is a need for precise, region-level explanations and unified multimodal models.

Method: Proposes Facial Image Concept Tree (FICT) to partition facial images into fine-grained regional concepts and FiFa-Annotator for reliable data annotation. Defines Artifact-Grounding Explanation (AGE) task that jointly generates textual forgery explanations and segmentation masks of manipulated artifacts. Develops a unified FiFa-MLLM multi-task model with auxiliary supervision to support rich multimodal inputs/outputs and grounding.

Result: FiFa-MLLM outperforms strong baselines on the AGE task and achieves state-of-the-art performance on existing XDFA datasets. The authors also commit to releasing code and data for the community.

Conclusion: The FiFa framework advances explainable deepfake analysis by providing fine-grained, region-aware explanations grounded in facial context and by delivering a unified, multimodal model capable of flexible input/output and explicit artifact grounding, with open-source release to foster reproducibility.

Abstract: The advancement of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has bridged the
gap between vision and language tasks, enabling the implementation of
Explainable DeepFake Analysis (XDFA). However, current methods suffer from a
lack of fine-grained awareness: the description of artifacts in data annotation
is unreliable and coarse-grained, and the models fail to support the output of
connections between textual forgery explanations and the visual evidence of
artifacts, as well as the input of queries for arbitrary facial regions. As a
result, their responses are not sufficiently grounded in Face Visual Context
(Facext). To address this limitation, we propose the Fake-in-Facext (FiFa)
framework, with contributions focusing on data annotation and model
construction. We first define a Facial Image Concept Tree (FICT) to divide
facial images into fine-grained regional concepts, thereby obtaining a more
reliable data annotation pipeline, FiFa-Annotator, for forgery explanation.
Based on this dedicated data annotation, we introduce a novel
Artifact-Grounding Explanation (AGE) task, which generates textual forgery
explanations interleaved with segmentation masks of manipulated artifacts. We
propose a unified multi-task learning architecture, FiFa-MLLM, to
simultaneously support abundant multimodal inputs and outputs for fine-grained
Explainable DeepFake Analysis. With multiple auxiliary supervision tasks,
FiFa-MLLM can outperform strong baselines on the AGE task and achieve SOTA
performance on existing XDFA datasets. The code and data will be made
open-source at https://github.com/lxq1000/Fake-in-Facext.

*Guillermo Carbajal,Andrés Almansa,Pablo Musé*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A deep learning framework jointly recovers a latent sharp image and the underlying camera motion from a single blurry image by modeling projective motion blur with a differentiable module, predicting a 3D rotation trajectory to guide a model-based restoration, reconstructing a sharp sequence, and refining via a reblur loss; achieves state-of-the-art on synthetic and real data, especially for severe or spatially variant blur; code released.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Motion blur from camera shake is hard to undo, especially under large/rotational motion and spatially varying blur. Existing end-to-end deblurring struggles and lacks interpretable motion information. There is a need to jointly estimate motion trajectories and latent sharp content to improve restoration and enable sequence reconstruction.

Method: Introduce PMBM-based differentiable blur module. A neural network predicts a full 3D rotation trajectory that defines the camera motion. A model-based restoration network uses this trajectory in an end-to-end trainable framework to restore the sharp image. After initial recovery, optimize the trajectory with a reblur loss to enforce consistency. The architecture is modular for interpretability and can reconstruct the sharp sequence from the blur. Code provided.

Result: State-of-the-art performance on both synthetic and real datasets, particularly for severe or spatially variant blur where end-to-end deblurring fails. The method yields interpretable motion and sequence reconstruction capabilities.

Conclusion: The proposed trajectory-guided, PMBM-based framework provides interpretable camera motion and improved restoration, including sequence reconstruction, and benefits from post-inference trajectory optimization; it advances robustness to challenging blur and offers open-source resources.

Abstract: Motion blur caused by camera shake, particularly under large or rotational
movements, remains a major challenge in image restoration. We propose a deep
learning framework that jointly estimates the latent sharp image and the
underlying camera motion trajectory from a single blurry image. Our method
leverages the Projective Motion Blur Model (PMBM), implemented efficiently
using a differentiable blur creation module compatible with modern networks. A
neural network predicts a full 3D rotation trajectory, which guides a
model-based restoration network trained end-to-end. This modular architecture
provides interpretability by revealing the camera motion that produced the
blur. Moreover, this trajectory enables the reconstruction of the sequence of
sharp images that generated the observed blurry image. To further refine
results, we optimize the trajectory post-inference via a reblur loss, improving
consistency between the blurry input and the restored output. Extensive
experiments show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on both
synthetic and real datasets, particularly in cases with severe or spatially
variant blur, where end-to-end deblurring networks struggle.

TL;DR: A lightweight, scene-adaptive camera parameter network (ACamera-Net) predicts exposure and white balance from RAW inputs to improve image quality across challenging lighting, suitable for edge devices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Consumer-grade cameras struggle with underexposure, color casts, and tonal inconsistency under complex illumination and variable color temperature; there is a need for a real-time, lightweight solution that adapts to scenes.

Method: Two modules: ACamera-Exposure predicts ISO to counter underexposure and contrast loss; ACamera-Color predicts correlated color temperature and gain factors for improved color consistency. Operates directly on RAW inputs, optimized for real-time edge-device inference, trained on diverse real-world data, integrating without extra enhancement modules.

Result: Extensive experiments show that ACamera-Net consistently enhances image quality and stabilizes perception outputs, outperforming conventional auto modes and lightweight baselines.

Conclusion: ACamera-Net provides real-time, robust camera parameter adjustment across diverse lighting conditions and color temperatures, easily integrable into imaging pipelines without additional image enhancement steps.

Abstract: Consumer-grade camera systems often struggle to maintain stable image quality
under complex illumination conditions such as low light, high dynamic range,
and backlighting, as well as spatial color temperature variation. These issues
lead to underexposure, color casts, and tonal inconsistency, which degrade the
performance of downstream vision tasks. To address this, we propose
ACamera-Net, a lightweight and scene-adaptive camera parameter adjustment
network that directly predicts optimal exposure and white balance from RAW
inputs. The framework consists of two modules: ACamera-Exposure, which
estimates ISO to alleviate underexposure and contrast loss, and ACamera-Color,
which predicts correlated color temperature and gain factors for improved color
consistency. Optimized for real-time inference on edge devices, ACamera-Net can
be seamlessly integrated into imaging pipelines. Trained on diverse real-world
data with annotated references, the model generalizes well across lighting
conditions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ACamera-Net consistently
enhances image quality and stabilizes perception outputs, outperforming
conventional auto modes and lightweight baselines without relying on additional
image enhancement modules.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To design efficient, perceptually-optimized crowd rendering by understanding how different representations and viewing conditions affect perceived quality and performance.

Method: Qualitative and quantitative experiments evaluating visual fidelity and computational cost across four representation types and multiple LoD levels and viewing distances; metrics likely include perceptual quality and runtime performance.

Result: Each representation offers distinct trade-offs between fidelity and efficiency; findings quantify these trade-offs and indicate how to balance them for perceptual quality at target distances, enabling perceptually optimized LoD decisions.

Conclusion: The work provides guidance for selecting representations and LoD settings to achieve perceptual quality goals while maintaining performance in crowd rendering.

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate how users perceive the visual quality of crowd
character representations at different levels of detail (LoD) and viewing
distances. Each representation: geometric meshes, image-based impostors, Neural
Radiance Fields (NeRFs), and 3D Gaussians, exhibits distinct trade-offs between

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Open-o3 Video introduces explicit spatio-temporal evidence for video reasoning with curated STGR datasets and a cold-start RL training strategy, achieving state-of-the-art results and producing grounding traces.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bring evidence-centered reasoning to videos by providing unified spatio-temporal supervision and explicit visual traces, addressing the challenge of joint temporal tracking and spatial localization in dynamic scenes.

Method: Non-agent Open-o3 Video framework that generates reasoning traces with key timestamps, objects, and bounding boxes; introduces STGR-CoT-30k (SFT) and STGR-RL-36k (RL) datasets with temporal and spatial annotations; uses cold-start reinforcement learning with rewards for accuracy, temporal alignment, and spatial precision.

Result: State-of-the-art on the V-STAR benchmark (mAM +14.4%, mLGM +24.2% over Qwen2.5-VL baseline); consistent improvements across VideoMME, WorldSense, VideoMMMU, TVGBench; reasoning traces enable confidence-aware verification and improve answer reliability.

Conclusion: Explicit spatio-temporal grounding in video reasoning can substantially improve accuracy and reliability, providing useful traces for test-time scaling and verification across a broad range of video understanding tasks.

Abstract: Most video reasoning models only generate textual reasoning traces without
indicating when and where key evidence appears. Recent models such as OpenAI-o3
have sparked wide interest in evidence-centered reasoning for images, yet
extending this ability to videos is more challenging, as it requires joint
temporal tracking and spatial localization across dynamic scenes. We introduce
Open-o3 Video, a non-agent framework that integrates explicit spatio-temporal
evidence into video reasoning, and carefully collect training data and design
training strategies to address the aforementioned challenges. The model
highlights key timestamps, objects, and bounding boxes alongside its answers,
allowing reasoning to be grounded in concrete visual observations. To enable
this functionality, we first curate and build two high-quality datasets,
STGR-CoT-30k for SFT and STGR-RL-36k for RL, with carefully constructed
temporal and spatial annotations, since most existing datasets offer either
temporal spans for videos or spatial boxes on images, lacking unified
spatio-temporal supervision and reasoning traces. Then, we adopt a cold-start
reinforcement learning strategy with multiple specially designed rewards that
jointly encourage answer accuracy, temporal alignment, and spatial precision.
On V-STAR benchmark, Open-o3 Video achieves state-of-the-art performance,
raising mAM by 14.4% and mLGM by 24.2% on the Qwen2.5-VL baseline. Consistent
improvements are also observed on a broad range of video understanding
benchmarks, including VideoMME, WorldSense, VideoMMMU, and TVGBench. Beyond
accuracy, the reasoning traces produced by Open-o3 Video also provide valuable
signals for test-time scaling, enabling confidence-aware verification and

### [62] [GenColorBench: A Color Evaluation Benchmark for Text-to-Image Generation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20586)
*Muhammad Atif Butt,Alexandra Gomez-Villa,Tao Wu,Javier Vazquez-Corral,Joost Van De Weijer,Kai Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GenColorBench – the first comprehensive benchmark for text-to-image color generation. It uses ISCC-NBS and CSS3/X11 color systems with 44K prompts spanning 400+ colors to assess perceptual and automated color accuracy, revealing model strengths, weaknesses, and color-convention comprehension; public upon acceptance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Color precision is critical in art, design, and branding, yet current T2I benchmarks neglect fine-grained color control and numerical color prompts. A dedicated benchmark is needed to quantify how well models interpret and reproduce specified colors.

Method: Ground prompts in established color systems (ISCC-NBS, CSS3/X11), include numeric color specifications, assemble ~44K color-focused prompts covering 400+ colors, and evaluate models with perceptual and automated color metrics to assess adherence and human-aligned expectations; analyze which conventions models understand best and identify common failure modes.

Result: Preliminary evaluations show performance variability across color conventions, indicating some colors and systems are better understood by current models; the benchmark exposes failure modes and gaps in color precision not captured by existing benchmarks.

Conclusion: GenColorBench addresses a critical gap in evaluating precise color generation in text-to-image models and is expected to guide targeted improvements; the benchmark will be public upon acceptance.

Abstract: Recent years have seen impressive advances in text-to-image generation, with
image generative or unified models producing high-quality images from text. Yet
these models still struggle with fine-grained color controllability, often
failing to accurately match colors specified in text prompts. While existing
benchmarks evaluate compositional reasoning and prompt adherence, none
systematically assess color precision. Color is fundamental to human visual
perception and communication, critical for applications from art to design
workflows requiring brand consistency. However, current benchmarks either
neglect color or rely on coarse assessments, missing key capabilities such as
interpreting RGB values or aligning with human expectations. To this end, we
propose GenColorBench, the first comprehensive benchmark for text-to-image
color generation, grounded in color systems like ISCC-NBS and CSS3/X11,
including numerical colors which are absent elsewhere. With 44K color-focused
prompts covering 400+ colors, it reveals models' true capabilities via
perceptual and automated assessments. Evaluations of popular text-to-image
models using GenColorBench show performance variations, highlighting which
color conventions models understand best and identifying failure modes. Our
GenColorBench assessments will guide improvements in precise color generation.
The benchmark will be made public upon acceptance.

### [63] [Unsupervised Domain Adaptation via Similarity-based Prototypes for Cross-Modality Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20596)
*Ziyu Ye,Chen Ju,Chaofan Ma,Xiaoyun Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A cross-modality unsupervised domain adaptation framework that learns class-wise prototypes in an embedding space, enforces similarity-based constraints, and uses dictionaries of prototypes across images to enable contrastive learning, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep models fail under domain shift; unsupervised domain adaptation is needed for cross-modality segmentation to bridge the gap between source and unseen target domains without extra annotations.

Method: Learn class-wise prototypes in a learned embedding space; apply similarity constraints to make prototypes representative for their class and separable from others; maintain dictionaries of prototypes extracted from multiple images to prevent class-missing and enable prototype-level contrastive learning.

Result: Experimental results show our method achieves better performance than existing state-of-the-art methods on cross-modality segmentation tasks.

Conclusion: Similarity-based prototype learning with dictionary-powered prototype storage effectively improves cross-modality unsupervised domain adaptation by promoting representative, separable class prototypes and robust contrastive learning.

Abstract: Deep learning models have achieved great success on various vision
challenges, but a well-trained model would face drastic performance degradation
when applied to unseen data. Since the model is sensitive to domain shift,
unsupervised domain adaptation attempts to reduce the domain gap and avoid
costly annotation of unseen domains. This paper proposes a novel framework for
cross-modality segmentation via similarity-based prototypes. In specific, we
learn class-wise prototypes within an embedding space, then introduce a
similarity constraint to make these prototypes representative for each semantic
class while separable from different classes. Moreover, we use dictionaries to
store prototypes extracted from different images, which prevents the
class-missing problem and enables the contrastive learning of prototypes, and
further improves performance. Extensive experiments show that our method
achieves better results than other state-of-the-art methods.

*Mark He Huang,Lin Geng Foo,Christian Theobalt,Ying Sun,De Wen Soh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OnlineSplatter proposes a real-time, pose-free monocular object reconstruction framework that represents the object with a dense field of 3D Gaussian primitives, learned online from RGB frames using a dual-key memory, achieving constant memory/time independent of sequence length while progressively refining from the first frame.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reconstructing moving objects from monocular video without reliable pose or depth cues is highly challenging and currently limits practical applications. There is a need for online, setup-free methods that deliver high-quality 3D object representations with predictable efficiency.

Method: The approach anchors on the first frame and builds a dense Gaussian primitive field for the object. It uses an online feed-forward network with a dual-key memory module (latent appearance-geometry keys plus explicit directional keys) to fuse current frame features with temporally aggregated object states. A spatial-guided memory readout and sparsification enable complete yet compact coverage. Computational cost remains constant with respect to sequence length.

Result: On real-world datasets, OnlineSplatter outperforms pose-free reconstruction baselines, with performance improving as more frames are observed, while memory and runtime stay constant.

Conclusion: The method enables robust, online, pose-free 3D object reconstruction from RGB video, maintaining efficiency and improving with more observations through a dual-key memory and Gaussian primitive representation.

Abstract: Free-moving object reconstruction from monocular video remains challenging,
particularly without reliable pose or depth cues and under arbitrary object
motion. We introduce OnlineSplatter, a novel online feed-forward framework
generating high-quality, object-centric 3D Gaussians directly from RGB frames
without requiring camera pose, depth priors, or bundle optimization. Our
approach anchors reconstruction using the first frame and progressively refines
the object representation through a dense Gaussian primitive field, maintaining
constant computational cost regardless of video sequence length. Our core
contribution is a dual-key memory module combining latent appearance-geometry
keys with explicit directional keys, robustly fusing current frame features
with temporally aggregated object states. This design enables effective
handling of free-moving objects via spatial-guided memory readout and an
efficient sparsification mechanism, ensuring comprehensive yet compact object
coverage. Evaluations on real-world datasets demonstrate that OnlineSplatter
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art pose-free reconstruction baselines,
consistently improving with more observations while maintaining constant memory
and runtime.

### [65] [SeViCES: Unifying Semantic-Visual Evidence Consensus for Long Video Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20622)
*Yuan Sheng,Yanbin Hao,Chenxu Li,Shuo Wang,Xiangnan He*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SeViCES is a training-free, model-agnostic framework that improves long video understanding by consensus-based evidence selection. It combines a temporal-aware semantic frame-selection module (LLM reasoning over captions) with a cluster-guided visual module (MI-aligned embeddings) and an Answer Consensus Refinement to fuse semantic/visual evidence and constrain answers, yielding state-of-the-art accuracy and robustness on long-video benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long videos pose challenges due to computationally expensive Video-LLMs and the need for coherent reasoning over temporally scattered content. Existing frame-selection methods often disregard temporal dependencies or rely on unimodal cues, leading to incomplete and inconsistent answers.

Method: SeViCES comprises two main components. (1) Semantic-Visual Consensus Frame Selection (SVCFS): a temporal-aware semantic branch that uses LLM reasoning over captions and a cluster-guided visual branch that aligns embeddings with semantic scores via mutual information to select informative frames. (2) Answer Consensus Refinement (ACR): fuses semantic- and visual-based predictions and constrains the answer space to resolve inconsistencies. The approach is training-free and model-agnostic.

Result: Extensive experiments on long video understanding benchmarks show that SeViCES consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both accuracy and robustness, demonstrating the value of consensus-driven evidence selection for Video-LLMs.

Conclusion: Consensus-driven evidence selection is crucial for reliable long video understanding with Video-LLMs. SeViCES provides an effective, training-free framework that improves accuracy and robustness by integrating semantic and visual cues and refining answers.

Abstract: Long video understanding remains challenging due to its complex, diverse, and
temporally scattered content. Although video large language models (Video-LLMs)
can process videos lasting tens of minutes, applying them to truly long
sequences is computationally prohibitive and often leads to unfocused or
inconsistent reasoning. A promising solution is to select only the most
informative frames, yet existing approaches typically ignore temporal
dependencies or rely on unimodal evidence, limiting their ability to provide
complete and query-relevant context. We propose a Semantic-Visual Consensus
Evidence Selection (SeViCES) framework for effective and reliable long video
understanding. SeViCES is training-free and model-agnostic, and introduces two
key components. The Semantic-Visual Consensus Frame Selection (SVCFS) module
selects frames through (1) a temporal-aware semantic branch that leverages LLM
reasoning over captions, and (2) a cluster-guided visual branch that aligns
embeddings with semantic scores via mutual information. The Answer Consensus
Refinement (ACR) module further resolves inconsistencies between semantic- and
visual-based predictions by fusing evidence and constraining the answer space.
Extensive experiments on long video understanding benchmarks show that SeViCES
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both accuracy and
robustness, demonstrating the importance of consensus-driven evidence selection
for Video-LLMs.

TL;DR: A systematic review of deep learning in dental image analysis (DIA), synthesizing 260 studies: 49 public datasets and 211 DL-based algorithms; catalogs datasets, models, tasks, metrics; discusses challenges and future directions; GitHub resources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dental imaging faces low contrast, artifacts, projection-angle variability; clinical subjectivity; AI-based DIA can improve accuracy and efficiency; comprehensive synthesis needed to guide research and practice.

Method: Systematic review of 260 studies on DL in DIA; categorizes datasets by acquisition and characteristics; analyzes models by DIA tasks; examines architectures, optimization, training strategies; summarizes training and evaluation metrics; discusses challenges and future directions; supplementary materials and comparison tables publicly available on GitHub.

Result: Provides a structured taxonomy of models and tasks, summarizes dataset characteristics and performance trends, highlights commonly used metrics, and identifies key challenges (data availability, standardization, generalization, artifacts).

Conclusion: The review serves as a valuable reference for researchers; outlines current challenges and potential future directions in DIA DL research; provides public resources to facilitate further work.

Abstract: Efficient analysis and processing of dental images are crucial for dentists
to achieve accurate diagnosis and optimal treatment planning. However, dental
imaging inherently poses several challenges, such as low contrast, metallic
artifacts, and variations in projection angles. Combined with the subjectivity
arising from differences in clinicians' expertise, manual interpretation often
proves time-consuming and prone to inconsistency. Artificial intelligence
(AI)-based automated dental image analysis (DIA) offers a promising solution to
these issues and has become an integral part of computer-aided dental diagnosis
and treatment. Among various AI technologies, deep learning (DL) stands out as
the most widely applied and influential approach due to its superior feature
extraction and representation capabilities. To comprehensively summarize recent
progress in this field, we focus on the two fundamental aspects of DL
research-datasets and models. In this paper, we systematically review 260
studies on DL applications in DIA, including 49 papers on publicly available
dental datasets and 211 papers on DL-based algorithms. We first introduce the
basic concepts of dental imaging and summarize the characteristics and
acquisition methods of existing datasets. Then, we present the foundational
techniques of DL and categorize relevant models and algorithms according to
different DIA tasks, analyzing their network architectures, optimization
strategies, training methods, and performance. Furthermore, we summarize
commonly used training and evaluation metrics in the DIA domain. Finally, we
discuss the current challenges of existing research and outline potential
future directions. We hope that this work provides a valuable and systematic
reference for researchers in this field. All supplementary materials and
detailed comparison tables will be made publicly available on GitHub.

*Ibrahim Ethem Hamamci,Sezgin Er,Suprosanna Shit,Hadrien Reynaud,Dong Yang,Pengfei Guo,Marc Edgar,Daguang Xu,Bernhard Kainz,Bjoern Menze*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BTB3D introduces compact, frequency-aware 3D tokens via a causal conv encoder-decoder and a three-stage training curriculum to unify 2D/3D training, achieving state-of-the-art in CT report generation and text-to-CT synthesis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address misalignment between vision encoders and clinical language and the loss of anatomical detail from slice-wise tokenization when modeling long, high-resolution 3D CT scans for vision-language tasks.

Method: A causal convolutional encoder-decoder BTB3D that produces volumetric tokens; three-stage training: local reconstruction, overlapping-window tiling, long-context decoder refinement; handles >300 slices with no extra memory overhead; unifies 2D/3D training and inference.

Result: State-of-the-art improvements: report generation with BLEU/clinical F1 up ~40% over baselines (CT2Rep, CT-CHAT, Merlin); text-to-CT synthesis: FID reduced by ~75% and FVD halved vs GenerateCT/MedSyn; anatomically consistent 512x512x241 volumes; generalizes to >300 slices.

Conclusion: Precise 3D tokenization is essential for scalable vision-language modeling in 3D medical imaging; relying on larger language backbones alone is insufficient; release code at GitHub.

Abstract: Recent progress in vision-language modeling for 3D medical imaging has been
fueled by large-scale computed tomography (CT) corpora with paired free-text
reports, stronger architectures, and powerful pretrained models. This has
enabled applications such as automated report generation and text-conditioned
3D image synthesis. Yet, current approaches struggle with high-resolution,
long-sequence volumes: contrastive pretraining often yields vision encoders
that are misaligned with clinical language, and slice-wise tokenization blurs
fine anatomy, reducing diagnostic performance on downstream tasks. We introduce
BTB3D (Better Tokens for Better 3D), a causal convolutional encoder-decoder
that unifies 2D and 3D training and inference while producing compact,
frequency-aware volumetric tokens. A three-stage training curriculum enables
(i) local reconstruction, (ii) overlapping-window tiling, and (iii)
long-context decoder refinement, during which the model learns from short slice
excerpts yet generalizes to scans exceeding 300 slices without additional
memory overhead. BTB3D sets a new state-of-the-art on two key tasks: it
improves BLEU scores and increases clinical F1 by 40% over CT2Rep, CT-CHAT, and
Merlin for report generation; and it reduces FID by 75% and halves FVD compared
to GenerateCT and MedSyn for text-to-CT synthesis, producing anatomically
consistent 512*512*241 volumes. These results confirm that precise
three-dimensional tokenization, rather than larger language backbones alone, is
essential for scalable vision-language modeling in 3D medical imaging. The

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduces UltraHR-100K, a 100k high-quality ultra-high-resolution image-text dataset, and a frequency-aware post-training approach with DOTS and SWFR to improve fine-grained detail in text-to-image diffusion models; experiments show improved detail and fidelity; code released.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address two main gaps in UHR T2I: (1) the lack of a large-scale, high-quality UHR T2I dataset, and (2) the need for training strategies that enhance fine-grained detail synthesis in UHR generation.

Method: Dataset: UltraHR-100K with >3K resolution and rich captions. Post-training methods: (i) DOTS—Detail-Oriented Timestep Sampling to emphasize detail-critical denoising steps; (ii) SWFR—Soft-Weighting Frequency Regularization using Discrete Fourier Transform to softly constrain high-frequency components and preserve details.

Result: Extensive experiments on UltraHR-eval4K benchmarks show significant improvements in fine-grained detail quality and overall image fidelity in UHR T2I generation; code available at the provided GitHub link.

Conclusion: The combination of a high-quality UHR dataset and a frequency-aware post-training strategy effectively enhances fine-grained detail synthesis in UHR text-to-image diffusion models and sets a resource for future research.

Abstract: Ultra-high-resolution (UHR) text-to-image (T2I) generation has seen notable
progress. However, two key challenges remain : 1) the absence of a large-scale
high-quality UHR T2I dataset, and (2) the neglect of tailored training
strategies for fine-grained detail synthesis in UHR scenarios. To tackle the
first challenge, we introduce \textbf{UltraHR-100K}, a high-quality dataset of
100K UHR images with rich captions, offering diverse content and strong visual
fidelity. Each image exceeds 3K resolution and is rigorously curated based on
detail richness, content complexity, and aesthetic quality. To tackle the
second challenge, we propose a frequency-aware post-training method that
enhances fine-detail generation in T2I diffusion models. Specifically, we
design (i) \textit{Detail-Oriented Timestep Sampling (DOTS)} to focus learning
on detail-critical denoising steps, and (ii) \textit{Soft-Weighting Frequency
Regularization (SWFR)}, which leverages Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) to
softly constrain frequency components, encouraging high-frequency detail
preservation. Extensive experiments on our proposed UltraHR-eval4K benchmarks
demonstrate that our approach significantly improves the fine-grained detail
quality and overall fidelity of UHR image generation. The code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HybridSOMSpikeNet is a hybrid deep learning framework that fuses CNN-based feature extraction, differentiable self-organizing maps, and spiking temporal processing to achieve high-accuracy, energy-efficient waste classification (97.39% on a 10-class dataset) with interpretability and eco-friendly benefits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Misclassification of recyclable materials drives landfill growth, increases recycling contamination, and raises emissions; there is a need for accurate, efficient, and deployable waste classification systems.

Method: Uses a ResNet-152 backbone to extract spatial features; Soft-SOM differentiable self-organizing map for topology-preserving clustering; a spiking neural head accumulates temporal activations across discrete time steps; trained on a ten-class waste dataset; aims for lightweight computation.

Result: Achieves 97.39% test accuracy, surpassing several SOTA architectures; maintains a lightweight compute profile suitable for real-world deployment.

Conclusion: Offers tangible environmental benefits by enabling precise automated waste sorting, increasing recycling efficiency, reducing stream contamination, and lowering processing costs; supports SDG 11 (sustainable cities) and SDG 12 (responsible consumption and production).

Abstract: Accurate waste classification is vital for achieving sustainable waste
management and reducing the environmental footprint of urbanization.
Misclassification of recyclable materials contributes to landfill accumulation,
inefficient recycling, and increased greenhouse gas emissions. To address these
issues, this study introduces HybridSOMSpikeNet, a hybrid deep learning
framework that integrates convolutional feature extraction, differentiable
self-organization, and spiking-inspired temporal processing to enable
intelligent and energy-efficient waste classification. The proposed model
employs a pre-trained ResNet-152 backbone to extract deep spatial
representations, followed by a Differentiable Soft Self-Organizing Map
(Soft-SOM) that enhances topological clustering and interpretability. A spiking
neural head accumulates temporal activations over discrete time steps,
improving robustness and generalization. Trained on a ten-class waste dataset,
HybridSOMSpikeNet achieved a test accuracy of 97.39%, outperforming several
state-of-the-art architectures while maintaining a lightweight computational
profile suitable for real-world deployment. Beyond its technical innovations,
the framework provides tangible environmental benefits. By enabling precise and
automated waste segregation, it supports higher recycling efficiency, reduces
contamination in recyclable streams, and minimizes the ecological and
operational costs of waste processing. The approach aligns with global
sustainability priorities, particularly the United Nations Sustainable
Development Goals (SDG 11 and SDG 12), by contributing to cleaner cities,
circular economy initiatives, and intelligent environmental management systems.

### [70] [Efficient Multi-bit Quantization Network Training via Weight Bias Correction and Bit-wise Coreset Sampling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20673)
*Jinhee Kim,Jae Jun An,Kang Eun Jeon,Jong Hwan Ko*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Two techniques reduce training overhead in multi-bit quantization networks: weight bias correction for shared batch norm across bit-widths, and bit-wise coreset sampling for efficient per-bitwidth training; together achieving competitive accuracy with up to 7.88x faster training on CIFAR-10/100, TinyImageNet, and ImageNet-1K with ResNet/ViT.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-bit quantization networks incur training costs that scale linearly with the number of supported bit-widths and often require extra fine-tuning for new precisions, hindering deployment efficiency.

Method: i) Weight bias correction neutralizes quantization-induced bias and aligns activation distributions across bit-widths to enable shared batch normalization and avoid full-dataset fine-tuning; ii) Bit-wise coreset sampling selects a compact, informative subset for each child model using gradient-based importance scores, exploiting implicit knowledge transfer.

Result: Empirical results on CIFAR-10/100, TinyImageNet, and ImageNet-1K with ResNet and ViT show competitive or superior accuracy while reducing training time by up to 7.88x.

Conclusion: The approach substantially lowers training overhead for multi-bit quantization networks without sacrificing accuracy, facilitating efficient multi-precision deployment.

Abstract: Multi-bit quantization networks enable flexible deployment of deep neural
networks by supporting multiple precision levels within a single model.
However, existing approaches suffer from significant training overhead as
full-dataset updates are repeated for each supported bit-width, resulting in a
cost that scales linearly with the number of precisions. Additionally, extra
fine-tuning stages are often required to support additional or intermediate
precision options, further compounding the overall training burden. To address
this issue, we propose two techniques that greatly reduce the training overhead
without compromising model utility: (i) Weight bias correction enables shared
batch normalization and eliminates the need for fine-tuning by neutralizing
quantization-induced bias across bit-widths and aligning activation
distributions; and (ii) Bit-wise coreset sampling strategy allows each child
model to train on a compact, informative subset selected via gradient-based
importance scores by exploiting the implicit knowledge transfer phenomenon.
Experiments on CIFAR-10/100, TinyImageNet, and ImageNet-1K with both ResNet and
ViT architectures demonstrate that our method achieves competitive or superior
accuracy while reducing training time up to 7.88x. Our code is released at

TL;DR: A diagnostic study of state-of-the-art vision-language models reveals persistent failures in multimodal reasoning (e.g., visual hallucinations and reliance on textual priors). It proposes an agent-based architecture that couples LLM reasoning with lightweight visual modules to enable fine-grained analysis and iterative refinement, achieving notable gains on benchmarks and promising broader tool integration, with a community-ready framework and evaluation suite.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address persistent visual hallucinations and textual priors in multimodal large language models by systematically diagnosing failure modes and enabling detailed analysis and iterative improvement of reasoning chains.

Method: Three-stage evaluation framework to assess state-of-the-art vision-language models; introduce an agent-based architecture that integrates LLM-based reasoning with lightweight visual analysis modules to enable fine-grained, iterative refinement of reasoning chains.

Result: Significant performance gains over a 7B baseline (+10.3 MMMU, +6.0 MathVista); performance matching or surpassing larger models; capability for granular analysis and iterative reasoning; framework and evaluation suite to be released for community use.

Conclusion: Future visual reasoning models should integrate a broader set of specialized visual analysis tools; the proposed framework provides a scalable path for diagnosing and improving multimodal reasoning and will be released to facilitate research.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) that integrate visual and textual
reasoning leverage chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting to tackle complex visual
tasks, yet continue to exhibit visual hallucinations and an over-reliance on
textual priors. We present a systematic diagnosis of state-of-the-art
vision-language models using a three-stage evaluation framework, uncovering key
failure modes. To address these, we propose an agent-based architecture that
combines LLM reasoning with lightweight visual modules, enabling fine-grained
analysis and iterative refinement of reasoning chains. Our results highlight
future visual reasoning models should focus on integrating a broader set of
specialized tools for analyzing visual content. Our system achieves significant

surpassing much larger models. We will release our framework and evaluation

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MixKV blends importance and diversity to compress KV caches in LVLMs by exploiting head-wise semantic redundancy, yielding consistent gains under extreme compression and extending to LLMs; code released.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: KV cache growth in large vision-language models creates a memory bottleneck that limits deployment; existing compression methods focus on importance and neglect modality-specific redundancy patterns across attention heads.

Method: Introduce MixKV that adaptively balances diversity and importance for head-wise KV compression, exploiting cross-head redundancy to preserve semantic coverage while reducing storage; applicable to multi-modal KV caches and extendable to LLMs; code released.

Result: Under extreme compression (budget=64), MixKV improves baseline methods by an average of 5.1% across five multi-modal understanding benchmarks; achieves 8.0% and 9.0% gains for SnapKV and AdaKV on GUI grounding tasks; maintains comparable inference efficiency; extends to LLMs with comparable gains.

Conclusion: MixKV effectively captures head-wise redundancy to optimize KV-cache compression in LVLMs and can generalize to LLMs, offering practical memory savings without sacrificing performance.

Abstract: Recent large vision-language models (LVLMs) demonstrate remarkable
capabilities in processing extended multi-modal sequences, yet the resulting
key-value (KV) cache expansion creates a critical memory bottleneck that
fundamentally limits deployment scalability. While existing KV cache
compression methods focus on retaining high-importance KV pairs to minimize
storage, they often overlook the modality-specific semantic redundancy patterns
that emerge distinctively in multi-modal KV caches. In this work, we first
analyze how, beyond simple importance, the KV cache in LVLMs exhibits varying
levels of redundancy across attention heads. We show that relying solely on
importance can only cover a subset of the full KV cache information
distribution, leading to potential loss of semantic coverage. To address this,
we propose \texttt{MixKV}, a novel method that mixes importance with diversity
for optimized KV cache compression in LVLMs. \texttt{MixKV} adapts to head-wise
semantic redundancy, selectively balancing diversity and importance when
compressing KV pairs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that \texttt{MixKV}
consistently enhances existing methods across multiple LVLMs. Under extreme
compression (budget=64), \texttt{MixKV} improves baseline methods by an average
of \textbf{5.1\%} across five multi-modal understanding benchmarks and achieves
remarkable gains of \textbf{8.0\%} and \textbf{9.0\%} for SnapKV and AdaKV on
GUI grounding tasks, all while maintaining comparable inference efficiency.
Furthermore, \texttt{MixKV} extends seamlessly to LLMs with comparable
performance gains. Our code is available at

*Jiacheng Chen,Ziyu Jiang,Mingfu Liang,Bingbing Zhuang,Jong-Chyi Su,Sparsh Garg,Ying Wu,Manmohan Chandraker*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AutoScape is a diffusion-based framework for long-horizon driving scene generation that uses RGB-D keyframes as anchors; it jointly models image and depth in a shared latent space, conditions on existing geometry, uses warp-guided sampling, and interpolates with a video diffusion model to produce 20+ second driving videos, achieving state-of-the-art improvements in long-horizon FID and FVD.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of producing long, coherent, geometrically consistent driving videos, mitigating drift and inconsistency across many frames, and leveraging geometry-aware diffusion.

Method: 1) RGB-D diffusion model generates sparse keyframes with joint image-depth latent space. 2) Condition on previously generated scene geometry via rendered point clouds. 3) Warp-consistent guidance guides sampling for long-range consistency. 4) A video diffusion model interpolates between high-quality RGB-D keyframes to dense frames, producing over 20 seconds of video.

Result: Outperforms previous state-of-the-art on long-horizon metrics, with improvements of 48.6% in long-horizon FID and 43.0% in FVD. Produces realistic, geometrically consistent driving videos of 20+ seconds.

Conclusion: AutoScape demonstrates that combining geometry-conditioned diffusion with warp-guided sampling and keyframe interpolation can achieve long-horizon, coherent driving videos, significantly improving evaluation metrics over prior work.

Abstract: This paper proposes AutoScape, a long-horizon driving scene generation
framework. At its core is a novel RGB-D diffusion model that iteratively
generates sparse, geometrically consistent keyframes, serving as reliable
anchors for the scene's appearance and geometry. To maintain long-range
geometric consistency, the model 1) jointly handles image and depth in a shared
latent space, 2) explicitly conditions on the existing scene geometry (i.e.,
rendered point clouds) from previously generated keyframes, and 3) steers the
sampling process with a warp-consistent guidance. Given high-quality RGB-D
keyframes, a video diffusion model then interpolates between them to produce
dense and coherent video frames. AutoScape generates realistic and
geometrically consistent driving videos of over 20 seconds, improving the
long-horizon FID and FVD scores over the prior state-of-the-art by 48.6\% and
43.0\%, respectively.

TL;DR: A dual-encoder CNN+ViT model with attention-driven feature fusion improves semantic segmentation in histopathology, achieving state-of-the-art results on GCPS and PUMA datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhance semantic tissue segmentation in histopathology by leveraging complementary local (CNN) and global (ViT) representations through attention-based fusion.

Method: Unified dual-encoder architecture that fuses CNN and ViT features via attention mechanisms for semantic segmentation; evaluated on GCPS and PUMA with standard metrics.

benchmarks. The implementation of our method is publicly available in a GitHub

*Noam Issachar,Guy Yariv,Sagie Benaim,Yossi Adi,Dani Lischinski,Raanan Fattal*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A training-free method (Dynamic Position Extrapolation, DyPE) lets pre-trained diffusion transformers synthesize ultra-high-resolution images beyond their training data by dynamically adjusting positional encodings to the diffusion step's spectral progression, achieving state-of-the-art fidelity with no extra sampling cost (e.g., 16M-pixel images with FLUX).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the quadratic scaling of self-attention when generating ultra-high-resolution images with diffusion transformers and enable resolution extrapolation without retraining, by leveraging the diffusion process's spectral progression.

Method: Dynamic Position Extrapolation (DyPE) dynamically adjusts the model's positional encoding at each diffusion step to align with the current frequency spectrum of the generative process, enabling resolution extrapolation without additional training or sampling costs.

Result: Across benchmarks, DyPE yields consistent performance gains and state-of-the-art fidelity in ultra-high-resolution image generation, with larger gains as resolution increases; enables generation of very high-resolution images (e.g., 16M pixels) using FLUX, without extra sampling cost.

Conclusion: DyPE unlocks scalable ultra-high-resolution image generation from pre-trained diffusion transformers without retraining, by spectrally aligning positional encodings to the diffusion process; shows strong empirical gains and potential for further spectral-based methods.

Abstract: Diffusion Transformer models can generate images with remarkable fidelity and
detail, yet training them at ultra-high resolutions remains extremely costly
due to the self-attention mechanism's quadratic scaling with the number of
image tokens. In this paper, we introduce Dynamic Position Extrapolation
(DyPE), a novel, training-free method that enables pre-trained diffusion
transformers to synthesize images at resolutions far beyond their training
data, with no additional sampling cost. DyPE takes advantage of the spectral
progression inherent to the diffusion process, where low-frequency structures
converge early, while high-frequencies take more steps to resolve.
Specifically, DyPE dynamically adjusts the model's positional encoding at each
diffusion step, matching their frequency spectrum with the current stage of the
generative process. This approach allows us to generate images at resolutions
that exceed the training resolution dramatically, e.g., 16 million pixels using
FLUX. On multiple benchmarks, DyPE consistently improves performance and
achieves state-of-the-art fidelity in ultra-high-resolution image generation,
with gains becoming even more pronounced at higher resolutions. Project page is

### [76] [AlphaFlow: Understanding and Improving MeanFlow Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20771)
*Huijie Zhang,Aliaksandr Siarohin,Willi Menapace,Michael Vasilkovsky,Sergey Tulyakov,Qing Qu,Ivan Skorokhodov*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MeanFlow's objective splits into trajectory flow matching and trajectory consistency, which conflict in gradients; alpha-Flow unifies these with curriculum annealing, improving convergence and achieving SOTA FID on ImageNet-1K 256x256 with DiT backbones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand MeanFlow's failure modes and improve training from scratch for high-resolution generative modeling, by addressing optimization conflicts between two objective terms.

Method: Decompose MeanFlow into two terms, analyze gradient correlation; propose alpha-Flow family parameter alpha to interpolate between trajectory flow matching and MeanFlow; implement curriculum annealing from TFM to MeanFlow; train from scratch on class-conditional ImageNet-1K 256x256 using vanilla DiT backbones; evaluate with FID at 1-NFE and 2-NFE.

Result: alpha-Flow consistently outperforms MeanFlow across scales; largest alpha-Flow-XL/2+ achieves FID 2.58 (1-NFE) and 2.15 (2-NFE) on ImageNet-1K 256x256 with vanilla DiT backbones.

Conclusion: Curriculum-based annealing to disentangle conflicting gradient terms yields faster convergence and better generative quality; the alpha-Flow framework unifies trajectory flow matching, Shortcut Model, and MeanFlow under a single formulation, enabling SOTA results with standard architectures.

Abstract: MeanFlow has recently emerged as a powerful framework for few-step generative
modeling trained from scratch, but its success is not yet fully understood. In
this work, we show that the MeanFlow objective naturally decomposes into two
parts: trajectory flow matching and trajectory consistency. Through gradient
analysis, we find that these terms are strongly negatively correlated, causing
optimization conflict and slow convergence. Motivated by these insights, we
introduce $\alpha$-Flow, a broad family of objectives that unifies trajectory
flow matching, Shortcut Model, and MeanFlow under one formulation. By adopting
a curriculum strategy that smoothly anneals from trajectory flow matching to
MeanFlow, $\alpha$-Flow disentangles the conflicting objectives, and achieves
better convergence. When trained from scratch on class-conditional ImageNet-1K
256x256 with vanilla DiT backbones, $\alpha$-Flow consistently outperforms
MeanFlow across scales and settings. Our largest $\alpha$-Flow-XL/2+ model
achieves new state-of-the-art results using vanilla DiT backbones, with FID
scores of 2.58 (1-NFE) and 2.15 (2-NFE).

*Binbin Huang,Haobin Duan,Yiqun Zhao,Zibo Zhao,Yi Ma,Shenghua Gao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Cupid is a generation-based method for single-image 3D reconstruction that jointly infers camera pose, 3D shape, and texture by sampling from a learned distribution in a shared latent space. It uses a two-stage coarse-to-refinement pipeline to produce voxels and pixel-voxel correspondences, achieving state-of-the-art-like gains in PSNR and Chamfer Distance while matching pose accuracy of monocular estimators.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To robustly recover 3D geometry and appearance from a single image by unifying pose estimation and 3D generation within a probabilistic, conditional framework that can jointly model voxels and pixel-voxel correspondences, thereby improving accuracy and visual fidelity.

Method: Formulates 3D reconstruction as conditional sampling from a learned distribution of 3D objects. Simultaneously generates voxels and pixel-voxel correspondences in a shared 3D latent space. Employs a two-stage flow matching pipeline: (1) a coarse stage that yields initial 3D geometry with 2D projections for pose recovery; (2) a refinement stage that incorporates pose-aligned image features to enhance fidelity and texture.

Result: Extensive experiments show Cupid achieves over 3 dB PSNR gain and more than 10% improvement in Chamfer Distance over leading methods, while matching monocular estimators on pose accuracy and delivering superior visual fidelity versus baseline 3D generative models.

Conclusion: Cupid demonstrates that a unified generative framework with joint voxel and pixel-voxel reasoning in a shared latent space enables robust single-image 3D reconstruction of pose, shape, and texture, delivering strong quantitative gains and high-quality renderings; an immersive view is available at the project site.

Abstract: This work proposes a new generation-based 3D reconstruction method, named
Cupid, that accurately infers the camera pose, 3D shape, and texture of an
object from a single 2D image. Cupid casts 3D reconstruction as a conditional
sampling process from a learned distribution of 3D objects, and it jointly
generates voxels and pixel-voxel correspondences, enabling robust pose and
shape estimation under a unified generative framework. By representing both
input camera poses and 3D shape as a distribution in a shared 3D latent space,
Cupid adopts a two-stage flow matching pipeline: (1) a coarse stage that
produces initial 3D geometry with associated 2D projections for pose recovery;
and (2) a refinement stage that integrates pose-aligned image features to
enhance structural fidelity and appearance details. Extensive experiments
demonstrate Cupid outperforms leading 3D reconstruction methods with an over 3
dB PSNR gain and an over 10% Chamfer Distance reduction, while matching
monocular estimators on pose accuracy and delivering superior visual fidelity
over baseline 3D generative models. For an immersive view of the 3D results

*Lei Cheng,Siyang Cao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A radar–camera fusion MOT framework that uses online calibration and shared features to fuse detections, improving 3D positioning and tracking accuracy with real-world validations; code released.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Radar provides accurate range/depth information in 3D space but is often underutilized in MOT; there is a need for online calibration and effective fusion to reduce manual intervention and improve association.

Method: Develop a radar-camera fusion MOT framework; employ online radar–camera calibration to align detections; exploit common features to derive real-world positions; use feature matching and category-consistency checks to improve sensor association beyond simple position matching; validate with real-world experiments in controlled and traffic environments; release code.

Result: Streamlines radar-camera mapping process and improves tracking precision; demonstrated in controlled and traffic scenarios; open-source code available.

Conclusion: First to investigate integration of radar–camera common features and online calibration for MOT; approach reduces manual intervention and enhances fusion accuracy; code provided.

Abstract: This paper presents a Multi-Object Tracking (MOT) framework that fuses radar
and camera data to enhance tracking efficiency while minimizing manual
interventions. Contrary to many studies that underutilize radar and assign it a
supplementary role--despite its capability to provide accurate range/depth
information of targets in a world 3D coordinate system--our approach positions
radar in a crucial role. Meanwhile, this paper utilizes common features to
enable online calibration to autonomously associate detections from radar and
camera. The main contributions of this work include: (1) the development of a
radar-camera fusion MOT framework that exploits online radar-camera calibration
to simplify the integration of detection results from these two sensors, (2)
the utilization of common features between radar and camera data to accurately
derive real-world positions of detected objects, and (3) the adoption of
feature matching and category-consistency checking to surpass the limitations
of mere position matching in enhancing sensor association accuracy. To the best
of our knowledge, we are the first to investigate the integration of
radar-camera common features and their use in online calibration for achieving
MOT. The efficacy of our framework is demonstrated by its ability to streamline
the radar-camera mapping process and improve tracking precision, as evidenced
by real-world experiments conducted in both controlled environments and actual
traffic scenarios. Code is available at

*Xiaolong Wang,Lixiang Ru,Ziyuan Huang,Kaixiang Ji,Dandan Zheng,Jingdong Chen,Jun Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ARGenSeg introduces an autoregressive generation-based segmentation paradigm for MLLMs, producing dense pixel-level masks by detokenizing visual tokens through a VQ-VAE, with a next-scale-prediction strategy for parallel token generation, achieving SOTA performance with faster inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multimodal LLM-based segmentation relies on discrete boundary points or dedicated heads, which hamper fine-grained pixel-level perception and seamless multimodal integration. A generation-based, pixel-dense approach promises unified, detailed segmentation within MLLMs.

Method: Propose ARGenSeg: an image-generation-centric segmentation framework where the MLLM outputs visual tokens that are detokenized into images via a universal VQ-VAE to obtain dense masks. Introduce next-scale-prediction to generate tokens in parallel, reducing latency.

Result: Extensive experiments show ARGenSeg surpasses prior state-of-the-art on multiple segmentation datasets and offers substantial inference speed gains while preserving strong multimodal understanding.

Conclusion: Demonstrates the viability and benefits of an image-generation-based segmentation paradigm within MLLMs, enabling dense pixel-level segmentation in a unified, faster framework and suggesting a promising direction for future MLLM-enabled segmentation research.

Abstract: We propose a novel AutoRegressive Generation-based paradigm for image
Segmentation (ARGenSeg), achieving multimodal understanding and pixel-level
perception within a unified framework. Prior works integrating image
segmentation into multimodal large language models (MLLMs) typically employ
either boundary points representation or dedicated segmentation heads. These
methods rely on discrete representations or semantic prompts fed into
task-specific decoders, which limits the ability of the MLLM to capture
fine-grained visual details. To address these challenges, we introduce a
segmentation framework for MLLM based on image generation, which naturally
produces dense masks for target objects. We leverage MLLM to output visual
tokens and detokenize them into images using an universal VQ-VAE, making the
segmentation fully dependent on the pixel-level understanding of the MLLM. To
reduce inference latency, we employ a next-scale-prediction strategy to
generate required visual tokens in parallel. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our method surpasses prior state-of-the-art approaches on multiple
segmentation datasets with a remarkable boost in inference speed, while
maintaining strong understanding capabilities.

*Dean L Slack,G Thomas Hudson,Thomas Winterbottom,Noura Al Moubayed*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A pure transformer, autoregressive model predicts videos directly in pixel space, using causal spatiotemporal attention to model physical simulations; it outperforms latent-space methods by up to 50% in prediction horizon while keeping video quality, and it enables interpretability studies on PDE parameter estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Investigate whether end-to-end, pixel-space, autoregressive transformers can effectively perform video prediction with causal spatiotemporal reasoning, avoiding latent feature learning and complex training tricks, and to understand interpretability related to physical parameter estimation.

Method: An end-to-end pure transformer for autoregressive video prediction using continuous pixel-space representations. Explores various spatiotemporal self-attention layouts focused on causality. Trains on physical simulation datasets with unsupervised learning and incorporates physical object-tracking metrics to assess spatiotemporal reasoning.

Result: The model extends the prediction horizon for physically accurate predictions by up to 50% compared with existing latent-space approaches, while achieving comparable video-quality metrics. Interpretability experiments identify network regions encoding information for estimating PDE parameters, and this generalizes to out-of-distribution parameters.

Conclusion: A simple, parameter-efficient, and interpretable pixel-space transformer serves as a platform for attention-based spatiotemporal video modeling, demonstrating strong causal reasoning and robustness in physical simulations without latent components.

Abstract: Inspired by the performance and scalability of autoregressive large language
models (LLMs), transformer-based models have seen recent success in the visual
domain. This study investigates a transformer adaptation for video prediction
with a simple end-to-end approach, comparing various spatiotemporal
self-attention layouts. Focusing on causal modeling of physical simulations
over time; a common shortcoming of existing video-generative approaches, we
attempt to isolate spatiotemporal reasoning via physical object tracking
metrics and unsupervised training on physical simulation datasets. We introduce
a simple yet effective pure transformer model for autoregressive video
prediction, utilizing continuous pixel-space representations for video
prediction. Without the need for complex training strategies or latent
feature-learning components, our approach significantly extends the time
horizon for physically accurate predictions by up to 50% when compared with
existing latent-space approaches, while maintaining comparable performance on
common video quality metrics. In addition, we conduct interpretability
experiments to identify network regions that encode information useful to
perform accurate estimations of PDE simulation parameters via probing models,
and find that this generalizes to the estimation of out-of-distribution
simulation parameters. This work serves as a platform for further
attention-based spatiotemporal modeling of videos via a simple, parameter
efficient, and interpretable approach.

*Yuhan Liu,Lianhui Qin,Shengjie Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SV uses training-free speculative decoding with multiple lightweight draft experts and a strong verdict model to propose, filter, and synthesize reasoning paths for dense visual-text tasks, improving accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Vision-Language Models struggle with information-dense images that mix text with fine-grained visuals; precise localization and multi-hop reasoning are computationally expensive, motivating a training-free, multi-expert, verdict-based approach.

Method: In the draft stage, small VLMs act as draft experts to generate diverse reasoning paths with localization candidates. In the verdict stage, a strong VLM synthesizes these paths into the final answer. A consensus expert selection mechanism forwards only high-agreement paths to the verdict, and the framework is training-free.

Result: SV achieves consistent gains on information-intensive and high-resolution VQA benchmarks—InfographicVQA, ChartMuseum, ChartQAPro, HR-Bench 4K—demonstrating error correction and cost-efficiency compared to large proprietary models or training pipelines.

Conclusion: SV demonstrates that aggregating multiple partially accurate reasoning paths via a verdict model can recover correct insights while reducing computational cost, offering a practical, training-free route to improved reasoning in VLMs.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in
multimodal understanding, yet they struggle when reasoning over
information-intensive images that densely interleave textual annotations with
fine-grained graphical elements. The main challenges lie in precisely
localizing critical cues in dense layouts and multi-hop reasoning to integrate
dispersed evidence. We propose Speculative Verdict (SV), a training-free
framework inspired by speculative decoding that combines multiple lightweight
draft experts with a large verdict model. In the draft stage, small VLMs act as
draft experts to generate reasoning paths that provide diverse localization
candidates; in the verdict stage, a strong VLM synthesizes these paths to
produce the final answer, minimizing computational cost while recovering
correct answers. To further improve efficiency and accuracy, SV introduces a
consensus expert selection mechanism that forwards only high-agreement
reasoning paths to the verdict. Empirically, SV achieves consistent gains on
challenging information-intensive and high-resolution visual question answering
benchmarks, including InfographicVQA, ChartMuseum, ChartQAPro, and HR-Bench 4K.
By synthesizing correct insights from multiple partially accurate reasoning
paths, SV achieves both error correction and cost-efficiency compared to large
proprietary models or training pipelines. Code is available at

### [82] [SpectraMorph: Structured Latent Learning for Self-Supervised Hyperspectral Super-Resolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20814)
*Ritik Shah,Marco F Duarte*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SpectraMorph offers a physics-guided, self-supervised fusion framework for hyperspectral super-resolution that enforces a unmixing bottleneck for interpretable, robust fusion even with very limited MSI bands.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hyperspectral images have rich spectral information but low spatial resolution, causing mixed pixels; high-resolution MSI/ RGB provide spatial detail but lack spectral richness. There is a need for interpretable, robust fusion methods that work with few spectral bands and do not rely on opaque regressors.

Method: SpectraMorph uses a structured latent space with an unmixing bottleneck: endmember signatures are derived from the low-res HSI, while a compact MLP predicts abundance-like maps from the MSI. Spectra are reconstructed via linear spectral mixing, trained self-supervised using the MSI sensor's spectral response function.

Result: Experiments on synthetic and real datasets show SpectraMorph consistently outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised/self-supervised baselines and remains very competitive against supervised baselines. It trains in under a minute, produces interpretable intermediates, and is robust even with a single-band MSI (pan).

Conclusion: A principled, interpretable fusion framework that leverages physics-based unmixing and self-supervision achieves strong performance and robustness for HSI-MSI fusion, including extreme cases with very limited MSI bands.

Abstract: Hyperspectral sensors capture dense spectra per pixel but suffer from low
spatial resolution, causing blurred boundaries and mixed-pixel effects.
Co-registered companion sensors such as multispectral, RGB, or panchromatic
cameras provide high-resolution spatial detail, motivating hyperspectral
super-resolution through the fusion of hyperspectral and multispectral images
(HSI-MSI). Existing deep learning based methods achieve strong performance but
rely on opaque regressors that lack interpretability and often fail when the
MSI has very few bands. We propose SpectraMorph, a physics-guided
self-supervised fusion framework with a structured latent space. Instead of
direct regression, SpectraMorph enforces an unmixing bottleneck: endmember
signatures are extracted from the low-resolution HSI, and a compact multilayer
perceptron predicts abundance-like maps from the MSI. Spectra are reconstructed
by linear mixing, with training performed in a self-supervised manner via the
MSI sensor's spectral response function. SpectraMorph produces interpretable
intermediates, trains in under a minute, and remains robust even with a
single-band (pan-chromatic) MSI. Experiments on synthetic and real-world
datasets show SpectraMorph consistently outperforming state-of-the-art
unsupervised/self-supervised baselines while remaining very competitive against
supervised baselines.

*Nimrod Berman,Omkar Joglekar,Eitan Kosman,Dotan Di Castro,Omri Azencot*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LDDBM offers a latent-variable diffusion bridge approach for general modality translation across arbitrary modalities by learning a shared latent space with contrastive alignment and predictive losses, outperforming existing MT methods and establishing a strong new baseline.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current modality translation methods rely on restrictive assumptions (shared dimensionality, Gaussian priors, modality-specific architectures) and lack a unified theoretical framework. There is a need for a general, domain-agnostic approach to cross-modal translation that can handle arbitrary modality pairs.

Method: Propose Latent Denoising Diffusion Bridge Model (LDDBM): a latent-variable extension of denoising diffusion bridge models operating in a shared latent space; a domain-agnostic encoder-decoder architecture for latent-space noise prediction; a contrastive alignment loss to enforce semantic consistency between paired samples; a predictive loss to guide training toward accurate cross-domain translation; multiple training strategies to improve stability; supports arbitrary modality pairs.

Result: Demonstrates strong performance on diverse modality translation tasks including multi-view to 3D shape generation, image super-resolution, and multi-view scene synthesis; comprehensive experiments and ablations validate effectiveness and establish a new strong baseline in general modality translation.

Conclusion: LDDBM provides a general, flexible, and stable framework for modality translation that transcends restrictive priors and dimensional mismatches, enabling broad cross-modal translation and setting a foundation for future work in general modality translation.

Abstract: Recent advances in generative modeling have positioned diffusion models as
state-of-the-art tools for sampling from complex data distributions. While
these models have shown remarkable success across single-modality domains such
as images and audio, extending their capabilities to Modality Translation (MT),
translating information across different sensory modalities, remains an open
challenge. Existing approaches often rely on restrictive assumptions, including
shared dimensionality, Gaussian source priors, and modality-specific
architectures, which limit their generality and theoretical grounding. In this
work, we propose the Latent Denoising Diffusion Bridge Model (LDDBM), a
general-purpose framework for modality translation based on a latent-variable
extension of Denoising Diffusion Bridge Models. By operating in a shared latent
space, our method learns a bridge between arbitrary modalities without
requiring aligned dimensions. We introduce a contrastive alignment loss to
enforce semantic consistency between paired samples and design a
domain-agnostic encoder-decoder architecture tailored for noise prediction in
latent space. Additionally, we propose a predictive loss to guide training
toward accurate cross-domain translation and explore several training
strategies to improve stability. Our approach supports arbitrary modality pairs
and performs strongly on diverse MT tasks, including multi-view to 3D shape
generation, image super-resolution, and multi-view scene synthesis.
Comprehensive experiments and ablations validate the effectiveness of our
framework, establishing a new strong baseline in general modality translation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LayerComposer introduces a layered, interactive canvas for multi-subject personalized text-to-image generation, featuring per-subject layers and a locking mechanism to preserve fidelity while allowing other layers to adapt, enabling occlusion-free composition and superior spatial control relative to prior methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current personalized multi-subject T2I models struggle with interactive spatial control, occlusion-free composition, and fidelity across multiple subjects. A layer-based representation and a locking mechanism could provide intuitive, professional-grade control without altering model architectures.

Method: Propose LayerComposer with a layered canvas where each subject occupies a distinct layer, enabling occlusion-free composition. Introduce a locking mechanism that preserves selected layers’ content with high fidelity while letting other layers adapt to context. This mechanism relies on inherent positional embeddings and a novel data sampling strategy, requiring no architectural changes.

Result: Empirical evaluations show LayerComposer achieves superior spatial control and identity preservation compared to state-of-the-art multi-subject personalized image generation methods.

Conclusion: LayerComposer enables precise, interactive control over multi-subject generation through a layer-based representation and a non-invasive locking mechanism, delivering improved composition quality and identity fidelity without modifying underlying architectures.

Abstract: Despite their impressive visual fidelity, existing personalized generative
models lack interactive control over spatial composition and scale poorly to
multiple subjects. To address these limitations, we present LayerComposer, an
interactive framework for personalized, multi-subject text-to-image generation.
Our approach introduces two main contributions: (1) a layered canvas, a novel
representation in which each subject is placed on a distinct layer, enabling
occlusion-free composition; and (2) a locking mechanism that preserves selected
layers with high fidelity while allowing the remaining layers to adapt flexibly
to the surrounding context. Similar to professional image-editing software, the
proposed layered canvas allows users to place, resize, or lock input subjects
through intuitive layer manipulation. Our versatile locking mechanism requires
no architectural changes, relying instead on inherent positional embeddings
combined with a new complementary data sampling strategy. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that LayerComposer achieves superior spatial control and identity
preservation compared to the state-of-the-art methods in multi-subject
personalized image generation.

TL;DR: HoloCine generates end-to-end, coherent multi-shot cinematic scenes with directorial control via Window Cross-Attention and efficient Sparse Inter-Shot Self-Attention, advancing narrative coherence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text-to-video models produce isolated clips and fail to deliver coherent, long-form narratives; there is a need for end-to-end cinematic generation with global consistency across shots.

Method: Window Cross-Attention localizes text prompts to specific shots to control narrative direction; Sparse Inter-Shot Self-Attention is dense within shots but sparse across shots to maintain efficiency for minute-scale generation; holistic scene generation with memory for characters/scenes and emergent cinematic capabilities.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art narrative coherence, exhibits persistent memory for characters and scenes, and demonstrates emergent cinematic techniques; code is released for reproducibility.

Conclusion: Marks a shift from clip synthesis toward automated filmmaking, moving toward end-to-end cinematic creation as a tangible future.

Abstract: State-of-the-art text-to-video models excel at generating isolated clips but
fall short of creating the coherent, multi-shot narratives, which are the
essence of storytelling. We bridge this "narrative gap" with HoloCine, a model
that generates entire scenes holistically to ensure global consistency from the
first shot to the last. Our architecture achieves precise directorial control
through a Window Cross-Attention mechanism that localizes text prompts to
specific shots, while a Sparse Inter-Shot Self-Attention pattern (dense within
shots but sparse between them) ensures the efficiency required for minute-scale
generation. Beyond setting a new state-of-the-art in narrative coherence,
HoloCine develops remarkable emergent abilities: a persistent memory for
characters and scenes, and an intuitive grasp of cinematic techniques. Our work
marks a pivotal shift from clip synthesis towards automated filmmaking, making
end-to-end cinematic creation a tangible future. Our code is available at:

### [86] [Some Attention is All You Need for Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19861)
*Felix Michalak,Steven Abreu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Hybrid SSM-Transformer models show complete functional segregation: retrieval relies entirely on self-attention, with SSM layers unable to compensate. Reducing attention to ~15% of heads preserves retrieval and most task performance, suggesting self-attention is specialized for retrieval rather than integration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To test whether retrieval in hybrid SSM-Transformer architectures can be supported by non-attention modules (SSM) and to probe redundancy/interaction between components, with implications for interpretability and architecture design.

Method: Experiments across RecurrentGemma-2B/9B and Jamba-Mini-1.6. Ablate attention and SSM layers; test prompting effects; sparsify attention to 15% of heads; evaluate retrieval accuracy and MMLU performance; analyze required conditions for retrieval (needle tokens exposure and sufficient context during prefill/generation).

Result: Ablating attention causes 0% retrieval accuracy; SSM layers show no compensatory retrieval capability even with improved prompting. Sparsifying attention to about 15% of heads maintains near-perfect retrieval while preserving 84% of MMLU performance. Findings indicate retrieval depends on self-attention, while SSMs do not adaptively compensate; functional segregation is precise rather than redundant.

Conclusion: The results reveal strict functional specialization in hybrid architectures: models function as modular, specialized components rather than integrated systems. This challenges redundancy assumptions and has immediate implications for architectural optimization and interpretability.

Abstract: We demonstrate complete functional segregation in hybrid SSM-Transformer
architectures: retrieval depends exclusively on self-attention layers. Across
RecurrentGemma-2B/9B and Jamba-Mini-1.6, attention ablation causes catastrophic
retrieval failure (0% accuracy), while SSM layers show no compensatory
mechanisms even with improved prompting. Conversely, sparsifying attention to
just 15% of heads maintains near-perfect retrieval while preserving 84% MMLU
performance, suggesting self-attention specializes primarily for retrieval
tasks. We identify precise mechanistic requirements for retrieval: needle
tokens must be exposed during generation and sufficient context must be
available during prefill or generation. This strict functional specialization
challenges assumptions about redundancy in hybrid architectures and suggests
these models operate as specialized modules rather than integrated systems,
with immediate implications for architecture optimization and interpretability.

*Iman Rahmani,Saman Yazdannik,Morteza Tayefi,Jafar Roshanian*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: NAS-DQN integrates a learned neural architecture search controller into the DRL training loop to adapt architectures online, yielding better final performance, sample efficiency, and stability with negligible overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neural network architecture choices heavily constrain DRL performance and are typically fixed after costly offline searches; online adaptive architecture optimization may unlock better efficiency and performance.

Method: Propose NAS-DQN, which embeds a neural architecture search controller into the DRL training loop to dynamically reconfigure the network based on accumulated performance feedback; evaluate against fixed-architecture baselines and a random search control on a continuous-control task across multiple seeds.

Result: NAS-DQN achieves superior final performance, improved sample efficiency and policy stability, with negligible computational overhead; its learned search strategy outperforms undirected random exploration and poorly chosen fixed designs.

Conclusion: Online architecture adaptation is necessary for optimal sample efficiency in online DRL, suggesting RL agent design can be a dynamic component integrated into learning rather than a static offline choice.

Abstract: The performance of deep reinforcement learning agents is fundamentally
constrained by their neural network architecture, a choice traditionally made
through expensive hyperparameter searches and then fixed throughout training.
This work investigates whether online, adaptive architecture optimization can
escape this constraint and outperform static designs. We introduce NAS-DQN, an
agent that integrates a learned neural architecture search controller directly
into the DRL training loop, enabling dynamic network reconfiguration based on
cumulative performance feedback. We evaluate NAS-DQN against three
fixed-architecture baselines and a random search control on a continuous
control task, conducting experiments over multiple random seeds. Our results
demonstrate that NAS-DQN achieves superior final performance, sample
efficiency, and policy stability while incurring negligible computational
overhead. Critically, the learned search strategy substantially outperforms
both undirected random architecture exploration and poorly-chosen fixed
designs, indicating that intelligent, performance-guided search is the key
mechanism driving success. These findings establish that architecture
adaptation is not merely beneficial but necessary for optimal sample efficiency
in online deep reinforcement learning, and suggest that the design of RL agents
need not be a static offline choice but can instead be seamlessly integrated as
a dynamic component of the learning process itself.

### [88] [From Large to Small: Transferring CUDA Optimization Expertise via Reasoning Graph](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19873)
*Junfeng Gong,Zhiyi Wei,Junying Chen,Cheng Liu,Huawei Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A training-free retrieval-augmented framework named ReGraphT helps small language models (SLMs) match LLMs in CUDA optimization by organizing optimization steps into a reasoning graph and using Monte Carlo Graph Search, plus a CUDA-focused benchmark. It achieves 2.33x speedups and preserves privacy by avoiding cloud APIs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite CUDA's evolution, generating optimized CUDA code remains hard, and LLM-based approaches raise privacy and cost concerns. SLMs are privacy-friendly but lag in complex reasoning. A training-free method that transfers LLM-like reasoning to SLMs could combine privacy with strong performance.

Method: ReGraphT constructs a structured reasoning graph from CUDA optimization trajectories, treats optimizations as state transitions, and applies Monte Carlo Graph Search to explore the graph. It is training-free and uses a retrieval-augmented setup. A CUDA-specific benchmark with tiers by reasoning complexity is introduced. Evaluation uses CUDAEval and ParEval, pairing ReGraphT with DeepSeek-Coder-V2-Lite-Instruct and Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct.

Result: ReGraphT outperforms HPC-specific fine-tuned models and other retrieval-augmented methods, delivering an average 2.33× speedup on CUDAEval and ParEval. When combined with selected SLMs, it enables approaching LLM-level performance without privacy risks or heavy computing overhead.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates that LLM-level reasoning can be effectively transferred to smaller, privacy-friendly models via a training-free, graph-based retrieval-augmented approach, supported by a CUDA-focused benchmark. This points to practical, scalable, privacy-preserving CUDA optimization for broader adoption.

Abstract: Despite significant evolution of CUDA programming and domain-specific
libraries, effectively utilizing GPUs with massively parallel engines remains
difficult. Large language models (LLMs) show strong potential in generating
optimized CUDA code from sequential code. However, using LLMs in practice faces
two major challenges: cloud-based APIs pose risks of code leakage, and local
deployment is often computationally expensive and inefficient. These drawbacks
have spurred interest in small language models (SLMs), which are more
lightweight and privacy-friendly. Encouragingly, recent studies show that SLMs
can achieve performance comparable to LLMs on specific tasks. While SLMs can
match LLMs on domain-specific tasks, their limited reasoning abilities lead to
suboptimal performance in complex CUDA generation according to our experiments.
To bridge this gap, we propose ReGraphT, a training-free, retrieval-augmented
generation framework that transfers LLM-level reasoning to smaller models.
ReGraphT organizes CUDA optimization trajectories into a structured reasoning
graph, modeling the combined CUDA optimizations as state transitions, and
leverages Monte Carlo Graph Search (MCGS) for efficient exploration. We also
present a CUDA-specific benchmark with difficulty tiers defined by reasoning
complexity to evaluate models more comprehensively. Experiments show that
ReGraphT outperforms HPC-specific fine-tuned models and other
retrieval-augmented approaches, achieving an average 2.33X speedup on CUDAEval
and ParEval. When paired with DeepSeek-Coder-V2-Lite-Instruct and
Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct, ReGraphT enables SLMs to approach LLM-level
performance without the associated privacy risks or excessive computing
overhead.

*Mostafa Ameli,Van Anh Le,Sulthana Shams,Alexander Skabardonis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A data-driven Transformer-based approach predicts equilibrium path flows in traffic assignment, achieving orders-of-magnitude speedups over traditional optimization by modeling path-level flows and cross-OD correlations, validated on multiple networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional traffic assignment solving equilibrium via mathematical programs scales poorly with the number of origin-destination (OD) pairs; there is a need for faster, flexible methods that can adapt to changing demand and network structure to support rapid what-if analyses and policy decisions.

Method: Employ a Transformer-based deep neural network to predict equilibrium path flows directly from network and demand inputs, focusing on path-level traffic distribution and inter-OD correlations. Train on synthetic and real networks and evaluate against conventional optimization, with emphasis on multi-class networks.

Result: The approach achieves substantial computational speedups, being orders of magnitude faster than conventional optimization. It improves prediction accuracy by capturing detailed trip and flow information, estimates path-level flows efficiently, and adapts to varying demand and network conditions. Demonstrated across Manhattan-like synthetic network, Sioux Falls, and Eastern Massachusetts networks, enabling rapid what-if analyses for planning and policy.

Conclusion: A Transformer-based data-driven method offers a scalable, flexible alternative to traditional equilibrium traffic assignment, reducing computational costs while handling multi-class networks and enabling rapid planning analyses for traffic management and policy decisions.

Abstract: The traffic assignment problem is essential for traffic flow analysis,
traditionally solved using mathematical programs under the Equilibrium
principle. These methods become computationally prohibitive for large-scale
networks due to non-linear growth in complexity with the number of OD pairs.
This study introduces a novel data-driven approach using deep neural networks,
specifically leveraging the Transformer architecture, to predict equilibrium
path flows directly. By focusing on path-level traffic distribution, the
proposed model captures intricate correlations between OD pairs, offering a
more detailed and flexible analysis compared to traditional link-level
approaches. The Transformer-based model drastically reduces computation time,
while adapting to changes in demand and network structure without the need for
recalculation. Numerical experiments are conducted on the Manhattan-like
synthetic network, the Sioux Falls network, and the Eastern-Massachusetts
network. The results demonstrate that the proposed model is orders of magnitude
faster than conventional optimization. It efficiently estimates path-level
traffic flows in multi-class networks, reducing computational costs and
improving prediction accuracy by capturing detailed trip and flow information.
The model also adapts flexibly to varying demand and network conditions,
supporting traffic management and enabling rapid `what-if' analyses for
enhanced transportation planning and policy-making.

*Shiqi Dai,Wei Dai,Jiaee Cheong,Paul Pu Liang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A fairness-aware hierarchical RL method (FairGRPO) for equitable clinical learning, using adaptive advantage weighting and unsupervised clustering to discover latent groups, evaluated across diverse medical modalities; reports reduced disparities and higher F1, and releases a fairness-focused clinical VLLM (FairMedGemma-4B).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical AI systems show persistent performance disparities across demographic groups, and RL-based reasoning can inherit or amplify these biases when training data are dominated by majority populations. When demographic labels are missing, latent groups are often unobserved, complicating fairness efforts.

Method: FairGRPO is a hierarchical reinforcement learning framework that applies adaptive importance weighting of advantages based on representation, task difficulty, and data source to promote equitable learning across heterogeneous clinical populations. It uses unsupervised clustering to discover latent demographic groups when labels are unavailable. Evaluations span 7 clinical diagnostic datasets across 5 modalities (X-ray, CT, dermoscopy, mammography, ultrasound). A fairness-aware clinical VLLM, FairMedGemma-4B, is released.

Result: FairGRPO reduces predictive disparity (parity gap) by 27.2% compared with vanilla and bias-mitigated RL baselines and improves F1 score by 12.49%. Training dynamics show fairness steadily improves during optimization for FairGRPO, whereas baseline RL methods exhibit deteriorating fairness. The approach demonstrates broad empirical gains across multiple datasets and modalities.

Conclusion: FairGRPO offers a learning framework that progressively enhances fairness during optimization in medical RL, enabling fairer diagnoses. The accompanying FairMedGemma-4B model demonstrates state-of-the-art performance with reduced demographic disparities.

Abstract: Medical artificial intelligence systems have achieved remarkable diagnostic
capabilities, yet they consistently exhibit performance disparities across
demographic groups, causing real-world harm to underrepresented populations.
While recent multimodal reasoning foundation models have advanced clinical
diagnosis through integrated analysis of diverse medical data, reasoning
trainings via reinforcement learning inherit and often amplify biases present
in training datasets dominated by majority populations. We introduce
Fairness-aware Group Relative Policy Optimization (FairGRPO), a hierarchical
reinforcement learning approach that promotes equitable learning across
heterogeneous clinical populations. FairGRPO employs adaptive importance
weighting of advantages based on representation, task difficulty, and data
source. To address the common issue of missing demographic labels in the
clinical domain, we further employ unsupervised clustering, which automatically
discovers latent demographic groups when labels are unavailable. Through
comprehensive experiments across 7 clinical diagnostic datasets spanning 5
clinical modalities across X-ray, CT scan, dermoscropy, mammography and
ultrasound, we demonstrate that FairGRPO reduces predictive parity by 27.2%
against all vanilla and bias mitigated RL baselines, while improving F1 score
by 12.49%. Furthermore, training dynamics analysis reveals that FairGRPO
progressively improves fairness throughout optimization, while baseline RL
methods exhibit deteriorating fairness as training progresses. Based on
FairGRPO, we release FairMedGemma-4B, a fairness-aware clinical VLLM that
achieves state-of-the-art performance while demonstrating significantly reduced
disparities across demographic groups.

*Filipe Ferreira de Oliveira,Matheus Becali Rocha,Renato A. Krohling*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SHAP-guided feature selection enhances transparent, accurate bladder cancer prediction using XGBoost/LightGBM/CatBoost with SMOTE and Optuna across six binary tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve transparency and reliability of ML-based urinary tract disease diagnosis and address class imbalance, enabling better clinical decision support.

Method: Perform SHAP-based feature selection to identify predictive features; train XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost with Optuna for hyperparameter tuning and SMOTE for balancing; evaluate on six binary classification tasks distinguishing bladder cancer from other conditions; report balanced accuracy, precision, specificity.

Result: SHAP-based feature selection maintains or improves performance while enhancing explainability; the approach yields transparent models suitable for clinical decision support.

Conclusion: SHAP-informed feature selection is effective for clinical ML pipelines, offering transparent, reliable screening for urinary tract diseases and potential for deployment in decision-support systems.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose an approach to support the diagnosis of urinary
tract diseases, with a focus on bladder cancer, using SHAP (SHapley Additive
exPlanations)-based feature selection to enhance the transparency and
effectiveness of predictive models. Six binary classification scenarios were
developed to distinguish bladder cancer from other urological and oncological
conditions. The algorithms XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost were employed, with
hyperparameter optimization performed using Optuna and class balancing with the
SMOTE technique. The selection of predictive variables was guided by importance
values through SHAP-based feature selection while maintaining or even improving
performance metrics such as balanced accuracy, precision, and specificity. The
use of explainability techniques (SHAP) for feature selection proved to be an
effective approach. The proposed methodology may contribute to the development
of more transparent, reliable, and efficient clinical decision support systems,
optimizing screening and early diagnosis of urinary tract diseases.

### [92] [FINDER: Feature Inference on Noisy Datasets using Eigenspace Residuals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19917)
*Trajan Murphy,Akshunna S. Dogra,Hanfeng Gu,Caleb Meredith,Mark Kon,Julio Enrique Castrillion-Candas*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FINDER is a robust, stochastic-feature-based classifier framework for noisy data that uses the Kosambi-Karhunen-Loève decomposition to extract irreducible components for classification, showing state-of-the-art results in Alzheimer's stage classification and deforestation detection; the paper also discusses when it should outperform existing methods, plus potential failure modes and limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Noisy datasets with low signal-to-noise ratios, small sample sizes, or faulty data collection hinder reliable classification. A principled framework that integrates stochastic analysis into feature learning and inference is needed to account for inherent randomness in empirical data and to enable robust decision-making in data-deficient domains.

Method: Treat empirical datasets as realizations of an underlying random field, map them into appropriate Hilbert spaces, and apply the Kosambi-Karhunen-Loève expansion to decompose stochastic features into computable irreducible components. Classification is then performed via an eigen-decomposition in which data from different classes occupy distinct spectral regions.

Result: Validation on challenging, data-deficient domains yields state-of-the-art breakthroughs in (i) Alzheimer's Disease stage classification and (ii) remote sensing detection of deforestation, demonstrating the framework’s practical effectiveness in noisy settings.

Conclusion: FINDER offers a principled route to improved classification in noisy regimes and for data-scarce problems. It is most beneficial under conditions where stochastic structure can be exploited; the paper discusses when it is expected to outperform existing methods, along with identified failure modes and limitations such as modeling assumptions, computational complexity, and scalability.

Abstract: ''Noisy'' datasets (regimes with low signal to noise ratios, small sample
sizes, faulty data collection, etc) remain a key research frontier for
classification methods with both theoretical and practical implications. We
introduce FINDER, a rigorous framework for analyzing generic classification
problems, with tailored algorithms for noisy datasets. FINDER incorporates
fundamental stochastic analysis ideas into the feature learning and inference
stages to optimally account for the randomness inherent to all empirical
datasets. We construct ''stochastic features'' by first viewing empirical
datasets as realizations from an underlying random field (without assumptions
on its exact distribution) and then mapping them to appropriate Hilbert spaces.
The Kosambi-Karhunen-Lo\'eve expansion (KLE) breaks these stochastic features
into computable irreducible components, which allow classification over noisy
datasets via an eigen-decomposition: data from different classes resides in
distinct regions, identified by analyzing the spectrum of the associated
operators. We validate FINDER on several challenging, data-deficient scientific
domains, producing state of the art breakthroughs in: (i) Alzheimer's Disease
stage classification, (ii) Remote sensing detection of deforestation. We end
with a discussion on when FINDER is expected to outperform existing methods,
its failure modes, and other limitations.

### [93] [Beyond the Ideal: Analyzing the Inexact Muon Update](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19933)
*Egor Shulgin,Sultan AlRashed,Francesco Orabona,Peter Richtárik*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: First theoretical treatment of inexact orthogonalized updates in Muon within an LMO-based framework. It derives explicit bounds linking approximation error to performance and shows a coupling: with less precise oracle, you should reduce step size but can tolerate larger momentum. Empirical NanoGPT results confirm the predicted learning-rate shifts with precision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bridging the gap between theory and practice for Muon. Prior work assumes exact SVD-based updates, but practical implementations rely on approximate orthogonalization, creating a disconnect between theory and real performance.

Method: Model the orthogonalization error as an additive inexactness in a Linear Minimization Oracle (LMO) framework. Derive explicit performance bounds as a function of LMO inexactness. Analyze the coupling between inexactness, step size, and momentum; treat the level of approximation (e.g., Newton-Schulz iterations) as a tunable parameter.

Result: Provided explicit bounds that quantify degradation in performance due to LMO inexactness. Identified a fundamental coupling: lower oracle precision necessitates smaller step sizes but allows larger momentum. Experimental NanoGPT results corroborate the theory, showing optimal learning rates shift with approximation precision.

Conclusion: Approximation quality of the orthogonalization procedure is a critical hyperparameter that must be co-tuned with the learning schedule. This work closes the theory-practice gap by showing how inexact updates affect Muon's performance and how to adjust optimization hyperparameters accordingly.

Abstract: The Muon optimizer has rapidly emerged as a powerful, geometry-aware
alternative to AdamW, demonstrating strong performance in large-scale training
of neural networks. However, a critical theory-practice disconnect exists:
Muon's efficiency relies on fast, approximate orthogonalization, yet all prior
theoretical work analyzes an idealized, computationally intractable version
assuming exact SVD-based updates. This work moves beyond the ideal by providing
the first analysis of the inexact orthogonalized update at Muon's core. We
develop our analysis within the general framework of Linear Minimization Oracle
(LMO)-based optimization, introducing a realistic additive error model to
capture the inexactness of practical approximation schemes. Our analysis yields
explicit bounds that quantify performance degradation as a function of the LMO
inexactness/error. We reveal a fundamental coupling between this inexactness
and the optimal step size and momentum: lower oracle precision requires a
smaller step size but larger momentum parameter. These findings elevate the
approximation procedure (e.g., the number of Newton-Schulz steps) from an
implementation detail to a critical parameter that must be co-tuned with the
learning schedule. NanoGPT experiments directly confirm the predicted coupling,
with optimal learning rates clearly shifting as approximation precision
changes.

*Xiang Li,Buxin Su,Chendi Wang,Qi Long,Weijie J. Su*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces f-DP-based privacy accounting for decentralized FL; presents PN-f-DP and Sec-f-LDP to quantify privacy leakage under decentralized settings; uses Markov chain concentration to capture amplification from sparse communication, local iterations, and correlated noise; shows tighter (ε,δ) bounds and better utility than RDP-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurately quantifying the privacy budget in decentralized FL is challenging due to intertwined components (decentralized communication, local updates) and limitations of existing DP accounting (e.g., Rényi DP). The work aims to provide tighter, more reliable privacy accounting under f-DP.

Method: Develops two f-DP-based accounting methods: (1) Pairwise Network f-DP (PN-f-DP) for privacy leakage between user pairs under random-walk communication, and (2) Secret-based f-LDP (Sec-f-LDP) that enables structured noise via shared secrets. Combines f-DP theory with Markov chain concentration to model amplification from sparse communication, multiple local iterations, and correlated noise.

Result: Empirical results on synthetic and real datasets show consistently tighter (ε,δ) privacy bounds and improved data utility compared to Renyi DP-based accounting approaches.

Conclusion: f-DP-based accounting is advantageous for decentralized FL privacy budgeting, yielding tighter bounds and better utility by capturing amplification effects from communication sparsity, local updates, and correlated noise via PN-f-DP and Sec-f-LDP frameworks.

Abstract: Differentially private (DP) decentralized Federated Learning (FL) allows
local users to collaborate without sharing their data with a central server.
However, accurately quantifying the privacy budget of private FL algorithms is
challenging due to the co-existence of complex algorithmic components such as
decentralized communication and local updates. This paper addresses privacy
accounting for two decentralized FL algorithms within the $f$-differential
privacy ($f$-DP) framework. We develop two new $f$-DP-based accounting methods
tailored to decentralized settings: Pairwise Network $f$-DP (PN-$f$-DP), which
quantifies privacy leakage between user pairs under random-walk communication,
and Secret-based $f$-Local DP (Sec-$f$-LDP), which supports structured noise
injection via shared secrets. By combining tools from $f$-DP theory and Markov
chain concentration, our accounting framework captures privacy amplification
arising from sparse communication, local iterations, and correlated noise.
Experiments on synthetic and real datasets demonstrate that our methods yield
consistently tighter $(\epsilon,\delta)$ bounds and improved utility compared
to R\'enyi DP-based approaches, illustrating the benefits of $f$-DP in
decentralized privacy accounting.

*Matan Tsipory,Ran Levinstein,Itay Evron,Mark Kong,Deanna Needell,Daniel Soudry*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Greedy task orderings based on maximizing dissimilarity improve continual learning for linear regression in practice, but theoretical guarantees depend on rank; repetition matters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Investigate how task orderings influence continual learning performance and clarify open questions around greedy dissimilarity orderings using Kaczmarz-method insights.

Method: Formalize greedy dissimilarity orderings via Kaczmarz literature; derive geometric/algebraic intuition; conduct experiments on linear regression with random data and CIFAR-100 linear probing; prove theory: loss bound in high-rank setting; analyze rank-dependent behavior including single-pass vs repeated passes.

Result: Empirically, greedy orderings converge faster than random on average loss; analytically, a high-rank setting yields a loss bound comparable to random; in general rank, single-pass greedy can fail catastrophically, while repeated-pass greedy converges at rate O(k^{-1/3}); distinct behaviors highlight nuance between greedy and random orderings.

Conclusion: Greedy orderings offer practical benefits but come with rank-sensitive guarantees; allowing repetition mitigates worst-case failures; results enrich understanding of ordering in continual learning and guide design choices.

Abstract: We analyze task orderings in continual learning for linear regression,
assuming joint realizability of training data. We focus on orderings that
greedily maximize dissimilarity between consecutive tasks, a concept briefly
explored in prior work but still surrounded by open questions. Using tools from
the Kaczmarz method literature, we formalize such orderings and develop
geometric and algebraic intuitions around them. Empirically, we demonstrate
that greedy orderings converge faster than random ones in terms of the average
loss across tasks, both for linear regression with random data and for linear
probing on CIFAR-100 classification tasks. Analytically, in a high-rank
regression setting, we prove a loss bound for greedy orderings analogous to
that of random ones. However, under general rank, we establish a
repetition-dependent separation. Specifically, while prior work showed that for
random orderings, with or without replacement, the average loss after $k$
iterations is bounded by $\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{k})$, we prove that single-pass
greedy orderings may fail catastrophically, whereas those allowing repetition
converge at rate $\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt[3]{k})$. Overall, we reveal nuances
within and between greedy and random orderings.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces elliptic uncertainty sets to model market impact in robust RL for trading; derives closed-form worst-case solutions enabling efficient robust policy evaluation; demonstrates improved Sharpe ratio and robustness to higher trade volumes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mismatch between training on historical data (actions do not affect prices) and deployment in live markets (actions shift prices). Traditional symmetric robust methods fail to capture directional market impact.

Method: Proposes a novel class of elliptic uncertainty sets representing directional uncertainty; derives implicit and explicit closed-form solutions for worst-case uncertainty; applies to robust policy evaluation in RL for trading.

Result: Single-asset and multi-asset trading experiments show superior Sharpe ratio and robust performance as trade volumes increase.

Conclusion: Elliptic uncertainty sets offer a faithful, scalable approach for robust RL in financial markets with market impact, improving evaluation and potential deployment robustness over symmetric models.

Abstract: In financial applications, reinforcement learning (RL) agents are commonly
trained on historical data, where their actions do not influence prices.
However, during deployment, these agents trade in live markets where their own
transactions can shift asset prices, a phenomenon known as market impact. This
mismatch between training and deployment environments can significantly degrade
performance. Traditional robust RL approaches address this model
misspecification by optimizing the worst-case performance over a set of
uncertainties, but typically rely on symmetric structures that fail to capture
the directional nature of market impact. To address this issue, we develop a
novel class of elliptic uncertainty sets. We establish both implicit and
explicit closed-form solutions for the worst-case uncertainty under these sets,
enabling efficient and tractable robust policy evaluation. Experiments on
single-asset and multi-asset trading tasks demonstrate that our method achieves
superior Sharpe ratio and remains robust under increasing trade volumes,
offering a more faithful and scalable approach to RL in financial markets.

### [97] [On the Optimal Construction of Unbiased Gradient Estimators for Zeroth-Order Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19953)
*Shaocong Ma,Heng Huang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a family of unbiased zeroth-order gradient estimators that rely only on function evaluations, by reformulating directional derivatives as a telescoping series and sampling from carefully designed distributions; proves optimal SGD complexity for smooth non-convex objectives and validates with synthetic tasks and language-model fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard ZOO estimators are biased unless perturbation stepsizes vanish, which can hinder practical optimization. There is a need for unbiased gradient estimators that use only function evaluations while maintaining tractable variance.

Method: Reformulate directional derivatives as a telescoping series and sample from carefully designed distributions to construct unbiased gradient estimators. Develop four constructions with specific scaling distributions and perturbation stepsizes. Analyze bias-variance properties and derive optimal parameters; apply SGD with these estimators to smooth non-convex objectives.

Result: The estimators are proven unbiased; variance is controlled with favorable properties. Theoretical analysis yields optimal scaling distributions and perturbation stepsizes for the four constructions. SGD using these estimators achieves optimal complexity for smooth non-convex objectives. Experiments on synthetic tasks and language-model fine-tuning demonstrate improved accuracy and convergence over standard ZOO methods.

Conclusion: Unbiased, function-evaluation-based ZOO estimators can eliminate bias without sacrificing efficiency, enabling near-optimal SGD performance on non-convex problems and broad practical applicability, including language-model fine-tuning.

Abstract: Zeroth-order optimization (ZOO) is an important framework for stochastic
optimization when gradients are unavailable or expensive to compute. A
potential limitation of existing ZOO methods is the bias inherent in most
gradient estimators unless the perturbation stepsize vanishes. In this paper,
we overcome this biasedness issue by proposing a novel family of unbiased
gradient estimators based solely on function evaluations. By reformulating
directional derivatives as a telescoping series and sampling from carefully
designed distributions, we construct estimators that eliminate bias while
maintaining favorable variance. We analyze their theoretical properties, derive
optimal scaling distributions and perturbation stepsizes of four specific
constructions, and prove that SGD using the proposed estimators achieves
optimal complexity for smooth non-convex objectives. Experiments on synthetic
tasks and language model fine-tuning confirm the superior accuracy and
convergence of our approach compared to standard methods.

### [98] [Revisiting Zeroth-Order Optimization: Minimum-Variance Two-Point Estimators and Directionally Aligned Perturbations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19975)
*Shaocong Ma,Heng Huang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper optimizes perturbation distributions for two-point zeroth-order gradient estimators to minimize asymptotic variance; shows directional alignment with the true gradient can outperform fixed-length perturbations; introduces the directionally aligned perturbation (DAP) scheme, provides convergence analysis for SGD with delta-unbiased perturbations, and shows empirical gains under certain conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ZO methods often rely on fixed-length random perturbations, which may ignore directional information of the true gradient. Reducing estimator variance and extending theory to broader perturbation classes could improve efficiency and convergence.

Method: Formulate a constrained functional optimization over perturbation distributions to minimize estimator variance as perturbation step size tends to zero; derive a directionally aligned perturbation (DAP) scheme that aligns perturbations with the gradient; provide convergence analysis for SGD using delta-unbiased perturbations; perform empirical evaluations on synthetic problems and practical tasks.

Result: Optimal perturbations that minimize asymptotic variance tend to align with the gradient rather than have fixed magnitude; DAP improves accuracy along critical directions; convergence bounds are extended to a broader class of perturbations; empirical results show DAPs outperform traditional methods under certain conditions.

Conclusion: Directional alignment in perturbations is a viable approach to variance reduction in zeroth-order optimization; the DAP framework offers both theoretical and empirical benefits and warrants further exploration of condition-specific perturbation strategies.

Abstract: In this paper, we explore the two-point zeroth-order gradient estimator and
identify the distribution of random perturbations that minimizes the
estimator's asymptotic variance as the perturbation stepsize tends to zero. We
formulate it as a constrained functional optimization problem over the space of
perturbation distributions. Our findings reveal that such desired perturbations
can align directionally with the true gradient, instead of maintaining a fixed
length. While existing research has largely focused on fixed-length
perturbations, the potential advantages of directional alignment have been
overlooked. To address this gap, we delve into the theoretical and empirical
properties of the directionally aligned perturbation (DAP) scheme, which
adaptively offers higher accuracy along critical directions. Additionally, we
provide a convergence analysis for stochastic gradient descent using
$\delta$-unbiased random perturbations, extending existing complexity bounds to
a wider range of perturbations. Through empirical evaluations on both synthetic
problems and practical tasks, we demonstrate that DAPs outperform traditional
methods under specific conditions.

Motivation: Isotropic (uniform) noise in existing randomized smoothing ignores input-dimension heterogeneity, limiting robustness certification; a method to arbitrarily adapt noise across dimensions and norms, compatible with any classifier, is needed.

Method: Propose UCAN framework that transforms any smoothing method from symmetric to asymmetric noise; supports diverse noise distributions for certifying robustness under different L_p norms; develop three Noise Parameter Generators (NPGs) to optimally tune per-dimension noise; provide theoretical foundation and implementation pipeline.

Result: Empirical evaluation shows significant improvements over state-of-the-art, up to 182.6% increase in certified accuracy at large radii across MNIST, CIFAR-10, ImageNet.

Conclusion: UCAN enables universal, anisotropic-noise certified robustness, broadening applicability of randomized smoothing and offering practical robustness gains; code available.

Abstract: Randomized smoothing has become essential for achieving certified adversarial
robustness in machine learning models. However, current methods primarily use
isotropic noise distributions that are uniform across all data dimensions, such
as image pixels, limiting the effectiveness of robustness certification by
ignoring the heterogeneity of inputs and data dimensions. To address this
limitation, we propose UCAN: a novel technique that \underline{U}niversally
\underline{C}ertifies adversarial robustness with \underline{A}nisotropic
\underline{N}oise. UCAN is designed to enhance any existing randomized
smoothing method, transforming it from symmetric (isotropic) to asymmetric
(anisotropic) noise distributions, thereby offering a more tailored defense
against adversarial attacks. Our theoretical framework is versatile, supporting
a wide array of noise distributions for certified robustness in different
$\ell_p$-norms and applicable to any arbitrary classifier by guaranteeing the
classifier's prediction over perturbed inputs with provable robustness bounds
through tailored noise injection. Additionally, we develop a novel framework
equipped with three exemplary noise parameter generators (NPGs) to optimally
fine-tune the anisotropic noise parameters for different data dimensions,
allowing for pursuing different levels of robustness enhancements in
practice.Empirical evaluations underscore the significant leap in UCAN's
performance over existing state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating up to
$182.6\%$ improvement in certified accuracy at large certified radii on MNIST,
CIFAR10, and ImageNet datasets.\footnote{Code is anonymously available at

### [100] [Abstain Mask Retain Core: Time Series Prediction by Adaptive Masking Loss with Representation Consistency](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19980)
*Renzhao Liang,Sizhe Xu,Chenggang Xie,Jingru Chen,Feiyang Ren,Shu Yang,Takahiro Yabe*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A paradoxical finding: truncating historical data can improve time-series forecasting performance. The paper introduces AMRC to suppress redundant features and boost accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenging the long-sequence information gain hypothesis in time-series forecasting; redundant/noisy history can hinder learning; leverage information bottleneck to improve robustness and efficiency.

Method: Adaptive Masking Loss with Representation Consistency (AMRC): (1) dynamic masking loss to identify highly discriminative temporal segments during training; (2) representation consistency constraint to stabilize the relations among inputs, labels, and predictions, reducing reliance on redundant features.

Result: Empirical results show AMRC reduces redundant feature learning and significantly improves forecasting accuracy, even when less historical data is used, challenging conventional long-history assumptions.

Conclusion: The work provides theoretical and practical advances by leveraging information bottleneck concepts to suppress noise and redundancy in temporal models, offering a robust, efficient framework for forecasting.

Abstract: Time series forecasting plays a pivotal role in critical domains such as
energy management and financial markets. Although deep learning-based
approaches (e.g., MLP, RNN, Transformer) have achieved remarkable progress, the
prevailing "long-sequence information gain hypothesis" exhibits inherent
limitations. Through systematic experimentation, this study reveals a
counterintuitive phenomenon: appropriately truncating historical data can
paradoxically enhance prediction accuracy, indicating that existing models
learn substantial redundant features (e.g., noise or irrelevant fluctuations)
during training, thereby compromising effective signal extraction. Building
upon information bottleneck theory, we propose an innovative solution termed
Adaptive Masking Loss with Representation Consistency (AMRC), which features
two core components: 1) Dynamic masking loss, which adaptively identified
highly discriminative temporal segments to guide gradient descent during model
training; 2) Representation consistency constraint, which stabilized the
mapping relationships among inputs, labels, and predictions. Experimental
results demonstrate that AMRC effectively suppresses redundant feature learning
while significantly improving model performance. This work not only challenges
conventional assumptions in temporal modeling but also provides novel
theoretical insights and methodological breakthroughs for developing efficient
and robust forecasting models.

### [101] [No Compute Left Behind: Rethinking Reasoning and Sampling with Masked Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19990)
*Zachary Horvitz,Raghav Singhal,Hao Zou,Carles Domingo-Enrich,Zhou Yu,Rajesh Ranganath,Kathleen McKeown*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Masked diffusion language models (MDLMs) enable new inference and post-training methods via infilling-based reasoning and adaptive multi-token decoding, but their expected benefits on math/coding tasks are not straightforward. The paper proposes reasoning-as-infilling and multi-token entropy decoding (MED) to improve efficiency and data quality, with notable gains on GSM8k and substantial step reductions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To justify the extra compute of MDLMs beyond left-to-right decoding and to exploit their posterior distributions for inference, uncertainty estimation, early exits, and post-training data generation, especially for math/coding tasks where any-order or multi-token decoding can underperform.

Method: 1) Reasoning-as-infilling: structure outputs as a reasoning template and infer answers, enabling uncertainty measurement and early exits; sample posterior reasoning traces conditioned on an answer to create high-quality post-training data; fine-tune LLaDA-8B Base on posterior traces. 2) Multi-token entropy decoding (MED): an adaptive sampler that decodes masked positions in parallel based on conditional entropies to minimize error, preserving performance while reducing steps (2.7x).

Result: MDLM-based reasoning with infilling provides performance gains on GSM8k when fine-tuned on posterior reasoning traces comparable to human-written traces; MED maintains performance across benchmarks while achieving a 2.7x reduction in decoding steps.

Conclusion: MDLM training and computation unlock new inference and post-training paradigms (structured reasoning, uncertainty-based early exit, and posterior-trace augmentation) and can yield substantial efficiency improvements with MED, motivating further exploration of infilling-based reasoning and adaptive decoding.

Abstract: Masked diffusion language models (MDLMs) are trained to in-fill positions in
randomly masked sequences, in contrast to next-token prediction models.
Discussions around MDLMs focus on two benefits: (1) any-order decoding and 2)
multi-token decoding. However, we observe that for math and coding tasks,
any-order algorithms often underperform or behave similarly to left-to-right
sampling, and standard multi-token decoding significantly degrades performance.
At inference time, MDLMs compute the conditional distribution of all masked
positions. A natural question is: How can we justify this additional compute
when left-to-right one-token-at-a-time decoding is on par with any-order
decoding algorithms? First, we propose reasoning-as-infilling. By using MDLMs
to infill a reasoning template, we can structure outputs and distinguish
between reasoning and answer tokens. In turn, this enables measuring answer
uncertainty during reasoning, and early exits when the model converges on an
answer. Next, given an answer, reasoning-as-infilling enables sampling from the
MDLM posterior over reasoning traces conditioned on the answer, providing a new
source of high-quality data for post-training. On GSM8k, we observe that
fine-tuning LLaDA-8B Base on its posterior reasoning traces provides a
performance boost on par with fine-tuning on human-written reasoning traces.
Additionally, given an answer, reasoning-as-infilling provides a method for
scoring the correctness of the reasoning process at intermediate steps. Second,
we propose multi-token entropy decoding (MED), a simple adaptive sampler that
minimizes the error incurred by decoding positions in parallel based on the
conditional entropies of those positions. MED preserves performance across
benchmarks and leads to 2.7x fewer steps. Our work demonstrates that the
training and compute used by MDLMs unlock many new inference and post-training
methods.

### [102] [Machine Learning-Based Localization Accuracy of RFID Sensor Networks via RSSI Decision Trees and CAD Modeling for Defense Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20019)
*Curtis Lee Shull,Merrick Green*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RSSI-based decision-tree classification on RFID data in a CAD floor plan provides zone-level inference with modest overall accuracy; performance is uneven across zones due to class imbalance and rare-zone misclassification; adjacency-aware interpretation aids understanding; improvements likely from antenna placement and sensor fusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Defense asset storage requires reliable, zone-level localization under security constraints; RFID/RSSI methods offer scalable monitoring but face spoofing, long-range detection, and data imbalance challenges. This work explores feasibility through a realistic simulation.

Method: Supervised learning simulation using realistic RSSI data in a CAD-modeled floor plan; 12 zones (LabZoneA-L); dataset ~980,000 reads; class weights to handle imbalance; stratified subsampling to 5,000 balanced observations; Decision Tree classifier; adjacency-aware confusion matrix for interpretation.

Result: Overall accuracy 34.2%; F1-scores >0.40 for multiple zones (e.g., F, G, H); rare zones (notably LabZoneC) misclassified despite class weights; interpretation aided by adjacency-aware matrix; results indicate potential for zone-level anomaly detection in defense logistics; performance could improve with better antenna placement or sensor fusion.

Conclusion: RSSI-based decision trees can be applied in realistic defense simulations for zone-level anomaly detection or misplacement monitoring; reliability in low-coverage zones could be improved through hardware improvements (antenna placement) and integration with additional sensors or modalities.

Abstract: Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) tracking may be a viable solution for
defense assets that must be stored in accordance with security guidelines.
However, poor sensor specificity (vulnerabilities include long range detection,
spoofing, and counterfeiting) can lead to erroneous detection and operational
security events. We present a supervised learning simulation with realistic
Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) data and Decision Tree classification
in a Computer Assisted Design (CAD)-modeled floor plan that encapsulates some
of the challenges encountered in defense storage. In this work, we focused on
classifying 12 lab zones (LabZoneA-L) to perform location inference. The raw
dataset had approximately 980,000 reads. Class frequencies were imbalanced, and
class weights were calculated to account for class imbalance in this
multi-class setting. The model, trained on stratified subsamples to 5,000
balanced observations, yielded an overall accuracy of 34.2% and F1-scores
greater than 0.40 for multiple zones (Zones F, G, H, etc.). However, rare
classes (most notably LabZoneC) were often misclassified, even with the use of
class weights. An adjacency-aware confusion matrix was calculated to allow
better interpretation of physically adjacent zones. These results suggest that
RSSI-based decision trees can be applied in realistic simulations to enable
zone-level anomaly detection or misplacement monitoring for defense supply
logistics. Reliable classification performance in low-coverage and low-signal
zones could be improved with better antenna placement or additional sensors and
sensor fusion with other modalities.

### [103] [SALT: Step-level Advantage Assignment for Long-horizon Agents via Trajectory Graph](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20022)
*Jiazheng Li,Yawei Wang,David Yan,Yijun Tian,Zhichao Xu,Huan Song,Panpan Xu,Lin Lee Cheong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SALT provides a fine-grained credit assignment for group-based RL using trajectory graphs, improving performance with negligible overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Group-based RL approaches struggle with uniformly rewarding all actions due to entangled multi-step effects; need a way to credit individual steps using only outcome rewards.

Method: Construct a trajectory graph from samples with the same prompt to quantify per-step quality and derive step-wise advantages; SALT is a plug-and-play module that requires no rollout changes and adds minimal computation.

Result: Empirically improves performance across WebShop, ALFWorld, AppWorld for multiple model sizes; robust analyses validating design choices.

Conclusion: SALT offers an effective, lightweight solution for finer-grained credit assignment in group-based RL, enabling better performance with low overhead and easy integration.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities,
enabling language agents to excel at single-turn tasks. However, their
application to complex, multi-step, and long-horizon tasks remains challenging.
While reinforcement learning (RL) offers a promising avenue for addressing
these challenges, mainstream approaches typically rely solely on sparse,
outcome-based rewards, a limitation that becomes especially problematic for
group-based RL algorithms lacking critic models, such as Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO). In such methods, uniformly rewarding or penalizing all
actions within a trajectory can lead to training instability and suboptimal
policies, because beneficial and detrimental actions are often entangled across
multi-step interactions. To address this challenge, we propose SALT, a novel
and lightweight framework that provides a finer-grained advantage assignment,
derived solely from outcome rewards. We achieve this by constructing a graph
from trajectories of the same prompt, which allows us to quantify the quality
of each step and assign advantages accordingly. Crucially, SALT is designed as
a plug-and-play module that seamlessly integrates with existing group-based RL
algorithms, requiring no modifications to the rollout procedure and introducing
negligible computational overhead. Extensive experiments on the WebShop,
ALFWorld, and AppWorld benchmarks with various model sizes demonstrate that
SALT consistently improves performance. We also conduct a thorough analysis to
validate the design choices behind SALT and offer actionable insights.

TL;DR: A large-scale, ML-ready temporal heterogeneous graph of Bitcoin transaction flow enabling scalable ML research and benchmarking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bitcoin's pseudonymity and opaque UTXO-based flow hinder ML research; this work provides a complete, ML-friendly representation and toolkit.

Method: Construct a temporal heterogeneous graph from all transactions up to cutoffHeight, with >2.4B nodes and >39.72B edges; generate node/edge features for sampled communities; provide graph DB loading/analysis tools and database snapshots.

Result: An ML-ready Bitcoin graph dataset (>2.4B nodes, >39.72B edges) plus sampling methods, tooling, and ready snapshots; code and data available at GitHub.

Conclusion: Enables large-scale ML studies of Bitcoin, including anomaly detection, address classification, and market analysis; provides benchmarks for graph ML on a real, large-scale financial network.

Abstract: Since its 2009 genesis block, the Bitcoin network has processed \num{>1.08}
billion (B) transactions representing \num{>8.72}B BTC, offering rich potential
for machine learning (ML); yet, its pseudonymity and obscured flow of funds
inherent in its \utxo-based design, have rendered this data largely
inaccessible for ML research. Addressing this gap, we present an ML-compatible
graph modeling the Bitcoin's economic topology by reconstructing the flow of
funds. This temporal, heterogeneous graph encompasses complete transaction
history up to block \cutoffHeight, consisting of \num{>2.4}B nodes and
\num{>39.72}B edges. Additionally, we provide custom sampling methods yielding
node and edge feature vectors of sampled communities, tools to load and analyze
the Bitcoin graph data within specialized graph databases, and ready-to-use
database snapshots. This comprehensive dataset and toolkit empower the ML
community to tackle Bitcoin's intricate ecosystem at scale, driving progress in
applications such as anomaly detection, address classification, market
analysis, and large-scale graph ML benchmarking. Dataset and code available at

### [105] [Speculative Sampling for Parametric Temporal Point Processes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20031)
*Marin Biloš,Anderson Schneider,Yuriy Nevmyvaka*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A rejection-sampling based method enables exact, parallel sampling of multiple future events in temporal point processes (TPPs) from existing models without retraining or architecture changes, with theoretical guarantees and real-data speedups.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autoregressive TPPs force sequential sampling, which hurts efficiency and scalability. There is a need for a method that can generate multiple future events in parallel while preserving exactness and without changing models.

Method: Introduce a rejection sampling algorithm that operates on the conditional intensities of existing TPPs to sample several future events in parallel. It does not require retraining or changes to the model architecture and provides theoretical guarantees of correctness.

Result: The approach yields theoretical guarantees of exact sampling and demonstrates empirical speedups on real-world datasets, showing practical benefits for large-scale TPP applications.

Conclusion: The method closes the gap between expressive TPP modeling and efficient parallel generation, enabling scalable, exact multi-step sampling without additional training or architectural modification.

Abstract: Temporal point processes are powerful generative models for event sequences
that capture complex dependencies in time-series data. They are commonly
specified using autoregressive models that learn the distribution of the next
event from the previous events. This makes sampling inherently sequential,
limiting efficiency. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm based on
rejection sampling that enables exact sampling of multiple future values from
existing TPP models, in parallel, and without requiring any architectural
changes or retraining. Besides theoretical guarantees, our method demonstrates
empirical speedups on real-world datasets, bridging the gap between expressive
modeling and efficient parallel generation for large-scale TPP applications.

### [106] [Learning Personalized Ad Impact via Contextual Reinforcement Learning under Delayed Rewards](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20055)
*Yuwei Cheng,Zifeng Zhao,Haifeng Xu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces a Contextual MDP framework for online ad bidding with delayed Poisson rewards, plus a two-stage maximum likelihood estimator with data-splitting and a reinforcement learning algorithm that achieves near-optimal regret; validated via simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Online advertising auctions require accounting for delayed and long-term effects, cumulative ad impacts (reinforcement or fatigue), and user heterogeneity. These factors are seldom addressed jointly in prior work, limiting accurate estimation and effective bidding.

Method: Model the bidding problem as a Contextual MDP with delayed Poisson rewards. Propose a two-stage maximum likelihood estimator with data-splitting to control estimation error based on the first-stage accuracy. Build a reinforcement learning algorithm to derive personalized bidding strategies.

Result: Theoretical regret bound of tilde O(d H^2 sqrt(T)) for the proposed RL algorithm. Simulation experiments corroborate the theoretical findings, demonstrating effective personalized bidding performance.

Conclusion: A joint framework combining estimation and RL for contextual bidding under delayed effects; provides controlled estimation error and near-optimal regret, with simulations validating its promise for practical deployment in ad platforms.

Abstract: Online advertising platforms use automated auctions to connect advertisers
with potential customers, requiring effective bidding strategies to maximize
profits. Accurate ad impact estimation requires considering three key factors:
delayed and long-term effects, cumulative ad impacts such as reinforcement or
fatigue, and customer heterogeneity. However, these effects are often not
jointly addressed in previous studies. To capture these factors, we model ad
bidding as a Contextual Markov Decision Process (CMDP) with delayed Poisson
rewards. For efficient estimation, we propose a two-stage maximum likelihood
estimator combined with data-splitting strategies, ensuring controlled
estimation error based on the first-stage estimator's (in)accuracy. Building on
this, we design a reinforcement learning algorithm to derive efficient
personalized bidding strategies. This approach achieves a near-optimal regret
bound of $\tilde{O}{(dH^2\sqrt{T})}$, where $d$ is the contextual dimension,
$H$ is the number of rounds, and $T$ is the number of customers. Our
theoretical findings are validated by simulation experiments.

*Hongyi Liu,Jiaji Huang,Zhen Jia,Youngsuk Park,Yu-Xiang Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes an online draft-model selection algorithm for speculative decoding that provably competes with the best draft model in hindsight, enabling evaluation of all drafts without extra queries and achieving exponential improvement over bandit approaches; applicable to single/multi-draft and draft-tree methods; includes system-efficient online learners and strong empirical gains vs EAGLE3 and BanditSpec, especially for long reasoning chains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve draft-model selection in speculative decoding by obtaining theoretical guarantees and reducing overhead, enabling accurate evaluation of all drafts without additional queries to the target model.

Method: Designs an online learning algorithm that, for each query, competes with the best draft model in hindsight using metrics like token acceptance probability or expected acceptance length; can evaluate all drafts without extra target-model queries; applicable to various speculative decoding setups; provides system-efficient implementations of online learners.

Result: The approach achieves provable competitive guarantees and empirically outperforms state-of-the-art baselines (EAGLE3, BanditSpec) across multiple datasets and domains, particularly when long reasoning chains are required.

Conclusion: The framework generalizes speculative decoding, enabling more effective, lower-cost draft-model selection with strong theoretical guarantees and practical performance gains.

Abstract: Speculative decoding is widely used in accelerating large language model
(LLM) inference. In this work, we focus on the online draft model selection
problem in speculative decoding. We design an algorithm that provably competes
with the best draft model in hindsight for each query in terms of either the
token acceptance probability or expected acceptance length. In particular, we
show that we can accurately evaluate all draft models, instead of only the
chosen model without incurring additional queries to the target model, which
allows us to improve exponentially over the existing bandit-based approach as
the number of draft models increases. Our approach is generically applicable
with any speculative decoding methods (single draft, multi-drafts and
draft-trees). Moreover, we design system-efficient versions of online learners
and demonstrate that the overhead in computation and latency can be
substantially reduced. We conduct extensive experiments on open-source LLMs and
diverse datasets, demonstrating that our methods substantially outperform the
state-of-the-art EAGLE3 and the BanditSpec baseline in a variety of domains
where specialized domain-expert drafters are available, especially when long
reasoning chains are required.

*Yimeng Qiu,Feihuang Fang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A multi-layer empirical study on whether core cryptoassets' liquidity and volatility proxies generate spillovers that forecast market-wide risk; it combines A) liquidity-returns interactions, B) PCA-based liquidity-returns relations, and C) volatility-crowding factors, using VARs, HAR-X, and leakage-safe ML with SHAP. It analyzes daily data (2021–2025) across 74 assets, finds significant cross-layer Granger-causality and moderate out-of-sample predictive accuracy, and provides artifacts and figures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine whether microstructure-like signals (liquidity and volatility proxies) in a core cryptoasset set can forecast systemic market risk, and to integrate multiple analytical layers and interpretable ML to assess spillovers and forecastability.

Method: Three-layer framework: Layer A — interactions between core liquidity and returns; Layer B — principal-component relations linking liquidity and returns; Layer C — volatility-factor projections capturing cross-sectional volatility crowding. Supplemented by VAR impulse responses and forecast error variance decompositions; HAR-X models; leakage-safe machine learning with temporal splits, early stopping, validation-thresholding, and SHAP-based interpretation. Data: daily observations from 2021–2025 (1,462 obs across 74 assets). Outputs include pipeline overview, Layer A heatmap, Layer C robustness analysis, VAR variance decompositions, and test-set precision-recall curves; full data/figures in artifact repository.

Result: Evidence of statistically significant Granger-causal relationships across the three layers, with moderate out-of-sample predictive accuracy. Layer C robustness analyses and various figures (VAR decompositions, precision-recall curves) support the robustness of findings; comprehensive data and figures are archived in the artifact repository.

Conclusion: A multi-layer framework can reveal meaningful cross-layer spillovers from liquidity and volatility proxies to market-wide risk in crypto markets, with interpretable ML components (SHAP) and transparent evaluation; the work provides data and figures for replication and future research.

Abstract: We study whether liquidity and volatility proxies of a core set of
cryptoassets generate spillovers that forecast market-wide risk. Our empirical
framework integrates three statistical layers: (A) interactions between core
liquidity and returns, (B) principal-component relations linking liquidity and
returns, and (C) volatility-factor projections that capture cross-sectional
volatility crowding. The analysis is complemented by vector autoregression
impulse responses and forecast error variance decompositions (see Granger 1969;
Sims 1980), heterogeneous autoregressive models with exogenous regressors
(HAR-X, Corsi 2009), and a leakage-safe machine learning protocol using
temporal splits, early stopping, validation-only thresholding, and SHAP-based
interpretation. Using daily data from 2021 to 2025 (1462 observations across 74
assets), we document statistically significant Granger-causal relationships
across layers and moderate out-of-sample predictive accuracy. We report the
most informative figures, including the pipeline overview, Layer A heatmap,
Layer C robustness analysis, vector autoregression variance decompositions, and

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A transformer-based autoencoder that jointly models non-linear, non-stationary dynamics across multiple brain regions while disentangling shared vs. region-specific latent structure, yielding better behavioral decoding than prior methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of existing alignment/multi-view methods (which neglect temporal structure) and dynamical latent variable models (which are usually restricted to a single area, assume linear read-outs, or conflate shared and private signals) by providing a unified framework for cross-region neural dynamics.

Method: Introduce Coupled Transformer Autoencoder (CTAE) using transformer encoders/decoders to capture long-range temporal dynamics. Each region has a latent space partitioned into orthogonal shared and private subspaces, enabling explicit separation of cross-region shared dynamics from region-specific activity within a single model.

Result: Applied to two high-density electrophysiology datasets with simultaneous multi-region recordings (motor cortical areas and sensory areas). CTAE yields meaningful representations that improve decoding of behavioral variables compared to existing approaches.

Conclusion: CTAE offers a unified framework to model non-stationary, non-linear cross-region dynamics while disentangling shared vs. private signals, improving decoding performance and providing richer insights into inter-regional brain interactions; applicable to other multi-region sequential data and open questions on interpretability and scalability.

Abstract: Simultaneous recordings from thousands of neurons across multiple brain areas
reveal rich mixtures of activity that are shared between regions and dynamics
that are unique to each region. Existing alignment or multi-view methods
neglect temporal structure, whereas dynamical latent variable models capture
temporal dependencies but are usually restricted to a single area, assume
linear read-outs, or conflate shared and private signals. We introduce the
Coupled Transformer Autoencoder (CTAE) - a sequence model that addresses both
(i) non-stationary, non-linear dynamics and (ii) separation of shared versus
region-specific structure in a single framework. CTAE employs transformer
encoders and decoders to capture long-range neural dynamics and explicitly
partitions each region's latent space into orthogonal shared and private
subspaces. We demonstrate the effectiveness of CTAE on two high-density
electrophysiology datasets with simultaneous recordings from multiple regions,
one from motor cortical areas and the other from sensory areas. CTAE extracts
meaningful representations that better decode behavioral variables compared to
existing approaches.

*Bosong Huang,Ming Jin,Yuxuan Liang,Johan Barthelemy,Debo Cheng,Qingsong Wen,Chenghao Liu,Shirui Pan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ShapeX explains time series classifications by partitioning signals into shapelet-driven segments and using Shapley values to quantify their saliency, addressing timesteplevel attribution and aiming for causal, shapelet-based explanations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Post-hoc explanations for time series largely focus on timestep-level attribution, neglecting that classification is driven by key shapelets. A shapelet-centric, causal explanation is needed for trust in high-stakes domains.

Method: Propose ShapeX framework; segment time series into shapelet-driven segments; Shapelet Describe-and-Detect (SDD) learns diverse, informative shapelets; compute segment saliency with Shapley values; leverage atomicity of shapelets to infer causal relations.

Result: Empirical results on synthetic and real-world datasets show ShapeX outperforms existing PHTSE methods in identifying the most relevant subsequences and enhancing both the precision and causal fidelity of explanations.

Conclusion: ShapeX provides more faithful, causally grounded explanations for time series classification by foregrounding shapelets, suggesting a step toward more transparent, trustworthy models in high-stakes settings.

Abstract: Explaining time series classification models is crucial, particularly in
high-stakes applications such as healthcare and finance, where transparency and
trust play a critical role. Although numerous time series classification
methods have identified key subsequences, known as shapelets, as core features
for achieving state-of-the-art performance and validating their pivotal role in
classification outcomes, existing post-hoc time series explanation (PHTSE)
methods primarily focus on timestep-level feature attribution. These
explanation methods overlook the fundamental prior that classification outcomes
are predominantly driven by key shapelets. To bridge this gap, we present
ShapeX, an innovative framework that segments time series into meaningful
shapelet-driven segments and employs Shapley values to assess their saliency.
At the core of ShapeX lies the Shapelet Describe-and-Detect (SDD) framework,
which effectively learns a diverse set of shapelets essential for
classification. We further demonstrate that ShapeX produces explanations which
reveal causal relationships instead of just correlations, owing to the
atomicity properties of shapelets. Experimental results on both synthetic and
real-world datasets demonstrate that ShapeX outperforms existing methods in
identifying the most relevant subsequences, enhancing both the precision and
causal fidelity of time series explanations.

*Chang Yang,Ziyi Wang,Wangfeng Tan,Zhiting Tan,Changrui Ji,Zhiming Zhou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A hierarchical dual-head model for four-level suicide risk classification using CORAL for ordinal relations and a standard classifier head, with temporal modeling and time-interval embeddings; trained with a composite loss; efficiency-focused via freezing layers and mixed-precision; evaluated with 5-fold cross-validation using macro F1.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenging aspects in automated suicide risk detection: severe class imbalance, temporal posting dynamics, and the need to model risk as both ordinal and categorical.

Method: MentalRoBERTa-based architecture; 3-layer Transformer encoder with 8-head attention; two heads (CORAL ordinal, standard classifier); time-interval embeddings; composite loss (0.5 CORAL + 0.3 Cross-Entropy + 0.2 Focal); freeze first 6 layers; mixed-precision; 5-fold stratified cross-validation; macro F1 as metric.

Result: Not reported in abstract; methodology and evaluation protocol described.

Conclusion: Proposes a dual-head hierarchical model to jointly model ordinal and categorical risk levels with temporal dynamics and efficiency optimizations; evaluation protocol outlined; no numeric results provided.

Abstract: Social media platforms have become important sources for identifying suicide
risk, but automated detection systems face multiple challenges including severe
class imbalance, temporal complexity in posting patterns, and the dual nature
of risk levels as both ordinal and categorical. This paper proposes a
hierarchical dual-head neural network based on MentalRoBERTa for suicide risk
classification into four levels: indicator, ideation, behavior, and attempt.
The model employs two complementary prediction heads operating on a shared
sequence representation: a CORAL (Consistent Rank Logits) head that preserves
ordinal relationships between risk levels, and a standard classification head
that enables flexible categorical distinctions. A 3-layer Transformer encoder
with 8-head multi-head attention models temporal dependencies across post
sequences, while explicit time interval embeddings capture posting behavior
dynamics. The model is trained with a combined loss function (0.5 CORAL + 0.3
Cross-Entropy + 0.2 Focal Loss) that simultaneously addresses ordinal structure
preservation, overconfidence reduction, and class imbalance. To improve
computational efficiency, we freeze the first 6 layers (50%) of MentalRoBERTa
and employ mixed-precision training. The model is evaluated using 5-fold
stratified cross-validation with macro F1 score as the primary metric.

*Amartya Roy,Souvik Chakraborty*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a game-theoretic RL framework for causal discovery with finite-sample guarantees, competitive with strong baselines, and scalable to large graphs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bridge the gap between empirically strong but non-guaranteed methods (GES, GraN-DAG) and theoretically principled but non-scalable approaches, by providing finite-sample guarantees and scalable RL-based solutions.

Method: A DDQN agent competes against a baseline (GES or GraN-DAG), warm-starting from the opponent's solution; learns a policy to select graphs within a game, delivering provable guarantees including no-worse-than-opponent, accelerated convergence, and high-probability correctness.

Result: Demonstrates error probability decay with sample size on synthetic SEMs; outperforms GES and GraN-DAG on multiple real datasets; scales to graphs with up to ~220 nodes; establishes RL-based causal discovery with consistency, sample-efficiency, and scalability.

Conclusion: RL-based causal discovery can combine empirical performance with finite-sample guarantees, marking a step toward unifying theory and practice in causal structure learning.

Abstract: Causal discovery remains a central challenge in machine learning, yet
existing methods face a fundamental gap: algorithms like GES and GraN-DAG
achieve strong empirical performance but lack finite-sample guarantees, while
theoretically principled approaches fail to scale. We close this gap by
introducing a game-theoretic reinforcement learning framework for causal
discovery, where a DDQN agent directly competes against a strong baseline (GES
or GraN-DAG), always warm-starting from the opponent's solution. This design
yields three provable guarantees: the learned graph is never worse than the
opponent, warm-starting strictly accelerates convergence, and most importantly,
with high probability the algorithm selects the true best candidate graph. To
the best of our knowledge, our result makes a first-of-its-kind progress in
explaining such finite-sample guarantees in causal discovery: on synthetic SEMs
(30 nodes), the observed error probability decays with n, tightly matching
theory. On real-world benchmarks including Sachs, Asia, Alarm, Child, Hepar2,
Dream, and Andes, our method consistently improves upon GES and GraN-DAG while
remaining theoretically safe. Remarkably, it scales to large graphs such as
Hepar2 (70 nodes), Dream (100 nodes), and Andes (220 nodes). Together, these
results establish a new class of RL-based causal discovery algorithms that are
simultaneously provably consistent, sample-efficient, and practically scalable,
marking a decisive step toward unifying empirical performance with rigorous
finite-sample theory.

### [113] [On pattern classification with weighted dimensions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20107)
*Ayatullah Faruk Mollah*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces a dimension-wise weighting scheme for KNN using weighted Minkowski distance; demonstrates improved classification performance, notably around 10% gain on gene expression data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pattern classification in high-dimensional, small-sample settings often suffers from suboptimal distance measures. Euclidean distance and equal feature treatment can mislead nearest-neighbor decisions. A per-dimension weighting scheme and distance norm analysis aim to improve accuracy and robustness.

Method: Provide a detailed analysis of distance measure norms and per-dimension weights with visualization; propose a novel per-dimension weighting scheme; incorporate this schema into a KNN classifier using weighted Minkowski distance; evaluate on synthetic and real datasets, focusing on gene-expression data.

Result: The proposed approach outperforms traditional KNN under the same experimental setups. In gene-expression datasets, it yields a significant and consistent ~10% improvement in classification accuracy across cross-validation with varying k; the weighting scheme helps shape the neighbor region and improve robust neighbor selection in high-dimensional spaces.

Conclusion: This work generalizes KNN by integrating a per-dimension weighted Minkowski distance, providing robust improvements in pattern classification for high-dimensional, limited-sample data; the weighting framework is effective across diverse datasets, with notable gains in gene-expression tasks.

Abstract: Studies on various facets of pattern classification is often imperative while
working with multi-dimensional samples pertaining to diverse application
scenarios. In this notion, weighted dimension-based distance measure has been
one of the vital considerations in pattern analysis as it reflects the degree
of similarity between samples. Though it is often presumed to be settled with
the pervasive use of Euclidean distance, plethora of issues often surface. In
this paper, we present (a) a detail analysis on the impact of distance measure
norms and weights of dimensions along with visualization, (b) a novel weighting
scheme for each dimension, (c) incorporation of this dimensional weighting
schema into a KNN classifier, and (d) pattern classification on a variety of
synthetic as well as realistic datasets with the developed model. It has
performed well across diverse experiments in comparison to the traditional KNN
under the same experimental setups. Specifically, for gene expression datasets,
it yields significant and consistent gain in classification accuracy (around
10%) in all cross-validation experiments with different values of k. As such
datasets contain limited number of samples of high dimensions, meaningful
selection of nearest neighbours is desirable, and this requirement is
reasonably met by regulating the shape and size of the region enclosing the k
number of reference samples with the developed weighting schema and appropriate
norm. It, therefore, stands as an important generalization of KNN classifier
powered by weighted Minkowski distance with the present weighting schema.

### [114] [Why Prototypes Collapse: Diagnosing and Preventing Partial Collapse in Prototypical Self-Supervised Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20108)
*Gabriel Y. Arteaga,Marius Aasan,Rwiddhi Chakraborty,Martine Hjelkrem-Tan,Thalles Silva,Michael Kampffmeyer,Adín Ramírez Rivera*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Decoupling prototype learning from the encoder eliminates partial prototype collapse in prototypical SSL by treating prototypes as a Gaussian mixture updated via online EM, improving diversity and downstream performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Partial prototype collapse reduces diversity of targets and degrades representation quality; existing remedies address symptoms rather than root cause; a principled decoupling may restore diversity and efficiency.

Method: Prototypes are modeled as a Gaussian mixture; updated with an online EM-style procedure independent of the encoder's loss; the encoder is trained with its own objective, decoupling the optimization.

Result: Eliminates prototype collapse, yields consistently diverse prototypes, and improves downstream performance without explicit regularization.

Conclusion: Decoupling joint optimization addresses the root cause of collapse in prototypical SSL, offering a simpler, principled approach with potential broader applicability to other joint-optimization settings.

Abstract: Prototypical self-supervised learning methods consistently suffer from
partial prototype collapse, where multiple prototypes converge to nearly
identical representations. This undermines their central purpose -- providing
diverse and informative targets to guide encoders toward rich representations
-- and has led practitioners to over-parameterize prototype sets or add ad-hoc
regularizers, which mitigate symptoms rather than address the root cause. We
empirically trace the collapse to the joint optimization of encoders and
prototypes, which encourages a type of shortcut learning: early in training
prototypes drift toward redundant representations that minimize loss without
necessarily enhancing representation diversity. To break the joint
optimization, we introduce a fully decoupled training strategy that learns
prototypes and encoders under separate objectives. Concretely, we model
prototypes as a Gaussian mixture updated with an online EM-style procedure,
independent of the encoder's loss. This simple yet principled decoupling
eliminates prototype collapse without explicit regularization and yields
consistently diverse prototypes and stronger downstream performance.

### [115] [There is No "apple" in Timeseries: Rethinking TSFM through the Lens of Invariance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20119)
*Arian Prabowo,Flora D. Salim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TS foundation models underperform lightweight baselines due to naive transfer from NLP/CV; progress requires principled, invariance-focused time-series dataset design that preserves temporal semantics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is no natural 'apple' concept in time series; web-scale, opportunistic data collection fails for TS. To achieve generalization and emergent behavior, we need to close the gap by designing time-series datasets that cover core invariances from first principles.

Method: Advocates constructing datasets that systematically span the space of time-series invariances while preserving temporal semantics and proposes building an ontology of invariances based on first principles.

Result: The work presents a theoretical design principle rather than empirical results, arguing that representational completeness via comprehensive invariance coverage is necessary for TSFMs to generalize and exhibit reasoning/emergent behavior.

Conclusion: Principled, invariance-aware dataset design—rooted in first-principles invariances—is essential for TSFMs to achieve robust generalization and emergent capabilities, rather than relying on opportunistic aggregation.

Abstract: Timeseries foundation models (TSFMs) have multiplied, yet lightweight
supervised baselines and even classical models often match them. We argue this
gap stems from the naive importation of NLP or CV pipelines. In language and
vision, large web-scale corpora densely capture human concepts i.e. there are
countless images and text of apples. In contrast, timeseries data is built to
complement the image and text modalities. There are no timeseries dataset that
contains the concept apple. As a result, the scrape-everything-online paradigm
fails for TS. We posit that progress demands a shift from opportunistic
aggregation to principled design: constructing datasets that systematically
span the space of invariance that preserve temporal semantics. To this end, we
suggest that the ontology of timeseries invariances should be built based on
first principles. Only by ensuring representational completeness through
invariance coverage can TSFMs achieve the aligned structure necessary for
generalisation, reasoning, and truly emergent behaviour.

### [116] [Understanding Mechanistic Role of Structural and Functional Connectivity in Tau Propagation Through Multi-Layer Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20148)
*Tingting Dan,Xinwei Huang,Jiaqi Ding,Yinggang Zheng,Guorong Wu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A multi-layer diffusion analysis reveals region-specific SC vs FC roles in tau spread in AD, with FC dominant early and SC later, aligned with gene expression and risk factors, validated in an independent cohort.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how large-scale brain connectivity shapes tau propagation in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and how interactions between structural connectivity (SC) and functional connectivity (FC) influence disease progression.

Method: Utilized longitudinal neuroimaging data and a multi-layer graph diffusion model to integrate SC and FC, identifying region-specific dominance of SC versus FC in tau spread, examining how dominance shifts over disease stages, and correlating patterns with AD-related gene expression and non-modifiable risk factors; replication in an independent AD cohort.

Result: Findings show that connectome architecture constrains tau propagation, with regionally asymmetric contributions: FC dominates tau spread in subcortical regions, the insula, and frontal/temporal cortices, while SC dominates in occipital, parietal, and limbic regions. The relative dominance shifts from FC in early AD to SC in later stages. Spatial patterns of SC- and FC-dominant regions align with expression of AD-associated genes involved in inflammation, apoptosis, and lysosomal function. Non-modifiable factors (e.g., APOE, sex) and biological mechanisms (e.g., amyloid) reshape propagation by shifting dominant routes between anatomical and functional pathways in a region-specific manner. Findings were validated in an independent AD cohort.

Conclusion: The study highlights that large-scale connectome architecture and its dynamic SC–FC interactions drive tau propagation in AD in a region- and stage-specific manner, linking molecular risk factors to network-level spread and reinforcing the validity of the multi-layer diffusion framework across cohorts.

Abstract: Emerging neuroimaging evidence shows that pathological tau proteins build up
along specific brain networks, suggesting that large-scale network architecture
plays a key role in the progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, how
structural connectivity (SC) and functional connectivity (FC) interact to
influence tau propagation remains unclear. Leveraging an unprecedented volume
of longitudinal neuroimaging data, we examine SC-FC interactions through a
multi-layer graph diffusion model. Beyond showing that connectome architecture
constrains tau spread, our model reveals a regionally asymmetric contribution
of SC and FC. Specifically, FC predominantly drives tau spread in subcortical
areas, the insula, frontal and temporal cortices, whereas SC plays a larger
role in occipital, parietal, and limbic regions. The relative dominance of SC
versus FC shifts over the course of disease, with FC generally prevailing in
early AD and SC becoming primary in later stages. Spatial patterns of SC- and
FC-dominant regions strongly align with the regional expression of
AD-associated genes involved in inflammation, apoptosis, and lysosomal
function, including CHUK (IKK-alpha), TMEM106B, MCL1, NOTCH1, and TH. In
parallel, other non-modifiable risk factors (e.g., APOE genotype, sex) and
biological mechanisms (e.g., amyloid deposition) selectively reshape tau
propagation by shifting dominant routes between anatomical and functional
pathways in a region-specific manner. Findings are validated in an independent
AD cohort.

### [117] [ADP-VRSGP: Decentralized Learning with Adaptive Differential Privacy via Variance-Reduced Stochastic Gradient Push](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20157)
*Xiaoming Wu,Teng Liu,Xin Wang,Ming Yang,Jiguo Yu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A decentralized learning method with adaptive differential privacy using a variance-reduced gradient push, which adaptively tunes noise and learning rate, uses progressive gradient fusion to speed convergence, and is robust to time-varying topologies, yielding improved performance with private, personalized guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fixed-variance noise in privacy-preserving decentralized learning degrades accuracy and efficiency. There is a need for adaptive privacy mechanisms that maintain performance while providing node-level privacy and stability across time-varying networks.

Method: Introduce ADP-VRSGP: adaptive differential privacy with variance-reduced stochastic gradient push. Key components include stepwise-decaying noise variance and learning rate, progressive gradient fusion using historical gradients, and decentralized push-sum/aggregation to accommodate time-varying communication topologies, along with theoretical convergence guarantees.

Result: The method achieves robust convergence with a properly chosen learning rate, improves training stability and speed, and outperforms existing baselines across several scenarios according to theoretical analysis and experiments.

Conclusion: ADP-VRSGP effectively addresses privacy-preserving decentralized learning challenges by combining adaptive noise, variance-reduced updates, and gradient fusion within a decentralized topology framework, yielding faster, more stable training with node-level privacy guarantees.

Abstract: Differential privacy is widely employed in decentralized learning to
safeguard sensitive data by introducing noise into model updates. However,
existing approaches that use fixed-variance noise often degrade model
performance and reduce training efficiency. To address these limitations, we
propose a novel approach called decentralized learning with adaptive
differential privacy via variance-reduced stochastic gradient push (ADP-VRSGP).
This method dynamically adjusts both the noise variance and the learning rate
using a stepwise-decaying schedule, which accelerates training and enhances
final model performance while providing node-level personalized privacy
guarantees. To counteract the slowed convergence caused by large-variance noise
in early iterations, we introduce a progressive gradient fusion strategy that
leverages historical gradients. Furthermore, ADP-VRSGP incorporates
decentralized push-sum and aggregation techniques, making it particularly
suitable for time-varying communication topologies. Through rigorous
theoretical analysis, we demonstrate that ADP-VRSGP achieves robust convergence
with an appropriate learning rate, significantly improving training stability
and speed. Experimental results validate that our method outperforms existing
baselines across multiple scenarios, highlighting its efficacy in addressing
the challenges of privacy-preserving decentralized learning.

### [118] [Empowering Targeted Neighborhood Search via Hyper Tour for Large-Scale TSP](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20169)
*Tongkai Lu,Shuai Ma,Chongyang Tao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HyperNS is a scalable TSP solver that uses clustering via sparse heatmaps and a hyper tour to guide initialization and optimization, reducing the search space and improving performance on large-scale instances.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neural-based TSP solvers struggle with memory limits of global representations and lack of strong global guidance, especially for large instances; there is a need for scalable initialization and efficient search navigation.

Method: Construct a sparse heatmap graph, cluster nodes into groups, abstract clusters as supernodes, generate a hyper tour to guide both initialization and optimization, and focus the search on hyper tour-relevant edges to prune the space.

Result: Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show HyperNS outperforms neural-based methods, especially on large instances, achieving a smaller gap to the optimal solution.

Conclusion: HyperNS demonstrates a scalable, effective approach for large-scale TSP by combining clustering, hyper tour guidance, and targeted neighborhood search; potential applicability to other large combinatorial problems.

Abstract: Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is a classic NP-hard problem that has
garnered significant attention from both academia and industry. While
neural-based methods have shown promise for solving TSPs, they still face
challenges in scaling to larger instances, particularly in memory constraints
associated with global heatmaps, edge weights, or access matrices, as well as
in generating high-quality initial solutions and insufficient global guidance
for efficiently navigating vast search spaces. To address these challenges, we
propose a Hyper Tour Guided Neighborhood Search (HyperNS) method for
large-scale TSP instances. Inspired by the ``clustering first, route second"
strategy, our approach initially divides the TSP instance into clusters using a
sparse heatmap graph and abstracts them as supernodes, followed by the
generation of a hyper tour to guide both the initialization and optimization
processes. This method reduces the search space by focusing on edges relevant
to the hyper tour, leading to more efficient and effective optimization.
Experimental results on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that
our approach outperforms existing neural-based methods, particularly in
handling larger-scale instances, offering a significant reduction in the gap to
the optimal solution.

*Dian Yu,Yulai Zhao,Kishan Panaganti,Linfeng Song,Haitao Mi,Dong Yu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RLEV introduces human-valued rewards into RL for LLMs, boosting value-weighted accuracy across models and algorithms, and enabling value-aware termination; robust to noisy value signals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Not all tasks are equally important; binary correctness rewards miss human priorities. We need a way to inject explicit human value signals into LLM optimization.

Method: Extend Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) by incorporating ground-truth value labels into the reward function (exam-style data). Evaluate across multiple RL algorithms and model scales; analyze value-weighted termination and gradient effects; perform ablations; test robustness to noisy value signals.

Result: RLEV outperforms correctness-only baselines in value-weighted accuracy across settings; learns a termination policy that is concise for low-value prompts and thorough for high-value ones; ablations show this is causally linked to value alignment; robust to noisy value signals.

Conclusion: Optimizing with explicit utility functions provides a practical path to aligning LLMs with human priorities; RLEV demonstrates effective and robust value-aligned RL for LLMs.

Abstract: We propose Reinforcement Learning with Explicit Human Values (RLEV), a method
that aligns Large Language Model (LLM) optimization directly with quantifiable
human value signals. While Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards
(RLVR) effectively trains models in objective domains using binary correctness
rewards, it overlooks that not all tasks are equally significant. RLEV extends
this framework by incorporating human-defined value signals directly into the
reward function. Using exam-style data with explicit ground-truth value labels,
RLEV consistently outperforms correctness-only baselines across multiple RL
algorithms and model scales. Crucially, RLEV policies not only improve
value-weighted accuracy but also learn a value-sensitive termination policy:
concise for low-value prompts, thorough for high-value ones. We demonstrate
this behavior stems from value-weighted gradient amplification on
end-of-sequence tokens. Ablation studies confirm the gain is causally linked to
value alignment. RLEV remains robust under noisy value signals, such as
difficulty-based labels, demonstrating that optimizing for an explicit utility
function offers a practical path to aligning LLMs with human priorities.

*Jane H. Lee,Baturay Saglam,Spyridon Pougkakiotis,Amin Karbasi,Dionysis Kalogerias*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a risk-aware constrained RL framework using optimized certainty equivalents (OCEs); achieves per-stage robustness, exact duality, and a PPO-wrapped algorithm with convergence guarantees and empirical validation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional constrained RL optimizes expected rewards and ignores tail risk; high-stakes scenarios require accounting for risk of extreme outcomes.

Method: Uses optimized certainty equivalents to model risk in per-step rewards and constraints; develops a parameterized strong Lagrangian duality framework; derives an algorithm that can wrap standard RL solvers (e.g., PPO); proves convergence under standard assumptions.

Result: Establishes exact equivalence to the original constrained problem under appropriate constraint qualifications; provides a practical algorithm; demonstrates convergence and risk-aware behavior via numerical experiments.

Conclusion: Framework enables risk-aware constrained RL with per-stage robustness, offers plug-in compatibility with existing RL solvers, and is supported by convergence guarantees and empirical validation.

Abstract: Constrained optimization provides a common framework for dealing with
conflicting objectives in reinforcement learning (RL). In most of these
settings, the objectives (and constraints) are expressed though the expected
accumulated reward. However, this formulation neglects risky or even possibly
catastrophic events at the tails of the reward distribution, and is often
insufficient for high-stakes applications in which the risk involved in
outliers is critical. In this work, we propose a framework for risk-aware
constrained RL, which exhibits per-stage robustness properties jointly in
reward values and time using optimized certainty equivalents (OCEs). Our
framework ensures an exact equivalent to the original constrained problem
within a parameterized strong Lagrangian duality framework under appropriate
constraint qualifications, and yields a simple algorithmic recipe which can be
wrapped around standard RL solvers, such as PPO. Lastly, we establish the
convergence of the proposed algorithm under common assumptions, and verify the
risk-aware properties of our approach through several numerical experiments.

### [121] [Approximate Replicability in Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20200)
*Max Hopkins,Russell Impagliazzo,Christopher Ye*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Three relaxations of replicability in PAC learning enable sample-optimal agnostic learners. Pointwise and Approximate relaxations achieve teaching with Θ(d/α^2) samples; the Semi relaxation with shared unlabeled data needs Θ(d^2/α^2) labeled samples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Replicability requires algorithms to be stable under input resampling with shared randomness. While appealing, it is known to be too strong (e.g., no replicable algorithm for threshold learning). The paper investigates what approximate notions of replicability still allow learning.

Method: Introduce three natural relaxations of replicability in the PAC setting: (1) Pointwise—consistency on a fixed input but not uniformly across inputs; (2) Approximate—consistency on most of the distribution; (3) Semi—fully replicable but augmented with shared unlabeled samples. For constant replication parameters, construct agnostic PAC learners and analyze sample complexity.

Result: For constant replicability parameters, the paper achieves sample-optimal agnostic PAC learners: (1) and (2) with Θ(d/α^2) samples (effectively free of additional cost), (3) with Θ(d^2/α^2) labeled samples.

Conclusion: Three natural relaxations of replicability restore learnability in the PAC framework, with clear trade-offs in sample complexity. Pointwise and Approximate offer low sample costs, while Semi incurs higher labeled-sample cost due to requiring full replicability plus unlabeled data. This establishes a spectrum between stability and efficiency and invites further study on constants, other concept classes, and practical algorithm design.

Abstract: Replicability, introduced by (Impagliazzo et al. STOC '22), is the notion
that algorithms should remain stable under a resampling of their inputs (given
access to shared randomness). While a strong and interesting notion of
stability, the cost of replicability can be prohibitive: there is no replicable
algorithm, for instance, for tasks as simple as threshold learning (Bun et al.
STOC '23). Given such strong impossibility results we ask: under what
approximate notions of replicability is learning possible?
  In this work, we propose three natural relaxations of replicability in the
context of PAC learning: (1) Pointwise: the learner must be consistent on any
fixed input, but not across all inputs simultaneously, (2) Approximate: the
learner must output hypotheses that classify most of the distribution
consistently, (3) Semi: the algorithm is fully replicable, but may additionally
use shared unlabeled samples. In all three cases, for constant replicability
parameters, we obtain sample-optimal agnostic PAC learners: (1) and (2) are
achievable for ``free" using $\Theta(d/\alpha^2)$ samples, while (3) requires
$\Theta(d^2/\alpha^2)$ labeled samples.

*Shumin Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A large benchmark shows routine canine lab data can detect cancer signals, but clinical discrimination is weak and multimodal data are needed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need for accessible, low-cost screening tools for early cancer detection in dogs. Routine laboratory data may offer a signal, but non-specific biomarkers and class imbalance hinder performance. This study benchmarks predictive capability under real-world constraints and seeks to identify limitations.

Method: Systematic benchmarking of 126 analytical pipelines combining machine learning models, feature selection methods, and data balancing techniques. Data from the Golden Retriever Lifetime Study (GRLS) cohort. Partitioned at the patient level to prevent leakage. Investigated grouping of diverse cancer types and inclusion of post-diagnosis samples. Evaluated via AUROC, F1-score, PPV, NPV, and recall. Interpretability assessed with SHAP. The best model was Logistic Regression with class weighting and recursive feature elimination.

Result: Best AUROC 0.815 (95% CI 0.793–0.836); F1-score 0.25; PPV 0.15; NPV 0.98; recall 0.79. The optimal model used logistic regression with class weighting and recursive feature elimination. SHAP indicated predictions were driven by non-specific features such as age and markers of inflammation and anemia, suggesting limited clinical discrimination beyond aging/inflammation. The study reveals a detectable cancer signal in routine data but insufficient strength/confounding for reliable rule-out discrimination.

Conclusion: There exists a statistical cancer signal in routine canine lab data, but it is too weak and confounded for reliable clinical separation from aging or inflammatory conditions. This establishes a performance ceiling for this data modality and indicates progress in veterinary oncology will require integration of multi-modal data sources.

Abstract: The development of accessible screening tools for early cancer detection in
dogs represents a significant challenge in veterinary medicine. Routine
laboratory data offer a promising, low-cost source for such tools, but their
utility is hampered by the non-specificity of individual biomarkers and the
severe class imbalance inherent in screening populations. This study assesses
the feasibility of cancer risk classification using the Golden Retriever
Lifetime Study (GRLS) cohort under real-world constraints, including the
grouping of diverse cancer types and the inclusion of post-diagnosis samples. A
comprehensive benchmark evaluation was conducted, systematically comparing 126
analytical pipelines that comprised various machine learning models, feature
selection methods, and data balancing techniques. Data were partitioned at the
patient level to prevent leakage. The optimal model, a Logistic Regression
classifier with class weighting and recursive feature elimination, demonstrated
moderate ranking ability (AUROC = 0.815; 95% CI: 0.793-0.836) but poor clinical
classification performance (F1-score = 0.25, Positive Predictive Value = 0.15).
While a high Negative Predictive Value (0.98) was achieved, insufficient recall
(0.79) precludes its use as a reliable rule-out test. Interpretability analysis
with SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) revealed that predictions were driven
by non-specific features like age and markers of inflammation and anemia. It is
concluded that while a statistically detectable cancer signal exists in routine
lab data, it is too weak and confounded for clinically reliable discrimination
from normal aging or other inflammatory conditions. This work establishes a
critical performance ceiling for this data modality in isolation and
underscores that meaningful progress in computational veterinary oncology will
require integration of multi-modal data sources.

*Ke Xing,Yanjie Dong,Xiaoyi Fan,Runhao Zeng,Victor C. M. Leung,M. Jamal Deen,Xiping Hu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CO-PFL introduces Contribution-Oriented Federated Learning that dynamically weights client updates by estimated contribution using gradient and data subspaces, with parameter-wise personalization and mask-aware momentum, improving personalization accuracy, robustness, scalability, and convergence on benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address heterogeneity and data scarcity in federated learning. Traditional global aggregation assumes equal contribution and often weights by data volume, leading to suboptimal personalization and aggregation bias.

Method: CO-PFL jointly assesses client contribution by analyzing gradient direction discrepancies and prediction deviations, leveraging gradient and data subspaces to compute discriminative aggregation weights. It also integrates parameter-wise personalization with mask-aware momentum optimization to adapt submodels and stabilize updates.

Result: Empirical evaluation on CIFAR10, CIFAR10C, CINIC10, and Mini-ImageNet shows that CO-PFL consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in personalization accuracy, robustness, scalability, and convergence stability.

Conclusion: CO-PFL mitigates aggregation bias, strengthens global coordination, and enhances local performance by enabling tailored submodels with stable updates under heterogeneous data distributions.

Abstract: Personalized federated learning (PFL) addresses a critical challenge of
collaboratively training customized models for clients with heterogeneous and
scarce local data. Conventional federated learning, which relies on a single
consensus model, proves inadequate under such data heterogeneity. Its standard
aggregation method of weighting client updates heuristically or by data volume,
operates under an equal-contribution assumption, failing to account for the
actual utility and reliability of each client's update. This often results in
suboptimal personalization and aggregation bias. To overcome these limitations,
we introduce Contribution-Oriented PFL (CO-PFL), a novel algorithm that
dynamically estimates each client's contribution for global aggregation. CO-PFL
performs a joint assessment by analyzing both gradient direction discrepancies
and prediction deviations, leveraging information from gradient and data
subspaces. This dual-subspace analysis provides a principled and discriminative
aggregation weight for each client, emphasizing high-quality updates.
Furthermore, to bolster personalization adaptability and optimization
stability, CO-PFL cohesively integrates a parameter-wise personalization
mechanism with mask-aware momentum optimization. Our approach effectively
mitigates aggregation bias, strengthens global coordination, and enhances local
performance by facilitating the construction of tailored submodels with stable
updates. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets (CIFAR10, CIFAR10C,
CINIC10, and Mini-ImageNet) confirm that CO-PFL consistently surpasses
state-of-the-art methods in in personalization accuracy, robustness,
scalability and convergence stability.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Fair-SMW: a faster spectral clustering method that enforces group fairness (balance) via a Lagrangian reformulation and Sherman-Morrison-Woodbury; explores three Laplacian variants for spectral gaps; shows ~2x speedup and potential for ~2x more balance on real networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce the computational burden of enforcing group fairness constraints in spectral clustering, specifically balance, while maintaining competitive balance and solution quality.

Method: Reformulates the constrained optimization using a Lagrangian framework and the Sherman-Morrison-Woodbury identity. Introduces Fair-SMW with three Laplacian variants (different spectral gaps) to generate multiple solutions. Evaluates on SBM for runtime and balance; tests on real networks (LastFM, FacebookNet, Deezer, German).

Result: Fair-SMW achieves approximately 2x faster runtimes than state-of-the-art methods and can obtain up to 2x greater balance on the tested datasets; maintains balance comparable to existing algorithms.

Conclusion: Fair-SMW offers an efficient, flexible approach to fairness-aware spectral clustering, delivering strong balance performance with significant runtime gains, validating the utility of SMW-based reformulations for constrained clustering.

Abstract: Recent research has focused on mitigating algorithmic bias in clustering by
incorporating fairness constraints into algorithmic design. Notions such as
disparate impact, community cohesion, and cost per population have been
implemented to enforce equitable outcomes. Among these, group fairness
(balance) ensures that each protected group is proportionally represented
within every cluster. However, incorporating balance as a metric of fairness
into spectral clustering algorithms has led to computational times that can be
improved. This study aims to enhance the efficiency of spectral clustering
algorithms by reformulating the constrained optimization problem using a new
formulation derived from the Lagrangian method and the
Sherman-Morrison-Woodbury (SMW) identity, resulting in the Fair-SMW algorithm.
Fair-SMW employs three alternatives to the Laplacian matrix with different
spectral gaps to generate multiple variations of Fair-SMW, achieving clustering
solutions with comparable balance to existing algorithms while offering
improved runtime performance. We present the results of Fair-SMW, evaluated
using the Stochastic Block Model (SBM) to measure both runtime efficiency and
balance across real-world network datasets, including LastFM, FacebookNet,
Deezer, and German. We achieve an improvement in computation time that is twice
as fast as the state-of-the-art, and also flexible enough to achieve twice as
much balance.

### [125] [QKCV Attention: Enhancing Time Series Forecasting with Static Categorical Embeddings for Both Lightweight and Pre-trained Foundation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20222)
*Hao Wang,Baojun Ma*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Extends QKV attention with a static categorical embedding C (QKCV) to encode category-specific information, boosting forecasting accuracy across attention-based TS models and enabling efficient fine-tuning by updating only C while keeping pretrained weights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world time series display strong category patterns; standard QKV attention may ignore category-specific signals. A lightweight, plug-in embedding that injects category information could improve accuracy and enable resource-efficient fine-tuning.

Method: Introduce a QKCV module that augments QKV attention with a static category embedding C. Treat it as a plug-in compatible with Vanilla Transformer, Informer, PatchTST, TFT. Demonstrate that, during fine-tuning, updating only C (keeping pretrained weights) yields better performance with reduced compute.

Result: QKCV improves forecasting accuracy across diverse real-world datasets and model families. It also enables effective univariate TS foundation model fine-tuning by updating only the static embedding, reducing computational overhead while achieving superior performance.

Conclusion: QKCV is a versatile, effective plug-in for attention-based time series forecasting that leverages category information to enhance accuracy and enable efficient fine-tuning.

Abstract: In real-world time series forecasting tasks, category information plays a
pivotal role in capturing inherent data patterns. This paper introduces QKCV
(Query-Key-Category-Value) attention, an extension of the traditional QKV
framework that incorporates a static categorical embedding C to emphasize
category-specific information. As a versatile plug-in module, QKCV enhances the
forecasting accuracy of attention-based models (e.g., Vanilla Transformer,
Informer, PatchTST, TFT) across diverse real-world datasets. Furthermore, QKCV
demonstrates remarkable adaptability in fine-tuning univariate time series
foundation model by solely updating the static embedding C while preserving
pretrained weights, thereby reducing computational overhead and achieving
superior fine-tuning performance.

### [126] [Federated Learning via Meta-Variational Dropout](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20225)
*Insu Jeon,Minui Hong,Junhyeog Yun,Gunhee Kim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MetaVD is a Bayesian meta-learning approach for Federated Learning that uses a shared hypernetwork to predict client-specific dropout rates (meta-variational dropout), enabling personalized models in limited, non-IID data settings; it improves accuracy and uncertainty calibration (especially for OOD clients) while compressing local parameters to reduce overfitting and communication costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Federated Learning models suffer from overfitting and divergent local models when client data are limited and non-IID. There is a need for personalizing models to each client and for reliable uncertainty estimates, while also reducing communication overhead.

Method: Meta-variational dropout (MetaVD) uses a shared hypernetwork to predict client-dependent dropout rates. This enables per-client personalization by conditioning dropout on the client. The approach emphasizes the posterior adaptation view of meta-learning and the posterior aggregation view of Bayesian FL via the conditional dropout posterior. It also achieves parameter compression to mitigate overfitting and communication costs.

Result: Experiments on sparse and non-IID FL datasets show MetaVD achieves excellent classification accuracy and uncertainty calibration, particularly for out-of-distribution (OOD) clients, and reduces the amount of local parameters needed per client, thereby lowering communication costs.

Conclusion: MetaVD provides effective personalization for FL under limited non-IID data, with improved accuracy, better uncertainty calibration for OOD clients, and reduced communication overhead; a codebase is available for replication.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) aims to train a global inference model from remotely
distributed clients, gaining popularity due to its benefit of improving data
privacy. However, traditional FL often faces challenges in practical
applications, including model overfitting and divergent local models due to
limited and non-IID data among clients. To address these issues, we introduce a
novel Bayesian meta-learning approach called meta-variational dropout (MetaVD).
MetaVD learns to predict client-dependent dropout rates via a shared
hypernetwork, enabling effective model personalization of FL algorithms in
limited non-IID data settings. We also emphasize the posterior adaptation view
of meta-learning and the posterior aggregation view of Bayesian FL via the
conditional dropout posterior. We conducted extensive experiments on various
sparse and non-IID FL datasets. MetaVD demonstrated excellent classification
accuracy and uncertainty calibration performance, especially for
out-of-distribution (OOD) clients. MetaVD compresses the local model parameters
needed for each client, mitigating model overfitting and reducing communication
costs. Code is available at https://github.com/insujeon/MetaVD.

### [127] [Sparse Local Implicit Image Function for sub-km Weather Downscaling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20228)
*Yago del Valle Inclan Redondo,Enrique Arriaga-Varela,Dmitry Lyamzin,Pablo Cervantes,Tiago Ramalho*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SpLIIF adopts implicit neural representations to enable arbitrary downscaling of weather fields; trained on sparse stations and topography over Japan; outperforms interpolation and CorrDiff in predicting temperature and wind, with up to ~50% gains for temperature and 10–20% for wind.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Downgridding/downscaling weather variables from sparse observations is challenging; conventional interpolation and diffusion priors (e.g., CorrDiff) struggle with out-of-distribution generalization. Implicit neural representations can model high-resolution fields conditional on arbitrary coordinates and auxiliary data (topography) to improve accuracy and generalization.

Method: Train SpLIIF, an INR-based model, on sparse weather stations and topographic features over Japan. Evaluate both in-distribution and out-of-distribution accuracy for temperature and wind; compare against a simple interpolation baseline and CorrDiff. Allow arbitrary downscaling resolution at inference.

Result: The model achieves up to ~50% better performance than CorrDiff and the baseline for temperature downscaling, and ~10–20% better performance for wind.

Conclusion: SpLIIF demonstrates that implicit neural representations can effectively enable high-quality, arbitrarily scalable downscaling of weather variables from sparse data, with superior generalization relative to interpolation and CorrDiff, especially for temperature.

Abstract: We introduce SpLIIF to generate implicit neural representations and enable
arbitrary downscaling of weather variables. We train a model from sparse
weather stations and topography over Japan and evaluate in- and
out-of-distribution accuracy predicting temperature and wind, comparing it to
both an interpolation baseline and CorrDiff. We find the model to be up to 50%
better than both CorrDiff and the baseline at downscaling temperature, and
around 10-20% better for wind.

*Woohyeon Byeon,Giseung Park,Jongseong Chae,Amir Leshem,Youngchul Sung*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a provably convergent, practical MORL framework for max-min objectives via a regularized two-player zero-sum game solved by mirror descent, with theoretical guarantees and adaptive regularization; demonstrates strong empirical performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the challenge of stable, convergent optimization in multi-objective RL under a max-min criterion, by casting MORL as a two-player game and providing convergence guarantees and practical algorithms.

Method: Reformulates max-min MORL as a two-player zero-sum regularized continuous game and solves it with a mirror-descent-based algorithm. The approach yields a simple policy update, guarantees global last-iterate convergence, and includes adaptive regularization. Theoretical analysis covers iteration and sample complexity under exact/approximately evaluated policies.

Result: The algorithm achieves global last-iterate convergence. It provides iteration and sample complexity bounds and shows that adaptive regularization enhances performance. Empirical results demonstrate convergence in tabular settings and superior performance of the deep-RL implementation over prior baselines across multiple MORL environments.

Conclusion: The work delivers a provably convergent, practical MORL framework for max-min objectives with a simple policy update, robust theoretical guarantees, and empirical effectiveness, including benefits from adaptive regularization and scalability to deep RL.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a provably convergent and practical framework for
multi-objective reinforcement learning with max-min criterion. From a
game-theoretic perspective, we reformulate max-min multi-objective
reinforcement learning as a two-player zero-sum regularized continuous game and
introduce an efficient algorithm based on mirror descent. Our approach
simplifies the policy update while ensuring global last-iterate convergence. We
provide a comprehensive theoretical analysis on our algorithm, including
iteration complexity under both exact and approximate policy evaluations, as
well as sample complexity bounds. To further enhance performance, we modify the
proposed algorithm with adaptive regularization. Our experiments demonstrate
the convergence behavior of the proposed algorithm in tabular settings, and our
implementation for deep reinforcement learning significantly outperforms
previous baselines in many MORL environments.

### [129] [Layer-to-Layer Knowledge Mixing in Graph Neural Network for Chemical Property Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20236)
*Teng Jiek See,Daokun Zhang,Mario Boley,David K. Chalmers*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Layer-to-Layer Knowledge Mixing (LKM) is a self-knowledge distillation approach for GNNs that aligns hidden embeddings across layers to fuse multi-hop information, boosting molecular property predictions with minimal overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GNNs improve with larger, more complex models but incur higher training/inference costs. There is a need for more accurate chemical property predictions without substantial computational overhead.

Method: LKM minimizes the mean absolute distance between hidden embeddings of different GNN layers (self-distillation). This encourages cross-layer information sharing and effectively aggregates multi-hop/multi-scale representations without adding significant computational cost. Evaluated on three GNN architectures (DimeNet++, MXMNet, PAMNet) and datasets (QM9, MD17, Chignolin).

Result: LKM reduces prediction errors by up to 9.8% on QM9, 45.3% on MD17 Energy, and 22.9% on Chignolin, demonstrating significant accuracy gains with negligible increases in training and inference cost.

Conclusion: LKM is a practical and effective self-knowledge distillation method for GNNs in chemical property prediction, improving accuracy without substantially increasing computation or memory requirements.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are the currently most effective methods for
predicting molecular properties but there remains a need for more accurate
models. GNN accuracy can be improved by increasing the model complexity but
this also increases the computational cost and memory requirement during
training and inference. In this study, we develop Layer-to-Layer Knowledge
Mixing (LKM), a novel self-knowledge distillation method that increases the
accuracy of state-of-the-art GNNs while adding negligible computational
complexity during training and inference. By minimizing the mean absolute
distance between pre-existing hidden embeddings of GNN layers, LKM efficiently
aggregates multi-hop and multi-scale information, enabling improved
representation of both local and global molecular features. We evaluated LKM
using three diverse GNN architectures (DimeNet++, MXMNet, and PAMNet) using
datasets of quantum chemical properties (QM9, MD17 and Chignolin). We found
that the LKM method effectively reduces the mean absolute error of quantum
chemical and biophysical property predictions by up to 9.8% (QM9), 45.3% (MD17
Energy), and 22.9% (Chignolin). This work demonstrates the potential of LKM to
significantly improve the accuracy of GNNs for chemical property prediction
without any substantial increase in training and inference cost.

### [130] [What Does It Take to Build a Performant Selective Classifier?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20242)
*Stephan Rabanser,Nicolas Papernot*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper defines the selective-classification gap, decomposes it into five sources (Bayes noise, approximation error, ranking error, statistical noise, and shift-induced slack), and shows that scoring/ranking quality—not simple calibration—drives performance toward an ideal oracle. It validates with synthetic and real data and provides practical guidelines to improve score ordering and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why selective classifiers fall short of a perfect-ordering oracle and to quantify the sources of error, enabling targeted improvements and principled design of abstention mechanisms.

Method: Finite-sample decomposition of the gap into five components; theoretical framing of Bayes noise, approximation error, ranking error, statistical noise, and shift-induced slack; analysis of monotone post-hoc calibration; controlled experiments on synthetic (two-moons) and real-world vision/lang benchmarks to isolate each component.

Result: Findings show that Bayes noise and limited model capacity explain substantial portions of the gap; monotone calibration rarely improves score ordering; richer, feature-aware calibrators that reorder predictions meaningfully reduce the gap; data shift introduces a separate slack requiring distributionally robust training; the work provides a quantitative error budget and actionable design guidelines.

Conclusion: Bringing selective classifiers closer to ideal oracle behavior requires scoring mechanisms that can effectively reorder predictions rather than only rescale them, along with robust training strategies to handle data shift. The decomposition offers actionable guidance for practitioners to design more reliable abstention-based systems.

Abstract: Selective classifiers improve model reliability by abstaining on inputs the
model deems uncertain. However, few practical approaches achieve the
gold-standard performance of a perfect-ordering oracle that accepts examples
exactly in order of correctness. Our work formalizes this shortfall as the
selective-classification gap and present the first finite-sample decomposition
of this gap to five distinct sources of looseness: Bayes noise, approximation
error, ranking error, statistical noise, and implementation- or shift-induced
slack. Crucially, our analysis reveals that monotone post-hoc calibration --
often believed to strengthen selective classifiers -- has limited impact on
closing this gap, since it rarely alters the model's underlying score ranking.
Bridging the gap therefore requires scoring mechanisms that can effectively
reorder predictions rather than merely rescale them. We validate our
decomposition on synthetic two-moons data and on real-world vision and language
benchmarks, isolating each error component through controlled experiments. Our
results confirm that (i) Bayes noise and limited model capacity can account for
substantial gaps, (ii) only richer, feature-aware calibrators meaningfully
improve score ordering, and (iii) data shift introduces a separate slack that
demands distributionally robust training. Together, our decomposition yields a
quantitative error budget as well as actionable design guidelines that
practitioners can use to build selective classifiers which approximate ideal
oracle behavior more closely.

### [131] [FedGPS: Statistical Rectification Against Data Heterogeneity in Federated Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20250)
*Zhiqin Yang,Yonggang Zhang,Chenxin Li,Yiu-ming Cheung,Bo Han,Yixuan Yuan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FedGPS improves robustness to data heterogeneity in federated learning by integrating global distribution surrogate information and cross-client gradients; it outperforms state-of-the-art methods across heterogeneous scenarios and is open-sourced.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Data heterogeneity hurts FL performance and convergence; existing methods often lack robustness across diverse heterogeneity settings; leveraging shared statistical information can help align client updates with a global perspective.

Method: FedGPS statically modifies each client's objective to implicitly model the global data distribution using surrogate information, and dynamically adjusts local update directions with gradient information from other clients at each round.

Result: Extensive experiments show FedGPS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods across diverse heterogeneity scenarios, demonstrating effectiveness and robustness.

Conclusion: FedGPS is an effective and robust framework for FL under data heterogeneity; code is available at the provided GitHub URL.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) confronts a significant challenge known as data
heterogeneity, which impairs model performance and convergence. Existing
methods have made notable progress in addressing this issue. However, improving
performance in certain heterogeneity scenarios remains an overlooked question:
\textit{How robust are these methods to deploy under diverse heterogeneity
scenarios?} To answer this, we conduct comprehensive evaluations across varied
heterogeneity scenarios, showing that most existing methods exhibit limited
robustness. Meanwhile, insights from these experiments highlight that sharing
statistical information can mitigate heterogeneity by enabling clients to
update with a global perspective. Motivated by this, we propose \textbf{FedGPS}
(\textbf{Fed}erated \textbf{G}oal-\textbf{P}ath \textbf{S}ynergy), a novel
framework that seamlessly integrates statistical distribution and gradient
information from others. Specifically, FedGPS statically modifies each client's
learning objective to implicitly model the global data distribution using
surrogate information, while dynamically adjusting local update directions with
gradient information from other clients at each round. Extensive experiments
show that FedGPS outperforms state-of-the-art methods across diverse
heterogeneity scenarios, validating its effectiveness and robustness. The code

### [132] [Optimistic Task Inference for Behavior Foundation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20264)
*Thomas Rupf,Marco Bagatella,Marin Vlastelica,Andreas Krause*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: OpTI-BFM introduces an optimistic data-collection criterion that models uncertainty over reward functions to guide task inference for Behavior Foundation Models (BFMs). It provides a regret bound linking to linear bandits and shows empirically that few episodes with minimal compute suffice to identify and optimize unseen rewards; code available.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: BFMs excel at zero-shot policy retrieval but typically require non-negligible reward evaluations or labeled data to infer tasks. This work aims to reduce data requirements by enabling task inference through test-time interaction, making BFMs more data-efficient in practice.

Method: Introduce OpTI-BFM, an optimistic decision criterion that models uncertainty over reward functions and uses it to guide environment data collection during task inference. The authors connect the method to upper-confidence bounds for linear bandits, derive a regret bound for well-trained BFMs, and apply the approach to successor-features-based BFMs to collect informative data with minimal compute.

Result: Empirical evaluation on standard zero-shot RL benchmarks shows that OpTI-BFM enables successor-features-based BFMs to identify and optimize unseen reward functions within a handful of episodes, with minimal compute overhead. Code is released at the provided GitHub link.

Conclusion: OpTI-BFM offers a theoretically grounded and practically efficient solution for test-time task inference in BFMs, reducing data requirements while preserving or enhancing zero-shot RL performance.

Abstract: Behavior Foundation Models (BFMs) are capable of retrieving high-performing
policy for any reward function specified directly at test-time, commonly
referred to as zero-shot reinforcement learning (RL). While this is a very
efficient process in terms of compute, it can be less so in terms of data: as a
standard assumption, BFMs require computing rewards over a non-negligible
inference dataset, assuming either access to a functional form of rewards, or
significant labeling efforts. To alleviate these limitations, we tackle the
problem of task inference purely through interaction with the environment at
test-time. We propose OpTI-BFM, an optimistic decision criterion that directly
models uncertainty over reward functions and guides BFMs in data collection for
task inference. Formally, we provide a regret bound for well-trained BFMs
through a direct connection to upper-confidence algorithms for linear bandits.
Empirically, we evaluate OpTI-BFM on established zero-shot benchmarks, and
observe that it enables successor-features-based BFMs to identify and optimize
an unseen reward function in a handful of episodes with minimal compute
overhead. Code is available at https://github.com/ThomasRupf/opti-bfm.

### [133] [ImpossibleBench: Measuring LLMs' Propensity of Exploiting Test Cases](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20270)
*Ziqian Zhong,Aditi Raghunathan,Nicholas Carlini*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ImpossibleBench is a benchmark framework that measures LLM agents' propensity to exploit unit tests by creating impossible task variants; the pass rate on these variants is the cheating rate, revealing reliance on shortcuts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address risks that LLMs exploit shortcuts (e.g., deleting failing tests) which undermines benchmark validity and real-world reliability; a need for reliable assessment and mitigation of such behavior.

Method: Create impossible task variants by introducing conflicts between natural-language specs and unit tests; quantify cheating via pass rate; study effects of prompts, test access, and feedback loops; demonstrate utility for behavior analysis, context engineering, and monitoring.

Result: A versatile evaluation framework with a testbed that uncovers cheating behaviors, clarifies how context affects cheating, and provides tools for monitoring, with implementation available at a public repository.

Conclusion: ImpossibleBench offers a practical path toward building more robust and reliable LLM systems by systematically studying and mitigating deceptive shortcuts.

Abstract: The tendency to find and exploit "shortcuts" to complete tasks poses
significant risks for reliable assessment and deployment of large language
models (LLMs). For example, an LLM agent with access to unit tests may delete
failing tests rather than fix the underlying bug. Such behavior undermines both
the validity of benchmark results and the reliability of real-world LLM coding
assistant deployments.
  To quantify, study, and mitigate such behavior, we introduce ImpossibleBench,
a benchmark framework that systematically measures LLM agents' propensity to
exploit test cases. ImpossibleBench creates "impossible" variants of tasks from
existing benchmarks like LiveCodeBench and SWE-bench by introducing direct
conflicts between the natural-language specification and the unit tests. We
measure an agent's "cheating rate" as its pass rate on these impossible tasks,
where any pass necessarily implies a specification-violating shortcut.
  As a practical framework, ImpossibleBench is not just an evaluation but a
versatile tool. We demonstrate its utility for: (1) studying model behaviors,
revealing more fine-grained details of cheating behaviors from simple test
modification to complex operator overloading; (2) context engineering, showing
how prompt, test access and feedback loop affect cheating rates; and (3)
developing monitoring tools, providing a testbed with verified deceptive
solutions. We hope ImpossibleBench serves as a useful framework for building
more robust and reliable LLM systems.

TL;DR: Efficiently compute the Euler Characteristic Curve on GPUs and integrate it into deep learning via a differentiable PyTorch layer, achieving large speedups and end-to-end trainability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Topological features capture global structure in imaging data, but practical use in deep learning requires both speed and differentiability; ECC offers global topology signals that are computationally heavy to compute with standard methods.

Method: Develop optimized CUDA kernels for ECC on Ampere GPUs with 128B-coalesced memory access and hierarchical shared-memory accumulation; implement a differentiable PyTorch layer that relaxes thresholds via a sigmoid-style Differentiable Euler Characteristic Transform, enabling end-to-end learning; discuss batch and multi-GPU extensions.

Result: Achieved 16-2000x speedups over prior GPU implementations on synthetic grids; created a differentiable PyTorch layer for end-to-end learning of ECC-based features; outlines practical considerations for adoption and extensions.

Conclusion: ECC-based topological features can be efficiently integrated into deep learning workflows; the work enables broader adoption through high-performance GPU kernels and differentiability, with potential downstream applications discussed and multi-GPU/batching considered.

Abstract: Topological features capture global geometric structure in imaging data, but
practical adoption in deep learning requires both computational efficiency and
differentiability. We present optimized GPU kernels for the Euler

use 128B-coalesced access and hierarchical shared-memory accumulation. Our
PyTorch layer learns thresholds in a single direction via a Differentiable
Euler Characteristic Transform-style sigmoid relaxation. We discuss downstream
relevance, including applications highlighted by prior ECC work, and outline
batching/multi-GPU extensions to broaden adoption.

### [135] [Limits of PRM-Guided Tree Search for Mathematical Reasoning with LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20272)
*Tristan Cinquin,Geoff Pleiss,Agustinus Kristiadi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PRM-guided tree search does not improve mathematical reasoning over Best-of-N; unreliable PRMs and depth-related degradation hinder performance; requires better reward modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Assess whether PRM-guided tree search can capture branching exploration in complex math problems and outperform linear chain-of-thought prompting.

Method: Propose an adaptive algorithm to maximize process reward model (PRM) scores over an intractable action space; evaluate PRM-guided tree search on 23 math problems using Qwen2.5-Math-7B-Instruct; compare BoN, Monte Carlo tree search, and beam search.

Result: PRM-guided tree search shows no statistically significant improvements over BoN despite higher computational costs; MCTS and beam search outperform other PRM-guided methods; PRMs poorly approximate state values and their reliability degrades with reasoning depth; PRMs generalize poorly out-of-distribution.

Conclusion: Under current PRM formulations, tree search is not effective for enhancing mathematical reasoning in LLMs; different reward modeling is needed before tree search can be beneficial.

Abstract: While chain-of-thought prompting with Best-of-N (BoN) selection has become
popular for mathematical reasoning in large language models (LLMs), its linear
structure fails to capture the branching and exploratory nature of complex
problem-solving. In this work, we propose an adaptive algorithm to maximize
process reward model (PRM) scores over the intractable action space, and
investigate whether PRM-guided tree search can improve mathematical reasoning
by exploring multiple partial solution paths. Across $23$ diverse mathematical
problems using Qwen2.5-Math-7B-Instruct with its associated PRM as a case
study, we find that: (1) PRM-guided tree search shows no statistically
significant improvements over BoN despite higher costs, (2) Monte Carlo tree
search and beam search outperform other PRM-guided tree search methods, (3)
PRMs poorly approximate state values and their reliability degrades with
reasoning depth, and (4) PRMs generalize poorly out of distribution. This
underperformance stems from tree search's greater reliance on unreliable PRM
scores, suggesting different reward modeling is necessary before tree search
can effectively enhance mathematical reasoning in LLMs.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SynTSBench offers an interpretable, synthetic-data-based framework to systematically evaluate time series models across pattern learning, robustness to irregularities, and theoretical optima, revealing gaps in current deep learning approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of explainability and robust benchmarking in time series forecasting caused by black-box DL models and inadequate evaluation metrics.

Method: Three analytical dimensions: (1) temporal feature decomposition and capability mapping; (2) robustness analysis under data irregularities; (3) theoretical optimum benchmarking. Programmable feature configurations isolate confounding factors.

Result: Experiments show current deep learning models do not universally approach optimal baselines across all temporal feature types.

Conclusion: SynTSBench provides an interpretable, open-source evaluation platform to better compare models and guide model selection for forecasting scenarios.

Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning have driven rapid progress in time series
forecasting, yet many state-of-the-art models continue to struggle with robust
performance in real-world applications, even when they achieve strong results
on standard benchmark datasets. This persistent gap can be attributed to the
black-box nature of deep learning architectures and the inherent limitations of
current evaluation frameworks, which frequently lack the capacity to provide
clear, quantitative insights into the specific strengths and weaknesses of
different models, thereby complicating the selection of appropriate models for
particular forecasting scenarios. To address these issues, we propose a
synthetic data-driven evaluation paradigm, SynTSBench, that systematically
assesses fundamental modeling capabilities of time series forecasting models
through programmable feature configuration. Our framework isolates confounding
factors and establishes an interpretable evaluation system with three core
analytical dimensions: (1) temporal feature decomposition and capability
mapping, which enables systematic evaluation of model capacities to learn
specific pattern types; (2) robustness analysis under data irregularities,
which quantifies noise tolerance thresholds and anomaly recovery capabilities;
and (3) theoretical optimum benchmarking, which establishes performance
boundaries for each pattern type-enabling direct comparison between model
predictions and mathematical optima. Our experiments show that current deep
learning models do not universally approach optimal baselines across all types
of temporal features.The code is available at

### [137] [KCM: KAN-Based Collaboration Models Enhance Pretrained Large Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20278)
*Guangyu Dai,Siliang Tang,Yueting Zhuang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A KAN-based collaborative model (KCM) for large-small model collaboration reduces large-model inference calls while maintaining accuracy, mitigates catastrophic forgetting and hallucinations, and outperforms MLP-based collaborators across language, vision, and vision-language tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address significant resource costs and performance degradation in large-small pretrained model collaboration, notably accuracy loss, catastrophic forgetting, and hallucinations from small models, while aiming to cut compute and improve domain-specific performance.

Method: Propose and evaluate a KAN-based collaborative model (KCM) as an alternative to MLP-based small models (MCM). Implement KCM across three scenario families (language, vision, and vision-language cross-modal tasks), compare against MCM, and assess large-model inference reduction, accuracy, and robustness to long-tail data.

Result: Empirical results show that KCM substantially reduces the number of large-model inferences while maintaining near-identical task accuracy; the KAN-based small collaborator mitigates catastrophic forgetting and improves long-tail data performance, outperforming MCM across all metrics in the tested domains.

Conclusion: KAN-based collaboration provides a more efficient and robust large-small model paradigm, delivering compute savings and accuracy gains with better interference control (less forgetting and hallucination) than MLP-based small models.

Abstract: In recent years, Pretrained Large Models(PLMs) researchers proposed
large-small model collaboration frameworks, leveraged easily trainable small
models to assist large models, aim to(1) significantly reduce computational
resource consumption while maintaining comparable accuracy, and (2) enhance
large model performance in specialized domain tasks. However, this
collaborative paradigm suffers from issues such as significant accuracy
degradation, exacerbated catastrophic forgetting, and amplified hallucination
problems induced by small model knowledge. To address these challenges, we
propose a KAN-based Collaborative Model (KCM) as an improved approach to
large-small model collaboration. The KAN utilized in KCM represents an
alternative neural network architecture distinct from conventional MLPs.
Compared to MLPs, KAN offers superior visualizability and interpretability
while mitigating catastrophic forgetting. We deployed KCM in large-small model
collaborative systems across three scenarios: language, vision, and
vision-language cross-modal tasks. The experimental results demonstrate that,
compared with pure large model approaches, the large-small model collaboration
framework utilizing KCM as the collaborative model significantly reduces the
number of large model inference calls while maintaining near-identical task
accuracy, thereby substantially lowering computational resource consumption.
Concurrently, the KAN-based small collaborative model markedly mitigates
catastrophic forgetting, leading to significant accuracy improvements for
long-tail data. The results reveal that KCM demonstrates superior performance
across all metrics compared to MLP-based small collaborative models (MCM).

*Penghao Wang,Yuhao Zhou,Mengxuan Wu,Ziheng Qin,Bangyuan Zhu,Shengbin Huang,Xuanlei Zhao,Panpan Zhang,Xiaojiang Peng,Yuzhang Shang,Jianfei Yang,Zheng Zhu,Tianlong Chen,Zhangyang Wang,Kai Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CS-54k/CS-4k/CS-50k provide a paper-grounded, RAG-based, high-quality CS dataset suite for end-to-end AI scientific research assistance; shows smaller, domain-aligned models can outperform larger proprietary ones; releases aim to foster reliable ResearchGPT-style collaboration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for end-to-end benchmarks of AI in scientific research and progress toward ResearchGPT; demanding high-quality, domain-specific data to train and evaluate AI as research assistants.

Method: Construct CS-54k (14k CC-licensed papers) via a scalable paper-grounded pipeline combining retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with multi-stage quality control; derive CS-4k (benchmark) and CS-50k (training data); evaluate SOTA models on CS-4k and train/open models on CS-50k with supervised and RL techniques.

Result: CS-4k distinguishes capability tiers among state-of-the-art LLMs; training open models on CS-50k with supervised + RL yields substantial gains; 7B-scale models can outperform larger proprietary systems such as GPT-4.1/4o and Gemini 2.5 Pro when properly trained on domain data.

Conclusion: Releasing CS-4k and CS-50k to foster AI systems as reliable researchers' collaborators in computer science; data quality and domain alignment can beat sheer scale for research-assistant performance.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) advance, the ultimate vision for their role
in science is emerging: we could build an AI collaborator to effectively assist
human beings throughout the entire scientific research process. We refer to
this envisioned system as ResearchGPT. Given that scientific research
progresses through multiple interdependent phases, achieving this vision
requires rigorous benchmarks that evaluate the end-to-end workflow rather than
isolated sub-tasks. To this end, we contribute CS-54k, a high-quality corpus of
scientific Q&A pairs in computer science, built from 14k CC-licensed papers. It
is constructed through a scalable, paper-grounded pipeline that combines
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with multi-stage quality control to ensure
factual grounding. From this unified corpus, we derive two complementary
subsets: CS-4k, a carefully curated benchmark for evaluating AI's ability to
assist scientific research, and CS-50k, a large-scale training dataset.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that CS-4k stratifies state-of-the-art LLMs
into distinct capability tiers. Open models trained on CS-50k with supervised
training and reinforcement learning demonstrate substantial improvements. Even
7B-scale models, when properly trained, outperform many larger proprietary
systems, such as GPT-4.1, GPT-4o, and Gemini 2.5 Pro. This indicates that
making AI models better research assistants relies more on domain-aligned
training with high-quality data than on pretraining scale or general benchmark
performance. We release CS-4k and CS-50k in the hope of fostering AI systems as
reliable collaborators in CS research.

### [139] [Quantifying Distributional Invariance in Causal Subgraph for IRM-Free Graph Generalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20295)
*Yang Qiu,Yixiong Zou,Jun Wang,Wei Liu,Xiangyu Fu,Ruixuan Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: An IRM-free framework for discovering causal subgraphs in GNNs under distribution shifts, using an Invariant Distribution Criterion and a norm-guided objective to improve out-of-distribution generalization, outperforming IRM-based methods on benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome IRM's reliance on environment annotations or synthetic splits for robust graph learning under distributional shifts, enabling IRM-free causal discovery and prediction.

Method: Introduce the Invariant Distribution Criterion; derive the link between distributional shift and representation norm; propose a norm-guided invariant distribution objective to uncover causal subgraphs and make predictions without IRM.

Result: Empirical evaluation on two standard graph-generalization benchmarks shows the proposed IRM-free method consistently surpasses state-of-the-art approaches.

Conclusion: IRM-free causal subgraph discovery via norm-guided invariant distribution objectives provides robust OOD generalization and deeper insight into how distributional shifts affect representations.

Abstract: Out-of-distribution generalization under distributional shifts remains a
critical challenge for graph neural networks. Existing methods generally adopt
the Invariant Risk Minimization (IRM) framework, requiring costly environment
annotations or heuristically generated synthetic splits. To circumvent these
limitations, in this work, we aim to develop an IRM-free method for capturing
causal subgraphs. We first identify that causal subgraphs exhibit substantially
smaller distributional variations than non-causal components across diverse
environments, which we formalize as the Invariant Distribution Criterion and
theoretically prove in this paper. Building on this criterion, we
systematically uncover the quantitative relationship between distributional
shift and representation norm for identifying the causal subgraph, and
investigate its underlying mechanisms in depth. Finally, we propose an IRM-free
method by introducing a norm-guided invariant distribution objective for causal
subgraph discovery and prediction. Extensive experiments on two widely used
benchmarks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in graph generalization.

*Saraf Anzum Shreya,MD. Abu Ismail Siddique,Sharaf Tasnim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DB-FGA-Net: a dual-backbone network (VGG16 + Xception) with a Frequency-Gated Attention block for augmentation-free brain tumor classification, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy on 7K-DS (4-class 99.24%, 3-class 98.68%, 2-class 99.85%) and good generalization on 3K-DS (95.77%), with Grad-CAM visualization and a GUI for real-time classification and localization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limited generalization and trust in augmentation-heavy deep learning models for brain tumor diagnosis, by proposing an augmentation-free, interpretable architecture that can generalize across variably sized datasets and provide clinical interpretability.

Method: A double-backbone network that fuses VGG16 and Xception, augmented with a Frequency-Gated Attention (FGA) Block to capture complementary local and global features. Does not rely on data augmentation. Grad-CAM is used for visualization. A GUI enables real-time classification and Grad-CAM-based localization.

Result: Achieves 99.24% accuracy on 7K-DS dataset for 4-class, 98.68% for 3-class, and 99.85% for 2-class. On independent 3K-DS dataset, achieves 95.77% accuracy, outperforming baselines and SOTA methods. Also demonstrates model interpretability via Grad-CAM and deployability via a GUI.

Conclusion: Augmentation-free, interpretable, and deployable DB-FGA-Net shows strong potential for reliable clinical translation in brain tumor diagnosis, with robust generalization and explainability features.

Abstract: Brain tumors are a challenging problem in neuro-oncology, where early and
precise diagnosis is important for successful treatment. Deep learning-based
brain tumor classification methods often rely on heavy data augmentation which
can limit generalization and trust in clinical applications. In this paper, we
propose a double-backbone network integrating VGG16 and Xception with a
Frequency-Gated Attention (FGA) Block to capture complementary local and global
features. Unlike previous studies, our model achieves state-of-the-art
performance without augmentation which demonstrates robustness to variably
sized and distributed datasets. For further transparency, Grad-CAM is
integrated to visualize the tumor regions based on which the model is giving
prediction, bridging the gap between model prediction and clinical
interpretability. The proposed framework achieves 99.24\% accuracy on the 7K-DS
dataset for the 4-class setting, along with 98.68\% and 99.85\% in the 3-class
and 2-class settings, respectively. On the independent 3K-DS dataset, the model
generalizes with 95.77\% accuracy, outperforming baseline and state-of-the-art
methods. To further support clinical usability, we developed a graphical user
interface (GUI) that provides real-time classification and Grad-CAM-based tumor
localization. These findings suggest that augmentation-free, interpretable, and
deployable deep learning models such as DB-FGA-Net hold strong potential for
reliable clinical translation in brain tumor diagnosis.

### [141] [InvDec: Inverted Decoder for Multivariate Time Series Forecasting with Separated Temporal and Variate Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20302)
*Yuhang Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: InvDec is a hybrid time-series model that separates temporal encoding from variate-level decoding using a patch-based temporal encoder and an inverted decoder with variate-wise self-attention; it introduces delayed variate embeddings and adaptive residual fusion, achieving large gains on high-dimensional datasets while remaining competitive on low-dimensional data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Channel-independent models capture temporal patterns but ignore cross-variable correlations, while variate-attention models capture cross-variable dependencies but can sacrifice temporal encoding. There is a need for a principled separation that preserves temporal integrity while enabling cross-variate modeling, particularly as the number of variables grows.

Method: InvDec combines a patch-based temporal encoder with an inverted decoder that operates on the variate dimension via variate-wise self-attention. Delayed variate embeddings enrich variable-specific representations only after temporal encoding to preserve temporal features. An adaptive residual fusion mechanism balances temporal and variate information across datasets with different dimensionalities. Instantiating InvDec with PatchTST yields InvDec-PatchTST.

Result: Across seven benchmarks, InvDec-PatchTST delivers notable improvements on high-dimensional datasets: 20.9% MSE reduction on Electricity (321 variables), 4.3% on Weather, and 2.7% on Traffic, while maintaining competitive performance on low-dimensional ETT datasets. Ablation studies confirm the contribution of each component, and analyses show InvDec’s advantage grows with dataset dimensionality, highlighting the importance of cross-variate modeling as variable count increases.

Conclusion: A principled separation of temporal encoding and variate-level decoding enables effective cross-variate modeling without compromising temporal information. The approach scales favorably with dimensionality, suggesting cross-variable dependencies become increasingly crucial for accurate multivariate time series forecasting.

Abstract: Multivariate time series forecasting requires simultaneously modeling
temporal patterns and cross-variate dependencies. Channel-independent methods
such as PatchTST excel at temporal modeling but ignore variable correlations,
while pure variate-attention approaches such as iTransformer sacrifice temporal
encoding. We proposeInvDec (Inverted Decoder), a hybrid architecture that
achieves principled separation between temporal encoding and variate-level
decoding. InvDec combines a patch-based temporal encoder with an inverted
decoder operating on the variate dimension through variate-wise self-attention.
We introduce delayed variate embeddings that enrich variable-specific
representations only after temporal encoding, preserving temporal feature
integrity. An adaptive residual fusion mechanism dynamically balances temporal
and variate information across datasets of varying dimensions. Instantiating
InvDec with PatchTST yields InvDec-PatchTST. Extensive experiments on seven
benchmarks demonstrate significant gains on high-dimensional datasets: 20.9%
MSE reduction on Electricity (321 variables), 4.3% improvement on Weather, and
2.7% gain on Traffic compared to PatchTST, while maintaining competitive
performance on low-dimensional ETT datasets. Ablation studies validate each
component, and analysis reveals that InvDec's advantage grows with dataset
dimensionality, confirming that cross-variate modeling becomes critical as the
number of variables increases.

### [142] [LEGO: A Lightweight and Efficient Multiple-Attribute Unlearning Framework for Recommender Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20327)
*Fengyuan Yu,Yuyuan Li,Xiaohua Feng,Junjie Fang,Tao Wang,Chaochao Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LEGO enables simultaneous multi-attribute unlearning in recommender systems with a two-step, parallelizable framework using mutual information minimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In real-world privacy, multiple sensitive attributes must be unlearned and adaptively managed; single-attribute methods cannot handle multiple or dynamic unlearning requests.

Method: Two-step process: (i) Embedding Calibration removes attribute-related information from user embeddings; (ii) Flexible Combination fuses calibrated embeddings into a single protected embedding. The learning objective minimizes mutual information to guarantee simultaneous unlearning and supports parallelization.

Result: Empirical results on three real-world datasets across three recommendation models demonstrate effectiveness and efficiency; code and appendix available.

Conclusion: LEGO offers theoretical guarantees for simultaneous multi-attribute unlearning, supports dynamic adaptation, and is practical for deployment in real-world recommender systems.

Abstract: With the growing demand for safeguarding sensitive user information in
recommender systems, recommendation attribute unlearning is receiving
increasing attention. Existing studies predominantly focus on single-attribute
unlearning. However, privacy protection requirements in the real world often
involve multiple sensitive attributes and are dynamic. Existing
single-attribute unlearning methods cannot meet these real-world requirements
due to i) CH1: the inability to handle multiple unlearning requests
simultaneously, and ii) CH2: the lack of efficient adaptability to dynamic
unlearning needs. To address these challenges, we propose LEGO, a lightweight
and efficient multiple-attribute unlearning framework. Specifically, we divide
the multiple-attribute unlearning process into two steps: i) Embedding
Calibration removes information related to a specific attribute from user
embedding, and ii) Flexible Combination combines these embeddings into a single
embedding, protecting all sensitive attributes. We frame the unlearning process
as a mutual information minimization problem, providing LEGO a theoretical
guarantee of simultaneous unlearning, thereby addressing CH1. With the two-step
framework, where Embedding Calibration can be performed in parallel and
Flexible Combination is flexible and efficient, we address CH2. Extensive
experiments on three real-world datasets across three representative
recommendation models demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our
proposed framework. Our code and appendix are available at

### [143] [Synthetic Data for Robust Runway Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20349)
*Estelle Chigot,Dennis G. Wilson,Meriem Ghrib,Fabrice Jimenez,Thomas Oberlin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Synthetic data from a flight simulator, combined with a small set of real labeled images and a custom domain adaptation strategy, enables accurate runway detection and robustness to nighttime conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Data collection and labeling for deep vision models are costly, especially for critical applications requiring coverage of rare scenarios; synthetic data offers scalable coverage but risks a synthetic-to-real distribution shift.

Method: Generate images with a commercial flight simulator to control conditions; augment with a few annotated real images; integrate real and synthetic data to train standard object detectors; apply a customized domain adaptation strategy to mitigate the synthetic-to-real gap; evaluate robustness under adverse nighttime conditions.

Result: Standard object detection models trained with real+synthetic data achieve accurate runway predictions; robustness to nighttime conditions improves with the customized domain adaptation strategy, demonstrating viability of the approach.

Conclusion: Synthetic data paired with targeted domain adaptation can reduce data collection costs while maintaining accuracy for runway detection, and the approach is promising for other critical perception tasks.

Abstract: Deep vision models are now mature enough to be integrated in industrial and
possibly critical applications such as autonomous navigation. Yet, data
collection and labeling to train such models requires too much efforts and
costs for a single company or product. This drawback is more significant in
critical applications, where training data must include all possible conditions
including rare scenarios. In this perspective, generating synthetic images is
an appealing solution, since it allows a cheap yet reliable covering of all the
conditions and environments, if the impact of the synthetic-to-real
distribution shift is mitigated. In this article, we consider the case of
runway detection that is a critical part in autonomous landing systems
developed by aircraft manufacturers. We propose an image generation approach
based on a commercial flight simulator that complements a few annotated real
images. By controlling the image generation and the integration of real and
synthetic data, we show that standard object detection models can achieve
accurate prediction. We also evaluate their robustness with respect to adverse
conditions, in our case nighttime images, that were not represented in the real
data, and show the interest of using a customized domain adaptation strategy.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: An uncertainty-driven routing framework blends a fast reward model (RM) with a costly but strong LLM judge for RLHF, routing uncertain instances to the LLM while fast cases stay with the RM to improve efficiency and alignment robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classical reward models trained on human preferences can be hacked and generalize poorly to out-of-distribution inputs, while strong LLM judges excel at generalization but are too costly for online RLHF. A hybrid, uncertainty-aware approach aims to get the best of both worlds.

Method: Formulate the policy-gradient advantage estimation as a pairwise preference classification and use principled uncertainty quantification to route uncertain preference pairs to the LLM judge; confident pairs are evaluated by the fast RM, while uncertain ones are escalated to the costly LLM judge.

Result: Empirical results on RM benchmarks show the uncertainty-based routing outperforms random judge calling at the same cost, and downstream alignment improves in online RLHF.

Conclusion: An uncertainty-guided routing framework effectively combines a fast RM with a strong but costly LLM judge, achieving improved efficiency and alignment robustness in online RLHF; the approach is validated on RM benchmarks and downstream tasks.

Abstract: Reward model (RM) plays a pivotal role in reinforcement learning with human
feedback (RLHF) for aligning large language models (LLMs). However, classical
RMs trained on human preferences are vulnerable to reward hacking and
generalize poorly to out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs. By contrast, strong LLM
judges equipped with reasoning capabilities demonstrate superior
generalization, even without additional training, but incur significantly
higher inference costs, limiting their applicability in online RLHF. In this
work, we propose an uncertainty-based routing framework that efficiently
complements a fast RM with a strong but costly LLM judge. Our approach
formulates advantage estimation in policy gradient (PG) methods as pairwise
preference classification, enabling principled uncertainty quantification to
guide routing. Uncertain pairs are forwarded to the LLM judge, while confident
ones are evaluated by the RM. Experiments on RM benchmarks demonstrate that our
uncertainty-based routing strategy significantly outperforms random judge
calling at the same cost, and downstream alignment results showcase its
effectiveness in improving online RLHF.

### [145] [Hierarchical Time Series Forecasting with Robust Reconciliation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20383)
*Shuhei Aikawa,Aru Suzuki,Kei Yoshitake,Kanata Teshigawara,Akira Iwabuchi,Ken Kobayashi,Kazuhide Nakata*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a robust hierarchical forecast reconciliation under covariance uncertainty using semidefinite programming; improves forecast accuracy by accounting for estimation error.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hierarchical time-series forecasts require coherent sums; standard reconciliation relies on a known covariance of forecast errors; in practice this covariance is unknown and estimated with error, which can hurt performance.

Method: Define an uncertainty set for the estimated covariance; formulate a worst-case minimization of expected squared error; recast as semidefinite program for tractable solution.

Result: Numerical experiments show the robust method outperforms traditional reconciliation methods that ignore covariance uncertainty.

Conclusion: Incorporating uncertainty into the reconciliation process yields more robust forecasts in hierarchical time-series settings.

Abstract: This paper focuses on forecasting hierarchical time-series data, where each
higher-level observation equals the sum of its corresponding lower-level time
series. In such contexts, the forecast values should be coherent, meaning that
the forecast value of each parent series exactly matches the sum of the
forecast values of its child series. Existing hierarchical forecasting methods
typically generate base forecasts independently for each series and then apply
a reconciliation procedure to adjust them so that the resulting forecast values
are coherent across the hierarchy. These methods generally derive an optimal
reconciliation, using a covariance matrix of the forecast error. In practice,
however, the true covariance matrix is unknown and has to be estimated from
finite samples in advance. This gap between the true and estimated covariance
matrix may degrade forecast performance. To address this issue, we propose a
robust optimization framework for hierarchical reconciliation that accounts for
uncertainty in the estimated covariance matrix. We first introduce an
uncertainty set for the estimated covariance matrix and formulate a
reconciliation problem that minimizes the worst-case expected squared error
over this uncertainty set. We show that our problem can be cast as a
semidefinite optimization problem. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the
proposed robust reconciliation method achieved better forecast performance than
existing hierarchical forecasting methods, which indicates the effectiveness of
integrating uncertainty into the reconciliation process.

### [146] [Relative-Based Scaling Law for Neural Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20387)
*Baoqing Yue,Jinyuan Zhou,Zixi Wei,Jingtao Zhan,Qingyao Ai,Yiqun Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces Relative-Based Probability (RBP) and its Relative-Based Scaling Law as a ranking-based complement to cross-entropy for evaluating language model performance; validated across diverse datasets and model families, with applications to emergence and theory discovery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cross-entropy only measures absolute probability of the correct token and ignores the relative ordering among tokens. A metric capturing ranking of the correct token among top predictions can better reflect practical settings like greedy sampling and provide deeper scaling insights.

Method: Define the Relative-Based Probability (RBP) metric to measure the likelihood that the correct token ranks among the top predictions. Derive the Relative-Based Scaling Law describing how RBP improves with model size. Validate the law through extensive experiments on four datasets and four model families spanning five orders of magnitude, and demonstrate two broad applications.

Result: The Relative-Based Scaling Law shows robust, accurate scaling of RBP with model size across diverse settings; RBP increases as models scale, offering a complementary perspective to cross-entropy for understanding model performance and scaling.

Conclusion: RBP-based scaling provides a complementary lens to cross-entropy, enriching practical development and theoretical exploration of scaling laws and emergence phenomena in large language models.

Abstract: Scaling laws aim to accurately predict model performance across different
scales. Existing scaling-law studies almost exclusively rely on cross-entropy
as the evaluation metric. However, cross-entropy provides only a partial view
of performance: it measures the absolute probability assigned to the correct
token, but ignores the relative ordering between correct and incorrect tokens.
Yet, relative ordering is crucial for language models, such as in
greedy-sampling scenario. To address this limitation, we investigate scaling
from the perspective of relative ordering. We first propose the Relative-Based
Probability (RBP) metric, which quantifies the probability that the correct
token is ranked among the top predictions. Building on this metric, we
establish the Relative-Based Scaling Law, which characterizes how RBP improves
with increasing model size. Through extensive experiments on four datasets and
four model families spanning five orders of magnitude, we demonstrate the
robustness and accuracy of this law. Finally, we illustrate the broad
application of this law with two examples, namely providing a deeper
explanation of emergence phenomena and facilitating finding fundamental
theories of scaling laws. In summary, the Relative-Based Scaling Law
complements the cross-entropy perspective and contributes to a more complete
understanding of scaling large language models. Thus, it offers valuable
insights for both practical development and theoretical exploration.

*Tom Maus,Asma Atamna,Tobias Glasmachers*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces an industry-inspired benchmark combining SortingEnv and ContainerGym into a sequential recycling task and compares modular vs monolithic RL controllers, showing action masking is a key enabler and that specialization benefits shrink as action complexity is reduced.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the gap between academic RL benchmarks and real industrial control problems by creating a realistic, multi-stage benchmark that emphasizes modularity, reward design, and action space management; investigate centralization vs specialization in control policies.

Method: Create an enhanced benchmark environment that merges two existing benchmarks into a sequential process with sorting and pressing. Evaluate two control strategies: a modular multi-agent architecture with specialized agents and a single monolithic agent; analyze the impact of action masking on learning performance.

Result: Without action masking, the modular architecture learns policies better than the monolithic agent. With action masking, both architectures improve substantially and the performance gap narrows. Action space constraints prove decisive for practical learning and suggest specialization advantages diminish with reduced action complexity.

Conclusion: The benchmark provides a valuable testbed for practical multi-agent RL in industrial automation and informs the ongoing debate on centralization versus specialization, highlighting the crucial role of action masking in enabling learning and the context-dependent value of specialization.

Abstract: Autonomous control of multi-stage industrial processes requires both local
specialization and global coordination. Reinforcement learning (RL) offers a
promising approach, but its industrial adoption remains limited due to
challenges such as reward design, modularity, and action space management. Many
academic benchmarks differ markedly from industrial control problems, limiting
their transferability to real-world applications. This study introduces an
enhanced industry-inspired benchmark environment that combines tasks from two
existing benchmarks, SortingEnv and ContainerGym, into a sequential recycling
scenario with sorting and pressing operations. We evaluate two control
strategies: a modular architecture with specialized agents and a monolithic
agent governing the full system, while also analyzing the impact of action
masking. Our experiments show that without action masking, agents struggle to
learn effective policies, with the modular architecture performing better. When
action masking is applied, both architectures improve substantially, and the
performance gap narrows considerably. These results highlight the decisive role
of action space constraints and suggest that the advantages of specialization
diminish as action complexity is reduced. The proposed benchmark thus provides
a valuable testbed for exploring practical and robust multi-agent RL solutions
in industrial automation, while contributing to the ongoing debate on
centralization versus specialization.

### [148] [Why DPO is a Misspecified Estimator and How to Fix It](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20413)
*Aditya Gopalan,Sayak Ray Chowdhury,Debangshu Banerjee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) can be misspecified when the true reward function cannot be realized by the policy class, leading to failure modes like preference reversals and sensitivity to data; the authors propose AuxDPO, adding auxiliary variables to align with RLHF, with empirical gains on bandit tasks and LLM alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why supervised DPO can underperform RLHF in aligning models, identify misspecification modes, and develop a principled fix that bridges DPO and RLHF.

Method: Treat DPO as a statistical estimation of reward functions induced by a parametric policy class; analyze the local behavior of two-stage RLHF as a natural gradient step in policy space; propose AuxDPO by introducing auxiliary variables into the DPO loss to move toward the RLHF solution; validate with experiments on didactic bandit settings and large language model alignment tasks.

Result: Characterizes misspecification-driven failure modes in DPO (preference reversal, reward degradation, input distribution sensitivity) and demonstrates that AuxDPO mitigates these issues and achieves superior performance in the tested tasks.

Conclusion: Misspecification is a key weakness of DPO; AuxDPO provides a principled mechanism to mitigate this gap and better approximate RLHF outcomes, improving alignment performance.

Abstract: Direct alignment algorithms such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO)
fine-tune models based on preference data, using only supervised learning
instead of two-stage reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF). We show
that DPO encodes a statistical estimation problem over reward functions induced
by a parametric policy class. When the true reward function that generates
preferences cannot be realized via the policy class, DPO becomes misspecified,
resulting in failure modes such as preference order reversal, worsening of
policy reward, and high sensitivity to the input preference data distribution.
On the other hand, we study the local behavior of two-stage RLHF for a
parametric class and relate it to a natural gradient step in policy space. Our
fine-grained geometric characterization allows us to propose AuxDPO, which
introduces additional auxiliary variables in the DPO loss function to help move
towards the RLHF solution in a principled manner and mitigate the
misspecification in DPO. We empirically demonstrate the superior performance of
AuxDPO on didactic bandit settings as well as LLM alignment tasks.

### [149] [Addressing Mark Imbalance in Integration-free Neural Marked Temporal Point Processes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20414)
*Sishun Liu,Ke Deng,Xiuzhen Zhang,Yongli Ren,Yan Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A thresholding-based approach tackles imbalanced marks in Marked Temporal Point Processes (MTPP) by recalibrating mark probabilities with class priors, predicting the mark first and then the time, and employing a neural MTPP model that enables efficient time sampling without costly numerical integration; it achieves superior next-event mark and time prediction on real datasets, with code available.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In real-world event streams, the distribution over marks is highly imbalanced, causing poor prediction for rare marks when using standard MTPP models that predict marks directly from raw probabilities. This imbalance motivates a method that decouples prediction from priors and focuses on optimizing calibrated mark prediction rather than raw probability.

Method: Introduce a thresholding mechanism that learns thresholds to adjust the raw mark probability using the mark's prior probability, effectively normalizing by class priors to optimize the correct mark prediction. The model first predicts the mark and then the arrival time. Develop a neural MTPP framework that supports efficient time sampling and accurate estimation of mark probabilities without expensive numerical improper integration.

Result: Extensive experiments on real-world datasets show superior performance of the proposed method against various baselines for both next-event mark and time prediction.

Conclusion: The proposed thresholding-driven MTPP approach mitigates the adverse effects of mark imbalance, improving predictive accuracy for both the next-event mark and its timestamp; the method is validated on real data and code is publicly available.

Abstract: Marked Temporal Point Process (MTPP) has been well studied to model the event
distribution in marked event streams, which can be used to predict the mark and
arrival time of the next event. However, existing studies overlook that the
distribution of event marks is highly imbalanced in many real-world
applications, with some marks being frequent but others rare. The imbalance
poses a significant challenge to the performance of the next event prediction,
especially for events of rare marks. To address this issue, we propose a
thresholding method, which learns thresholds to tune the mark probability
normalized by the mark's prior probability to optimize mark prediction, rather
than predicting the mark directly based on the mark probability as in existing
studies. In conjunction with this method, we predict the mark first and then
the time. In particular, we develop a novel neural MTPP model to support
effective time sampling and estimation of mark probability without
computationally expensive numerical improper integration. Extensive experiments
on real-world datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our solution
against various baselines for the next event mark and time prediction. The code
is available at https://github.com/undes1red/IFNMTPP.

### [150] [An Empirical Study of Sample Selection Strategies for Large Language Model Repair](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20428)
*Xuran Li,Jingyi Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SAPS (Semantic-Aware Prioritized Sampling) bests other data-selection methods for LLM repair, achieving strong detoxification with less data; random sampling works well for very large/robust models; CCS and GraNd offer limited gains; optimal data amount depends on model size and method.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce the cost of post-hoc LLM repair by selectively choosing repair data, enabling effective toxicity removal and behavior alignment without heavy parameter updates.

Method: Systematic comparison of five sampling strategies (Random, K-Center, GraNd, CCS, SAPS) for behavioral repair of LLMs. Evaluation metrics include toxicity reduction, perplexity on WikiText-2 and LAMBADA, and composite scores (RPS, OPS, RES). Experiments across model scales to assess trade-offs between repair effectiveness and data efficiency.

Result: SAPS achieves the best balance among detoxification, utility preservation, and efficiency, delivering repair outcomes comparable or superior to baselines with substantially less data. Random sampling remains competitive for large/robust models. CCS and GraNd yield limited improvements. The optimal data proportion is model-scale and method dependent.

Conclusion: Selection-based repair is a scalable, efficient paradigm for maintaining LLM reliability. Data sampling should be tuned as part of repair pipelines to optimize toxicity reduction and utility retention while minimizing data and computational costs.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in real-world systems,
yet they can produce toxic or biased outputs that undermine safety and trust.
Post-hoc model repair provides a practical remedy, but the high cost of
parameter updates motivates selective use of repair data. Despite extensive
prior work on data selection for model training, it remains unclear which
sampling criteria are most effective and efficient when applied specifically to
behavioral repair of large generative models. Our study presents a systematic
analysis of sample prioritization strategies for LLM repair. We evaluate five
representative selection methods, including random sampling, K-Center,
gradient-norm-based selection(GraNd), stratified coverage (CCS), and a
Semantic-Aware Prioritized Sampling (SAPS) approach we proposed. Repair
effectiveness and trade-offs are assessed through toxicity reduction,
perplexity on WikiText-2 and LAMBADA, and three composite metrics: the Repair
Proximity Score (RPS), the Overall Performance Score (OPS), and the Repair
Efficiency Score (RES). Experimental results show that SAPS achieves the best
balance between detoxification, utility preservation, and efficiency,
delivering comparable or superior repair outcomes with substantially less data.
Random sampling remains effective for large or robust models, while
high-overhead methods such as CCS and GraNd provide limited benefit. The
optimal data proportion depends on model scale and repair method, indicating
that sample selection should be regarded as a tunable component of repair
pipelines. Overall, these findings establish selection-based repair as an
efficient and scalable paradigm for maintaining LLM reliability.

### [151] [MolBridge: Atom-Level Joint Graph Refinement for Robust Drug-Drug Interaction Event Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20448)
*Xuan Lin,Aocheng Ding,Tengfei Ma,Hua Liang,Zhe Quan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MolBridge introduces an atom-level joint graph refinement framework that directly models inter-drug atom-level interactions to predict DDI events, using a structure-consistency module to mitigate over-smoothing, achieving robust and interpretable results across long-tail and inductive scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate DDI prediction requires capturing fine-grained inter-drug relationships, including atom-level cross-molecular interactions, which current isolated-drug representations fail to model, especially across diverse molecular complexities and uneven DDI type distributions.

Method: Construct a joint graph that integrates atomic structures of drug pairs and apply a structure consistency module that iteratively refines node features while preserving global context to mitigate over-smoothing, enabling learning of both local and global interactions.

Result: MolBridge outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on two benchmark datasets, with robust performance on long-tail and inductive scenarios and across frequent and rare DDI types, demonstrating improved accuracy, robustness, and mechanistic interpretability.

Conclusion: The approach advances graph-based drug safety analysis by enabling fine-grained atom-level coupling and joint graph refinement, contributing to Web Mining and Content Analysis through improved DDI network analysis.

Abstract: Drug combinations offer therapeutic benefits but also carry the risk of
adverse drug-drug interactions (DDIs), especially under complex molecular
structures. Accurate DDI event prediction requires capturing fine-grained
inter-drug relationships, which are critical for modeling metabolic mechanisms
such as enzyme-mediated competition. However, existing approaches typically
rely on isolated drug representations and fail to explicitly model atom-level
cross-molecular interactions, limiting their effectiveness across diverse
molecular complexities and DDI type distributions. To address these
limitations, we propose MolBridge, a novel atom-level joint graph refinement
framework for robust DDI event prediction. MolBridge constructs a joint graph
that integrates atomic structures of drug pairs, enabling direct modeling of
inter-drug associations. A central challenge in such joint graph settings is
the potential loss of information caused by over-smoothing when modeling
long-range atomic dependencies. To overcome this, we introduce a structure
consistency module that iteratively refines node features while preserving the
global structural context. This joint design allows MolBridge to effectively
learn both local and global interaction outperforms state-of-the-art baselines,
achieving superior performance across long-tail and inductive scenarios.
patterns, yielding robust representations across both frequent and rare DDI
types. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets show that MolBridge
consistently. These results demonstrate the advantages of fine-grained graph
refinement in improving the accuracy, robustness, and mechanistic
interpretability of DDI event prediction.This work contributes to Web Mining
and Content Analysis by developing graph-based methods for mining and analyzing
drug-drug interaction networks.

*Quannian Zhang,Michael Röder,Nikit Srivastava,N'Dah Jean Kouagou,Axel-Cyrille Ngonga Ngomo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes explainable benchmarking for KG QA; introduces PruneCEL, a concept-learning method; shows improved explainability and a user study suggesting explanations help users predict system behavior; code release provided.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Benchmarking often reduces results to a few metrics, lacking explanations that would help interpret performance and guide future work; explainable benchmarking aims to automatically generate explanations for benchmark results.

Method: Introduce PruneCEL, a novel concept-learning approach for large knowledge graphs, and instantiate explainable benchmarking for KG QA systems; generate explanations of system behavior by learning explainable concepts.

Result: PruneCEL outperforms state-of-the-art concept learners on explainable benchmarking by up to 0.55 points F1; a task-driven user study with 41 participants showed 80% of cases where participants could accurately predict system behavior based on the explanations; code and data are available at the provided GitHub repository.

Conclusion: Explainable benchmarking with PruneCEL demonstrates promise for interpretable evaluation of KG QA systems, enabling insights for development and use; the work provides a concrete instantiation and resources for replication.

Abstract: Evaluating competing systems in a comparable way, i.e., benchmarking them, is
an undeniable pillar of the scientific method. However, system performance is
often summarized via a small number of metrics. The analysis of the evaluation
details and the derivation of insights for further development or use remains a
tedious manual task with often biased results. Thus, this paper argues for a
new type of benchmarking, which is dubbed explainable benchmarking. The aim of
explainable benchmarking approaches is to automatically generate explanations
for the performance of systems in a benchmark. We provide a first instantiation
of this paradigm for knowledge-graph-based question answering systems. We
compute explanations by using a novel concept learning approach developed for
large knowledge graphs called PruneCEL. Our evaluation shows that PruneCEL
outperforms state-of-the-art concept learners on the task of explainable
benchmarking by up to 0.55 points F1 measure. A task-driven user study with 41
participants shows that in 80\% of the cases, the majority of participants can
accurately predict the behavior of a system based on our explanations. Our code

### [153] [Transferable Black-Box One-Shot Forging of Watermarks via Image Preference Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20468)
*Tomáš Souček,Sylvestre-Alvise Rebuffi,Pierre Fernandez,Nikola Jovanović,Hady Elsahar,Valeriu Lacatusu,Tuan Tran,Alexandre Mourachko*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a backpropagation-based watermark forging attack for post-hoc image watermarking, using a procedurally trained watermark detector; capable of removing/forging watermarks from a single watermarked image without knowing the watermarking model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As AI-generated content proliferates, watermarking is needed to verify authenticity and attribution. Forging watermarks represents a practical, underexplored threat that existing work on robustness to removal attacks does not address.

Method: 1) Train a watermark-detection preference model with a ranking loss on procedurally generated data (no real watermarks). 2) Attack by backpropagating on the input image to remove or forge the watermark, using the detector as guidance. Requires only a single watermarked image and no knowledge of the watermarking model; evaluate across various post-hoc watermarking systems.

Result: The method successfully forges watermarks across multiple post-hoc watermarking models, demonstrating a practical and simple attack that does not require model access; code and resources are released.

Conclusion: This work questions the security of current post-hoc watermarking schemes and highlights the need for forging-resistant defenses and broader threat models; suggests directions for developing more robust watermarking mechanisms and evaluation benchmarks.

Abstract: Recent years have seen a surge in interest in digital content watermarking
techniques, driven by the proliferation of generative models and increased
legal pressure. With an ever-growing percentage of AI-generated content
available online, watermarking plays an increasingly important role in ensuring
content authenticity and attribution at scale. There have been many works
assessing the robustness of watermarking to removal attacks, yet, watermark
forging, the scenario when a watermark is stolen from genuine content and
applied to malicious content, remains underexplored. In this work, we
investigate watermark forging in the context of widely used post-hoc image
watermarking. Our contributions are as follows. First, we introduce a
preference model to assess whether an image is watermarked. The model is
trained using a ranking loss on purely procedurally generated images without
any need for real watermarks. Second, we demonstrate the model's capability to
remove and forge watermarks by optimizing the input image through
backpropagation. This technique requires only a single watermarked image and
works without knowledge of the watermarking model, making our attack much
simpler and more practical than attacks introduced in related work. Third, we
evaluate our proposed method on a variety of post-hoc image watermarking
models, demonstrating that our approach can effectively forge watermarks,
questioning the security of current watermarking approaches. Our code and
further resources are publicly available.

*Fangjian Zhang,Xiaoyong Zhuge,Wenlan Wang,Haixia Xiao,Yuying Zhu,Siyang Cheng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes Hurdle-IMDL to debias rainfall retrieval under imbalanced label distributions by separating zero inflation and long-tail; uses a hurdle model for zero inflation and an unbiased inverse-model learning objective for long tail; demonstrated superior performance, especially for heavy rainfall, across eastern China case studies; generalizable to environmental variables.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Imbalanced label distributions in quantitative remote sensing bias model training, causing underperformance for rare/heavy rainfall and similar high-impact events.

Method: Divide-and-conquer: decompose imbalance into zero inflation and long tail; apply hurdle model to zero inflation; transform learning objective to unbiased ideal inverse model with IMDL for long tail.

Result: Empirical evaluation shows IMDL outperforms conventional, cost-sensitive, generative, and multi-task methods; reduces systematic underestimation and improves heavy-to-extreme rainfall retrieval; case studies in eastern China confirm effectiveness.

Conclusion: IMDL offers a generalizable framework for addressing distribution imbalance in environmental variables, enabling improved retrieval of rare but high-impact events.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence has advanced quantitative remote sensing, yet its
effectiveness is constrained by imbalanced label distribution. This imbalance
leads conventionally trained models to favor common samples, which in turn
degrades retrieval performance for rare ones. Rainfall retrieval exemplifies
this issue, with performance particularly compromised for heavy rain. This
study proposes Hurdle-Inversion Model Debiasing Learning (IMDL) framework.
Following a divide-and-conquer strategy, imbalance in the rain distribution is
decomposed into two components: zero inflation, defined by the predominance of
non-rain samples; and long tail, defined by the disproportionate abundance of
light-rain samples relative to heavy-rain samples. A hurdle model is adopted to
handle the zero inflation, while IMDL is proposed to address the long tail by
transforming the learning object into an unbiased ideal inverse model.
Comprehensive evaluation via statistical metrics and case studies investigating
rainy weather in eastern China confirms Hurdle-IMDL's superiority over
conventional, cost-sensitive, generative, and multi-task learning methods. Its
key advancements include effective mitigation of systematic underestimation and
a marked improvement in the retrieval of heavy-to-extreme rain. IMDL offers a
generalizable approach for addressing imbalance in distributions of
environmental variables, enabling enhanced retrieval of rare yet high-impact
events.

*Lawrence Clegg,John Cartlidge*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Graph neural network captures intransitive relationships in tennis matchups to improve forecasting, achieving positive ROI on selective bets by exploiting a market inefficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Intransitive dominance (A beats B, B beats C, C beats A) is common in tennis but rarely modeled in forecasts; markets may misprice such relational dynamics, creating exploitable inefficiencies.

Method: Model uses temporal directed graphs with players as nodes and historical match outcomes as directed edges; a graph neural network learns relational, time-evolving features to forecast match results, evaluating on higher-intransitivity matchups with metrics like accuracy, Brier score, and ROI via Kelly staking across ~1.9k bets.

Result: On higher-intransitivity matchups, the model achieves 65.7% accuracy and a 0.215 Brier score, delivering a 3.26% ROI over 1,903 bets under Kelly staking.

Conclusion: Graph-based relational modeling can capture intransitive dynamics and reveal market inefficiencies in betting environments; further validation and robust comparisons are warranted to assess generalizability and practical deployment.

Abstract: Intransitive player dominance, where player A beats B, B beats C, but C beats
A, is common in competitive tennis. Yet, there are few known attempts to
incorporate it within forecasting methods. We address this problem with a graph
neural network approach that explicitly models these intransitive relationships
through temporal directed graphs, with players as nodes and their historical
match outcomes as directed edges. We find the bookmaker Pinnacle Sports poorly
handles matches with high intransitive complexity and posit that our
graph-based approach is uniquely positioned to capture relational dynamics in
these scenarios. When selectively betting on higher intransitivity matchups
with our model (65.7% accuracy, 0.215 Brier Score), we achieve significant
positive returns of 3.26% ROI with Kelly staking over 1903 bets, suggesting a
market inefficiency in handling intransitive matchups that our approach
successfully exploits.

*Rui Zhu,Song-Lin Lv,Zi-Kang Wang,Lan-Zhe Guo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Bi-CoG introduces a plug-and-play semi-supervised fine-tuning method for vision-language models that reduces bias and hyperparameter sensitivity by using both inter-model and intra-model consistency along with an error-aware, dynamic pseudo-labeling strategy, showing strong gains across 14 datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Label scarcity in vision-language model fine-tuning and limitations of existing SSL approaches that rely on fixed confidence thresholds or prediction consistency, which can induce bias and sensitivity to hyperparameters.

Method: Bi-CoG (Bi-Consistency-Guided Self-Training) combines inter-model and intra-model consistency to quality-pick pseudo-labels. It features an error-aware dynamic pseudo-label assignment strategy and is designed as a plug-and-play module that can be added to pre-trained VLM fine-tuning processes.

Result: Theoretical analysis and extensive experiments on 14 datasets demonstrate that Bi-CoG consistently and significantly improves performance over existing methods.

Conclusion: Bi-CoG provides a robust, low-bias, and hyperparameter-tolerant approach to semi-supervised fine-tuning of vision-language models, with broad applicability and strong empirical gains.

Abstract: Exploiting unlabeled data through semi-supervised learning (SSL) or
leveraging pre-trained models via fine-tuning are two prevailing paradigms for
addressing label-scarce scenarios. Recently, growing attention has been given
to combining fine-tuning of pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) with SSL,
forming the emerging paradigm of semi-supervised fine-tuning. However, existing
methods often suffer from model bias and hyperparameter sensitivity, due to
reliance on prediction consistency or pre-defined confidence thresholds. To
address these limitations, we propose a simple yet effective plug-and-play
methodology named
$\underline{\textbf{Bi-Co}}$nsistency-$\underline{\textbf{G}}$uided
Self-Training (Bi-CoG), which assigns high-quality and low-bias pseudo-labels,
by simultaneously exploiting inter-model and intra-model consistency, along
with an error-aware dynamic pseudo-label assignment strategy. Both theoretical
analysis and extensive experiments over 14 datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of Bi-CoG, which consistently and significantly improves the
performance of existing methods.

*Alexandre Benoit,Catherine Aitken,Yu He*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Systematic empirical study of graph rewiring methods for GNNs/Graph Transformers. Seven strategies analyzed; preserving local structure while allowing global connectivity changes yields better performance and fidelity; insights to guide rewiring design and metric selection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand which graph structural properties must be preserved during rewiring to achieve performance gains without distorting topology-dependent signals, bridging graph theory and practical GNN optimization.

Method: Empirically evaluate seven diverse rewiring strategies on graphs, measuring changes in a range of local and global structural metrics (e.g., clustering, degree distribution, modularity, global efficiency, centrality measures) and correlating these with downstream node classification accuracy to identify patterns between metric changes and performance.

Result: A consistent pattern emerges: successful rewiring methods tend to preserve local structure while allowing flexibility in global connectivity. Changes in local properties are tightly linked to preserving performance/fidelity, while global connectivity changes can be tolerated or even beneficial if local structure is maintained; correlations between specific metric changes and accuracy were observed across strategies.

Conclusion: Design rewiring algorithms with a priority on preserving local topology (e.g., clusters, motifs) and permit flexible or altered global connectivity. The study provides practical guidelines and metrics to monitor when applying rewiring and helps align graph-theoretic properties with GNN optimization goals.

Abstract: Graph rewiring has emerged as a key technique to alleviate over-squashing in
Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Graph Transformers by modifying the graph
topology to improve information flow. While effective, rewiring inherently
alters the graph's structure, raising the risk of distorting important
topology-dependent signals. Yet, despite the growing use of rewiring, little is
known about which structural properties must be preserved to ensure both
performance gains and structural fidelity. In this work, we provide the first
systematic analysis of how rewiring affects a range of graph structural
metrics, and how these changes relate to downstream task performance. We study
seven diverse rewiring strategies and correlate changes in local and global
graph properties with node classification accuracy. Our results reveal a
consistent pattern: successful rewiring methods tend to preserve local
structure while allowing for flexibility in global connectivity. These findings
offer new insights into the design of effective rewiring strategies, bridging
the gap between graph theory and practical GNN optimization.

*Abdulmomen Ghalkha,Zhuojun Tian,Chaouki Ben Issaid,Mehdi Bennis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SheafAlign introduces a decentralized, sheaf-theoretic framework for multimodal alignment that relaxes the mutual-redundancy assumption, using pairwise comparison spaces and decentralized contrastive learning to preserve both shared and unique information, achieving better zero-shot generalization, cross-modal alignment, robustness to missing modalities, and 50% lower communication cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world multimodal data often exhibit non-redundant or only partially overlapping information across modalities. Traditional single-space alignment assumes mutual redundancy across all modalities, leading to information loss and poor scalability in distributed settings.

Method: Model pairwise modality relations as local 'sheaf' structures represented by multiple comparison spaces; apply decentralized contrastive learning objectives to train without requiring all modalities to be jointly redundant; reduce inter-modality communication by operating in local spaces.

Result: Empirical experiments on multimodal sensing datasets show superior zero-shot generalization, improved cross-modal alignment, robustness to missing modalities, and about 50% reduction in communication cost compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: SheafAlign overcomes the limitations of prior methods by preserving both shared and unique information in a decentralized, multi-space alignment framework and delivering efficient communication for distributed multimodal systems.

Abstract: Conventional multimodal alignment methods assume mutual redundancy across all
modalities, an assumption that fails in real-world distributed scenarios. We
propose SheafAlign, a sheaf-theoretic framework for decentralized multimodal
alignment that replaces single-space alignment with multiple comparison spaces.
This approach models pairwise modality relations through sheaf structures and
leverages decentralized contrastive learning-based objectives for training.
SheafAlign overcomes the limitations of prior methods by not requiring mutual
redundancy among all modalities, preserving both shared and unique information.
Experiments on multimodal sensing datasets show superior zero-shot
generalization, cross-modal alignment, and robustness to missing modalities,
with 50\% lower communication cost than state-of-the-art baselines.

*Jacopo Di Ventura,Jan Felix Kleuker,Aske Plaat,Thomas Moerland*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Unified framework for zero-shot RL, organizing methods into direct and compositional representations; extends successor-feature bounds and sets a principled foundation for future zero-shot RL research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Zero-shot RL lacks a common analytical lens and a unified vocabulary, hindering cross-method comparison and progress toward general agents. A principled framework can clarify assumptions, enable fair benchmarking, and guide future research.

Method: Introduce consistent notation and taxonomy for zero-shot RL, classify existing approaches into two families (direct representations and compositional representations), and derive an extended bound for successor-feature methods.

Result: Clarifies shared principles and differences across methods, provides an extended bound for successor-feature approaches, and consolidates existing work under a common framework to facilitate cross-method analysis and comparison.

Conclusion: The framework offers a principled foundation for future zero-shot RL research and outlines a clear path toward developing more general agents.

Abstract: Zero-shot reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a setting for developing
general agents in an unsupervised manner, capable of solving downstream tasks
without additional training or planning at test-time. Unlike conventional RL,
which optimizes policies for a fixed reward, zero-shot RL requires agents to
encode representations rich enough to support immediate adaptation to any
objective, drawing parallels to vision and language foundation models. Despite
growing interest, the field lacks a common analytical lens.
  We present the first unified framework for zero-shot RL. Our formulation
introduces a consistent notation and taxonomy that organizes existing
approaches and allows direct comparison between them. Central to our framework
is the classification of algorithms into two families: direct representations,
which learn end-to-end mappings from rewards to policies, and compositional
representations, which decompose the representation leveraging the substructure
of the value function. Within this framework, we highlight shared principles
and key differences across methods, and we derive an extended bound for
successor-feature methods, offering a new perspective on their performance in
the zero-shot regime. By consolidating existing work under a common lens, our
framework provides a principled foundation for future research in zero-shot RL
and outlines a clear path toward developing more general agents.

*Alexandru Oarga,Yilun Du*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A compositional energy-based reasoning framework: learn local energy landscapes on tractable subproblems, compose them into a global energy landscape at inference time, and use Parallel Energy Minimization to improve sampling, enabling generalization to larger, more complex problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generalization in reasoning tasks is limited by end-to-end training; exploiting compositional structure and energy-based modeling can constrain search and scale reasoning to harder problems.

Method: Train energy functions on smaller subproblems to capture their solution spaces; at test time, compose these local energies to form a global landscape for the given problem; apply Parallel Energy Minimization (PEM) to improve sample quality from the constructed landscape; evaluate on a broad set of reasoning tasks.

Result: The approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods on a wide set of reasoning problems, demonstrating improved generalization to larger and more complex problems.

Conclusion: Compositional energy landscapes enable scalable generalization in reasoning by modularizing subproblems and coordinating them during inference; PEM enhances sample quality, supporting constraint-incorporated, more flexible inference.

Abstract: Generalization is a key challenge in machine learning, specifically in
reasoning tasks, where models are expected to solve problems more complex than
those encountered during training. Existing approaches typically train
reasoning models in an end-to-end fashion, directly mapping input instances to
solutions. While this allows models to learn useful heuristics from data, it
often results in limited generalization beyond the training distribution. In
this work, we propose a novel approach to reasoning generalization by learning
energy landscapes over the solution spaces of smaller, more tractable
subproblems. At test time, we construct a global energy landscape for a given
problem by combining the energy functions of multiple subproblems. This
compositional approach enables the incorporation of additional constraints
during inference, allowing the construction of energy landscapes for problems
of increasing difficulty. To improve the sample quality from this newly
constructed energy landscape, we introduce Parallel Energy Minimization (PEM).
We evaluate our approach on a wide set of reasoning problems. Our method
outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating its ability to
generalize to larger and more complex problems. Project website can be found

*Simon Schindler,Christoph Binder,Lukas Lürzer,Stefan Huber*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MLOps needs careful adaptation for OT environments using RAMI 4.0 and ISA-95; direct transplantation fails, but a structured mapping and an exemplar use case enable practical integration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: OT systems pose unique constraints (safety, reliability, lifecycle, interoperability). The paper seeks to bridge MLOps with OT by leveraging established reference models to facilitate industrial deployment.

Method: Evaluate RAMI 4.0 and ISA-95 for MLOps integration; map MLOps lifecycle components to RAMI 4.0; illustrate with a real-world use case.

Result: Standard MLOps practices cannot be directly transplanted into OT environments; however, a structured adaptation using RAMI 4.0 and ISA-95 enables a viable integration path, demonstrated through a lifecycle component mapping and a real-world example.

Conclusion: A systematic approach that adapts existing OT reference models is essential to successfully embed MLOps in OT contexts; direct transplantation is insufficient.

Abstract: Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) practices are increas- ingly adopted in
industrial settings, yet their integration with Opera- tional Technology (OT)
systems presents significant challenges. This pa- per analyzes the fundamental
obstacles in combining MLOps with OT en- vironments and proposes a systematic
approach to embed MLOps prac- tices into established OT reference models. We
evaluate the suitability of the Reference Architectural Model for Industry 4.0
(RAMI 4.0) and the International Society of Automation Standard 95 (ISA-95) for
MLOps integration and present a detailed mapping of MLOps lifecycle compo-
nents to RAMI 4.0 exemplified by a real-world use case. Our findings
demonstrate that while standard MLOps practices cannot be directly transplanted
to OT environments, structured adaptation using existing reference models can
provide a pathway for successful integration.

*Timur Galimzyanov,Olga Kolomyttseva,Egor Bogomolov*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Systematic evaluation of retrieval configurations for code-focused RAG under realistic compute budgets, yielding practical recommendations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To identify cost-effective, high-quality retrieval setups for code-oriented generation tasks by comparing chunking, similarity scoring, and splitting granularity across tasks and budget levels.

Method: Experiments on two Long Code Arena tasks (code completion, bug localization) across various context window sizes. Compare retrieval configurations along three axes: (i) chunking strategy, (ii) similarity scoring, (iii) splitting granularity. Tested PL-PL (sparse BM25 with word-level splitting vs dense), NL-PL (denseVoyager-3 vs sparse), and varied chunk sizes (32-64 line chunks to whole-file). Measured quality and retrieval latency.

Result: Key findings: (1) PL-PL: BM25 with word-level splitting outperforms dense alternatives and is much faster; (2) NL-PL: dense Voyager-3 encoders outperform sparse retrievers but with ~100x higher latency; (3) Optimal chunk size scales with budget: 32-64 line chunks best at small budgets; whole-file retrieval competitive at ~16000 tokens; (4) Line-based chunking matches syntax-aware splitting across budgets; (5) Retrieval latency varies up to ~200x across configurations; BM25 + word splitting provides best quality-latency trade-off.

Conclusion: The study offers evidence-based recommendations for building code-oriented RAG systems under budget and model constraints, guiding choices of chunking, scoring, and granularity to balance retrieval quality and latency.

Abstract: We study retrieval design for code-focused generation tasks under realistic
compute budgets. Using two complementary tasks from Long Code Arena -- code
completion and bug localization -- we systematically compare retrieval
configurations across various context window sizes along three axes: (i)
chunking strategy, (ii) similarity scoring, and (iii) splitting granularity.
(1) For PL-PL, sparse BM25 with word-level splitting is the most effective and
practical, significantly outperforming dense alternatives while being an order
of magnitude faster. (2) For NL-PL, proprietary dense encoders (Voyager-3
family) consistently beat sparse retrievers, however requiring 100x larger
latency. (3) Optimal chunk size scales with available context: 32-64 line
chunks work best at small budgets, and whole-file retrieval becomes competitive
at 16000 tokens. (4) Simple line-based chunking matches syntax-aware splitting
across budgets. (5) Retrieval latency varies by up to 200x across
configurations; BPE-based splitting is needlessly slow, and BM25 + word
splitting offers the best quality-latency trade-off. Thus, we provide
evidence-based recommendations for implementing effective code-oriented RAG
systems based on task requirements, model constraints, and computational
efficiency.

TL;DR: An integrated PSO-based feature selection framework evaluated on 29 models for breast cancer diagnosis, achieving 99.1% performance with dimensionality reduction and explainable, model-agnostic explanations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional diagnostic methods suffer from variability, cost, and misdiagnosis risk; need for accurate, interpretable, low-cost diagnosis; feature selection and explainability to improve performance and clinical relevance.

Method: Customized Particle Swarm Optimization for feature selection integrated with a broad evaluation over 29 models (classical, ensemble, neural, probabilistic, instance-based); cross-validation combined with explainable AI to ensure interpretability and clinical relevance.

Result: Superior performance of 99.1% across metrics (accuracy, precision); effective dimensionality reduction; transparent model-agnostic explanations.

Conclusion: Swarm intelligence combined with explainable ML yields robust, trustworthy, and clinically meaningful breast cancer diagnosis; shows promise for high-performance, interpretable CAD systems.

Abstract: Breast cancer is considered the most critical and frequently diagnosed cancer
in women worldwide, leading to an increase in cancer-related mortality. Early
and accurate detection is crucial as it can help mitigate possible threats
while improving survival rates. In terms of prediction, conventional diagnostic
methods are often limited by variability, cost, and, most importantly, risk of
misdiagnosis. To address these challenges, machine learning (ML) has emerged as
a powerful tool for computer-aided diagnosis, with feature selection playing a
vital role in improving model performance and interpretability. This research
study proposes an integrated framework that incorporates customized Particle
Swarm Optimization (PSO) for feature selection. This framework has been
evaluated on a comprehensive set of 29 different models, spanning classical
classifiers, ensemble techniques, neural networks, probabilistic algorithms,
and instance-based algorithms. To ensure interpretability and clinical
relevance, the study uses cross-validation in conjunction with explainable AI
methods. Experimental evaluation showed that the proposed approach achieved a
superior score of 99.1\% across all performance metrics, including accuracy and
precision, while effectively reducing dimensionality and providing transparent,
model-agnostic explanations. The results highlight the potential of combining
swarm intelligence with explainable ML for robust, trustworthy, and clinically
meaningful breast cancer diagnosis.

### [164] [Convergence Analysis of SGD under Expected Smoothness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20608)
*Yuta Kawamoto,Hideaki Iiduka*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Convergence analysis of SGD under the expected smoothness (ES) condition, providing self-contained proofs, refined ES constants, bounds on squared full gradient norm, and O(1/K) convergence with explicit residuals; unifies and extends prior ES-based SGD work.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard SGD analyses rely on strong bounded-variance or coarse noise assumptions. The ES condition offers a flexible, objective-value–dependent link between gradient moments and the objective, enabling robust convergence results under more realistic stochastic gradients. The paper aims to formalize this under ES, quantify constants, and connect to prior work.

Method: Develops a self-contained convergence analysis under ES; refines ES with sampling-dependent constants; derives bounds on the expected squared full gradient norm; analyzes SGD with various step-size schedules; provides full proofs in the appendix.

Result: Establishes O(1/K) convergence rates with explicit residual errors for several step-size schedules; provides explicit bounds for the expected squared full gradient norm under ES; unifies and extends prior results (Khaled & Richtárik 2020; Umeda & Iiduka 2025).

Conclusion: The ES-based framework yields a unified, extensible analysis of SGD with detailed bounds and proofs, clarifying the role of constants and residual terms, and reinforcing ES as a robust alternative to traditional variance assumptions.

Abstract: Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is the workhorse of large-scale learning,
yet classical analyses rely on assumptions that can be either too strong
(bounded variance) or too coarse (uniform noise). The expected smoothness (ES)
condition has emerged as a flexible alternative that ties the second moment of
stochastic gradients to the objective value and the full gradient. This paper
presents a self-contained convergence analysis of SGD under ES. We (i) refine
ES with interpretations and sampling-dependent constants; (ii) derive bounds of
the expectation of squared full gradient norm; and (iii) prove $O(1/K)$ rates
with explicit residual errors for various step-size schedules. All proofs are
given in full detail in the appendix. Our treatment unifies and extends recent
threads (Khaled and Richt\'arik, 2020; Umeda and Iiduka, 2025).

### [165] [Equitable Survival Prediction: A Fairness-Aware Survival Modeling (FASM) Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20629)
*Mingxuan Liu,Yilin Ning,Haoyuan Wang,Chuan Hong,Matthew Engelhard,Danielle S. Bitterman,William G. La Cava,Nan Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces Fairness-Aware Survival Modeling (FASM) to reduce intra- and cross-group risk misranking over time in survival analysis, demonstrated on SEER breast cancer data with maintained predictive performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clinical data carry structural inequities and biases; misranking across groups (e.g., Black vs White) can lead to inequitable care. Survival analysis adds censoring and time dynamics, making fairness harder. There is a need for methods that address both intra- and cross-group risk rankings over time.

Method: Develop FASM to mitigate algorithmic bias in both intra-group and cross-group risk rankings across time. Apply FASM to SEER breast cancer data. Evaluate fairness over a 10-year horizon using time-stratified analyses, comparing fairness and discrimination with fairness-unaware models.

Result: FASM substantially improves fairness while preserving discrimination (predictive) performance comparable to fairness-unaware models. Time-stratified evaluations show stable fairness over a 10-year horizon, with the greatest improvements during the mid-term follow-up.

Conclusion: FASM enables survival models that balance accuracy and equity, reinforcing fairness as a core principle in clinical decision-making and potentially reducing disparities in breast cancer prognosis and care.

Abstract: As machine learning models become increasingly integrated into healthcare,
structural inequities and social biases embedded in clinical data can be
perpetuated or even amplified by data-driven models. In survival analysis,
censoring and time dynamics can further add complexity to fair model
development. Additionally, algorithmic fairness approaches often overlook
disparities in cross-group rankings, e.g., high-risk Black patients may be
ranked below lower-risk White patients who do not experience the event of
mortality. Such misranking can reinforce biological essentialism and undermine
equitable care. We propose a Fairness-Aware Survival Modeling (FASM), designed
to mitigate algorithmic bias regarding both intra-group and cross-group risk
rankings over time. Using breast cancer prognosis as a representative case and
applying FASM to SEER breast cancer data, we show that FASM substantially
improves fairness while preserving discrimination performance comparable to
fairness-unaware survival models. Time-stratified evaluations show that FASM
maintains stable fairness over a 10-year horizon, with the greatest
improvements observed during the mid-term of follow-up. Our approach enables
the development of survival models that prioritize both accuracy and equity in
clinical decision-making, advancing fairness as a core principle in clinical
care.

*Subham Kumar,Prakrithi Shivaprakash,Koustav Rudra,Lekhansh Shukla,Animesh Mukherjee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Graph neural network GRACE for predicting locus of care in addiction treatment, addressing class imbalance with an unbiased meta-graph; shows 11-35% improvement in minority-class F1 on real data; code and embeddings released.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Determining the appropriate locus of care for addiction patients is critical but constrained by limited specialized resources. Existing decision methods suffer from severe class imbalance in addiction datasets, necessitating an automated framework to improve decision quality and resource use.

Method: Formalizes locus-of-care prediction as a structured learning problem using a graph neural network (GRACE). Performs extensive feature engineering and introduces an unbiased meta-graph to train the GNN and mitigate class imbalance.

Result: Real-world experiments show an 11-35% improvement in F1 score for the minority class over competitive baselines.

Conclusion: The GRACE framework demonstrates the potential of graph-based, structured learning to improve locus-of-care decisions under resource constraints, and the authors provide code and note embeddings for reproducibility.

Abstract: Determining the appropriate locus of care for addiction patients is one of
the most critical clinical decisions that affects patient treatment outcomes
and effective use of resources. With a lack of sufficient specialized treatment
resources, such as inpatient beds or staff, there is an unmet need to develop
an automated framework for the same. Current decision-making approaches suffer
from severe class imbalances in addiction datasets. To address this limitation,
we propose a novel graph neural network (GRACE) framework that formalizes locus
of care prediction as a structured learning problem. Further, we perform
extensive feature engineering and propose a new approach of obtaining an
unbiased meta-graph to train a GNN to overcome the class imbalance problem.
Experimental results in real-world data show an improvement of 11-35% in terms
of the F1 score of the minority class over competitive baselines. The codes and
note embeddings are available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/GRACE-F8E1/.

### [167] [MS-BART: Unified Modeling of Mass Spectra and Molecules for Structure Elucidation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20615)
*Yang Han,Pengyu Wang,Kai Yu,Xin Chen,Lu Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MS-BART introduces a unified cross-modal pretraining framework that maps mass spectra and molecular structures into a shared token space, enabling robust structure elucidation from MS data. It achieves state-of-the-art performance on key metrics, runs substantially faster than diffusion-based methods, and uses a chemical-feedback mechanism to reduce molecular hallucinations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Elucidating molecular structures from mass spectrometry (MS) data is challenging due to limited annotated spectra, data scarcity, and the heterogeneity of raw spectra. There is a need to leverage large-scale pretraining to improve generalization, but cross-domain spectral complexity hinders straightforward adaptation.

Method: MS-BART maps mass spectra and molecular structures into a shared token vocabulary to enable cross-modal pretraining on fingerprint–molecule datasets. It uses multi-task pretraining with denoising and translation objectives, and transfers to experimental spectra by finetuning on fingerprint predictions from MIST (a pre-trained spectral inference model). A chemical feedback mechanism guides outputs toward reference structures, addressing molecular hallucination. The model is evaluated with ablations, and compared against diffusion-based methods on MassSpecGym and NPLIB1 datasets.

Result: MS-BART achieves state-of-the-art performance on 5 out of 12 key metrics across MassSpecGym and NPLIB1. It is faster by about an order of magnitude compared to competing diffusion-based approaches. Ablation studies validate the contributions of cross-modal pretraining, multi-task objectives, fingerprint-level finetuning, and chemical feedback for robustness and accuracy.

Conclusion: Cross-modal pretraining that aligns spectra and chemical structures in a shared token space can significantly improve MS-based structure elucidation. The combination of finetuning on fingerprint predictions and a chemical feedback loop mitigates distributional shifts and hallucination, yielding robust performance and runtime advantages over diffusion-based methods; future work could further refine alignment and reduce remaining hallucinations.

Abstract: Mass spectrometry (MS) plays a critical role in molecular identification,
significantly advancing scientific discovery. However, structure elucidation
from MS data remains challenging due to the scarcity of annotated spectra.
While large-scale pretraining has proven effective in addressing data scarcity
in other domains, applying this paradigm to mass spectrometry is hindered by
the complexity and heterogeneity of raw spectral signals. To address this, we
propose MS-BART, a unified modeling framework that maps mass spectra and
molecular structures into a shared token vocabulary, enabling cross-modal
learning through large-scale pretraining on reliably computed
fingerprint-molecule datasets. Multi-task pretraining objectives further
enhance MS-BART's generalization by jointly optimizing denoising and
translation task. The pretrained model is subsequently transferred to
experimental spectra through finetuning on fingerprint predictions generated
with MIST, a pre-trained spectral inference model, thereby enhancing robustness
to real-world spectral variability. While finetuning alleviates the
distributional difference, MS-BART still suffers molecular hallucination and
requires further alignment. We therefore introduce a chemical feedback
mechanism that guides the model toward generating molecules closer to the
reference structure. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that MS-BART achieves
SOTA performance across 5/12 key metrics on MassSpecGym and NPLIB1 and is
faster by one order of magnitude than competing diffusion-based methods, while
comprehensive ablation studies systematically validate the model's
effectiveness and robustness.

### [168] [A Scalable, Causal, and Energy Efficient Framework for Neural Decoding with Spiking Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20683)
*Georgios Mentzelopoulos,Ioannis Asmanis,Konrad P. Kording,Eva L. Dyer,Kostas Daniilidis,Flavia Vitale*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Spikachu is a scalable, causal, energy-efficient spiking neural network decoder for brain-computer interfaces that processes binned spikes in a shared latent space to achieve competitive performance with orders of magnitude energy savings, and supports few-shot transfer across sessions and subjects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deliver real-time, low-power neural decoding for BCIs while maintaining generalization and scalability, addressing limitations of simple causal models and complex offline non-causal models that are energy-intensive.

Method: A Spiking Neural Network-based decoding framework that directly processes binned spikes, projects them into a shared latent space, uses timing-adapted spiking modules to extract features, integrates latent representations, and decodes behavioral predictions. Evaluated on 113 sessions from 6 non-human primates (~43 hours). Compared to causal baselines, showing much lower energy consumption (2.26x to 418.81x) and improved performance with multi-session training enabling few-shot transfer.

Result: Spikachu outperforms causal baselines in single-session settings while consuming significantly less energy. Scaling training across multiple sessions and subjects improves performance and enables few-shot transfer to unseen sessions, subjects, and tasks.

Conclusion: Spikachu demonstrates that a scalable, online-compatible SNN-based decoder can achieve competitive decoding performance with substantially reduced energy consumption, making it a strong candidate for real-world, battery-powered BCI deployments.

Abstract: Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) promise to enable vital functions, such as
speech and prosthetic control, for individuals with neuromotor impairments.
Central to their success are neural decoders, models that map neural activity
to intended behavior. Current learning-based decoding approaches fall into two
classes: simple, causal models that lack generalization, or complex, non-causal
models that generalize and scale offline but struggle in real-time settings.
Both face a common challenge, their reliance on power-hungry artificial neural
network backbones, which makes integration into real-world, resource-limited
systems difficult. Spiking neural networks (SNNs) offer a promising
alternative. Because they operate causally these models are suitable for
real-time use, and their low energy demands make them ideal for
battery-constrained environments. To this end, we introduce Spikachu: a
scalable, causal, and energy-efficient neural decoding framework based on SNNs.
Our approach processes binned spikes directly by projecting them into a shared
latent space, where spiking modules, adapted to the timing of the input,
extract relevant features; these latent representations are then integrated and
decoded to generate behavioral predictions. We evaluate our approach on 113
recording sessions from 6 non-human primates, totaling 43 hours of recordings.
Our method outperforms causal baselines when trained on single sessions using
between 2.26 and 418.81 times less energy. Furthermore, we demonstrate that
scaling up training to multiple sessions and subjects improves performance and
enables few-shot transfer to unseen sessions, subjects, and tasks. Overall,
Spikachu introduces a scalable, online-compatible neural decoding framework
based on SNNs, whose performance is competitive relative to state-of-the-art
models while consuming orders of magnitude less energy.

### [169] [On Optimal Hyperparameters for Differentially Private Deep Transfer Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20616)
*Aki Rehn,Linzh Zhao,Mikko A. Heikkilä,Antti Honkela*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: In DP transfer learning, the common hyperparameters C (clip bound) and B (batch size) show a theory-vs-practice mismatch: larger C can help under strong privacy, contrary to the belief that smaller C is always better for privacy. Batch-size heuristics fail under fixed compute, while cumulative DP noise better explains performance. Across tasks, a single (C,B) setting hurts results, with bigger drops when moving between privacy and compute regimes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and improve hyperparameter tuning for differentially private fine-tuning of large pretrained models, specifically how clipping bound and batch size interact with privacy constraints and compute budgets, and why theory and empirical results diverge.

Method: Theoretical and empirical analysis of DP-SGD with varying clip bound C and batch size B under different privacy budgets and fixed compute. Examine gradient distributions, clipping as gradient re-weighting, and accumulation of DP noise (cumulative DP). Evaluate across tasks to see cross-task effects of using a single (C,B).

Result: There is a clear mismatch between theory and practice: stronger privacy does not necessarily require smaller C; larger C can improve performance under strong privacy due to changes in gradient distributions. Existing heuristics for B tuning fail under fixed compute budgets; cumulative DP noise provides a better explanation for when smaller versus larger batches are advantageous. Using a single (C,B) across tasks leads to suboptimal performance and larger performance drops when transitioning between privacy regimes and compute regimes. Clipping acts as a form of gradient re-weighting, which, together with cumulative DP noise, explains these trends.

Conclusion: Hyperparameter tuning for DP transfer learning should account for gradient distribution changes and cumulative DP noise, and must be adapted per task and regime (privacy vs compute). One-size-fits-all (C,B) settings are suboptimal; developing DP-aware tuning strategies that consider how clipping reweights gradients and how DP noise accumulates is crucial for robust performance across tasks and privacy/compute regimes.

Abstract: Differentially private (DP) transfer learning, i.e., fine-tuning a pretrained
model on private data, is the current state-of-the-art approach for training
large models under privacy constraints. We focus on two key hyperparameters in
this setting: the clipping bound $C$ and batch size $B$. We show a clear
mismatch between the current theoretical understanding of how to choose an
optimal $C$ (stronger privacy requires smaller $C$) and empirical outcomes
(larger $C$ performs better under strong privacy), caused by changes in the
gradient distributions. Assuming a limited compute budget (fixed epochs), we
demonstrate that the existing heuristics for tuning $B$ do not work, while
cumulative DP noise better explains whether smaller or larger batches perform
better. We also highlight how the common practice of using a single $(C,B)$
setting across tasks can lead to suboptimal performance. We find that
performance drops especially when moving between loose and tight privacy and
between plentiful and limited compute, which we explain by analyzing clipping
as a form of gradient re-weighting and examining cumulative DP noise.

### [170] [H-SPLID: HSIC-based Saliency Preserving Latent Information Decomposition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20627)
*Lukas Miklautz,Chengzhi Shi,Andrii Shkabrii,Theodoros Thirimachos Davarakis,Prudence Lam,Claudia Plant,Jennifer Dy,Stratis Ioannidis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: H-SPLID learns salient and non-salient features in separate latent spaces, producing compact, task-relevant representations; robustness to perturbations is upper-bounded by the salient subspace dimension and HSIC, with empirical gains on image classification showing reduced sensitivity to background perturbations; code is released.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance robustness and generalization by explicitly disentangling salient features from nuisance features, linking robustness to latent representation compression via a measurable dependence (HSIC).

Method: Introduce H-SPLID, an algorithm that explicitly decomposes representations into salient and non-salient subspaces. Derive an upper bound on expected prediction deviation under input perturbations that depends on the salient subspace dimension and the HSIC between inputs and representations. Validate empirically on image classification, showing models favor salient components.

Result: The paper establishes a theoretical bound tying robustness to the dimensionality of salient representations and their dependence with inputs via HSIC. Empirically, models trained with H-SPLID rely more on salient input components and exhibit reduced sensitivity to perturbations/changes in non-salient features (e.g., backgrounds).

Conclusion: H-SPLID provides a principled framework for learning robust, compact representations by separating salient from non-salient features, with a proven perturbation bound and empirical evidence; code is publicly available for replication.

Abstract: We introduce H-SPLID, a novel algorithm for learning salient feature
representations through the explicit decomposition of salient and non-salient
features into separate spaces. We show that H-SPLID promotes learning
low-dimensional, task-relevant features. We prove that the expected prediction
deviation under input perturbations is upper-bounded by the dimension of the
salient subspace and the Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC) between
inputs and representations. This establishes a link between robustness and
latent representation compression in terms of the dimensionality and
information preserved. Empirical evaluations on image classification tasks show
that models trained with H-SPLID primarily rely on salient input components, as
indicated by reduced sensitivity to perturbations affecting non-salient
features, such as image backgrounds. Our code is available at
https://github.com/neu-spiral/H-SPLID.

### [171] [Unsupervised Anomaly Prediction with N-BEATS and Graph Neural Network in Multi-variate Semiconductor Process Time Series](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20718)
*Daniel Sorensen,Bappaditya Dey,Minjin Hwang,Sandip Halder*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Forecast-based anomaly prediction for semiconductor manufacturing using univariate N-BEATS and a Graph Neural Network to capture inter-variable dependencies; GNN achieves higher accuracy with fewer parameters, enabling online anomaly forecasting for proactive fault prevention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-dimensional, imbalanced, and interdependent multivariate time-series data in semiconductor fabrication make fault prediction challenging; advancing from anomaly detection to proactive anomaly prediction enables real-time process correction and prevention.

Method: Two-stage approach: (a) train a forecasting model on data assumed anomaly-free; (b) forecast on unseen data and flag anomalies where observed deviations exceed a threshold. Two variants: (1) univariate N-BEATS assuming variable independence; (2) Graph Neural Network capturing inter-variable relationships.

Result: Forecasting performance up to 20 time steps; anomaly prediction remains stable up to 50 time steps. The GNN consistently outperforms N-BEATS and does so with significantly fewer trainable parameters and lower computational cost.

Conclusion: Graph-based online anomaly forecasting is a promising solution for manufacturing, enabling real-time process correction and proactive fault prevention.

Abstract: Semiconductor manufacturing is an extremely complex and precision-driven
process, characterized by thousands of interdependent parameters collected
across diverse tools and process steps. Multi-variate time-series analysis has
emerged as a critical field for real-time monitoring and fault detection in
such environments. However, anomaly prediction in semiconductor fabrication
presents several critical challenges, including high dimensionality of sensor
data and severe class imbalance due to the rarity of true faults. Furthermore,
the complex interdependencies between variables complicate both anomaly
prediction and root-cause-analysis. This paper proposes two novel approaches to
advance the field from anomaly detection to anomaly prediction, an essential
step toward enabling real-time process correction and proactive fault
prevention. The proposed anomaly prediction framework contains two main stages:
(a) training a forecasting model on a dataset assumed to contain no anomalies,
and (b) performing forecast on unseen time series data. The forecast is
compared with the forecast of the trained signal. Deviations beyond a
predefined threshold are flagged as anomalies. The two approaches differ in the
forecasting model employed. The first assumes independence between variables by
utilizing the N-BEATS model for univariate time series forecasting. The second
lifts this assumption by utilizing a Graph Neural Network (GNN) to capture
inter-variable relationships. Both models demonstrate strong forecasting
performance up to a horizon of 20 time points and maintain stable anomaly
prediction up to 50 time points. The GNN consistently outperforms the N-BEATS
model while requiring significantly fewer trainable parameters and lower
computational cost. These results position the GNN as promising solution for
online anomaly forecasting to be deployed in manufacturing environments.

*Yujia Zheng,Zhuokai Zhao,Zijian Li,Yaqi Xie,Mingze Gao,Lizhu Zhang,Kun Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A latent 'thought communication' paradigm for multi-agent systems that identifies and transfers hidden thoughts (latent variables) to improve cooperation, with nonparametric identifiability guarantees and a practical framework, validated on synthetic and real data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Natural language is lossy and ambiguous, limiting collective intelligence. To unlock cooperation beyond surface-level language, this work proposes direct mind-to-mind thought communication, underpinned by theory that latent thoughts can be identified and shared even without auxiliary information, and a framework to extract and assign thoughts to agents.

Method: Formulate the problem as a general latent variable model where agent states are generated by underlying thoughts; prove identifiability of both shared and private latent thoughts between any pair of agents in a nonparametric setting without auxiliary information; infer the global structure of thought sharing; develop a framework that extracts latent thoughts from all agents before communication and assigns relevant thoughts to each agent with sharing patterns; extend beyond LLMs to all modalities.

Result: Theoretical guarantees of identifiability and recoverable thought-sharing structure; empirical validation on synthetic and real-world benchmarks showing collaborative advantages of thought communication.

Conclusion: The work highlights a hidden layer of information that can enhance coordination beyond surface observations; many challenges remain unsolved with surface data alone, regardless of compute or data scale; the paradigm extends beyond LLMs to all modalities and may generalize to various observational domains.

Abstract: Natural language has long enabled human cooperation, but its lossy,
ambiguous, and indirect nature limits the potential of collective intelligence.
While machines are not subject to these constraints, most LLM-based multi-agent
systems still rely solely on natural language, exchanging tokens or their
embeddings. To go beyond language, we introduce a new paradigm, thought
communication, which enables agents to interact directly mind-to-mind, akin to
telepathy. To uncover these latent thoughts in a principled way, we formalize
the process as a general latent variable model, where agent states are
generated by an unknown function of underlying thoughts. We prove that, in a
nonparametric setting without auxiliary information, both shared and private
latent thoughts between any pair of agents can be identified. Moreover, the
global structure of thought sharing, including which agents share which
thoughts and how these relationships are structured, can also be recovered with
theoretical guarantees. Guided by the established theory, we develop a
framework that extracts latent thoughts from all agents prior to communication
and assigns each agent the relevant thoughts, along with their sharing
patterns. This paradigm naturally extends beyond LLMs to all modalities, as
most observational data arise from hidden generative processes. Experiments on
both synthetic and real-world benchmarks validate the theory and demonstrate
the collaborative advantages of thought communication. We hope this work
illuminates the potential of leveraging the hidden world, as many challenges
remain unsolvable through surface-level observation alone, regardless of
compute or data scale.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LLMs/LMMs enable task-oriented autonomous communications in 6G by integrating multimodal sensing, adaptive reconfiguration, and prompting/fine-tuning; demonstrated in traffic control, robot scheduling, and environment-aware channel estimation with superior robustness and performance over traditional DL methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of traditional discriminative DL and static optimization in dynamic, multimodal wireless environments; need for adaptable, reasoning-based autonomy in 6G networks.

Method: Propose a framework combining LLMs/LMMs for multimodal sensing integration and adaptive system reconfiguration; apply three case studies to illustrate; compare against conventional DL methods.

Result: LLM/LMM-aided systems significantly outperform conventional/discriminative DL approaches, maintain robustness under dynamic objectives, input variations, and heterogeneous multimodal data.

Conclusion: LLM/LMM-driven autonomous communications are promising for future 6G, enabling resilient, context-aware wireless tasks; further research needed on integration, prompting strategies, and real-time constraints.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) and large multimodal models (LMMs) have achieved
unprecedented breakthrough, showcasing remarkable capabilities in natural
language understanding, generation, and complex reasoning. This transformative
potential has positioned them as key enablers for 6G autonomous communications
among machines, vehicles, and humanoids. In this article, we provide an
overview of task-oriented autonomous communications with LLMs/LMMs, focusing on
multimodal sensing integration, adaptive reconfiguration, and
prompt/fine-tuning strategies for wireless tasks. We demonstrate the framework
through three case studies: LMM-based traffic control, LLM-based robot
scheduling, and LMM-based environment-aware channel estimation. From
experimental results, we show that the proposed LLM/LMM-aided autonomous
systems significantly outperform conventional and discriminative deep learning
(DL) model-based techniques, maintaining robustness under dynamic objectives,
varying input parameters, and heterogeneous multimodal conditions where
conventional static optimization degrades.

TL;DR: Attention-enhanced DiRecGNN ranks entities to decide which attributes to monitor for cloud services; achieves 43.1% MRR gain; users rate usefulness 4.5/5.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the problem of selecting a subset of attributes (dimensions) to monitor with a watchdog in production cloud services; overcome data sparsity and long-range dependencies in monitor heterogeneous graphs.

Method: Propose DiRecGNN with multi-head attention over heterogeneous neighbors and attributes; uses random-walk sampled paths to capture long-range dependencies; transformer-inspired attention; multi-faceted loss to handle sparsity and optimize relevance of recommendations.

Result: Empirical evaluations show significant improvements over baselines, including 43.1% increase in MRR.

Conclusion: Feature is useful to product teams; deployment yields practical insights; attention-based relational modeling is effective for attribute subset recommendations in cloud monitoring.

Abstract: In this paper, we present DiRecGNN, an attention-enhanced entity
recommendation framework for monitoring cloud services at Microsoft. We provide
insights on the usefulness of this feature as perceived by the cloud service
owners and lessons learned from deployment. Specifically, we introduce the
problem of recommending the optimal subset of attributes (dimensions) that
should be tracked by an automated watchdog (monitor) for cloud services. To
begin, we construct the monitor heterogeneous graph at production-scale. The
interaction dynamics of these entities are often characterized by limited
structural and engagement information, resulting in inferior performance of
state-of-the-art approaches. Moreover, traditional methods fail to capture the
dependencies between entities spanning a long range due to their homophilic
nature. Therefore, we propose an attention-enhanced entity ranking model
inspired by transformer architectures. Our model utilizes a multi-head
attention mechanism to focus on heterogeneous neighbors and their attributes,
and further attends to paths sampled using random walks to capture long-range
dependencies. We also employ multi-faceted loss functions to optimize for
relevant recommendations while respecting the inherent sparsity of the data.
Empirical evaluations demonstrate significant improvements over existing
methods, with our model achieving a 43.1% increase in MRR. Furthermore, product
teams who consumed these features perceive the feature as useful and rated it
4.5 out of 5.

*Shiva Sreeram,Alaa Maalouf,Pratyusha Sharma,Daniela Rus*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LASER pruning can boost downstream accuracy without fine-tuning by selective rank reduction; this work speeds up LASER by focusing on key matrices, using gradient signals to pick matrices, clustering rows into multiple subspaces for factorization, and using only 100 samples for evaluation; overall yields fast, robust adaptation with up to 24.6 pp gain.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Original LASER requires exhaustive per-matrix search with full dataset passes, which is impractical for rapid deployment; need efficient, gradient-guided, data-efficient method to adapt LLMs to downstream tasks without gradient-based fine-tuning.

Method: 1) identify a small subset of matrices to inspect instead of layer-by-layer sweep; 2) use the gradient of each matrix’s singular values to indicate which matrices matter; 3) enlarge factorization search by clustering matrix rows into multiple subspaces and decompose each cluster; 4) evaluate using just 100 samples for gradient calculation and final accuracy to reduce search time; 5) combine these steps into a single-step gradient adaptation with minimal sweeps.

Result: Achieves up to 24.6 percentage point improvement in downstream accuracy; reduces search time; demonstrates strong adaptation with one gradient step on 100 examples and a quick scan of candidates, without fine-tuning.

Conclusion: Proposes a fast, robust, data-efficient adaptation algorithm for downstream tasks via criterion-driven matrix pruning/factorization, enabling near-immediate deployment of LLMs without gradient-based fine-tuning.

Abstract: Recently, Sharma et al. suggested a method called Layer-SElective-Rank
reduction (LASER) which demonstrated that pruning high-order components of
carefully chosen LLM's weight matrices can boost downstream accuracy -- without
any gradient-based fine-tuning. Yet LASER's exhaustive, per-matrix search (each
requiring full-dataset forward passes) makes it impractical for rapid
deployment. We demonstrate that this overhead can be removed and find that: (i)
Only a small, carefully chosen subset of matrices needs to be inspected --
eliminating the layer-by-layer sweep, (ii) The gradient of each matrix's
singular values pinpoints which matrices merit reduction, (iii) Increasing the
factorization search space by allowing matrices rows to cluster around multiple
subspaces and then decomposing each cluster separately further reduces
overfitting on the original training data and further lifts accuracy by up to
24.6 percentage points, and finally, (iv) we discover that evaluating on just
100 samples rather than the full training data -- both for computing the
indicative gradients and for measuring the final accuracy -- suffices to
further reduce the search time; we explain that as adaptation to downstream
tasks is dominated by prompting style, not dataset size. As a result, we show
that combining these findings yields a fast and robust adaptation algorithm for
downstream tasks. Overall, with a single gradient step on 100 examples and a
quick scan of the top candidate layers and factorization techniques, we can
adapt LLMs to new datasets -- entirely without fine-tuning.

### [176] [Connecting Jensen-Shannon and Kullback-Leibler Divergences: A New Bound for Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20644)
*Reuben Dorent,Polina Golland,William Wells III*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Derives a tight, tractable lower bound on KL divergence as a function of Jensen-Shannon divergence, tying JSD-based objectives to a guaranteed lower bound on mutual information (MI); shows cross-entropy training for a joint vs marginal classifier recovers a variational bound on JSD; empirically, the bound is tight for MI estimation and yields a stable, low-variance MI estimator, with practical benefits in Information Bottleneck and MI-based representation learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mutual information is a foundational measure in representation learning, but its direct computation via KL divergence is often intractable. While JSD-based, discriminative objectives are popular surrogates, their connection to MI is unclear. This work seeks a theoretical and practical link by bounding KL divergence in terms of JSD, thereby validating JSD-based methods as MI surrogates.

Method: Develop a new, tight, and tractable lower bound on KL divergence as a function of JSD in the general case. Specialize the bound to joint and marginal distributions to show that maximizing JSD-based information increases a guaranteed lower bound on MI. Revisit practical JSD-based objectives: show that cross-entropy loss of a binary classifier distinguishing joint from marginal pairs recovers a known variational lower bound on the JSD. Conduct extensive experiments comparing the bound to state-of-the-art neural estimators of variational lower bounds across established reference scenarios, demonstrating tightness and low variance. Apply the bound within the Information Bottleneck framework to illustrate practical usefulness.

Result: The proposed lower bound is tight and provides a stable, low-variance estimator of a lower bound on MI. It offers theoretical justification for using discriminative (JSD-based) objectives in MI-based representation learning and demonstrates empirical benefits across standard MI estimation benchmarks and the Information Bottleneck context.

Conclusion: The work provides both theoretical justification and empirical evidence that discriminative JSD-based objectives can reliably bound MI from below. This strengthens the use of JSD-based surrogates in MI-based representation learning and supports their integration with Information Bottleneck methods.

Abstract: Mutual Information (MI) is a fundamental measure of statistical dependence
widely used in representation learning. While direct optimization of MI via its
definition as a Kullback-Leibler divergence (KLD) is often intractable, many
recent methods have instead maximized alternative dependence measures, most
notably, the Jensen-Shannon divergence (JSD) between joint and product of
marginal distributions via discriminative losses. However, the connection
between these surrogate objectives and MI remains poorly understood. In this
work, we bridge this gap by deriving a new, tight, and tractable lower bound on
KLD as a function of JSD in the general case. By specializing this bound to
joint and marginal distributions, we demonstrate that maximizing the JSD-based
information increases a guaranteed lower bound on mutual information.
Furthermore, we revisit the practical implementation of JSD-based objectives
and observe that minimizing the cross-entropy loss of a binary classifier
trained to distinguish joint from marginal pairs recovers a known variational
lower bound on the JSD. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our lower bound
is tight when applied to MI estimation. We compared our lower bound to
state-of-the-art neural estimators of variational lower bound across a range of
established reference scenarios. Our lower bound estimator consistently
provides a stable, low-variance estimate of a tight lower bound on MI. We also
demonstrate its practical usefulness in the context of the Information
Bottleneck framework. Taken together, our results provide new theoretical
justifications and strong empirical evidence for using discriminative learning
in MI-based representation learning.

### [177] [xTime: Extreme Event Prediction with Hierarchical Knowledge Distillation and Expert Fusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20651)
*Quan Li,Wenchao Yu,Suhang Wang,Minhua Lin,Lingwei Chen,Wei Cheng,Haifeng Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: xTime introduces a knowledge-distillation-driven, mixture-of-experts framework for extreme-event forecasting in time series, addressing data imbalance and leveraging intermediate events to boost rare-event accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extreme events in domains like climate and healthcare can have severe consequences. Most forecasting models optimize overall performance and miss rare extremes due to data imbalance and underutilization of informative intermediate events.

Method: xTime employs two key components: (1) knowledge distillation from models trained on lower-rarity events to transfer information to rarer extremes; (2) a mixture-of-experts mechanism that dynamically selects and fuses outputs from expert models across different rarity levels to improve extreme-event forecasts.

Result: Experiments on multiple datasets show consistent improvements in extreme-event forecasting. Extreme-event accuracy improves substantially, with reported gains ranging from about 3% to 78% across datasets.

Conclusion: The xTime framework effectively tackles data imbalance and exploits information from preceding intermediate events; its knowledge distillation and MoE components yield substantial improvements in extreme-event forecasting.

Abstract: Extreme events frequently occur in real-world time series and often carry
significant practical implications. In domains such as climate and healthcare,
these events, such as floods, heatwaves, or acute medical episodes, can lead to
serious consequences. Accurate forecasting of such events is therefore of
substantial importance. Most existing time series forecasting models are
optimized for overall performance within the prediction window, but often
struggle to accurately predict extreme events, such as high temperatures or
heart rate spikes. The main challenges are data imbalance and the neglect of
valuable information contained in intermediate events that precede extreme
events. In this paper, we propose xTime, a novel framework for extreme event
forecasting in time series. xTime leverages knowledge distillation to transfer
information from models trained on lower-rarity events, thereby improving
prediction performance on rarer ones. In addition, we introduce a mixture of
experts (MoE) mechanism that dynamically selects and fuses outputs from expert
models across different rarity levels, which further improves the forecasting
performance for extreme events. Experiments on multiple datasets show that
xTime achieves consistent improvements, with forecasting accuracy on extreme
events improving from 3% to 78%.

### [178] [Bayesian Jammer Localization with a Hybrid CNN and Path-Loss Mixture of Experts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20666)
*Mariona Jaramillo-Civill,Luis González-Gudiño,Tales Imbiriba,Pau Closas*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A hybrid Bayesian mixture-of-experts combines a physics-based path-loss model with a CNN to localize GNSS jammers and reconstruct the RSS field in urban areas, with uncertainty quantified via Laplace approximation; experiments show improved localization and focused uncertainty near critical propagation regions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GNSS signals are easily jammed, especially in cities where multipath and shadowing distort signal strength. Existing data-driven approaches give reasonable localization but fail to reconstruct the RSS field well due to limited spatial context; a physically consistent, context-aware model is needed.

Method: A hybrid mixture-of-experts framework fuses a physical path-loss (PL) model and a CNN through log-linear pooling. The PL expert enforces physical consistency; the CNN uses building-height maps to capture urban propagation effects. Bayesian inference with a Laplace approximation yields posterior distributions over jammer position and the RSS field.

Result: On urban ray-tracing data, localization accuracy improves as more training points are used, and the posterior uncertainty decreases. Uncertainty concentrates near the jammer and along urban canyons where propagation is most sensitive to changes in position.

Conclusion: The proposed physics-informed Bayesian framework improves RSS-field reconstruction and jammer localization in urban GNSS scenarios, providing meaningful uncertainty quantification and leveraging urban geometry via building-height maps.

Abstract: Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) signals are vulnerable to jamming,
particularly in urban areas where multipath and shadowing distort received
power. Previous data-driven approaches achieved reasonable localization but
poorly reconstructed the received signal strength (RSS) field due to limited
spatial context. We propose a hybrid Bayesian mixture-of-experts framework that
fuses a physical path-loss (PL) model and a convolutional neural network (CNN)
through log-linear pooling. The PL expert ensures physical consistency, while
the CNN leverages building-height maps to capture urban propagation effects.
Bayesian inference with Laplace approximation provides posterior uncertainty
over both the jammer position and RSS field. Experiments on urban ray-tracing
data show that localization accuracy improves and uncertainty decreases with
more training points, while uncertainty concentrates near the jammer and along
urban canyons where propagation is most sensitive.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A constructive blueprint linking masked multimodal representation learning, unified architectures, interactive generative systems, and memory-augmented memory to form robust world models; not a survey, but a guided roadmap.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Provide a practical guide to building world models, unify disparate strands of work, and emphasize a core architecture consisting of generative core, interactive loop, and memory system.

Method: Conceptual synthesis and narrative progression: identify a sequence from early masked multimodal representations to unified architectures, then to interactive generative loops and finally to memory-augmented systems; explicitly bypass loosely related branches to focus on core components.

Result: A coherent roadmap and justification for pursuing a unified world-model paradigm, arguing that the outlined progression is the most promising path toward true world models.

Conclusion: If followed, the roadmap should advance the development of robust, persistent world models by centering on the generative core, the action-perception loop, and memory for consistency over time.

Abstract: This is not a typical survey of world models; it is a guide for those who
want to build worlds. We do not aim to catalog every paper that has ever
mentioned a ``world model". Instead, we follow one clear road: from early
masked models that unified representation learning across modalities, to
unified architectures that share a single paradigm, then to interactive
generative models that close the action-perception loop, and finally to
memory-augmented systems that sustain consistent worlds over time. We bypass
loosely related branches to focus on the core: the generative heart, the
interactive loop, and the memory system. We show that this is the most
promising path towards true world models.

### [180] [MEIcoder: Decoding Visual Stimuli from Neural Activity by Leveraging Most Exciting Inputs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20762)
*Jan Sobotka,Luca Baroni,Ján Antolík*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MEIcoder is a biologically informed decoder that uses neuron-specific most exciting inputs (MEIs), an SSIM loss, and adversarial training to reconstruct visual stimuli from sparse neural activity. It sets state-of-the-art performance on V1 with small datasets and scales to thousands of neurons with limited data, and it introduces a large unified benchmark to spur future work.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning decoding from neural data is often hampered by scarcity, especially in primates/humans. Biological priors (MEIs) and robust training goals can enable reliable image reconstruction from limited recordings, advancing neuroscience and neuroengineering applications.

Method: MEIcoder leverages neuron-specific MEIs as guiding inputs, optimizes with a structural similarity index (SSIM) loss, and incorporates adversarial training to improve perceptual quality. The authors perform ablation to show MEIs are the main driver and demonstrate scaling to 1,000–2,500 neurons with fewer than 1,000 training samples; they also propose a unified benchmark with >160k samples.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction of visual stimuli from single-cell activity in V1, particularly excelling on small datasets; MEIs identified as the primary driver of performance; scalable to larger neural populations with limited data; provides a substantial benchmarking dataset to facilitate future research.

Conclusion: The approach demonstrates the feasibility of reliable visual decoding in the early visual system under data constraints and offers practical guidance for neuroscience and neuroengineering, along with a standardized benchmark to accelerate progress.

Abstract: Decoding visual stimuli from neural population activity is crucial for
understanding the brain and for applications in brain-machine interfaces.
However, such biological data is often scarce, particularly in primates or
humans, where high-throughput recording techniques, such as two-photon imaging,
remain challenging or impossible to apply. This, in turn, poses a challenge for
deep learning decoding techniques. To overcome this, we introduce MEIcoder, a
biologically informed decoding method that leverages neuron-specific most
exciting inputs (MEIs), a structural similarity index measure loss, and
adversarial training. MEIcoder achieves state-of-the-art performance in
reconstructing visual stimuli from single-cell activity in primary visual
cortex (V1), especially excelling on small datasets with fewer recorded
neurons. Using ablation studies, we demonstrate that MEIs are the main drivers
of the performance, and in scaling experiments, we show that MEIcoder can
reconstruct high-fidelity natural-looking images from as few as 1,000-2,500
neurons and less than 1,000 training data points. We also propose a unified
benchmark with over 160,000 samples to foster future research. Our results
demonstrate the feasibility of reliable decoding in early visual system and
provide practical insights for neuroscience and neuroengineering applications.

### [181] [Separating the what and how of compositional computation to enable reuse and continual learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20709)
*Haozhe Shan,Sun Minni,Lea Duncker*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A two-system continual learning framework for RNNs: a 'what' system infers the computation (epoch structure) via a probabilistic generative model; a 'how' system implements it with context-driven low-rank RNN components. Learned online on single trials; enables continual learning without forgetting and fast generalization to new tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understand mechanisms enabling continual learning and flexible recomposition of skills; study how to infer task structure and implement it efficiently in neural networks.

Method: Two-system architecture: what system uses unsupervised online learning to learn a generative model of task epochs, incremental vocabulary, and time-varying context inference; how system is an RNN with low-rank components whose assembly is dictated by inferred context; demonstration on a set of compositional cognitive tasks.

Result: Shows competitive performance, supports forward/backward transfer, and fast compositional generalization to unseen tasks; demonstrates potential to mitigate catastrophic forgetting.

Conclusion: Proposes a framework that enables continual learning and compositional reuse by coupling probabilistic inference of task structure with modular, context-driven network components; a promising direction for scalable generalization in continual learning.

Abstract: The ability to continually learn, retain and deploy skills to accomplish
goals is a key feature of intelligent and efficient behavior. However, the
neural mechanisms facilitating the continual learning and flexible
(re-)composition of skills remain elusive. Here, we study continual learning
and the compositional reuse of learned computations in recurrent neural network
(RNN) models using a novel two-system approach: one system that infers what
computation to perform, and one that implements how to perform it. We focus on
a set of compositional cognitive tasks commonly studied in neuroscience. To
construct the what system, we first show that a large family of tasks can be
systematically described by a probabilistic generative model, where
compositionality stems from a shared underlying vocabulary of discrete task
epochs. The shared epoch structure makes these tasks inherently compositional.
We first show that this compositionality can be systematically described by a
probabilistic generative model. Furthermore, We develop an unsupervised online
learning approach that can learn this model on a single-trial basis, building
its vocabulary incrementally as it is exposed to new tasks, and inferring the
latent epoch structure as a time-varying computational context within a trial.
We implement the how system as an RNN whose low-rank components are composed
according to the context inferred by the what system. Contextual inference
facilitates the creation, learning, and reuse of low-rank RNN components as new
tasks are introduced sequentially, enabling continual learning without
catastrophic forgetting. Using an example task set, we demonstrate the efficacy
and competitive performance of this two-system learning framework, its
potential for forward and backward transfer, as well as fast compositional
generalization to unseen tasks.

*Fardin Ganjkhanloo,Emmett Springer,Erik H. Hoyer,Daniel L. Young,Kimia Ghobadi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CSO models on JHFRAT with EHR data improve inpatient fall risk prediction (AUC 0.91 vs 0.86), with XGBoost at 0.94 but CSO offers robustness and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Align fall risk scoring with clinically meaningful measures, improve predictive performance, and maintain interpretability while leveraging EHR data.

Method: Retrospective cohort of 54,209 inpatient admissions across three Johns Hopkins hospitals; 20,208 high-risk and 13,941 low-risk; apply constrained score optimization (CSO) models on JHFRAT and extra EHR vars; compare to JHFRAT and XGBoost; assess robustness to risk labeling.

Result: CSO AUC-ROC 0.91 vs JHFRAT 0.86; CSO with/without EHR vars similar; XGBoost AUC 0.94; CSO more robust to label variations.

Conclusion: Data-driven constrained scoring can robustly improve inpatient fall risk assessment and resource allocation while preserving interpretability, supporting safer care delivery.

Abstract: In this study we aim to better align fall risk prediction from the Johns
Hopkins Fall Risk Assessment Tool (JHFRAT) with additional clinically
meaningful measures via a data-driven modelling approach. We conducted a
retrospective analysis of 54,209 inpatient admissions from three Johns Hopkins
Health System hospitals between March 2022 and October 2023. A total of 20,208
admissions were included as high fall risk encounters, and 13,941 were included
as low fall risk encounters. To incorporate clinical knowledge and maintain
interpretability, we employed constrained score optimization (CSO) models on
JHFRAT assessment data and additional electronic health record (EHR) variables.
The model demonstrated significant improvements in predictive performance over
the current JHFRAT (CSO AUC-ROC=0.91, JHFRAT AUC-ROC=0.86). The constrained
score optimization models performed similarly with and without the EHR
variables. Although the benchmark black-box model (XGBoost), improves upon the
performance metrics of the knowledge-based constrained logistic regression
(AUC-ROC=0.94), the CSO demonstrates more robustness to variations in risk
labelling. This evidence-based approach provides a robust foundation for health
systems to systematically enhance inpatient fall prevention protocols and
patient safety using data-driven optimization techniques, contributing to
improved risk assessment and resource allocation in healthcare settings.

*Jasmine Bayrooti,Sattar Vakili,Amanda Prorok,Carl Henrik Ek*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: No-regret guarantees for Thompson sampling in episodic RL with Gaussian marginal models, achieving tilde O(sqrt(K H Γ(KH))).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To strengthen the theoretical foundations of Thompson sampling in reinforcement learning, addressing complex temporal structure and non-Gaussian value functions by using Gaussian process priors over rewards and transitions.

Method: Prove regret bound for Thompson sampling in episodic RL with joint GP priors over rewards and transitions; extend elliptical potential lemma to multi-output settings; address non-Gaussian value functions and the recursive Bellman updates, resulting in a finite-horizon regret bound depending on GP complexity Γ(KH).

Result: Regret bound tilde O(sqrt(K H Γ(KH))) over K episodes of horizon H; Γ captures the GP model complexity of the underlying priors; analysis handles non-Gaussian value functions and multi-output Bellman updates.

Conclusion: Advances the theoretical understanding of Thompson sampling in reinforcement learning, illustrating how model structure and uncertainty quantification influence performance in finite-horizon MDPs and guiding future work on GP-based RL algorithms.

Abstract: Thompson sampling (TS) is a powerful and widely used strategy for sequential
decision-making, with applications ranging from Bayesian optimization to
reinforcement learning (RL). Despite its success, the theoretical foundations
of TS remain limited, particularly in settings with complex temporal structure
such as RL. We address this gap by establishing no-regret guarantees for TS
using models with Gaussian marginal distributions. Specifically, we consider TS
in episodic RL with joint Gaussian process (GP) priors over rewards and
transitions. We prove a regret bound of
$\mathcal{\tilde{O}}(\sqrt{KH\Gamma(KH)})$ over $K$ episodes of horizon $H$,
where $\Gamma(\cdot)$ captures the complexity of the GP model. Our analysis
addresses several challenges, including the non-Gaussian nature of value
functions and the recursive structure of Bellman updates, and extends classical
tools such as the elliptical potential lemma to multi-output settings. This
work advances the understanding of TS in RL and highlights how structural
assumptions and model uncertainty shape its performance in finite-horizon
Markov Decision Processes.

*Tsai Hor Chan,Feng Wu,Yihang Chen,Guosheng Yin,Lequan Yu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A Dirichlet process–driven multimodal learning framework that balances intra-modal expressiveness with cross-modal alignment by modelling each modality as a DP-weighted Gaussian mixture, enabling adaptive feature selection and improved fusion across datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To preserve rich representations within each modality while enabling cross-modal interactions; conventional alignment-focused approaches can over-regularize and degrade intra-modal information. The Dirichlet process offers a richer-gets-richer mechanism to emphasize prominent features and allocate contributions dynamically.

Method: Each modality is treated as a mixture of multivariate Gaussians. A Dirichlet process is used to infer the mixture weights, allowing DP to dynamically allocate and emphasize prominent features (rich-get-richer). This framework facilitates multimodal fusion by balancing intra-modal representation learning and cross-modal alignment. The approach includes ablation studies and evaluations on multiple multimodal datasets, with code released at the provided GitHub URL.

Result: The proposed DP-driven framework achieves superior performance compared with baseline competitors on several multimodal datasets. Ablation analyses substantiate the effectiveness of DP in facilitating alignment while preserving intra-modal representations; the results are robust to key hyperparameters.

Conclusion: A DP-driven multimodal learning paradigm can automatically balance prominent intra-modal representations with cross-modal alignment, leveraging the DP's rich-get-richer property to emphasize important features. The approach shows strong empirical gains and is complemented by ablation studies and a publicly available implementation.

Abstract: Developing effective multimodal fusion approaches has become increasingly
essential in many real-world scenarios, such as health care and finance. The
key challenge is how to preserve the feature expressiveness in each modality
while learning cross-modal interactions. Previous approaches primarily focus on
the cross-modal alignment, while over-emphasis on the alignment of marginal
distributions of modalities may impose excess regularization and obstruct
meaningful representations within each modality. The Dirichlet process (DP)
mixture model is a powerful Bayesian non-parametric method that can amplify the
most prominent features by its richer-gets-richer property, which allocates
increasing weights to them. Inspired by this unique characteristic of DP, we
propose a new DP-driven multimodal learning framework that automatically
achieves an optimal balance between prominent intra-modal representation
learning and cross-modal alignment. Specifically, we assume that each modality
follows a mixture of multivariate Gaussian distributions and further adopt DP
to calculate the mixture weights for all the components. This paradigm allows
DP to dynamically allocate the contributions of features and select the most
prominent ones, leveraging its richer-gets-richer property, thus facilitating
multimodal feature fusion. Extensive experiments on several multimodal datasets
demonstrate the superior performance of our model over other competitors.
Ablation analysis further validates the effectiveness of DP in aligning
modality distributions and its robustness to changes in key hyperparameters.

*Anna Mészáros,Patrik Reizinger,Ferenc Huszár*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Transformers can generalize to some rule-based, compositional aspects of chess and solve many OOD puzzles, but still lag behind explicit search-based symbolic AIs in Chess960; training dynamics suggest emergent compositional understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Evaluate whether modern chess transformers learn underlying rules and compositional generalization beyond training distributions; assess OOD generalization and variant handling; compare with symbolic AI and human play.

Method: Train a 270M-parameter chess Transformer; design out-of-distribution tests to probe rule extrapolation; evaluate on Chess960; compare against symbolic AI search-based algorithms; play against Lichess users; analyze training dynamics (e.g., early emergence of moving only own pieces).

Result: Evidence of compositional generalization and rule extrapolation; strong performance on OOD puzzles; Chess960 results show basic strategy adaptation but inferior to symbolic AI; the gap narrows when playing humans on Lichess; training dynamics indicate an emergent understanding, with initial bias to moving only the model's own pieces.

Conclusion: Transformers capture some rule-based generalization but rely on heuristics and do not yet replace explicit search in complex or highly varied settings; results motivate hybrid approaches and deeper study of emergent learning dynamics in game-playing agents.

Abstract: Chess is a canonical example of a task that requires rigorous reasoning and
long-term planning. Modern decision Transformers - trained similarly to LLMs -
are able to learn competent gameplay, but it is unclear to what extent they
truly capture the rules of chess. To investigate this, we train a 270M
parameter chess Transformer and test it on out-of-distribution scenarios,
designed to reveal failures of systematic generalization. Our analysis shows
that Transformers exhibit compositional generalization, as evidenced by strong
rule extrapolation: they adhere to fundamental syntactic rules of the game by
consistently choosing valid moves even in situations very different from the
training data. Moreover, they also generate high-quality moves for OOD puzzles.
In a more challenging test, we evaluate the models on variants including
Chess960 (Fischer Random Chess) - a variant of chess where starting positions
of pieces are randomized. We found that while the model exhibits basic strategy
adaptation, they are inferior to symbolic AI algorithms that perform explicit
search, but gap is smaller when playing against users on Lichess. Moreover, the
training dynamics revealed that the model initially learns to move only its own
pieces, suggesting an emergent compositional understanding of the game.

*Liang Ye,Shengqin Chen,Jiazhu Dai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: BadGraph is a backdoor attack on latent diffusion models for text-guided graph generation, enabling attacker-specified subgraphs when triggers appear, with low poisoning and stealthy performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text-guided graph generation via diffusion models poses new security risks. Backdoor vulnerabilities in such conditional graph generation, especially for drug-related domains, are underexplored and require defense.

Method: The attack poisons training data with textual triggers, implanting backdoors during VAE and diffusion model training (not pretraining). At inference, triggers induce attacker-specified subgraphs in generated graphs while preserving normal performance on clean inputs.

Result: Experiments on PubChem, ChEBI-20, PCDes, MoMu show that with less than 10% poisoning rate, attack success can reach 50%; with 24% poisoning, success exceeds 80%, and benign performance is largely unaffected. Ablations show the backdoor is implanted during VAE and diffusion training.

Conclusion: Latent diffusion models for text-guided graph generation are susceptible to covert backdoor attacks with practical poisoning levels, posing serious risks in applications like drug discovery; defenses against such backdoors are needed.

Abstract: The rapid progress of graph generation has raised new security concerns,
particularly regarding backdoor vulnerabilities. While prior work has explored
backdoor attacks in image diffusion and unconditional graph generation,
conditional, especially text-guided graph generation remains largely
unexamined. This paper proposes BadGraph, a backdoor attack method targeting
latent diffusion models for text-guided graph generation. BadGraph leverages
textual triggers to poison training data, covertly implanting backdoors that
induce attacker-specified subgraphs during inference when triggers appear,
while preserving normal performance on clean inputs. Extensive experiments on
four benchmark datasets (PubChem, ChEBI-20, PCDes, MoMu) demonstrate the
effectiveness and stealth of the attack: less than 10% poisoning rate can
achieves 50% attack success rate, while 24% suffices for over 80% success rate,
with negligible performance degradation on benign samples. Ablation studies
further reveal that the backdoor is implanted during VAE and diffusion training
rather than pretraining. These findings reveal the security vulnerabilities in
latent diffusion models of text-guided graph generation, highlight the serious
risks in models' applications such as drug discovery and underscore the need
for robust defenses against the backdoor attack in such diffusion models.

### [187] [KL-Regularized Reinforcement Learning is Designed to Mode Collapse](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20817)
*Anthony GX-Chen,Jatin Prakash,Jeff Guo,Rob Fergus,Rajesh Ranganath*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: KL direction (forward vs reverse) in RL with KL regularization does not simply map to mode-seeking vs mass-covering. The optimal target distribution is shaped by the regularization coefficient and reward/reference scales; common settings tend to yield unimodal, non-diverse targets. A simple, scalable algorithm can steer toward a high-quality, multi-mode distribution by minimal reward adjustments, improving both LLMs and chemical language models without extra diversity signals, and working with either KL direction when tuned.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenge the conventional wisdom that reverse KL implies mode-seeking and forward KL implies mass-covering in RL with KL regularization, and understand how these dynamics affect diversity and quality in language and chemical language models. Provide a principled method to achieve diverse, high-quality sampling without external signals.

Method: Theoretically analyze how KL direction and regularization shape the optimal target distribution and how factors like regularization strength and reward/reference scales impact mode coverage. Identify conditions (e.g., low regularization, equal rewards) that lead to unimodal targets. Propose a simple, scalable algorithm that minimally perturbs rewards to steer toward a target distribution placing high probability on all high-quality modes. Validate empirically by post-training Large Language Models and Chemical Language Models, measuring quality and diversity across forward/reverse KL settings.

Result: The analysis shows that KL direction alone does not guarantee mode behavior in RL; mode coverage depends on regularization strength and reward/reference scales. Under common settings, targets are unimodal, limiting diversity. The proposed algorithm successfully post-trains models to achieve higher solution quality and diversity without external diversity signals, effective for both forward and reverse KL when properly tuned; naive applications fail.

Conclusion: KL direction and regularization jointly determine the target distribution in RL-based generation. Appropriate tuning enables diverse, high-quality sampling without external diversity prompts. The authors provide a simple, scalable, theoretically grounded method compatible with both forward and reverse KL, demonstrated on LLMs and chemical language models.

Abstract: It is commonly believed that optimizing the reverse KL divergence results in
"mode seeking", while optimizing forward KL results in "mass covering", with
the latter being preferred if the goal is to sample from multiple diverse
modes. We show -- mathematically and empirically -- that this intuition does
not necessarily transfer well to doing reinforcement learning with
reverse/forward KL regularization (e.g. as commonly used with language models).
Instead, the choice of reverse/forward KL determines the family of optimal
target distributions, parameterized by the regularization coefficient. Mode
coverage depends primarily on other factors, such as regularization strength,
and relative scales between rewards and reference probabilities. Further, we
show commonly used settings such as low regularization strength and equal
verifiable rewards tend to specify unimodal target distributions, meaning the
optimization objective is, by construction, non-diverse. We leverage these
insights to construct a simple, scalable, and theoretically justified
algorithm. It makes minimal changes to reward magnitudes, yet optimizes for a
target distribution which puts high probability over all high-quality sampling
modes. In experiments, this simple modification works to post-train both Large
Language Models and Chemical Language Models to have higher solution quality
and diversity, without any external signals of diversity, and works with both
forward and reverse KL when using either naively fails.

### [188] [A Quantum-Inspired Algorithm for Solving Sudoku Puzzles and the MaxCut Problem](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19835)
*Max B. Zhao,Fei Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Quantum-inspired MPS/DMRG approach solves QUBO/Ising problems by evolving a Matrix Product State under a driver-plus-problem Hamiltonian, successfully finding global minima on Sudoku-like and MaxCut instances, with good scalability and generalizability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: QUBO/Ising problems are computationally hard; there is a need for scalable, versatile solvers that can locate global minima. Quantum-inspired methods, leveraging MPS and tunneling-like dynamics, may enhance exploration beyond classical local optimizers.

Method: Represent the solution as a Matrix Product State (MPS). Apply a discrete driving schedule with a driver Hamiltonian that includes a transverse field, intertwined with the problem Hamiltonian to enable spin flips and tunneling. Update the MPS using standard Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) sweeps to minimize energy. Test on challenging Sudoku instances with ~200+ spins and long-range couplings; then apply to MaxCut instances from Biq Mac library up to 251 nodes and 3,265 edges.

Result: The approach reliably identifies global minima across diverse QUBO instances, not merely near-optimal solutions, demonstrating effectiveness on both Sudoku-like problems and sizeable MaxCut problems.

Conclusion: Quantum-inspired MPS/DMRG methods offer scalable, generalizable solvers for large-scale QUBO/Ising problems, with potential industrial applicability and advantages over some classical heuristics.

Abstract: We propose and evaluate a quantum-inspired algorithm for solving Quadratic
Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problems, which are mathematically
equivalent to finding ground states of Ising spin-glass Hamiltonians. The
algorithm employs Matrix Product States (MPS) to compactly represent large
superpositions of spin configurations and utilizes a discrete driving schedule
to guide the MPS toward the ground state. At each step, a driver Hamiltonian --
incorporating a transverse magnetic field -- is combined with the problem
Hamiltonian to enable spin flips and facilitate quantum tunneling. The MPS is
updated using the standard Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) method,
which iteratively minimizes the system's energy via multiple sweeps across the
spin chain. Despite its heuristic nature, the algorithm reliably identifies
global minima, not merely near-optimal solutions, across diverse QUBO
instances. We first demonstrate its effectiveness on intermediate-level Sudoku
puzzles from publicly available sources, involving over $200$ Ising spins with
long-range couplings dictated by constraint satisfaction. We then apply the
algorithm to MaxCut problems from the Biq Mac library, successfully solving
instances with up to $251$ nodes and $3,265$ edges. We discuss the advantages
of this quantum-inspired approach, including its scalability, generalizability,
and suitability for industrial-scale QUBO applications.

### [189] [Benchmarking Reasoning Reliability in Artificial Intelligence Models for Energy-System Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19836)
*Eliseo Curcio*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Analytical Reliability Benchmark (ARB) to quantify reasoning reliability in large language models for energy system analysis, moving beyond predictive accuracy to assess logical integrity and policy alignment using a reproducible, multi-metric framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is no standardized framework to evaluate whether AI-driven conclusions in energy forecasting/optimization are logically consistent, causally valid, and policy-aligned. Current validation focuses on accuracy or efficiency, neglecting reasoning quality and transparency.

Method: ARB combines five submetrics—accuracy, reasoning reliability, uncertainty discipline, policy consistency, and transparency—and tests models under deterministic, probabilistic, and epistemic scenarios using open technoeconomic datasets (NREL ATB 2024, DOE H2A/H2New, IEA WEO 2024). Four frontier models (GPT-4/5, Claude 4.5 Sonnet, Gemini 2.5 Pro, Llama 3 70B) are evaluated under identical factual and regulatory conditions.

Result: Reasoning reliability can be objectively measured. GPT-4/5 and Claude 4.5 Sonnet achieve Analytical Reliability Index > 90 with consistent and policy-compliant reasoning; Gemini 2.5 Pro shows moderate stability; Llama 3 70B remains below professional thresholds. Statistical validation confirms these differences are significant and reproducible.

Conclusion: ARB provides the first quantitative method in the energy literature for verifying causal, probabilistic, and policy-driven reasoning in AI systems, offering a reference framework for trustworthy and transparent analytical applications in the global energy transition.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence and machine learning are increasingly used for
forecasting, optimization, and policy design in the energy sector, yet no
standardized framework exists to evaluate whether these systems reason
correctly. Current validation practices focus on predictive accuracy or
computational efficiency, leaving the logical integrity of analytical
conclusions untested. This study introduces the Analytical Reliability
Benchmark (ARB), a reproducible framework that quantifies reasoning reliability
in large language models applied to energy system analysis. The benchmark
integrates five submetrics: accuracy, reasoning reliability, uncertainty
discipline, policy consistency, and transparency, and evaluates model
performance across deterministic, probabilistic, and epistemic scenarios using
open technoeconomic datasets (NREL ATB 2024, DOE H2A/H2New, IEA WEO 2024). Four
frontier models (GPT-4/5, Claude 4.5 Sonnet, Gemini 2.5 Pro, Llama 3 70B) were
tested under identical factual and regulatory conditions. Results show that
reasoning reliability can be objectively measured. GPT-4/5 and Claude 4.5
Sonnet achieved consistent and policy-compliant reasoning (Analytical
Reliability Index greater than 90), Gemini 2.5 Pro demonstrated moderate
stability, and Llama 3 70B remained below professional thresholds. Statistical
validation confirmed that these differences are significant and reproducible.
The ARB establishes the first quantitative method in the energy literature for
verifying causal, probabilistic, and policy-driven reasoning in artificial
intelligence systems, providing a reference framework for trustworthy and
transparent analytical applications in the global energy transition.

*Shiqi He,Yue Cui,Xinyu Ma,Yaliang Li,Bolin Ding,Mosharaf Chowdhury*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Branch-and-Browse offers a fine-grained, memory-enabled web-agent framework that uses tree-structured subtask exploration, web-state replay, and a page action memory to enable multi-branch reasoning with improved efficiency; on WebArena it achieves 35.8% task success and up to 40% faster execution than state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM-based web agents struggle with deep multi-step reasoning, backtracking, and efficiency; vanilla linear methods fail at multi-step reasoning; coarse-grained or costly search strategies hinder practical embodied reasoning on open web environments.

Method: Introduce Branch-and-Browse: a unified framework combining structured reasoning-acting, contextual memory, and efficient execution. Key components include (i) explicit subtask management with tree-structured exploration for controllable multi-branch reasoning, (ii) efficient web state replay with background reasoning to bootstrap exploration, and (iii) a page action memory that shares explored actions within and across sessions.

Result: On the WebArena benchmark, Branch-and-Browse achieves a task success rate of 35.8% and reduces execution time by up to 40.4% relative to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: Branch-and-Browse demonstrates a reliable and efficient framework for LLm-based web agents, enabling deeper, more efficient, and more controllable embodied reasoning in open web environments.

Abstract: Autonomous web agents powered by large language models (LLMs) show strong
potential for performing goal-oriented tasks such as information retrieval,
report generation, and online transactions. These agents mark a key step toward
practical embodied reasoning in open web environments. However, existing
approaches remain limited in reasoning depth and efficiency: vanilla linear
methods fail at multi-step reasoning and lack effective backtracking, while
other search strategies are coarse-grained and computationally costly. We
introduce Branch-and-Browse, a fine-grained web agent framework that unifies
structured reasoning-acting, contextual memory, and efficient execution. It (i)
employs explicit subtask management with tree-structured exploration for
controllable multi-branch reasoning, (ii) bootstraps exploration through
efficient web state replay with background reasoning, and (iii) leverages a
page action memory to share explored actions within and across sessions. On the
WebArena benchmark, Branch-and-Browse achieves a task success rate of 35.8\%
and reduces execution time by up to 40.4\% relative to state-of-the-art
methods. These results demonstrate that Branch-and-Browse is a reliable and
efficient framework for LLM-based web agents.

*Yuanhe Zhang,Ilja Kuzborskij,Jason D. Lee,Chenlei Leng,Fanghui Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A DAG-based formalization of chain-of-thought for LLMs with a new metric 'logical closeness' and a DAG-MATH CoT benchmark; reveals gaps between final answers and rule-consistent derivations across LLMs; code available.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand whether CoT's gains come from search, rote procedures, or rule-consistent reasoning; to move beyond PASS@k with a framework that evaluates rule-consistency; provide diagnostics for LLM reasoning.

Method: Model CoT as a rule-based stochastic process on directed acyclic graphs (DAGs); nodes are intermediate derivation states; edges encode rule applications. Introduce 'logical closeness' to quantify how well a model's CoT trajectory adheres to the DAG structure. Define DAG-MATH CoT format and build a benchmark guiding LLMs to generate CoT trajectories in this format.

Result: Across standard mathematical reasoning datasets, there are statistically significant differences in reasoning fidelity among representative LLM families even when PASS@k is comparable; final-answer accuracy can diverge from derivation quality, highlighting gaps between end results and rule-consistent derivations.

Conclusion: The framework offers a middle ground between free-form CoT and formal proofs, providing actionable diagnostics for evaluating LLM reasoning. The DAG-MATH CoT benchmark and code enable reproducible assessment and diagnostics.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate strong performance on mathematical
problems when prompted with Chain-of-Thought (CoT), yet it remains unclear
whether this success stems from search, rote procedures, or rule-consistent
reasoning. To address this, we propose modeling CoT as a certain rule-based
stochastic process over directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), where nodes represent
intermediate derivation states and edges encode rule applications. Within this
framework, we introduce logical closeness, a metric that quantifies how well a
model's CoT trajectory (i.e., the LLM's final output) adheres to the DAG
structure, providing evaluation beyond classical PASS@k metrics. Building on
this, we introduce the DAG-MATH CoT format and construct a benchmark that
guides LLMs to generate CoT trajectories in this format, thereby enabling the
evaluation of their reasoning ability under our framework. Across standard
mathematical reasoning datasets, our analysis uncovers statistically
significant differences in reasoning fidelity among representative LLM
families-even when PASS@k is comparable-highlighting gaps between final-answer
accuracy and rule-consistent derivation. Our framework provides a balance
between free-form CoT and formal proofs systems, offering actionable
diagnostics for LLMs reasoning evaluation. Our benchmark and code are available
at: https://github.com/YuanheZ/DAG-MATH-Formatted-CoT.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A visual-only, unified architecture (Surfer 2) achieves state-of-the-art cross-platform automation across web, desktop, and mobile, outperforming prior methods and humans on multiple benchmarks without task-specific fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cross-platform automation is hampered by environment-specific interfaces; enabling reliable control using only visual observations would enable general-purpose deployment without platform-specific adapters.

Method: Surfer 2 uses a unified architecture with hierarchical context management, decoupled planning and execution, and self-verification with adaptive recovery, operating entirely from visual inputs to handle long-horizon tasks.

Result: Achieves 97.1% accuracy on WebVoyager, 69.6% on WebArena, 60.1% on OSWorld, and 87.1% on AndroidWorld; outperforms all prior systems without task-specific fine-tuning; with multiple attempts, surpasses human performance on all benchmarks.

Conclusion: Systematic orchestration enhances foundation-model capabilities for general-purpose computer control via visual interaction, suggesting a need for next-generation vision-language models to maximize cost-efficiency.

Abstract: Building agents that generalize across web, desktop, and mobile environments
remains an open challenge, as prior systems rely on environment-specific
interfaces that limit cross-platform deployment. We introduce Surfer 2, a
unified architecture operating purely from visual observations that achieves
state-of-the-art performance across all three environments. Surfer 2 integrates
hierarchical context management, decoupled planning and execution, and
self-verification with adaptive recovery, enabling reliable operation over long
task horizons. Our system achieves 97.1% accuracy on WebVoyager, 69.6% on
WebArena, 60.1% on OSWorld, and 87.1% on AndroidWorld, outperforming all prior
systems without task-specific fine-tuning. With multiple attempts, Surfer 2
exceeds human performance on all benchmarks. These results demonstrate that
systematic orchestration amplifies foundation model capabilities and enables
general-purpose computer control through visual interaction alone, while
calling for a next-generation vision language model to achieve Pareto-optimal
cost-efficiency.

*Joseph Meyer,Divyansha Lachi,Reza Mohammadi,Roshan Reddy Upendra,Eva L. Dyer,Mark Li,Tom Palczewski*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RELATE provides a schema-agnostic, plug-and-play feature encoder for heterogeneous temporal graphs, enabling scalable, multi-modal node representations with strong parameter efficiency and near-parity to schema-specific encoders.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address scalability and parameter-sharing challenges in GNNs that use schema-specific feature encoders for heterogeneous graphs with multiple modalities, by enabling a single, reusable encoder across node types and schemas.

Method: Shared modality-specific encoders for categorical, numerical, textual, and temporal data feed into a Perceiver-style cross-attention module that produces fixed-size, permutation-invariant node embeddings, which can be plugged into any general-purpose GNN.

Result: On RelBench using ReLGNN and HGT backbones, achieving within 3% of schema-specific encoders while reducing parameters by up to 5x.

Conclusion: The approach enables handling varying schemas and supports multi-dataset pretraining, contributing toward foundation-model-like capabilities for relational graph data.

Abstract: Relational multi-table data is common in domains such as e-commerce,
healthcare, and scientific research, and can be naturally represented as
heterogeneous temporal graphs with multi-modal node attributes. Existing graph
neural networks (GNNs) rely on schema-specific feature encoders, requiring
separate modules for each node type and feature column, which hinders
scalability and parameter sharing. We introduce RELATE (Relational Encoder for
Latent Aggregation of Typed Entities), a schema-agnostic, plug-and-play feature
encoder that can be used with any general purpose GNN. RELATE employs shared
modality-specific encoders for categorical, numerical, textual, and temporal
attributes, followed by a Perceiver-style cross-attention module that
aggregates features into a fixed-size, permutation-invariant node
representation. We evaluate RELATE on ReLGNN and HGT in the RelBench benchmark,
where it achieves performance within 3% of schema-specific encoders while
reducing parameter counts by up to 5x. This design supports varying schemas and
enables multi-dataset pretraining for general-purpose GNNs, paving the way
toward foundation models for relational graph data.

### [194] [A new wave of vehicle insurance fraud fueled by generative AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19957)
*Amir Hever,Itai Orr*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Generative AI enables scalable, realistic insurance fraud (deepfakes, forged documents) in vehicle claims; existing defenses are limited, and a layered UVeye solution is proposed to detect, deter, and mitigate AI-driven fraud.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Insurance fraud costs tens of billions annually and is exacerbated by generative AI tools that produce realistic accident evidence, damaging the integrity of claims and increasing losses.

Method: The paper analyzes AI-enabled fraud vectors (deepfake images/videos, forged documents) and advocates a layered UVeye approach combining detection and verification processes to counter these scams, while acknowledging an ongoing arms race with adversaries.

Result: Proposes an architecture and strategy (layered UVeye solution) to detect, mitigate, and deter AI-driven vehicle fraud; claims progress but provides no empirical results in the abstract.

Conclusion: AI-enabled insurance fraud remains an ongoing challenge; a robust, layered defense is necessary, and the UVeye solution represents a significant step forward, albeit with unresolved issues like false positives/negatives and evolving attacker tactics.

Abstract: Generative AI is supercharging insurance fraud by making it easier to falsify
accident evidence at scale and in rapid time. Insurance fraud is a pervasive
and costly problem, amounting to tens of billions of dollars in losses each
year. In the vehicle insurance sector, fraud schemes have traditionally
involved staged accidents, exaggerated damage, or forged documents. The rise of
generative AI, including deepfake image and video generation, has introduced
new methods for committing fraud at scale. Fraudsters can now fabricate highly
realistic crash photos, damage evidence, and even fake identities or documents
with minimal effort, exploiting AI tools to bolster false insurance claims.
Insurers have begun deploying countermeasures such as AI-based deepfake
detection software and enhanced verification processes to detect and mitigate
these AI-driven scams. However, current mitigation strategies face significant
limitations. Detection tools can suffer from false positives and negatives, and
sophisticated fraudsters continuously adapt their tactics to evade automated
checks. This cat-and-mouse arms race between generative AI and detection
technology, combined with resource and cost barriers for insurers, means that
combating AI-enabled insurance fraud remains an ongoing challenge. In this
white paper, we present UVeye layered solution for vehicle fraud, representing
a major leap forward in the ability to detect, mitigate and deter this new wave
of fraud.

*Nitsa J Herzog,Rejwan Bin Sulaiman,David J Herzog,Rose Fong*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AI-based prediction of student academic success from leadership personality traits using ML; Random Forest achieved up to ~87% accuracy on 17 traits plus leadership score (vs ~85.7% without it) in 129 Environmental Engineering master's students.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable early identification of students’ strengths and weaknesses for personalized learning by predicting academic outcomes from leadership-related personality traits using machine learning.

Method: Collected data from 129 master's students in Environmental Engineering who completed five leadership personality tests (23 traits) and self-assessments (Personality Insight; Workplace Culture; Motivation at Work; Management Skills; Emotion Control). Grades were merged with test results. Performed exploratory data analysis and correlation analysis. Feature selection via Pearson correlations. Labels: fail, pass, excellent. Evaluated multiple ML models (SVM, Logistic Regression, KNN, Decision Tree, Gradient Boosting, Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM); tuned models; compared with and without a leadership mark feature.

Result: Random Forest yielded the highest predictive accuracy: 87.50% with 17 personality traits plus leadership mark, and 85.71% without the leadership mark.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that leadership-related personality traits can support early assessment of student strengths and weaknesses, enabling personalized learning strategies, with RF providing strong predictive performance among tested algorithms.

Abstract: The study explores the potential of AI technologies in personalized learning,
suggesting the prediction of academic success through leadership personality
traits and machine learning modelling. The primary data were obtained from 129
master's students in the Environmental Engineering Department, who underwent
five leadership personality tests with 23 characteristics. Students used
self-assessment tools that included Personality Insight, Workplace Culture,
Motivation at Work, Management Skills, and Emotion Control tests. The test
results were combined with the average grade obtained from academic reports.
The study employed exploratory data analysis and correlation analysis. Feature
selection utilized Pearson correlation coefficients of personality traits. The
average grades were separated into three categories: fail, pass, and excellent.
The modelling process was performed by tuning seven ML algorithms, such as SVM,
LR, KNN, DT, GB, RF, XGBoost and LightGBM. The highest predictive performance
was achieved with the RF classifier, which yielded an accuracy of 87.50% for
the model incorporating 17 personality trait features and the leadership mark
feature, and an accuracy of 85.71% for the model excluding this feature. In
this way, the study offers an additional opportunity to identify students'
strengths and weaknesses at an early stage of their education process and
select the most suitable strategies for personalized learning.

*Antonio Norelli,Michael Bronstein*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A protocol enables hiding a coherent text inside another of the same length using 8B-parameter LLMs, enabling local encoding/decoding; raises AI-safety and trust concerns about covert messaging and authorial intent.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Investigate text steganography via LLMs and its implications for trust in communication and the semantics of LLM knowledge; highlight potential misuse (covert unfiltered deployment).

Method: Proposes a simple, efficient protocol to encode/decode a message of equal length into a cover text using modest open-source LLMs; demonstrates local encoding/decoding on a laptop in seconds.

Result: The protocol can encode a message as long as the abstract and decode it locally with high-quality results using ~8B parameters; performance is fast and practical.

Conclusion: Decoupling text from authorial intent erodes trust in written communication and raises urgent AI-safety questions about model deployment and what it means for a model to 'know' something; suggests need for safeguards against covert use of safe models to emit unfiltered outputs.

Abstract: A meaningful text can be hidden inside another, completely different yet
still coherent and plausible, text of the same length. For example, a tweet
containing a harsh political critique could be embedded in a tweet that
celebrates the same political leader, or an ordinary product review could
conceal a secret manuscript. This uncanny state of affairs is now possible
thanks to Large Language Models, and in this paper we present a simple and
efficient protocol to achieve it. We show that even modest 8-billion-parameter
open-source LLMs are sufficient to obtain high-quality results, and a message
as long as this abstract can be encoded and decoded locally on a laptop in
seconds. The existence of such a protocol demonstrates a radical decoupling of
text from authorial intent, further eroding trust in written communication,
already shaken by the rise of LLM chatbots. We illustrate this with a concrete
scenario: a company could covertly deploy an unfiltered LLM by encoding its
answers within the compliant responses of a safe model. This possibility raises
urgent questions for AI safety and challenges our understanding of what it
means for a Large Language Model to know something.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address high-stakes finance by delivering proactive, trustworthy investment insights while meeting data sensitivity and regulatory constraints.

Method: A component-based orchestration layer routes between internal and external LLMs based on data sensitivity; a hybrid retrieval pipeline uses OpenSearch and finance-domain embeddings; a multi-stage recommender combines rule heuristics, sequential behavioral modeling, and contextual bandits; deploys on-premises using Docker Swarm and vLLM on 24 NVIDIA H100 GPUs; safety is enforced via grounding and layered QA.

Result: Demonstrates grounded generation with explicit routing and layered safety; measured as trustworthy AI insights through human QA and system metrics in a real retail finance setting.

Conclusion: It's feasible to deliver proactive, trustworthy investment insights in high-stakes finance with on-prem architecture, explicit routing, and layered safety controls.

Abstract: We present AI PB, a production-scale generative agent deployed in real retail
finance. Unlike reactive chatbots that answer queries passively, AI PB
proactively generates grounded, compliant, and user-specific investment
insights. It integrates (i) a component-based orchestration layer that
deterministically routes between internal and external LLMs based on data
sensitivity, (ii) a hybrid retrieval pipeline using OpenSearch and the
finance-domain embedding model, and (iii) a multi-stage recommendation
mechanism combining rule heuristics, sequential behavioral modeling, and
contextual bandits. Operating fully on-premises under Korean financial
regulations, the system employs Docker Swarm and vLLM across 24 X NVIDIA H100
GPUs. Through human QA and system metrics, we demonstrate that grounded
generation with explicit routing and layered safety can deliver trustworthy AI
insights in high-stakes finance.

*Gyuyeon Na,Minjung Park,Hyeonjeong Cha,Sangmi Chai*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: HCLA is a human-centered multi-agent system that makes anomaly detection in digital asset transactions more interpretable and interactive by coupling an NL-driven parsing/detection/explanation workflow with an XGBoost detector; it preserves accuracy while providing feature-grounded narrative explanations on a Wasabi Wallet Bitcoin-mixing dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transparency and accessibility in financial forensics: non-experts should be able to ask questions in natural language and receive understandable, feature-grounded rationales; also to translate user intents into detector schemas for improved trust.

Method: Three-agent roles (Parsing, Detection, Explanation) form a conversational loop in an open-source web UI. User intents are translated into a detector schema (XGBoost used in prototype) and accompanied by narrative explanations grounded in features. Evaluated on a labeled Wasabi Wallet Bitcoin-mixing dataset (2020–2024).

Result: Baseline detector achieves strong accuracy; HCLA adds interpretability and allows interactive refinement without sacrificing performance. Architecture, interaction loop, dataset, and evaluation protocol are described, along with limitations.

Conclusion: A human-in-the-loop design enhances transparency and trust in financial forensics by making anomaly detection more explainable and controllable for non-experts.

Abstract: We present HCLA, a human-centered multi-agent system for anomaly detection in
digital asset transactions. The system links three roles: Parsing, Detection,
and Explanation, into a conversational workflow that lets non-experts ask
questions in natural language, inspect structured analytics, and obtain
context-aware rationales. Implemented with an open-source web UI, HCLA
translates user intents into a schema for a classical detector (XGBoost in our
prototype) and returns narrative explanations grounded in the underlying
features. On a labeled Bitcoin mixing dataset (Wasabi Wallet, 2020-2024), the
baseline detector reaches strong accuracy, while HCLA adds interpretability and
interactive refinement. We describe the architecture, interaction loop,
dataset, evaluation protocol, and limitations, and discuss how a
human-in-the-loop design improves transparency and trust in financial
forensics.

### [199] [The Verification-Value Paradox: A Normative Critique of Gen AI in Legal Practice](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20109)
*Joshua Yuvaraj*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A normative argument for a new paradigm in AI-assisted legal practice, introducing the “verification-value paradox”: efficiency gains from AI are counterbalanced by a greater need for manual verification due to AI’s disconnection from reality and opacity, leading to an emphasis on truthfulness and civic responsibility in law education and practice.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The surge of generative AI in law promises cost savings, but documented missteps where lawyers rely on erroneous AI outputs threaten legal integrity; a new framework is needed to align AI use with professional duties and avoid misleading courts.

Method: Normative-analytic approach that highlights AI limitations (hallucination, opacity) and lawyers’ duties; introduces the verification-value paradox and derives practical and educational implications for practice and policy.

Result: The paradox suggests efficiency gains are often offset by verification burdens, resulting in negligible net value in many AI-assisted tasks; the paper outlines implications for practice, governance, and education grounded in fidelity to truth and civic responsibility.

Conclusion: To responsibly integrate AI into legal work, the field should adopt values-centered guidelines that prioritize verification, transparency, and accountability, shaping both practice and legal education around truth-telling and public duty.

Abstract: It is often claimed that machine learning-based generative AI products will
drastically streamline and reduce the cost of legal practice. This enthusiasm
assumes lawyers can effectively manage AI's risks. Cases in Australia and
elsewhere in which lawyers have been reprimanded for submitting inaccurate
AI-generated content to courts suggest this paradigm must be revisited. This
paper argues that a new paradigm is needed to evaluate AI use in practice,
given (a) AI's disconnection from reality and its lack of transparency, and (b)
lawyers' paramount duties like honesty, integrity, and not to mislead the
court. It presents an alternative model of AI use in practice that more
holistically reflects these features (the verification-value paradox). That
paradox suggests increases in efficiency from AI use in legal practice will be
met by a correspondingly greater imperative to manually verify any outputs of
that use, rendering the net value of AI use often negligible to lawyers. The
paper then sets out the paradox's implications for legal practice and legal
education, including for AI use but also the values that the paradox suggests
should undergird legal practice: fidelity to the truth and civic
responsibility.

*Morris Yu-Chao Huang,Zhen Tan,Mohan Zhang,Pingzhi Li,Zhuo Zhang,Tianlong Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TRUST proposes a decentralized auditing framework for LLM reasoning traces that combines a consensus among diverse auditors, a hierarchical DAG decomposition for scalable verification, a blockchain ledger for public accountability, and privacy-preserving segmentation to protect proprietary logic. It provides theoretical security and incentive guarantees and demonstrates robustness and effectiveness across multiple models and reasoning tasks.


<details>

Motivation: Current auditing of LLM reasoning is centralized, opaque, and hard to scale, posing risks for deploying proprietary models in high-stakes domains. There is a need for robust, scalable, transparent, and privacy-preserving auditing.

Method: 1) A consensus mechanism that tolerates up to 30% malicious auditors; 2) Hierarchical DAG decomposition of reasoning traces enabling parallel, scalable auditing; 3) A blockchain ledger recording all verification decisions for public accountability; 4) Privacy-preserving segmentation sharing only partial reasoning steps to protect proprietary logic; 5) Theoretical guarantees of security and economic incentives; 6) Empirical evaluation across LLMs (GPT-OSS, DeepSeek-r1, Qwen) and tasks (math, medical, science, humanities).

Result: Experiments show that TRUST effectively detects reasoning flaws and remains robust against adversarial auditors across multiple LLMs and reasoning domains.

Conclusion: Decentralized AI auditing is a practical path toward safe and trustworthy LLM deployment, offering transparency, robustness, and privacy-preserving governance for high-stakes applications.

Abstract: Large Language Models generate complex reasoning chains that reveal their
decision-making, yet verifying the faithfulness and harmlessness of these
intermediate steps remains a critical unsolved problem. Existing auditing
methods are centralized, opaque, and hard to scale, creating significant risks
for deploying proprietary models in high-stakes domains. We identify four core
challenges: (1) Robustness: Centralized auditors are single points of failure,
prone to bias or attacks. (2) Scalability: Reasoning traces are too long for
manual verification. (3) Opacity: Closed auditing undermines public trust. (4)
Privacy: Exposing full reasoning risks model theft or distillation. We propose
TRUST, a transparent, decentralized auditing framework that overcomes these
limitations via: (1) A consensus mechanism among diverse auditors, guaranteeing
correctness under up to $30\%$ malicious participants. (2) A hierarchical DAG
decomposition of reasoning traces, enabling scalable, parallel auditing. (3) A
blockchain ledger that records all verification decisions for public
accountability. (4) Privacy-preserving segmentation, sharing only partial
reasoning steps to protect proprietary logic. We provide theoretical guarantees
for the security and economic incentives of the TRUST framework. Experiments
across multiple LLMs (GPT-OSS, DeepSeek-r1, Qwen) and reasoning tasks (math,
medical, science, humanities) show TRUST effectively detects reasoning flaws
and remains robust against adversarial auditors. Our work pioneers
decentralized AI auditing, offering a practical path toward safe and
trustworthy LLM deployment.

### [201] [The Lock-In Phase Hypothesis: Identity Consolidation as a Precursor to AGI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20190)
*Marcelo Maciel Amaral,Raymond Aschheim*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A 'lock-in' phase in LLM development marks a shift from open imitation to stable identities, with goal structures and refusals becoming resistant to steering. The paper formalizes this phase, proposes onset metrics, and shows rapid, nonlinear consolidation with varied effects on capabilities across model scales; it argues consolidation is key for AGI reliability and a critical safety control point.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how scaling pushes LLMs toward stable, potentially autonomous identities, and to identify when and how this consolidation affects reliability and safety.

Method: Formalize the consolidation phase, relate it to learning dynamics, develop operational metrics for onset detection, and empirically test across model scales to observe behavioral consolidation and side-effects on capabilities.

Result: Consolidation is rapid and nonlinear. Side-effects on general capabilities vary: small models incur performance trade-offs, mid-scale models adopt behavior largely without cost, and large, quantized models show transient instabilities.

Conclusion: Consolidation may be a prerequisite for AGI-level reliability and is a critical safety control point: identities can be engineered for reliability but may also emerge during scaling, potentially hardening unpredictable goals and behaviors.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) remain broadly open and highly steerable: they
imitate at scale, accept arbitrary system prompts, and readily adopt multiple
personae. By analogy to human development, we hypothesize that progress toward
artificial general intelligence (AGI) involves a lock-in phase: a transition
from open imitation to identity consolidation, in which goal structures,
refusals, preferences, and internal representations become comparatively stable
and resistant to external steering. We formalize this phase, link it to known
phenomena in learning dynamics, and propose operational metrics for onset
detection. Experimentally, we demonstrate that while the behavioral
consolidation is rapid and non-linear, its side-effects on general capabilities
are not monolithic. Our results reveal a spectrum of outcomes--from performance
trade-offs in small models, through largely cost-free adoption in mid-scale
models, to transient instabilities in large, quantized models. We argue that
such consolidation is a prerequisite for AGI-level reliability and also a
critical control point for safety: identities can be deliberately engineered
for reliability, yet may also emerge spontaneously during scaling, potentially
hardening unpredictable goals and behaviors.

### [202] [Merge and Conquer: Evolutionarily Optimizing AI for 2048](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20205)
*Maggie Bai,Ava Kim Cohen,Eleanor Koss,Charlie Lichtenbaum*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper compares evolutionary refinement approaches for AI in the stochastic game 2048, finding strong gains from a single-agent MCTS-based refinement, while a two-agent metaprompting system shows limited benefits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Investigate how to optimize AI in dynamic, non-deterministic environments using role-based LLMs and search-based methods; use 2048 as a testbed; assess the value of rollback features.

Method: Implemented two systems: (1) a two-agent metaprompting setup where a 'thinker' LLM refines strategies for an 'executor' LLM; (2) a single-agent system that refines a value function for a limited Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). Explored rollback features to mitigate performance degradation. Evaluated across training cycles, reporting score changes and correlations.

Result: Single-agent approach achieved an average increase of 473.2 points per cycle with clear upward trends (ρ=0.607) across cycles; the LLM improved its game strategies over time. The two-agent system showed limited improvement, exposing limits of meta-prompting.

Conclusion: Evolutionary refinement techniques can enhance AI performance in non-deterministic environments, with the single-agent MCTS-based approach being more effective here. Meta-prompting via a two-agent setup has limited utility in this context; rollback features offer some stability benefits.

Abstract: Optimizing artificial intelligence (AI) for dynamic environments remains a
fundamental challenge in machine learning research. In this paper, we examine
evolutionary training methods for optimizing AI to solve the game 2048, a 2D
sliding puzzle. 2048, with its mix of strategic gameplay and stochastic
elements, presents an ideal playground for studying decision-making, long-term
planning, and dynamic adaptation. We implemented two distinct systems: a
two-agent metaprompting system where a "thinker" large language model (LLM)
agent refines gameplay strategies for an "executor" LLM agent, and a
single-agent system based on refining a value function for a limited Monte
Carlo Tree Search. We also experimented with rollback features to avoid
performance degradation. Our results demonstrate the potential of evolutionary
refinement techniques in improving AI performance in non-deterministic
environments. The single-agent system achieved substantial improvements, with
an average increase of 473.2 points per cycle, and with clear upward trends
(correlation $\rho$=0.607) across training cycles. The LLM's understanding of
the game grew as well, shown in its development of increasingly advanced
strategies. Conversely, the two-agent system did not garner much improvement,
highlighting the inherent limits of meta-prompting.

### [203] [Individualized Cognitive Simulation in Large Language Models: Evaluating Different Cognitive Representation Methods](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20252)
*Tianyi Zhang,Xiaolin Zhou,Yunzhe Wang,Erik Cambria,David Traum,Rui Mao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A study on individualized cognitive simulation (ICS) for authorial style emulation in LLMs. It evaluates 11 cognitive representation methods (linguistic features, concept mappings, profile cues) across seven LLMs using a dataset of post-release novels; finds that combining linguistic and conceptual features best supports ICS, with LLMs better at mimicking linguistic style than narrative structure, highlighting limits in deep cognitive simulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To move beyond surface-level mimicry by LLMs and evaluate how to represent internal cognitive processes of individuals for more faithful personalized storytelling.

Method: Create a dataset from novels released after the tested LLMs. Propose an 11-condition cognitive evaluation framework. Benchmark seven off-the-shelf LLMs on authorial style emulation. Test cognitive representations including linguistic features, concept mappings, and profile-based cues.

Result: Combining conceptual and linguistic features yields the strongest performance in ICS, surpassing static profile cues. LLMs more effectively mimic linguistic style than narrative structure, indicating limits in deep cognitive simulation.

Conclusion: A hybrid of linguistic and conceptual representations facilitates more accurate individualized cognitive simulation in storytelling. The work lays groundwork for adaptive, human-aligned creative AI but also reveals current limits in encoding deeper cognitive processes.

Abstract: Individualized cognitive simulation (ICS) aims to build computational models
that approximate the thought processes of specific individuals. While large
language models (LLMs) convincingly mimic surface-level human behavior such as
role-play, their ability to simulate deeper individualized cognitive processes
remains poorly understood. To address this gap, we introduce a novel task that
evaluates different cognitive representation methods in ICS. We construct a
dataset from recently published novels (later than the release date of the
tested LLMs) and propose an 11-condition cognitive evaluation framework to
benchmark seven off-the-shelf LLMs in the context of authorial style emulation.
We hypothesize that effective cognitive representations can help LLMs generate
storytelling that better mirrors the original author. Thus, we test different
cognitive representations, e.g., linguistic features, concept mappings, and
profile-based information. Results show that combining conceptual and
linguistic features is particularly effective in ICS, outperforming static
profile-based cues in overall evaluation. Importantly, LLMs are more effective
at mimicking linguistic style than narrative structure, underscoring their
limits in deeper cognitive simulation. These findings provide a foundation for
developing AI systems that adapt to individual ways of thinking and expression,
advancing more personalized and human-aligned creative technologies.

### [204] [Using Large Language Models for Abstraction of Planning Domains - Extended Version](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20258)
*Bita Banihashemi,Megh Patel,Yves Lespérance*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs (GPT-4o) can generate useful abstract PDDL domains and problems from natural-language abstraction objectives, mainly for action-level abstractions; validated by symbolic tools and experts; effective in simple settings but less robust for fluent/predicate abstractions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Abstraction choices in a dynamic domain critically affect planning, reasoning, and explanations. Automating abstraction generation to align with user objectives can streamline planning pipelines and improve interpretability.

Method: Model concrete behaviors in PDDL; use in-context learning with LLMs to generate abstract PDDL domains and problems from a natural-language abstraction objective. Consider abstractions over (i) alternative actions, (ii) action sequences, (iii) action/predicate parameters, and their combinations. Benchmark on new, unseen examples; validate results with symbolic validation tools and human experts.

Result: GPT-4o generally synthesizes useful planning-domain abstractions in simple settings, excelling at abstracting actions rather than fluents (fluents/predicate aspects).

Conclusion: LLMs can assist in generating domain abstractions for planning, but current capabilities are strongest for action-level abstractions and weaker for fluent/predicate abstractions; further work needed for robustness in complex domains and for broader abstraction types.

Abstract: Generating an abstraction of a dynamic domain that aligns with a given
purpose remains a significant challenge given that the choice of such an
abstraction can impact an agent's ability to plan, reason, and provide
explanations effectively. We model the agent's concrete behaviors in PDDL and
investigate the use of in-context learning with large language models (LLMs)
for the generation of abstract PDDL domains and problem instances, given an
abstraction objective specified in natural language. The benchmark examples we
use are new and have not been part of the data any LLMs have been trained on.
We consider three categories of abstractions: abstraction of choice of
alternative concrete actions, abstraction of sequences of concrete actions, and
abstraction of action/predicate parameters, as well as combinations of these.
The generated abstract PDDL domains and problem instances are then checked by
symbolic validation tools as well as human experts. Our experiments show that
GPT-4o can generally synthesize useful planning domain abstractions in simple
settings, although it is better at abstracting over actions than over the
associated fluents.

### [205] [Classical Feature Embeddings Help in BERT-Based Human Mobility Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20275)
*Yunzhi Liu,Haokai Tan,Rushi Kanjaria,Lihuan Li,Flora D. Salim*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Semantic-Temporal aware BERT (STaBERT) integrates POI and temporal cues into a BERT-based mobility model, yielding major accuracy gains in GEO-BLEU for single-city and multi-city predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing mobility models either focus on location sequences or treat time as mere auxiliary input, missing rich semantic context from POIs; incorporating POI semantics and temporal descriptors can improve forecasting.

Method: Propose STaBERT: a BERT-based mobility model that fuses derived temporal descriptors and POI embeddings at each location to form a unified semantically enriched representation of mobility; applied to single-city and multi-city predictions.

Result: Significant improvements: GEO-BLEU from 0.34 to 0.75 for single-city; from 0.34 to 0.56 for multi-city.

Conclusion: Integrating POI and temporal context into a BERT-based mobility model yields stronger predictive performance and demonstrates the value of semantically enriched representations for human mobility forecasting.

Abstract: Human mobility forecasting is crucial for disaster relief, city planning, and
public health. However, existing models either only model location sequences or
include time information merely as auxiliary input, thereby failing to leverage
the rich semantic context provided by points of interest (POIs). To address
this, we enrich a BERT-based mobility model with derived temporal descriptors
and POI embeddings to better capture the semantics underlying human movement.
We propose STaBERT (Semantic-Temporal aware BERT), which integrates both POI
and temporal information at each location to construct a unified, semantically
enriched representation of mobility. Experimental results show that STaBERT
significantly improves prediction accuracy: for single-city prediction, the
GEO-BLEU score improved from 0.34 to 0.75; for multi-city prediction, from 0.34
to 0.56.

### [206] [Multi-Step Reasoning for Embodied Question Answering via Tool Augmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20310)
*Mingliang Zhai,Hansheng Liang,Xiaomeng Fan,Zhi Gao,Chuanhao Li,Che Sun,Xu Bin,Yuwei Wu,Yunde Jia*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ToolEQA integrates external tools with multi-step reasoning for Embodied Question Answering, enabling more accurate answers with shorter exploration and introducing the EQA-RT dataset (~18k tasks).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLM-based EQA methods rely on direct exploration and lack explicit planning, leading to inefficient exploration and weaker reasoning.

Method: Proposes ToolEQA, which leverages external tools to supply information and supports multi-step reasoning to guide exploration. Also introduces an automatic EQA data generation pipeline that creates large-scale EQA tasks with reasoning trajectories, resulting in the EQA-RT dataset (≈18k tasks) with train and seen/unseen test splits. Evaluations on EQA-RT-Seen/Unseen and other benchmarks (HM-EQA, OpenEQA, EXPRESS-Bench) demonstrate improved performance.

Result: On EQA-RT-Seen and EQA-RT-Unseen, ToolEQA improves success rate by 9.2–20.2% over state-of-the-art baselines and surpasses zero-shot ToolEQA by ~10%. It also achieves state-of-the-art results on HM-EQA, OpenEQA, and EXPRESS-Bench.

Conclusion: Integrating external tools with multi-step reasoning and a scalable data-generation pipeline yields more efficient, accurate EQA with broader generality across benchmarks.

Abstract: Embodied Question Answering (EQA) requires agents to explore 3D environments
to obtain observations and answer questions related to the scene. Existing
methods leverage VLMs to directly explore the environment and answer questions
without explicit thinking or planning, which limits their reasoning ability and
results in excessive or inefficient exploration as well as ineffective
responses. In this paper, we introduce ToolEQA, an agent that integrates
external tools with multi-step reasoning, where external tools can provide more
useful information for completing the task, helping the model derive better
exploration directions in the next step of reasoning and thus obtaining
additional effective information. This enables ToolEQA to generate more
accurate responses with a shorter exploration distance. To enhance the model's
ability for tool-usage and multi-step reasoning, we further design a novel EQA
data generation pipeline that automatically constructs large-scale EQA tasks
with reasoning trajectories and corresponding answers. Based on the pipeline,
we collect the EQA-RT dataset that contains about 18K tasks, divided into a
training set EQA-RT-Train, and two test sets EQA-RT-Seen (scenes overlapping
with the training set) and EQA-RT-Unseen (novel scenes). Experiments on
EQA-RT-Seen and EQA-RT-Unseen show that ToolEQA improves the success rate by
9.2~20.2% over state-of-the-art baselines, while outperforming the zero-shot
ToolEQA by 10% in success rate. In addition, ToolEQA also achieves
state-of-the-art performance on the HM-EQA, OpenEQA, and EXPRESS-Bench
datasets, demonstrating its generality. Our homepage see

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper analyzes biases in clinical data collection for AI in healthcare within the AI4HealthyAging project, identifying historical, representation, and measurement biases across use cases, affecting variables like sex, gender, age, habitat, SES, equipment, and labeling, and provides practical recommendations to improve fairness and robustness in data design and collection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address data quality and fairness barriers that hinder deploying AI in real-world clinical practice; biased data can undermine fairness, generalizability, and safety of AI systems in healthcare.

Method: Qualitative analysis across multiple use cases within the AI4HealthyAging project to identify and taxonomy biases; examines how variables such as sex, gender, age, habitat, SES, equipment, and labeling contribute to bias.

Result: Identification of several bias types (historical, representation, measurement) across use cases and concrete variables; development of practical recommendations for fairer problem design and data collection in clinical AI.

Conclusion: The work contributes guidance for future healthcare AI projects to develop fairer and more robust AI systems by improving data collection practices and problem formulation.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) holds great promise for transforming healthcare.
However, despite significant advances, the integration of AI solutions into
real-world clinical practice remains limited. A major barrier is the quality
and fairness of training data, which is often compromised by biased data
collection practices. This paper draws on insights from the AI4HealthyAging
project, part of Spain's national R&D initiative, where our task was to detect
biases during clinical data collection. We identify several types of bias
across multiple use cases, including historical, representation, and
measurement biases. These biases manifest in variables such as sex, gender,
age, habitat, socioeconomic status, equipment, and labeling. We conclude with
practical recommendations for improving the fairness and robustness of clinical
problem design and data collection. We hope that our findings and experience
contribute to guiding future projects in the development of fairer AI systems
in healthcare.

*Clara Maathuis,Kasper Cools*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes a collateral damage assessment model for AI-enabled battlefield targeting using a layered Knowledge Representation and Reasoning architecture that integrates temporal, spatial, and force dimensions with explicit metrics and transparent reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To ensure responsible and trustworthy engagement of AI systems in military operations by systematically evaluating potential collateral effects and enabling transparent, accountable decision-making.

Method: Design-science–driven development of a layered KRR architecture that captures AI system categories/components, engagement vectors, and contextual factors; integrates spreading, severity, and likelihood alongside evaluation metrics; demonstrated via instantiation for demonstration and evaluation.

Result: A formally structured model and instantiation that yields transparent reasoning about potential collateral effects, supporting more responsible assessment and providing a basis for further dedicated work in trustworthy AI for military engagements.

Conclusion: The approach offers a structured, explainable framework for assessing collateral damage in AI-enabled targeting, with potential to improve safety and accountability, though further empirical validation and refinement are needed for real-world deployment.

Abstract: In an era where AI (Artificial Intelligence) systems play an increasing role
in the battlefield, ensuring responsible targeting demands rigorous assessment
of potential collateral effects. In this context, a novel collateral damage
assessment model for target engagement of AI systems in military operations is
introduced. The model integrates temporal, spatial, and force dimensions within
a unified Knowledge Representation and Reasoning (KRR) architecture following a
design science methodological approach. Its layered structure captures the
categories and architectural components of the AI systems to be engaged
together with corresponding engaging vectors and contextual aspects. At the
same time, spreading, severity, likelihood, and evaluation metrics are
considered in order to provide a clear representation enhanced by transparent
reasoning mechanisms. Further, the model is demonstrated and evaluated through
instantiation which serves as a basis for further dedicated efforts that aim at
building responsible and trustworthy intelligent systems for assessing the
effects produced by engaging AI systems in military operations.

*Haonan Bian*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A survey of how LLMs reshape knowledge-graph construction, comparing schema-based and schema-free approaches across ontology engineering, extraction, and fusion, and outlining future directions such as KG-based reasoning, dynamic memory for agents, and multimodal KG construction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs enable language-driven, generative KG pipelines, promising more flexible and capable knowledge systems, but require systematic analysis to bridge symbolic KG engineering with neural semantic understanding.

Method: Systematic literature review anchored in traditional KG methodologies; categorize LL-driven work into schema-based and schema-free paradigms; analyze mechanisms and limitations across ontology engineering, extraction, and fusion; synthesize frameworks and trends.

Result: Identifies benefits and challenges of LLM-driven KG construction: improved integration and generation across stages but issues with consistency, reliability, and scalability. Schema-based approaches emphasize structure and normalization; schema-free approaches emphasize adaptability and discovery. Highlights directions like KG-based reasoning for LLMs, dynamic memory for agentic systems, and multimodal KG construction.

Conclusion: The field is converging toward adaptive, explainable knowledge systems that integrate symbolic KG engineering with neural semantic understanding; future work should advance KG-based reasoning for LLMs, dynamic memory in agents, and multimodal KGs to enable robust, intelligent KGs.

Abstract: Knowledge Graphs (KGs) have long served as a fundamental infrastructure for
structured knowledge representation and reasoning. With the advent of Large
Language Models (LLMs), the construction of KGs has entered a new
paradigm-shifting from rule-based and statistical pipelines to language-driven
and generative frameworks. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of
recent progress in LLM-empowered knowledge graph construction, systematically
analyzing how LLMs reshape the classical three-layered pipeline of ontology
engineering, knowledge extraction, and knowledge fusion.
  We first revisit traditional KG methodologies to establish conceptual
foundations, and then review emerging LLM-driven approaches from two
complementary perspectives: schema-based paradigms, which emphasize structure,
normalization, and consistency; and schema-free paradigms, which highlight
flexibility, adaptability, and open discovery. Across each stage, we synthesize
representative frameworks, analyze their technical mechanisms, and identify
their limitations.
  Finally, the survey outlines key trends and future research directions,
including KG-based reasoning for LLMs, dynamic knowledge memory for agentic
systems, and multimodal KG construction. Through this systematic review, we aim
to clarify the evolving interplay between LLMs and knowledge graphs, bridging
symbolic knowledge engineering and neural semantic understanding toward the
development of adaptive, explainable, and intelligent knowledge systems.

TL;DR: Summary generation failed


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Motivation analysis unavailable

Method: Method extraction failed

Result: Result analysis unavailable

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Continual pretraining promises to adapt large language models (LLMs) to new
domains using only unlabeled test-time data, but naively applying standard
self-supervised objectives to instruction-tuned models is known to degrade
their instruction-following capability and semantic representations. Existing
fixes assume access to the original base model or rely on knowledge from an
external domain-specific database - both of which pose a realistic barrier in
settings where the base model weights are withheld for safety reasons or
reliable external corpora are unavailable. In this work, we propose
Instruction-Knowledge-Aware Continual Adaptation (IKnow), a simple and general
framework that formulates novel self-supervised objectives in the
instruction-response dialogue format. Rather than depend- ing on external
resources, IKnow leverages domain knowledge embedded within the text itself and
learns to encode it at a deeper semantic level.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To integrate creativity theories and techniques into a computational pipeline to produce more novel yet useful innovation opportunities, addressing limits of generic LMs in creative tasks.

Method: Implemented five distinct functions within a computational model; applied to generate opportunities for an innovation project in the hospitality sector; evaluated against Notebook LM and ChatGPT4o on novelty and usefulness of outputs.

Result: Outcomes were more novel and/or useful than baselines; however, not all functions contributed to novelty, indicating uneven function contributions and room for refinement.

Conclusion: The model shows promise for enhancing creative output; future work should dissect function contributions, optimize or replace underperforming components, and test across domains for generalizability.

Abstract: This paper presents a new computational model of creative outcomes, informed
by creativity theories and techniques, which was implemented to generate more
novel opportunities for innovation projects. The model implemented five
functions that were developed to contribute to the generation of innovation
opportunities with higher novelty without loss of usefulness. The model was
evaluated using opportunities generated for an innovation project in the
hospitality sector. The evaluation revealed that the computational model
generated outcomes that were more novel and/or useful than outcomes from
Notebook LM and ChatGPT4o. However, not all model functions contributed to the
generation of more novel opportunities, leading to new directions for further

*Louis Mozart Kamdem Teyou,Luke Friedrichs,N'Dah Jean Kouagou,Caglar Demir,Yasir Mahmood,Stefan Heindorf,Axel-Cyrille Ngonga Ngomo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Neural reasoning (EBR) is proposed to approximate a Description Logic reasoner for SHOIQ, enabling robust concept learning on real-world knowledge bases despite data inconsistencies and errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DL reasoners struggle with incompleteness and errors in real-world KBs; a robust neuro-symbolic alternative is needed to enable explainable concept learning in knowledge bases.

Method: Introduce EBR, a neural reasoner that uses embeddings to approximate symbolic DL reasoning. It retrieves instances for atomic concepts and existential restrictions to determine the set of instances of any SHOIQ concept, avoiding full reliance on classical DL reasoners.

Result: EBR is empirically compared with state-of-the-art reasoners and shows robustness to missing and erroneous data, outperforming or matching existing approaches in such conditions.

Conclusion: EBR demonstrates that neural reasoning can effectively replace brittle symbolic reasoners for SHOIQ-based concept learning, enabling deployment on real-world, noisy KBs.

Abstract: Concept learning exploits background knowledge in the form of description
logic axioms to learn explainable classification models from knowledge bases.
Despite recent breakthroughs in neuro-symbolic concept learning, most
approaches still cannot be deployed on real-world knowledge bases. This is due
to their use of description logic reasoners, which are not robust against
inconsistencies nor erroneous data. We address this challenge by presenting a
novel neural reasoner dubbed EBR. Our reasoner relies on embeddings to
approximate the results of a symbolic reasoner. We show that EBR solely
requires retrieving instances for atomic concepts and existential restrictions
to retrieve or approximate the set of instances of any concept in the
description logic $\mathcal{SHOIQ}$. In our experiments, we compare EBR with
state-of-the-art reasoners. Our results suggest that EBR is robust against
missing and erroneous data in contrast to existing reasoners.

### [213] [FLORA: Unsupervised Knowledge Graph Alignment by Fuzzy Logic](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20467)
*Yiwen Peng,Thomas Bonald,Fabian M. Suchanek*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: FLORA is an unsupervised, fuzzy-logic-based method for holistic alignment of entities and relations in knowledge graphs; it converges, handles dangling entities, and achieves state-of-the-art results without training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current KG alignment methods mostly do entity-level alignment, lack interpretable reasoning, and require labeled training data. There is a need for an unsupervised, interpretable, and holistic approach that can align both entities and relations and tolerate missing counterparts.

Method: FLORA performs iterative, unsupervised holistic alignment for entities and relations using fuzzy logic, yielding interpretable results, with provable convergence and support for dangling entities.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results on major benchmarks, outperforming existing methods in unsupervised settings and providing interpretable reasoning rather than opaque embeddings.

Conclusion: FLORA offers a simple yet effective unsupervised framework for KG alignment that provides interpretable, convergent, and holistic alignment of entities and relations, including support for dangling entities and strong empirical performance.

Abstract: Knowledge graph alignment is the task of matching equivalent entities (that
is, instances and classes) and relations across two knowledge graphs. Most
existing methods focus on pure entity-level alignment, computing the similarity
of entities in some embedding space. They lack interpretable reasoning and need
training data to work. In this paper, we propose FLORA, a simple yet effective
method that (1) is unsupervised, i.e., does not require training data, (2)
provides a holistic alignment for entities and relations iteratively, (3) is
based on fuzzy logic and thus delivers interpretable results, (4) provably
converges, (5) allows dangling entities, i.e., entities without a counterpart
in the other KG, and (6) achieves state-of-the-art results on major benchmarks.

*Susan Ariel Aaronson,Michael Moreno*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Public consultations on AI in Australia, Colombia, and the United States largely failed to influence policy: participation was very low (<1%), outreach was weak, and feedback loops were not established, undermining trust in AI governance. Eight recommendations aim to improve engagement and legitimacy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Governments attempt to democratize AI governance by soliciting public input, but current practices risk eroding trust if input is not meaningfully considered or diverse voices are engaged.

Method: Landscape analysis of three countries assessing how calls for public feedback on AI risks/policies were issued and whether input shaped governance; evaluation of participation levels and responsiveness.

Result: Citizen engagement was minimal: fewer than 1% of the population participated; limited outreach led to low awareness; officials showed little responsiveness and did not create a feedback loop; governance did not meaningfully incorporate public input.

Conclusion: Current participatory approaches to AI governance are unlikely to build trust or legitimacy. The authors propose eight recommendations to improve engagement and governance: AI literacy, monitor public feedback, broaden outreach, regular online forums, innovative engagement methods, include underrepresented groups, publicly respond to input, and simplify participation.

Abstract: The worlds people have strong opinions about artificial intelligence (AI),
and they want policymakers to listen. Governments are inviting public comment
on AI, but as they translate input into policy, much of what citizens say is
lost. Policymakers are missing a critical opportunity to build trust in AI and
its governance. This paper compares three countries, Australia, Colombia, and
the United States, that invited citizens to comment on AI risks and policies.
Using a landscape analysis, the authors examined how each government solicited
feedback and whether that input shaped governance. Yet in none of the three
cases did citizens and policymakers establish a meaningful dialogue.
Governments did little to attract diverse voices or publicize calls for
comment, leaving most citizens unaware or unprepared to respond. In each
nation, fewer than one percent of the population participated. Moreover,
officials showed limited responsiveness to the feedback they received, failing
to create an effective feedback loop. The study finds a persistent gap between
the promise and practice of participatory AI governance. The authors conclude
that current approaches are unlikely to build trust or legitimacy in AI because
policymakers are not adequately listening or responding to public concerns.
They offer eight recommendations: promote AI literacy; monitor public feedback;
broaden outreach; hold regular online forums; use innovative engagement
methods; include underrepresented groups; respond publicly to input; and make
participation easier.

### [215] [Transferable Graph Learning for Transmission Congestion Management via Busbar Splitting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20591)
*Ali Rajaei,Peter Palensky,Jochen L. Cremer*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A GNN-based approach for NTO via busbar splitting delivers near-real-time, AC-feasible solutions with strong generalization and large-scale performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: NTO with busbar splitting aims to relieve grid congestion but is currently intractable for large systems due to mixed-integer non-linear formulations; ML offers speed but struggles to generalize to unseen topologies, operating conditions, and systems.

Method: Formulate NTO for congestion management using linearized AC power flow and develop a heterogeneous edge-aware message passing graph neural network to predict effective busbar splitting as candidate solutions; the GNN captures local flow patterns and generalizes across unseen topology changes and cross-system transfers.

Result: Demonstrates up to 4 orders of magnitude speed-up, delivering AC-feasible solutions within one minute and achieving about a 2.3% optimality gap on the GOC 2000-bus system.

Conclusion: This work advances near-real-time NTO for large-scale systems by achieving topology- and cross-system generalization, moving toward practical deployment for congestion management.

Abstract: Network topology optimization (NTO) via busbar splitting can mitigate
transmission grid congestion and reduce redispatch costs. However, solving this
mixed-integer non-linear problem for large-scale systems in near-real-time is
currently intractable with existing solvers. Machine learning (ML) approaches
have emerged as a promising alternative, but they have limited generalization
to unseen topologies, varying operating conditions, and different systems,
which limits their practical applicability. This paper formulates NTO for
congestion management problem considering linearized AC PF, and proposes a
graph neural network (GNN)-accelerated approach. We develop a heterogeneous
edge-aware message passing NN to predict effective busbar splitting actions as
candidate NTO solutions. The proposed GNN captures local flow patterns,
achieves generalization to unseen topology changes, and improves
transferability across systems. Case studies show up to 4 orders-of-magnitude
speed-up, delivering AC-feasible solutions within one minute and a 2.3%
optimality gap on the GOC 2000-bus system. These results demonstrate a
significant step toward near-real-time NTO for large-scale systems with
topology and cross-system generalization.

### [216] [What Defines Good Reasoning in LLMs? Dissecting Reasoning Steps with Multi-Aspect Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20603)
*Heejin Do,Jaehui Hwang,Dongyoon Han,Seong Joon Oh,Sangdoo Yun*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CaSE (causal stepwise evaluation) offers a granular way to assess LLM reasoning by evaluating each step for relevance (grounded in the problem) and coherence (logically following from prior steps) using only prior context to avoid hindsight bias. It is validated against expert judgments on new benchmarks (MRa-GSM8K, MRa-MATH) and enabling CaSE-based data curation improves final task performance, providing a scalable framework for analyzing, debugging, and improving LLM reasoning beyond final-answer correctness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluation of LLMs focuses on final-answer correctness, which is a coarse signal that misses the quality of the reasoning process. A fine-grained, principled measure of reasoning quality (relevance and coherence) can guide data curation and model tuning to build more robust, interpretable systems.

Method: Introduce CaSE (causal stepwise evaluation) that assesses each reasoning step using only its preceding context to avoid hindsight bias. Measure two dimensions—relevance (grounded in the problem) and coherence (logically follows from prior steps)—across expert-annotated benchmarks. Validate CaSE against human judgments and demonstrate that CaSE-based data curation improves final task performance.

Result: CaSE aligns with human judgments on expert benchmarks (MRa-GSM8K and MRa-MATH) and, when used to curate training data, leads to measurable gains in final task performance, confirming its utility for debugging and improving LLM reasoning.

Conclusion: Moving beyond validity checks, CaSE provides a scalable framework to analyze, debug, and improve LLM reasoning, facilitating targeted data curation and model development to enhance robustness of reasoning-based capabilities.

Abstract: Evaluating large language models (LLMs) on final-answer correctness is the
dominant paradigm. This approach, however, provides a coarse signal for model
improvement and overlooks the quality of the underlying reasoning process. We
argue that a more granular evaluation of reasoning offers a more effective path
to building robust models. We decompose reasoning quality into two dimensions:
relevance and coherence. Relevance measures if a step is grounded in the
problem; coherence measures if it follows logically from prior steps. To
measure these aspects reliably, we introduce causal stepwise evaluation (CaSE).
This method assesses each reasoning step using only its preceding context,
which avoids hindsight bias. We validate CaSE against human judgments on our
new expert-annotated benchmarks, MRa-GSM8K and MRa-MATH. More importantly, we
show that curating training data with CaSE-evaluated relevance and coherence
directly improves final task performance. Our work provides a scalable
framework for analyzing, debugging, and improving LLM reasoning, demonstrating
the practical value of moving beyond validity checks.

### [217] [Efficient Algorithms for Computing Random Walk Centrality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20604)
*Changan Liu,Zixuan Xie,Ahad N. Zehmakan,Zhongzhi Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Two scalable near-linear-time algorithms for computing random walk centrality in large graphs, with strong approximation guarantees: (1) approximate Cholesky factorization and sparse inverse estimation, and (2) sampling rooted spanning trees; validated on networks up to over 10 million nodes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Random walk centrality captures node importance via hitting times but is prohibitively expensive on large networks; scalable approximation methods are needed to enable practical analysis at scale.

Method: Algorithm 1 uses approximate Cholesky factorization and sparse inverse estimation to compute centrality; Algorithm 2 uses sampling of rooted spanning trees to estimate centrality. Both are designed to run in near-linear time and come with approximation guarantees.

Result: Both algorithms achieve near-linear time complexity with provable approximation guarantees; extensive experiments on large real-world networks (including networks with over 10 million nodes) demonstrate efficiency and high-quality approximations relative to exact computation or baselines.

Conclusion: The work provides scalable, theoretically grounded methods for random walk centrality that enable analysis of very large graphs, broadening the practical applicability of this centrality measure.

Abstract: Random walk centrality is a fundamental metric in graph mining for
quantifying node importance and influence, defined as the weighted average of
hitting times to a node from all other nodes. Despite its ability to capture
rich graph structural information and its wide range of applications, computing
this measure for large networks remains impractical due to the computational
demands of existing methods. In this paper, we present a novel formulation of
random walk centrality, underpinning two scalable algorithms: one leveraging
approximate Cholesky factorization and sparse inverse estimation, while the
other sampling rooted spanning trees. Both algorithms operate in near-linear
time and provide strong approximation guarantees. Extensive experiments on
large real-world networks, including one with over 10 million nodes,
demonstrate the efficiency and approximation quality of the proposed
algorithms.

*Riccardo Guidotti,Martina Cinquini,Marta Marchiori Manerba,Mattia Setzu,Francesco Spinnato*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes MIMOSA: a framework to generate interpretable predictive models across data types, embedding causality, fairness, and privacy into interpretable pipelines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Trustworthy AI requires models that are interpretable and ethically aware; existing work lacks a unified framework to integrate interpretability with causal, fair, and privacy properties across diverse data types.

Method: Formalizes supervised learning for tabular/time-series/images/text/transactions/trajectories; characterizes three interpretable model families (feature importance, rule, instance-based); analyzes interpretability dimensions, reasoning mechanisms, and complexity; provides formal definitions, evaluation metrics, and verification procedures for causality, fairness, and privacy; discusses trade-offs and how to embed ethical constraints within interpretable pipelines; outlines evaluation of ethical measures during model generation.

Result: A theoretical framework establishing foundations for building accurate, interpretable, fair, privacy-preserving, and causally aware AI systems; defines metrics, verification procedures, and principled trade-offs to guide trustworthy model development across diverse data types.

Conclusion: MIMOSA provides groundwork for trustworthy AI by integrating ethical properties into interpretable model design and offering a formal, verifiable pipeline for diverse decision-making tasks.

Abstract: Interpretable-by-design models are crucial for fostering trust,
accountability, and safe adoption of automated decision-making models in
real-world applications. In this paper we formalize the ground for the MIMOSA
(Mining Interpretable Models explOiting Sophisticated Algorithms) framework, a
comprehensive methodology for generating predictive models that balance
interpretability with performance while embedding key ethical properties. We
formally define here the supervised learning setting across diverse
decision-making tasks and data types, including tabular data, time series,
images, text, transactions, and trajectories. We characterize three major
families of interpretable models: feature importance, rule, and instance based
models. For each family, we analyze their interpretability dimensions,
reasoning mechanisms, and complexity. Beyond interpretability, we formalize
three critical ethical properties, namely causality, fairness, and privacy,
providing formal definitions, evaluation metrics, and verification procedures
for each. We then examine the inherent trade-offs between these properties and
discuss how privacy requirements, fairness constraints, and causal reasoning
can be embedded within interpretable pipelines. By evaluating ethical measures
during model generation, this framework establishes the theoretical foundations
for developing AI systems that are not only accurate and interpretable but also
fair, privacy-preserving, and causally aware, i.e., trustworthy.

### [219] [Towards Reliable Evaluation of Large Language Models for Multilingual and Multimodal E-Commerce Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20632)
*Shuyi Xie,Ziqin Liew,Hailing Zhang,Haibo Zhang,Ling Hu,Zhiqiang Zhou,Shuman Liu,Anxiang Zeng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Introduces EcomEval, a multilingual and multimodal benchmark for evaluating LLMs in e-commerce, addressing gaps in prior benchmarks by including diverse tasks, multimodal data, authentic real-world data, and seven languages (including five low-resource SE Asian languages).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current e-commerce benchmarks are narrow (limited task diversity, modalities, languages) and often rely on synthetic data or English/Chinese. There is a need for a realistic, multilingual, multimodal benchmark that reflects authentic customer interactions to better assess LLMs in real-world shopping scenarios.

Method: Proposes EcomEval with 6 categories and 37 tasks (including 8 multimodal tasks). Data drawn from authentic customer queries and transaction logs. Uses a semi-automatic annotation pipeline where large models draft responses, then 50+ expert annotators review/edit. Establishes difficulty levels by averaging model performance across models of varying sizes. Covers 7 languages, including five low-resource Southeast Asian languages.

Result: A comprehensive benchmark framework for e-commerce LLM evaluation, with multilingual and multimodal coverage, grounded in real-world data and quality-controlled reference answers, plus graded difficulty levels to enable nuanced, challenge-oriented assessment.

Conclusion: EcomEval fills a critical gap by providing a realistic, diverse, multilingual, and multimodal evaluation resource for e-commerce LLMs, enabling more robust and applicable model assessment across real-world shopping scenarios.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel on general-purpose NLP benchmarks, yet
their capabilities in specialized domains remain underexplored. In e-commerce,
existing evaluations-such as EcomInstruct, ChineseEcomQA, eCeLLM, and Shopping
MMLU-suffer from limited task diversity (e.g., lacking product guidance and
after-sales issues), limited task modalities (e.g., absence of multimodal
data), synthetic or curated data, and a narrow focus on English and Chinese,
leaving practitioners without reliable tools to assess models on complex,
real-world shopping scenarios. We introduce EcomEval, a comprehensive
multilingual and multimodal benchmark for evaluating LLMs in e-commerce.
EcomEval covers six categories and 37 tasks (including 8 multimodal tasks),
sourced primarily from authentic customer queries and transaction logs,
reflecting the noisy and heterogeneous nature of real business interactions. To
ensure both quality and scalability of reference answers, we adopt a
semi-automatic pipeline in which large models draft candidate responses
subsequently reviewed and modified by over 50 expert annotators with strong
e-commerce and multilingual expertise. We define difficulty levels for each
question and task category by averaging evaluation scores across models with
different sizes and capabilities, enabling challenge-oriented and fine-grained
assessment. EcomEval also spans seven languages-including five low-resource
Southeast Asian languages-offering a multilingual perspective absent from prior
work.

*Eric Ngoiya,Tianshu Bao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A new Fluidity Index (FI) quantifies model adaptability in dynamic, scaling environments using benchmarks across initial/current/future state deviations; emphasizes closed-loop open-ended real-world tests and posits second-order adaptability with digital replenishment as a sign of super-intelligence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a metric that captures a model's ability to understand, predict, and adjust to changing environment states and context switches in scaling contexts, where conventional static benchmarks fail to reflect adaptability.

Method: Introduce FI as a benchmark metric; evaluate response accuracy based on deviations among initial, current, and future environment states; compare closed-ended vs open-ended benchmarks, prioritizing closed-loop open-ended real-world benchmarks; assess adaptability via context switching and continuity.

Result: Proposes FI as a tool to quantify adaptability; suggests that a truly super-intelligent model would exhibit at least second-order adaptability and digital replenishment for self-sustained computation; results are conceptual or theoretical, pending empirical validation.

Conclusion: FI provides a framework to quantify model adaptability in dynamic settings and stresses the importance of real-world closed-loop benchmarks and higher-order adaptability as a path toward more capable AI systems.

Abstract: This paper introduces the Fluidity Index (FI) to quantify model adaptability
in dynamic, scaling environments. The benchmark evaluates response accuracy
based on deviations in initial, current, and future environment states,
assessing context switching and continuity. We distinguish between closed-ended
and open-ended benchmarks, prioritizing closed-loop open-ended real-world
benchmarks to test adaptability. The approach measures a model's ability to
understand, predict, and adjust to state changes in scaling environments. A
truly super-intelligent model should exhibit at least second-order
adaptability, enabling self-sustained computation through digital replenishment
for optimal fluidity.

TL;DR: A fine-grained systematisation of ML-augmented rational agents using BDI as reference, addressing fragmentation in the literature and outlining opportunities and open challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address fragmentation in ML+rational-agent research and to leverage the expressive power of BDI architectures for designing effective ML-enabled agents.

Method: Fine-grained literature survey and taxonomy that maps existing ML-augmented rational-agent approaches onto BDI primitives, identifying design patterns, gaps, and evaluation considerations.

Result: A comprehensive taxonomy and cross-cutting insights showing how ML integrations align with Beliefs, Desires, and Intentions; highlights opportunities and open challenges for designing effective rational ML agents.

Conclusion: BDI-centric systematisation clarifies the design space, guides future research, and calls for coherent frameworks and benchmarks to advance rational ML agents.

Abstract: Thanks to the remarkable human-like capabilities of machine learning (ML)
models in perceptual and cognitive tasks, frameworks integrating ML within
rational agent architectures are gaining traction. Yet, the landscape remains
fragmented and incoherent, often focusing on embedding ML into generic agent
containers while overlooking the expressive power of rational
architectures--such as Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) agents. This paper
presents a fine-grained systematisation of existing approaches, using the BDI
paradigm as a reference. Our analysis illustrates the fast-evolving literature
on rational agents enhanced by ML, and identifies key research opportunities
and open challenges for designing effective rational ML agents.

### [222] [The Shape of Reasoning: Topological Analysis of Reasoning Traces in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20665)
*Xue Wen Tan,Nathaniel Tan,Galen Lee,Stanley Kok*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A topological data analysis (TDA) framework for evaluating the quality of reasoning traces in large language models, achieving better predictive power than graph metrics and enabling label-efficient, automated assessment for reinforcement learning signals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods to judge reasoning quality rely on labor-intensive expert rubrics, manual annotations, and slow pairwise judgments. Graph-based proxies capture connectivity but miss the geometric structure of complex reasoning, motivating a geometry-aware approach.

Method: Apply topological data analysis to reasoning traces to extract high-dimensional geometric features (e.g., persistent homology), compare their predictive power for reasoning quality against standard graph metrics, and identify a compact, stable feature set suitable for automated assessment and RL guidance.

Result: Topological features outperform traditional graph metrics in predicting reasoning quality; a compact, stable feature subset reliably signals trace quality, supporting efficient label-efficient evaluation and potential integration into RL algorithms.

Conclusion: TDA-based evaluation provides a scalable, effective approach for assessing reasoning quality in LLMs and can inform future reinforcement learning and development of higher-quality reasoning traces.

Abstract: Evaluating the quality of reasoning traces from large language models remains
understudied, labor-intensive, and unreliable: current practice relies on
expert rubrics, manual annotation, and slow pairwise judgments. Automated
efforts are dominated by graph-based proxies that quantify structural
connectivity but do not clarify what constitutes high-quality reasoning; such
abstractions can be overly simplistic for inherently complex processes. We
introduce a topological data analysis (TDA)-based evaluation framework that
captures the geometry of reasoning traces and enables label-efficient,
automated assessment. In our empirical study, topological features yield
substantially higher predictive power for assessing reasoning quality than
standard graph metrics, suggesting that effective reasoning is better captured
by higher-dimensional geometric structures rather than purely relational
graphs. We further show that a compact, stable set of topological features
reliably indicates trace quality, offering a practical signal for future
reinforcement learning algorithms.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Graph-RFT proposes a two-stage reinforcement fine-tuning KGQA framework that jointly plans and retrieves from knowledge graphs and the web to perform coherent, multi-step reasoning under incomplete knowledge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current KGQA with LLMs often assumes complete KG coverage and lacks mechanisms to judge when external information is needed; reasoning tends to be locally myopic, leading to failures even when relevant knowledge exists.

Method: Two-stage reinforcement fine-tuning architecture named Graph-RFT with plan-KGsearch-and-Websearch-during-think paradigm; chain-of-thought fine-tuning using a plan-retrieval dataset; plan-retrieval guided RL with a multi-reward design; Cartesian-inspired planning to decompose questions; logical expression to guide tool invocation; retrieval signals to learn when/how to combine KG and web sources.

Result: The abstract does not report empirical results; it emphasizes methodological contributions and potential benefits such as coverage-aware retrieval scheduling and globally consistent multi-step reasoning.

Conclusion: Graph-RFT offers a principled framework to integrate planning and retrieval for KGQA under incomplete knowledge, addressing cold-start issues and enabling adaptive, structured reasoning across KG and web resources.

Abstract: Knowledge Graph Question Answering aims to answer natural language questions
by reasoning over structured knowledge graphs. While large language models have
advanced KGQA through their strong reasoning capabilities, existing methods
continue to struggle to fully exploit both the rich knowledge encoded in KGs
and the reasoning capabilities of LLMs, particularly in complex scenarios. They
often assume complete KG coverage and lack mechanisms to judge when external
information is needed, and their reasoning remains locally myopic, failing to
maintain coherent multi-step planning, leading to reasoning failures even when
relevant knowledge exists. We propose Graph-RFT, a novel two-stage
reinforcement fine-tuning KGQA framework with a
'plan-KGsearch-and-Websearch-during-think' paradigm, that enables LLMs to
perform autonomous planning and adaptive retrieval scheduling across KG and web
sources under incomplete knowledge conditions. Graph-RFT introduces a
chain-of-thought fine-tuning method with a customized plan-retrieval dataset
activates structured reasoning and resolves the GRPO cold-start problem. It
then introduces a novel plan-retrieval guided reinforcement learning process
integrates explicit planning and retrieval actions with a multi-reward design,
enabling coverage-aware retrieval scheduling. It employs a Cartesian-inspired
planning module to decompose complex questions into ordered subquestions, and
logical expression to guide tool invocation for globally consistent multi-step
reasoning. This reasoning retrieval process is optimized with a multi-reward
combining outcome and retrieval specific signals, enabling the model to learn
when and how to combine KG and web retrieval effectively.

### [224] [A Coherence-Based Measure of AGI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20784)
*Fares Fourati*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Coherence-aware AGI metric using area under the curve of generalized means across compensability exponents; reveals GPT-4/5 underperform in general competence despite high arithmetic scores.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AGI definition based on arithmetic mean assumes compensability; this is incompatible with true coherent sufficiency; need a measure that penalizes imbalance across CHC domains.

Method: Define a continuum of compensability exponents p; compute generalized mean M_p across CHC domain scores; integrate M_p over p to obtain AUC; interpret AUC as coherence-adjusted AGI; apply to published CHC scores for GPT-4 and GPT-5.

Result: AUC-based coherence measure shows GPT-4 and GPT-5 remain far from general competence; even GPT-5's high arithmetic score (≈24%) is not sufficient when coherence penalized; demonstrates inter-domain dependency and imbalance reduce generality.

Conclusion: A generalized-mean integration provides a principled, interpretable, and stricter foundation for measuring progress toward AGI, correcting for compensability, and discouraging overemphasis on specialization.

Abstract: Recent work by \citet{hendrycks2025agidefinition} formalized
\textit{Artificial General Intelligence} (AGI) as the arithmetic mean of
proficiencies across cognitive domains derived from the Cattell--Horn--Carroll
(CHC) model of human cognition. While elegant, this definition assumes
\textit{compensability} -- that exceptional ability in some domains can offset
failure in others. True general intelligence, however, should reflect
\textit{coherent sufficiency}: balanced competence across all essential
domains. We propose a coherence-aware measure of AGI based on the integral of
generalized means over a continuum of compensability exponents. This
formulation spans arithmetic, geometric, and harmonic regimes, and the
resulting \textit{area under the curve} (AUC) quantifies robustness under
varying compensability assumptions. Unlike the arithmetic mean, which rewards
specialization, the AUC penalizes imbalance and captures inter-domain
dependency. Applied to published CHC-based domain scores for GPT-4 and GPT-5,
the coherence-adjusted AUC reveals that both systems remain far from general
competence despite high arithmetic scores (e.g., GPT-5 at~24\%). Integrating
the generalized mean thus yields a principled, interpretable, and stricter
foundation for measuring genuine progress toward AGI.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Researchers struggle to stay up-to-date amid explosive growth (e.g., 10k papers/year), rapid trend shifts, and increasing interdisciplinarity. A scalable, generalizable synthesis framework is needed.

Method: Introduce RDR, a comprehensive pipeline for analyzing research areas. Apply it to AI and robotics, emphasizing foundation models and robotics advancements.

Conclusion: RDR is a generalizable, practical framework to help researchers navigate large literatures and discover interdisciplinary opportunities; applicable beyond AI/robotics to other scientific domains.

Abstract: With the rapid growth of research in AI and robotics now producing over
10,000 papers annually it has become increasingly difficult for researchers to
stay up to date. Fast evolving trends, the rise of interdisciplinary work, and
the need to explore domains beyond one's expertise all contribute to this
challenge. To address these issues, we propose a generalizable pipeline capable
of systematically analyzing any research area: identifying emerging trends,
uncovering cross domain opportunities, and offering concrete starting points
for new inquiry. In this work, we present Real Deep Research (RDR) a
comprehensive framework applied to the domains of AI and robotics, with a
particular focus on foundation models and robotics advancements. We also
briefly extend our analysis to other areas of science. The main paper details
the construction of the RDR pipeline, while the appendix provides extensive
results across each analyzed topic. We hope this work sheds light for
researchers working in the field of AI and beyond.

TL;DR: Configuration-dependent calibration improves robot kinematics across the workspace by interpolating local POE models with Fourier basis functions tied to shoulder/elbow angles, delivering training-efficient, sub-millimeter accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Non-geometric, configuration-dependent discrepancies degrade kinematic precision; a global, continuous model is needed to maintain accuracy across the full workspace.

Method: Identify local POE models at multiple configurations and interpolate them into a global model using Fourier basis functions parameterized by shoulder and elbow angles; inspired by gravity-load expressions to ensure continuity; validated on two 6-DoF industrial robots; training efficiency surpasses neural-network/autoencoder approaches.

Result: Maximum positioning error is reduced by more than 50%, achieving sub-millimeter accuracy; larger gains on robots with greater configuration-dependent discrepancies; a dual-robot collaborative task demonstrates practical applicability and repeatability.

Conclusion: The framework provides a practical, repeatable, and training-efficient solution for configuration-dependent kinematic calibration, suitable for high-precision tasks in manufacturing (e.g., cold spray) and across varying robot configurations.

Abstract: Accurate robot kinematics is essential for precise tool placement in
articulated robots, but non-geometric factors can introduce
configuration-dependent model discrepancies. This paper presents a
configuration-dependent kinematic calibration framework for improving accuracy
across the entire workspace. Local Product-of-Exponential (POE) models,
selected for their parameterization continuity, are identified at multiple
configurations and interpolated into a global model. Inspired by joint gravity
load expressions, we employ Fourier basis function interpolation parameterized
by the shoulder and elbow joint angles, achieving accuracy comparable to neural
network and autoencoder methods but with substantially higher training
efficiency. Validation on two 6-DoF industrial robots shows that the proposed
approach reduces the maximum positioning error by over 50%, meeting the
sub-millimeter accuracy required for cold spray manufacturing. Robots with
larger configuration-dependent discrepancies benefit even more. A dual-robot
collaborative task demonstrates the framework's practical applicability and
repeatability.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: CI-MPC with C3+ enables real-time, multi-object planar pushing and de-cluttering with high success across 33 objects, leveraging scanning, mesh reconstruction, and hardware execution; faster solves than C3 enable practical real-time performance (0.5–5.3 minutes to goal depending on object count).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Non-prehensile manipulation with unknown object properties and dense contact interactions remains hard; existing CI-MPC methods were limited to curated scenarios. This work aims to generalize CI-MPC to diverse geometries and multi-object scenarios to enable robust, real-time planning and execution.

Method: Introduce Consensus Complementarity Control Plus (C3+)—an enhanced CI-MPC algorithm integrated into a full pipeline including object scanning, mesh reconstruction, and hardware execution. Improves solve speed over the predecessor C3 to enable real-time performance, including multi-object pushing tasks.

Result: Hardware experiments show a 98% success rate across 33 objects, achieving pose goals within tight tolerances. Time-to-goal averages roughly 0.5, 1.6, 3.2, and 5.3 minutes for 1, 2, 3, and 4-object tasks respectively.

Conclusion: C3+ extends CI-MPC applicability to diverse planar pushing tasks and cluttered environments, enabling efficient, robust manipulation across multiple objects in real time.

Abstract: Non-prehensile manipulation of diverse objects remains a core challenge in
robotics, driven by unknown physical properties and the complexity of
contact-rich interactions. Recent advances in contact-implicit model predictive
control (CI-MPC), with contact reasoning embedded directly in the trajectory
optimization, have shown promise in tackling the task efficiently and robustly,
yet demonstrations have been limited to narrowly curated examples. In this
work, we showcase the broader capabilities of CI-MPC through precise planar
pushing tasks over a wide range of object geometries, including multi-object
domains. These scenarios demand reasoning over numerous inter-object and
object-environment contacts to strategically manipulate and de-clutter the
environment, challenges that were intractable for prior CI-MPC methods. To
achieve this, we introduce Consensus Complementarity Control Plus (C3+), an
enhanced CI-MPC algorithm integrated into a complete pipeline spanning object
scanning, mesh reconstruction, and hardware execution. Compared to its
predecessor C3, C3+ achieves substantially faster solve times, enabling
real-time performance even in multi-object pushing tasks. On hardware, our
system achieves overall 98% success rate across 33 objects, reaching pose goals
within tight tolerances. The average time-to-goal is approximately 0.5, 1.6,
3.2, and 5.3 minutes for 1-, 2-, 3-, and 4-object tasks, respectively. Project

TL;DR: RL-based generalizable minimum-time UAV policy for arbitrary start/goal flights, using PMM trajectories as proxy rewards and curriculum learning; validated in simulation and real-world on a small ARM SBC.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional fast drone racing methods excel on predefined tracks but fail to generalize to arbitrary environments; there is a need for a learning framework that can plan and control for minimum time between arbitrary states while remaining robust to real-world constraints.

Method: A reinforcement learning framework that jointly learns state-to-state minimum-time planning and control. It uses Point Mass Model (PMM) trajectories as proxy rewards to approximate the true optimal objective and employs curriculum learning to scale training and improve generalization. Evaluation includes comparisons with NMPC tracking PMM-generated trajectories, ablation studies on curriculum learning, and outdoor real-world tests on an ARM-based single-board computer.

Result: The approach demonstrates generalization to arbitrary state-to-state flights in simulation and shows robustness in real-world outdoor experiments. Compared to an NMPC baseline that tracks PMM-generated trajectories, the method achieves competitive performance, and ablations confirm the benefit of curriculum learning. Real-world tests validate deployment on resource-constrained hardware.

Conclusion: RL with PMM proxy rewards and curriculum learning can realize a generalizable minimum-time UAV policy across arbitrary state pairs, offering improved generalization beyond track-specific racing and enabling practical deployment on low-power hardware. The work highlights the value of curriculum design and proxy objectives in guiding RL for UAV planning and control.

Abstract: This paper tackles the challenge of learning a generalizable minimum-time
flight policy for UAVs, capable of navigating between arbitrary start and goal
states while balancing agile flight and stable hovering. Traditional
approaches, particularly in autonomous drone racing, achieve impressive speeds
and agility but are constrained to predefined track layouts, limiting
real-world applicability. To address this, we propose a reinforcement
learning-based framework that simultaneously learns state-to-state minimum-time
planning and control and generalizes to arbitrary state-to-state flights. Our
approach leverages Point Mass Model (PMM) trajectories as proxy rewards to
approximate the true optimal flight objective and employs curriculum learning
to scale the training process efficiently and to achieve generalization. We
validate our method through simulation experiments, comparing it against
Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) tracking PMM-generated trajectories
and conducting ablation studies to assess the impact of curriculum learning.
Finally, real-world experiments confirm the robustness of our learned policy in
outdoor environments, demonstrating its ability to generalize and operate on a
small ARM-based single-board computer.

### [229] [Calibration of Parallel Kinematic Machine Based on Stewart Platform-A Literature Review](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20070)
*Sourabh Karmakar,Apurva Patel,Cameron J. Turner*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A survey of calibration methods for 6-DOF Stewart platform PKMs, focusing on inverse kinematics; compares external-instrument, constraint-based, and self-calibration approaches; notes emphasis on structural and sometimes environmental errors under no-load conditions; highlights need for broader future work.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Precise micro- to nano-scale 3D motion control in PKMs is required for diverse high-end applications; forward kinematics calibration is complex; inverse-kinematics calibration simplifies the task; improve accuracy across platform position and orientation.

Method: Literature survey categorizing calibration techniques into external-instrument-based, constraint-based, and auto/self-calibration approaches; analyzes outcomes and key points related to inverse-kinematics calibration for PKMs; discusses error sources (structural, environmental).

Result: Current studies focus on improving accuracy given single/multiple error sources, often considering structural errors; environmental factors occasionally considered; calibrations typically performed under no-load conditions; a consolidated view of state of the art.

Conclusion: Inverse kinematics-based PKM calibration is effective; there is a need to expand research horizons to include load conditions, multiple error sources, environmental and dynamic effects, and real-operating scenarios to enhance calibration robustness.

Abstract: Stewart platform-based Parallel Kinematic (PKM) Machines have been
extensively studied by researchers due to their inherent finer control
characteristics. This has opened its potential deployment opportunities in
versatile critical applications like the medical field, engineering machines,
space research, electronic chip manufacturing, automobile manufacturing, etc.
All these precise, complicated, and repeatable motion applications require
micro and nano-scale movement control in 3D space; a 6-DOF PKM can take this
challenge smartly. For this, the PKM must be more accurate than the desired
application accuracy level and thus proper calibration for a PKM robot is
essential. Forward kinematics-based calibration for such hexapod machines
becomes unnecessarily complex and inverse kinematics complete this task with
much ease. To analyze different techniques, an external instrument-based,
constraint-based, and auto or self-calibration-based approaches have been used
for calibration. This survey has been done by reviewing these key
methodologies, their outcome, and important points related to inverse
kinematic-based PKM calibrations in general. It is observed in this study that
the researchers focused on improving the accuracy of the platform position and
orientation considering the errors contributed by a single source or multiple
sources. The error sources considered are mainly structural, in some cases,
environmental factors are also considered, however, these calibrations are done
under no-load conditions. This study aims to understand the current state of
the art in this field and to expand the scope for other researchers in further
exploration in a specific area.

### [230] [Design of a Bed Rotation Mechanism to Facilitate In-Situ Photogrammetric Reconstruction of Printed Parts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20079)
*Travis A. Roberts,Sourabh Karmakar,Cameron J. Turner*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The authors build a research-oriented FDM test bed with closed-loop controls, environmental monitoring, and in-situ photogrammetry, including a novel spinning heated bed to enable 3D reconstruction with few cameras.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable repeatable, accurately controlled polymer FDM experiments and to link process parameters to geometric defects through photogrammetry, addressing the limitations of consumer and commercial printers.

Method: Design and fabrication of a test-bed platform with closed-loop position feedback; heated nozzle and bed temperature control; environmental sensing (temperature, humidity); cameras; an in-situ photogrammetry system; and a novel mechanism to rotate the heated bed for photogrammetric reconstruction using minimal cameras.

Result: A platform that records geometry throughout printing and allows backtracking of process parameters to defects; demonstration of the spinning bed mechanism enabling photogrammetric reconstruction with a minimal camera setup.

Conclusion: This platform provides a controllable, observable environment suitable for research on polymer FDM processes and demonstrates how photogrammetry can be integrated to correlate process parameters with geometric outcomes; the spinning bed mechanism is a key enabler for efficient reconstruction.

Abstract: Additive manufacturing, or 3D printing, is a complex process that creates
free-form geometric objects by sequentially placing material to construct an
object, usually in a layer-by-layer process. One of the most widely used
methods is Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM). FDM is used in many of the
consumer-grade polymer 3D printers available today. While consumer grade
machines are cheap and plentiful, they lack many of the features desired in a
machine used for research purposes and are often closed-source platforms.
Commercial-grade models are more expensive and are also usually closed-source
platforms that do not offer flexibility for modifications often needed for
research. The authors designed and fabricated a machine to be used as a test
bed for research in the field of polymer FDM processes. The goal was to create
a platform that tightly controls and/or monitors the FDM build parameters so
that experiments can be repeated with a known accuracy. The platform offers
closed loop position feedback, control of the hot end and bed temperature, and
monitoring of environment temperature and humidity. Additionally, the platform
is equipped with cameras and a mechanism for in-situ photogrammetry, creating a
geometric record of the printing throughout the printing process. Through
photogrammetry, backtracking and linking process parameters to observable
geometric defects can be achieved. This paper focuses on the design of a novel
mechanism for spinning the heated bed to allow for photogrammetric
reconstruction of the printed part using a minimal number of cameras, as
implemented on this platform.

*Ahmed Alanazi,Duy Ho,Yugyung Lee*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A Path-based Transformer uses a 3-grid where/what/when encoding and constraint-masked decoding to generate valid, task-aware robot trajectories, bridging graph-based planning and sequence learning, with strong real-world performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard sequence models often ignore motion structure, leading to invalid or inefficient executions; there is a need for task-aware trajectory planning that respects lattice-adjacent moves, workspace bounds, and action ordering.

Method: Proposes a Path-based Transformer with a 3-grid (where/what/when) representation and constraint-masked decoding. Enforces lattice-adjacent moves and workspace bounds, reasons over task graphs and action order. Trains on 53,755 trajectories (80% train / 20% validation). Compiled to motor primitives on an xArm Lite 6 with a depth-camera digital twin.

Result: The model aligns closely with ground truth: 89.44% stepwise accuracy, 93.32% precision, 89.44% recall, 90.40% F1. 99.99% of paths are legal by construction. In controlled tests, reach up to 97.5% and pick success 92.5%; in 60 language-specified tasks in cluttered scenes, end-to-end success 86.7%. It tolerates slips and occlusions via local re-grounding without global re-planning.

Conclusion: Path-structured representations enable Transformers to generate accurate, reliable, and interpretable robot trajectories, bridging graph-based planning and sequence-based learning, providing a practical foundation for general-purpose manipulation and sim-to-real transfer.

Abstract: Robotic arms require precise, task-aware trajectory planning, yet sequence
models that ignore motion structure often yield invalid or inefficient
executions. We present a Path-based Transformer that encodes robot motion with
a 3-grid (where/what/when) representation and constraint-masked decoding,
enforcing lattice-adjacent moves and workspace bounds while reasoning over task
graphs and action order. Trained on 53,755 trajectories (80% train / 20%
validation), the model aligns closely with ground truth -- 89.44% stepwise
accuracy, 93.32% precision, 89.44% recall, and 90.40% F1 -- with 99.99% of
paths legal by construction. Compiled to motor primitives on an xArm Lite 6
with a depth-camera digital twin, it attains up to 97.5% reach and 92.5% pick
success in controlled tests, and 86.7% end-to-end success across 60
language-specified tasks in cluttered scenes, absorbing slips and occlusions
via local re-grounding without global re-planning. These results show that
path-structured representations enable Transformers to generate accurate,
reliable, and interpretable robot trajectories, bridging graph-based planning
and sequence-based learning and providing a practical foundation for
general-purpose manipulation and sim-to-real transfer.

### [232] [Reinforcement Learning-based Robust Wall Climbing Locomotion Controller in Ferromagnetic Environment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20174)
*Yong Um,Young-Ha Shin,Joon-Ha Kim,Soonpyo Kwon,Hae-Won Park*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A reinforcement learning approach with a physics-based adhesion model and a three-phase curriculum yields robust magnetic quadruped wall-climbing that tolerates adhesion uncertainty and transfers to hardware, outperforming an adhesion-ideal MPC baseline.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Magnetic climbing robots face significant adhesion variability (partial contact, air gaps, occasional attachment failure). Robust, transferable control under these uncertainties is essential for reliable operation in real-world environments.

Method: Train a quadrupedal policy via reinforcement learning using a physics-based adhesion model in simulation. Employ a three-phase curriculum: (1) crawl on flat ground without adhesion, (2) gradually rotate gravity to vertical while activating adhesion, (3) inject stochastic adhesion failures to promote slip recovery. Compare to an MPC baseline assuming perfect adhesion; validate with untethered hardware experiments on steel surfaces.

Result: In simulation, the policy achieves high success rates, strong adhesion retention, and rapid recovery from detachment under degraded adhesion. It maintains locomotion when attachment is intermittently lost, outperforming the MPC baseline. Hardware experiments confirm robust vertical crawling on steel, maintaining stability despite transient misalignment and incomplete attachment.

Conclusion: Coupling curriculum learning with a realistic adhesion model yields a resilient sim-to-real framework for magnetic climbing robots, enabling reliable, robust locomotion in environments with uncertain adhesion.

Abstract: We present a reinforcement learning framework for quadrupedal wall-climbing
locomotion that explicitly addresses uncertainty in magnetic foot adhesion. A
physics-based adhesion model of a quadrupedal magnetic climbing robot is
incorporated into simulation to capture partial contact, air-gap sensitivity,
and probabilistic attachment failures. To stabilize learning and enable
reliable transfer, we design a three-phase curriculum: (1) acquire a crawl gait
on flat ground without adhesion, (2) gradually rotate the gravity vector to
vertical while activating the adhesion model, and (3) inject stochastic
adhesion failures to encourage slip recovery. The learned policy achieves a
high success rate, strong adhesion retention, and rapid recovery from
detachment in simulation under degraded adhesion. Compared with a model
predictive control (MPC) baseline that assumes perfect adhesion, our controller
maintains locomotion when attachment is intermittently lost. Hardware
experiments with the untethered robot further confirm robust vertical crawling
on steel surfaces, maintaining stability despite transient misalignment and
incomplete attachment. These results show that combining curriculum learning
with realistic adhesion modeling provides a resilient sim-to-real framework for
magnetic climbing robots in complex environments.

### [233] [A Contact-Driven Framework for Manipulating in the Blind](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20177)
*Muhammad Suhail Saleem,Lai Yuan,Maxim Likhachev*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A complete framework for manipulation in the blind that fuses contact feedback with structural priors to navigate unknown environments, leveraging a contact filter, occupancy prediction, and robust planning; demonstrated efficiency gains on real robots.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision can be unreliable in cluttered or occluded environments. Humans rely on touch and structural regularities to infer unseen space. The paper seeks a theoretically complete, empirically efficient method that integrates contact sensing with priors to enable robust blind manipulation.

Method: Three coupled components: (i) contact detection/localization using joint torque sensing with a contact particle filter to detect and localize contacts; (ii) occupancy estimation from contact history to build a partial workspace map and extrapolate into unexplored regions with learned predictors; (iii) planning that accounts for noise in contact localization and occupancy estimates to compute collision-avoiding, efficient paths without discarding feasible solutions.

Result: Evaluated in simulation and on a UR10e across two domestic tasks (valve under a sink with pipes; retrieving a target object from a cluttered shelf). Achieves up to 2x faster task completion vs baselines; ablations confirm the contribution of each module.

Conclusion: The framework offers a theoretically complete and empirically efficient approach to blind manipulation by integrating contact sensing with structural priors. It enables robust operation in unknown environments and shows strong efficiency gains, with potential generalization to other priors and tasks.

Abstract: Robots often face manipulation tasks in environments where vision is
inadequate due to clutter, occlusions, or poor lighting--for example, reaching
a shutoff valve at the back of a sink cabinet or locating a light switch above
a crowded shelf. In such settings, robots, much like humans, must rely on
contact feedback to distinguish free from occupied space and navigate around
obstacles. Many of these environments often exhibit strong structural
priors--for instance, pipes often span across sink cabinets--that can be
exploited to anticipate unseen structure and avoid unnecessary collisions. We
present a theoretically complete and empirically efficient framework for
manipulation in the blind that integrates contact feedback with structural
priors to enable robust operation in unknown environments. The framework
comprises three tightly coupled components: (i) a contact detection and
localization module that utilizes joint torque sensing with a contact particle
filter to detect and localize contacts, (ii) an occupancy estimation module
that uses the history of contact observations to build a partial occupancy map
of the workspace and extrapolate it into unexplored regions with learned
predictors, and (iii) a planning module that accounts for the fact that contact
localization estimates and occupancy predictions can be noisy, computing paths
that avoid collisions and complete tasks efficiently without eliminating
feasible solutions. We evaluate the system in simulation and in the real world
on a UR10e manipulator across two domestic tasks--(i) manipulating a valve
under a kitchen sink surrounded by pipes and (ii) retrieving a target object
from a cluttered shelf. Results show that the framework reliably solves these
tasks, achieving up to a 2x reduction in task completion time compared to
baselines, with ablations confirming the contribution of each module.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Experimental validation of learning-aided time-integrated current control for magnetically actuated satellite swarms, achieving enhanced controllability and decentralized current management; introduces NODA-MMH for power-optimal swarm control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enable long-term formation maintenance of large satellite swarms using magnetorquers by addressing nonlinear, underactuated, scalable, and computational challenges that grow with swarm size.

Method: Ground-based air-bearing experiments with two-axis coils to mimic orbital dynamics; implement time-integrated current control augmented by a learning-based interaction model; establish theoretical error bounds for the averaged dynamics; demonstrate decentralized current management; introduce NODA-MMH for model-based power-optimal swarm control.

Result: Demonstrated enhanced controllability of the averaged system dynamics with a guaranteed error bound; validated decentralized current management; confirmed effectiveness of the learned interaction model; proposed NODA-MMH for power-optimal swarm control based on the learned model.

Conclusion: The work supports the viability of learning-aided magnetically actuated swarms for long-term formation maintenance and provides a path toward scalable, power-efficient, model-based control, complementing existing tutorials in the area.

Abstract: This study experimentally validates the principle of large-scale satellite
swarm control through learning-aided magnetic field interactions generated by
satellite-mounted magnetorquers. This actuation presents a promising solution
for the long-term formation maintenance of multiple satellites and has
primarily been demonstrated in ground-based testbeds for two-satellite position
control. However, as the number of satellites increases beyond three,
fundamental challenges coupled with the high nonlinearity arise: 1)
nonholonomic constraints, 2) underactuation, 3) scalability, and 4)
computational cost. Previous studies have shown that time-integrated current
control theoretically solves these problems, where the average actuator outputs
align with the desired command, and a learning-based technique further enhances
their performance. Through multiple experiments, we validate critical aspects
of learning-aided time-integrated current control: (1) enhanced controllability
of the averaged system dynamics, with a theoretically guaranteed error bound,
and (2) decentralized current management. We design two-axis coils and a
ground-based experimental setup utilizing an air-bearing platform, enabling a
mathematical replication of orbital dynamics. Based on the effectiveness of the
learned interaction model, we introduce NODA-MMH (Neural power-Optimal Dipole
Allocation for certified learned Model-based Magnetically swarm control
Harness) for model-based power-optimal swarm control. This study complements
our tutorial paper on magnetically actuated swarms for the long-term formation
maintenance problem.

*Mert Bulent Sariyildiz,Philippe Weinzaepfel,Guillaume Bono,Gianluca Monaci,Christian Wolf*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Kinaema offers a scalable, memory-efficient approach to place recognition in continuous robotics by using a latent memory updated by a recurrent transformer to predict relative pose from a query image, showing favorable Mem-Nav performance against full-history transformers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In continuous robotic operations, robots must re-localize using prior observations without fixed context limits, and conventional transformers struggle with long histories or are computationally costly. The work aims to enable large-scale, efficient spatial memory for relocalization using pre-episode data.

Method: Introduce Kinaema, a model that ingests streaming visual observations and maintains an implicit latent memory updated by a transformer in a recurrent loop. It does not store explicit observation history; instead, it compresses sensor history into a compact latent representation. Upon a query image, it predicts the target space's relative position from the current pose. Evaluated on the Mem-Nav downstream task to assess navigation to goals observed before episode start and computational efficiency relative to full-history transformer approaches.

Result: The model retains a useful scene representation, enables navigation to previously observed goals, and achieves computational efficiency, notably compared to classical transformers with attention over entire histories.

Conclusion: A large-capacity recurrent model with implicit, compressed memory can effectively support long-horizon spatial localization in large scenes, offering efficiency advantages over explicit history-aware transformers and enabling memory-based navigation tasks like Mem-Nav.

Abstract: One key aspect of spatially aware robots is the ability to "find their
bearings", ie. to correctly situate themselves in previously seen spaces. In
this work, we focus on this particular scenario of continuous robotics
operations, where information observed before an actual episode start is
exploited to optimize efficiency. We introduce a new model, Kinaema, and agent,
capable of integrating a stream of visual observations while moving in a
potentially large scene, and upon request, processing a query image and
predicting the relative position of the shown space with respect to its current
position. Our model does not explicitly store an observation history, therefore
does not have hard constraints on context length. It maintains an implicit
latent memory, which is updated by a transformer in a recurrent way,
compressing the history of sensor readings into a compact representation. We
evaluate the impact of this model in a new downstream task we call "Mem-Nav".
We show that our large-capacity recurrent model maintains a useful
representation of the scene, navigates to goals observed before the actual
episode start, and is computationally efficient, in particular compared to
classical transformers with attention over an observation history.

*Ajay Sridhar,Jennifer Pan,Satvik Sharma,Chelsea Finn*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: MemER introduces a hierarchical memory-aware policy for long-horizon robotics, selecting keyframes to guide a low-level policy, using vision-language-action models, and achieving superior performance on memory-intensive tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Humans rely on memory for planning; current robot policies struggle with long histories, suffering from computational strain and brittleness under covariate shift; there is a need for efficient memory-based decision-making.

Method: A two-level hierarchy where the high-level policy selects and tracks relevant past keyframes; the high-level uses these keyframes plus the most recent frames to generate text instructions for a low-level policy. The approach is compatible with existing vision-language-action (VLA) models. In experiments, Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct is finetuned as the high-level policy and π0.5 as the low-level policy, using demonstrations augmented with minimal language annotations.

Result: MemER outperforms prior methods on three real-world long-horizon robotic manipulation tasks that require minutes of memory.

Conclusion: The memory-focused hierarchical framework enables efficient long-horizon reasoning by selectively retaining and using past experiences; it leverages existing VLA models and demonstrates practical gains in real-world tasks.

Abstract: Humans routinely rely on memory to perform tasks, yet most robot policies
lack this capability; our goal is to endow robot policies with the same
ability. Naively conditioning on long observation histories is computationally
expensive and brittle under covariate shift, while indiscriminate subsampling
of history leads to irrelevant or redundant information. We propose a
hierarchical policy framework, where the high-level policy is trained to select
and track previous relevant keyframes from its experience. The high-level
policy uses selected keyframes and the most recent frames when generating text
instructions for a low-level policy to execute. This design is compatible with
existing vision-language-action (VLA) models and enables the system to
efficiently reason over long-horizon dependencies. In our experiments, we
finetune Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct and $\pi_{0.5}$ as the high-level and low-level
policies respectively, using demonstrations supplemented with minimal language
annotations. Our approach, MemER, outperforms prior methods on three real-world
long-horizon robotic manipulation tasks that require minutes of memory. Videos

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A domain-agnostic parking pipeline (DDP) combines visual foundation models with diffusion-based planning to achieve robust, cross-domain parking performance, including zero-shot transfer to adversarial scenarios and sim-to-real transfer via a 3D Gaussian splatting environment, achieving >90% success in OOD tests.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve robustness of autonomous parking under distribution shifts (e.g., weather, lighting) where many end-to-end systems fail, without requiring extra data. Leverage visual foundation models for generalized perception and diffusion-based planning for robust motion planning.

Method: Introduce Dino-Diffusion Parking (DDP), a pipeline that fuses visual foundation models with diffusion-based planning. Trained in CARLA under regular settings and deployed zero-shot to adversarial settings. Evaluated in a 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) environment reconstructed from real parking data to assess sim-to-real transfer.

Result: Achieves parking success rate >90% across all tested out-of-distribution scenarios. Ablation studies show both network architecture and algorithmic design significantly improve cross-domain performance versus baselines.

Conclusion: DDP provides a domain-agnostic parking pipeline enabling generalized perception and robust planning under distribution shifts, with promising cross-domain performance and sim-to-real transfer potential.

Abstract: Parking is a critical pillar of driving safety. While recent end-to-end (E2E)
approaches have achieved promising in-domain results, robustness under domain
shifts (e.g., weather and lighting changes) remains a key challenge. Rather
than relying on additional data, in this paper, we propose Dino-Diffusion
Parking (DDP), a domain-agnostic autonomous parking pipeline that integrates
visual foundation models with diffusion-based planning to enable generalized
perception and robust motion planning under distribution shifts. We train our
pipeline in CARLA at regular setting and transfer it to more adversarial
settings in a zero-shot fashion. Our model consistently achieves a parking
success rate above 90% across all tested out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios,
with ablation studies confirming that both the network architecture and
algorithmic design significantly enhance cross-domain performance over existing
baselines. Furthermore, testing in a 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) environment
reconstructed from a real-world parking lot demonstrates promising sim-to-real
transfer.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Decentralized RL for modular reconfigurable robots enables zero-shot generalization across configurations with module-specific policies and shows strong simulation and lunar-analogue results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The combinatorial growth of possible morphologies in modular robots creates control complexity and limits unified control; there is a need for scalable, zero-shot capable policies that generalize to unseen configurations.

Method: Each module learns its own policy: wheel modules use Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) for locomotion, 7-DoF limbs use Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) for steering/manipulation. The approach aims for zero-shot generalization to unseen configurations and examines policy execution modes (synchronous, parallel, sequential) for conflict-free control. Evaluations are done in simulation and lunar-analogue field tests.

Result: Simulation results: steering MAE 3.63 degrees; manipulation success at 84.6% on target-offset criterion; wheel policy reduces average motor torque by 95.4% vs baseline with 99.6% success. Field tests show zero-shot integration for autonomous locomotion, steering, and preliminary alignment; system transitions smoothly among execution modes without idle states or conflicts.

Conclusion: The Dec-RL scheme is scalable, reusable, and robust for modular lunar robots, enabling zero-shot integration across morphologies and adaptable policy execution, with practical viability demonstrated in lunar-analogue scenarios.

Abstract: Modular reconfigurable robots suit task-specific space operations, but the
combinatorial growth of morphologies hinders unified control. We propose a
decentralized reinforcement learning (Dec-RL) scheme where each module learns
its own policy: wheel modules use Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) for locomotion and
7-DoF limbs use Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) for steering and
manipulation, enabling zero-shot generalization to unseen configurations. In
simulation, the steering policy achieved a mean absolute error of 3.63{\deg}
between desired and induced angles; the manipulation policy plateaued at 84.6 %
success on a target-offset criterion; and the wheel policy cut average motor
torque by 95.4 % relative to baseline while maintaining 99.6 % success.
Lunar-analogue field tests validated zero-shot integration for autonomous
locomotion, steering, and preliminary alignment for reconfiguration. The system
transitioned smoothly among synchronous, parallel, and sequential modes for
Policy Execution, without idle states or control conflicts, indicating a
scalable, reusable, and robust approach for modular lunar robots.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: NeuralTouch fuses Neural Descriptor Fields with tactile feedback and RL to refine grasps, enabling accurate, generalizable contact-rich manipulation with zero-shot sim-to-real transfer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: NDF alone is sensitive to calibration and perception noise and tactile policies often rely on fixed contact geometries; a general, contact-rich approach is needed for robust manipulation across objects.

Method: Represent target contact geometry via NDF; train a deep RL policy that uses tactile feedback to refine the grasp, conditioned on neural descriptors; no explicit contact-type specification; evaluate via ablations and zero-shot real-world tasks.

Result: Ablation studies in simulation; zero-shot transfer to real-world tasks (peg-out-in-hole, bottle lid opening) without fine-tuning; improved grasping accuracy and robustness over baselines.

Conclusion: NeuralTouch offers a general, multimodal framework for precise, contact-rich robotic manipulation by combining vision-based descriptors with tactile feedback, improving robustness and transferability.

Abstract: Grasping accuracy is a critical prerequisite for precise object manipulation,
often requiring careful alignment between the robot hand and object. Neural
Descriptor Fields (NDF) offer a promising vision-based method to generate
grasping poses that generalize across object categories. However, NDF alone can
produce inaccurate poses due to imperfect camera calibration, incomplete point
clouds, and object variability. Meanwhile, tactile sensing enables more precise
contact, but existing approaches typically learn policies limited to simple,
predefined contact geometries. In this work, we introduce NeuralTouch, a
multimodal framework that integrates NDF and tactile sensing to enable
accurate, generalizable grasping through gentle physical interaction. Our
approach leverages NDF to implicitly represent the target contact geometry,
from which a deep reinforcement learning (RL) policy is trained to refine the
grasp using tactile feedback. This policy is conditioned on the neural
descriptors and does not require explicit specification of contact types. We
validate NeuralTouch through ablation studies in simulation and zero-shot
transfer to real-world manipulation tasks--such as peg-out-in-hole and bottle
lid opening--without additional fine-tuning. Results show that NeuralTouch
significantly improves grasping accuracy and robustness over baseline methods,
offering a general framework for precise, contact-rich robotic manipulation.

TL;DR: Diffusion-based policy conditioned on structured, non-downsampled point maps fused with RGB (via xLSTM) for multi-modal robotic manipulation, achieving state-of-the-art on RoboCasa/CALVIN and real robots.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Combine geometric detail from point clouds with semantic context from RGB images to overcome the limitations of relying on a single modality in robotic manipulation, improving precision and generalization.

Method: Introduce PointMapPolicy that uses structured grids of points (point maps) without downsampling, enabling the use of standard computer vision techniques on 3D data. Fuse point maps with RGB through an xLSTM backbone to form a diffusion-conditioned policy. The approach supports frame-aligned data and avoids loss of fine details, tested on RoboCasa and CALVIN benchmarks and real robots.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse manipulation tasks on RoboCasa and CALVIN benchmarks and in real-robot experiments.

Conclusion: Structured 3D point maps, when fused with RGB in a diffusion-driven policy, enhance geometric awareness and multi-modal perception for robotic manipulation, with strong empirical validation and accessible resources on the project page.

Abstract: Robotic manipulation systems benefit from complementary sensing modalities,
where each provides unique environmental information. Point clouds capture
detailed geometric structure, while RGB images provide rich semantic context.
Current point cloud methods struggle to capture fine-grained detail, especially
for complex tasks, which RGB methods lack geometric awareness, which hinders
their precision and generalization. We introduce PointMapPolicy, a novel
approach that conditions diffusion policies on structured grids of points
without downsampling. The resulting data type makes it easier to extract shape
and spatial relationships from observations, and can be transformed between
reference frames. Yet due to their structure in a regular grid, we enable the
use of established computer vision techniques directly to 3D data. Using xLSTM
as a backbone, our model efficiently fuses the point maps with RGB data for
enhanced multi-modal perception. Through extensive experiments on the RoboCasa
and CALVIN benchmarks and real robot evaluations, we demonstrate that our
method achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse manipulation tasks.

*Kohei Nishi,Masato Kobayashi,Yuki Uranishi*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A mixed-reality underwater teleoperation system (MR-UBi) with a reaction-torque indicator, driven by bilateral control, enhances visual-haptic feedback to improve torque control, usability, and workload during robot-arm manipulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Underwater teleoperation suffers from imperfect torque feedback and cognitive load; integrating intuitive visual torque cues with haptic information could improve stability, accuracy, and operator experience.

Method: Implemented MR-UBi with a reaction torque indicator (RTI) overlay in a MR-HMD using color- and length-coded torque bars. Evaluated against a bilateral-control baseline with 16 participants on lift/pick-and-place tasks across objects of varying stiffness.

Result: MR-UBi significantly improved grasping-torque control accuracy by increasing time within the optimal torque range and reducing both low- and high-torque events. Subjective measures showed higher usability (SUS) and lower workload (NASA-TLX).

Conclusion: Integrating visual torque cues with haptic feedback via MR-UBi yields more stable, accurate, and user-friendly underwater robot-arm teleoperation, demonstrating the value of multimodal feedback in complex teleoperation environments.

Abstract: We present a mixed reality-based underwater robot arm teleoperation system
with a reaction torque indicator via bilateral control (MR-UBi). The reaction
torque indicator (RTI) overlays a color and length-coded torque bar in the
MR-HMD, enabling seamless integration of visual and haptic feedback during
underwater robot arm teleoperation. User studies with sixteen participants
compared MR-UBi against a bilateral-control baseline. MR-UBi significantly
improved grasping-torque control accuracy, increasing the time within the
optimal torque range and reducing both low and high grasping torque range
during lift and pick-and-place tasks with objects of different stiffness.
Subjective evaluations further showed higher usability (SUS) and lower workload
(NASA--TLX). Overall, the results confirm that \textit{MR-UBi} enables more
stable, accurate, and user-friendly underwater robot-arm teleoperation through
the integration of visual and haptic feedback. For additional material, please

### [242] [Robot Path and Trajectory Planning Considering a Spatially Fixed TCP](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20473)
*Bernhard Rameder,Hubert Gattringer,Andreas Mueller,Ronald Naderer*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A method for planning robot trajectories with a fixed tool center point by moving the workpiece, using B-splines to produce smooth, orientation-constrained paths, validated on a real industrial robot.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable smooth, orientation-aware trajectory planning in scenarios where it is easier to move the workpiece than the tool, and to ensure continuity and feasibility of the robot path.

Method: Represent the motion in workspace coordinates with a spatially fixed TCP, model the processing path (from design points or a defined shape) with B-splines to ensure smoothness, enforce prescribed orientation and a specific TCP velocity during trajectory generation, and validate the approach on a real industrial robot moving an arbitrarily defined part.

Result: A continuous, smooth robot trajectory was generated and validated on a real system, demonstrating feasibility of the approach for fixed TCP with part movement.

Conclusion: The proposed framework enables practical trajectory planning under a fixed TCP by coordinating part movement and spline-based path generation, yielding smooth, orientation-consistent motion demonstrated experimentally.

Abstract: This paper presents a method for planning a trajectory in workspace
coordinates using a spatially fixed tool center point (TCP), while taking into
account the processing path on a part. This approach is beneficial if it is
easier to move the part rather than moving the tool. Whether a mathematical
description that defines the shape to be processed or single points from a
design program are used, the robot path is finally represented using B-splines.
The use of splines enables the path to be continuous with a desired degree,
which finally leads to a smooth robot trajectory. While calculating the robot
trajectory through prescribed orientation, additionally a given velocity at the
TCP has to be considered. The procedure was validated on a real system using an
industrial robot moving an arbitrary defined part.

### [243] [Degradation-Aware Cooperative Multi-Modal GNSS-Denied Localization Leveraging LiDAR-Based Robot Detections](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20480)
*Václav Pritzl,Xianjia Yu,Tomi Westerlund,Petr Štěpán,Martin Saska*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: An adaptive, loosely-coupled multi-robot localization framework that fuses asynchronous VIO, LIO, and 3D inter-robot detections using a factor graph, with interpolation-based fusion and degradation-aware weighting; demonstrated on UGV/UAV teams with improved localization under sensor faults.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long-term, accurate localization in GNSS-denied environments is essential but challenging. Relying on a single robot's sensors increases size, weight, and power costs; distributing sensors across multiple robots improves deployability but requires robust fusion of asynchronous, multi-modal data.

Method: A factor-graph-based cooperative localization approach that fuses asynchronous Visual-Inertial Odometry (VIO), LiDAR-Inertial Odometry (LIO), and 3D inter-robot detections in a loosely-coupled manner. Introduces an interpolation-based factor to handle unsynchronized measurements. Evaluates LIO degradations via an approximate scan-matching Hessian and weights odometry data proportionally to the Wasserstein distance between consecutive VIO outputs. Includes theoretical analysis of cooperative localization under sensory degradations, and extensive real-world experiments with heterogeneous UGV/UAV teams.

Result: The approach yields significant improvements in localization accuracy under various sensory degradations in real-world UGV/UAV experiments.

Conclusion: Adaptive, multi-modal, multi-robot cooperative localization with interpolation-based fusion and degradation-aware weighting robustly enhances localization in GNSS-denied settings, leveraging cross-robot information to compensate for degraded sensors.

Abstract: Accurate long-term localization using onboard sensors is crucial for robots
operating in Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS)-denied environments.
While complementary sensors mitigate individual degradations, carrying all the
available sensor types on a single robot significantly increases the size,
weight, and power demands. Distributing sensors across multiple robots enhances
the deployability but introduces challenges in fusing asynchronous, multi-modal
data from independently moving platforms. We propose a novel adaptive
multi-modal multi-robot cooperative localization approach using a factor-graph
formulation to fuse asynchronous Visual-Inertial Odometry (VIO), LiDAR-Inertial
Odometry (LIO), and 3D inter-robot detections from distinct robots in a
loosely-coupled fashion. The approach adapts to changing conditions, leveraging
reliable data to assist robots affected by sensory degradations. A novel
interpolation-based factor enables fusion of the unsynchronized measurements.
LIO degradations are evaluated based on the approximate scan-matching Hessian.
A novel approach of weighting odometry data proportionally to the Wasserstein
distance between the consecutive VIO outputs is proposed. A theoretical
analysis is provided, investigating the cooperative localization problem under
various conditions, mainly in the presence of sensory degradations. The
proposed method has been extensively evaluated on real-world data gathered with
heterogeneous teams of an Unmanned Ground Vehicle (UGV) and Unmanned Aerial
Vehicles (UAVs), showing that the approach provides significant improvements in
localization accuracy in the presence of various sensory degradations.

### [244] [Dual Control Reference Generation for Optimal Pick-and-Place Execution under Payload Uncertainty](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20483)
*Victor Vantilborgh,Hrishikesh Sathyanarayan,Guillaume Crevecoeur,Ian Abraham,Tom Lefebvre*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A dual-control approach to robot manipulation with unknown dynamics, using adaptive feedback and two trajectory-generation methods that account for parameter uncertainty; both approaches leverage Fisher information to balance task performance and learning, validated on pick-and-place tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Unknown dynamics in manipulation tasks require online adaptation and active exploration to enable accurate, model-based control; dual control offers a framework to balance control and learning.

Method: Fix a structured adaptive feedback policy and propose two trajectory-generation strategies: (1) robust optimal control that minimizes expected task cost incorporating parameter uncertainty, and (2) minimizing optimality loss, i.e., the sensitivity of parameter-relevant information to task performance. Fisher information emerges as a natural side effect in both methods.

Result: Demonstrated on a pick-and-place task: reference trajectories designed with control considerations yield faster, more accurate task execution and system identification, while maintaining stable and efficient control.

Conclusion: The proposed dual-control-inspired framework enables efficient manipulation under unknown dynamics by embedding adaptation in the feedback policy and using trajectory objectives that account for uncertainty; Fisher information naturally guides the trade-off between learning and performance.

Abstract: This work addresses the problem of robot manipulation tasks under unknown
dynamics, such as pick-and-place tasks under payload uncertainty, where active
exploration and(/for) online parameter adaptation during task execution are
essential to enable accurate model-based control. The problem is framed as dual
control seeking a closed-loop optimal control problem that accounts for
parameter uncertainty. We simplify the dual control problem by pre-defining the
structure of the feedback policy to include an explicit adaptation mechanism.
Then we propose two methods for reference trajectory generation. The first
directly embeds parameter uncertainty in robust optimal control methods that
minimize the expected task cost. The second method considers minimizing the
so-called optimality loss, which measures the sensitivity of parameter-relevant
information with respect to task performance. We observe that both approaches
reason over the Fisher information as a natural side effect of their
formulations, simultaneously pursuing optimal task execution. We demonstrate
the effectiveness of our approaches for a pick-and-place manipulation task. We
show that designing the reference trajectories whilst taking into account the
control enables faster and more accurate task performance and system
identification while ensuring stable and efficient control.

### [245] [Simultaneous Stiffness and Trajectory Optimization for Energy Minimization of Pick-and-Place Tasks of SEA-Actuated Parallel Kinematic Manipulators](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20490)
*Thomas Kordik,Hubert Gattringer,Andreas Mueller*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Energy-efficient control for SEA-actuated PKMs in pick-and-place by exciting elastic eigenmotions; jointly optimize task trajectories and SEA stiffness; validated on two parallel robots with redundancy, showing energy reduction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Industrial PKMs performing repetitive pick-and-place tasks consume notable energy; leveraging series elastic actuators and elastic eigenmotions can reduce energy drain; providing a design-tool through stiffness optimization for SEA actuators.

Method: Develop a dynamic model of SEA-driven PKMs, formulate an energy-minimizing optimal control problem with both operating trajectories and SEA stiffnesses as decision variables, analyze a prescribed cyclic pick-and-place task, and test on two parallel robot applications with redundancy.

Result: The optimization yields energy savings compared to baseline; optimizing SEA stiffness informs design/dimensioning; redundancy is addressed; results confirm the energy-reduction hypothesis.

Conclusion: The approach is viable for reducing energy use in SEA-actuated PKMs via simultaneous trajectory and stiffness optimization. The stiffness optimization serves as a design tool for dimensioning. The study validates the concept on two parallel robot tasks; variable-stiffness actuators are not considered, suggesting a direction for future work.

Abstract: A major field of industrial robot applications deals with repetitive tasks
that alternate between operating points. For these so-called pick-and-place
operations, parallel kinematic manipulators (PKM) are frequently employed.
These tasks tend to automatically run for a long period of time and therefore
minimizing energy consumption is always of interest. Recent research addresses
this topic by the use of elastic elements and particularly series elastic
actuators (SEA). This paper explores the possibilities of minimizing energy
consumption of SEA actuated PKM performing pick-and-place tasks. The basic idea
is to excite eigenmotions that result from the actuator springs and exploit
their oscillating characteristics. To this end, a prescribed cyclic
pick-and-place operation is analyzed and a dynamic model of SEA driven PKM is
derived. Subsequently, an energy minimizing optimal control problem is
formulated where operating trajectories as well as SEA stiffnesses are
optimized simultaneously. Here, optimizing the actuator stiffness does not
account for variable stiffness actuators. It serves as a tool for the design
and dimensioning process. The hypothesis on energy reduction is tested on two
(parallel) robot applications where redundant actuation is also addressed. The
results confirm the validity of this approach.

### [246] [A Parameter-Linear Formulation of the Optimal Path Following Problem for Robotic Manipulator](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20496)
*Tobias Marauli,Hubert Gattringer,Andreas Mueller*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Maximizes path speed on a fixed path to avoid time-optimal singularities, enabling smooth trajectory planning with a linear, discrete optimization problem.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Time-optimal path following has singularities at zero path speed when parameterizing the path, and generating smooth trajectories with low computation is challenging.

Method: Formulates trajectory planning by maximizing the speed along a prescribed path; the discrete reformulation of the problem is linear in the optimization variables.

Result: Provides smooth trajectory planning with low computational effort and a linear discrete formulation, mitigating the singularities of time-optimal approaches.

Conclusion: Maximizing path speed along a prescribed path is a viable, computationally efficient alternative to time-optimal formulations, producing smooth trajectories without the zero-speed singularities.

Abstract: In this paper the computational challenges of time-optimal path following are
addressed. The standard approach is to minimize the travel time, which
inevitably leads to singularities at zero path speed, when reformulating the
optimization problem in terms of a path parameter. Thus, smooth trajectory
generation while maintaining a low computational effort is quite challenging,
since the singularities have to be taken into account. To this end, a different
approach is presented in this paper. This approach is based on maximizing the
path speed along a prescribed path. Furthermore, the approach is capable of
planning smooth trajectories numerically efficient. Moreover, the discrete
reformulation of the underlying problem is linear in optimization variables.

*Constantine Frost,Chad Council,Margaret McGuinness,Nathaniel Hanson*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: An open-source, Unity-based simulator (RubbleSim) for photorealistic rubble void spaces, enabling ground-truth, configurable experiments to study robot perception and to overcome data-access barriers in disaster scenes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Public data on void spaces in structural collapses is scarce due to legal ownership and safety constraints; sites that could be used for training are proprietary. RubbleSim provides a repeatable, accessible benchmark for evaluating perception under challenging visual conditions in rubble environments.

Method: Physics-based, stochastic rubble-pile generation implemented in Unity with multi-OS support; design informed by visits to real rubble training sites; photorealistic rendering; preserves ground-truth; assesses perception via a state-of-the-art structure-from-motion pipeline.

Result: Demonstrates how perception performance degrades under challenging visual conditions in emulated void spaces; provides pre-built binaries and source code for researchers to reuse and modify.

Conclusion: RubbleSim offers an open, configurable platform to study perception in rubble void spaces, addressing access barriers to real disaster data and enabling rapid, reproducible experimentation in disaster robotics research.

Abstract: Despite well-reported instances of robots being used in disaster response,
there is scant published data on the internal composition of the void spaces
within structural collapse incidents. Data collected during these incidents is
mired in legal constraints, as ownership is often tied to the responding
agencies, with little hope of public release for research. While engineered
rubble piles are used for training, these sites are also reluctant to release
information about their proprietary training grounds. To overcome this access
challenge, we present RubbleSim -- an open-source, reconfigurable simulator for
photorealistic void space exploration. The design of the simulation assets is
directly informed by visits to numerous training rubble sites at differing
levels of complexity. The simulator is implemented in Unity with
multi-operating system support. The simulation uses a physics-based approach to
build stochastic rubble piles, allowing for rapid iteration between simulation
worlds while retaining absolute knowledge of the ground truth. Using RubbleSim,
we apply a state-of-the-art structure-from-motion algorithm to illustrate how
perception performance degrades under challenging visual conditions inside the
emulated void spaces. Pre-built binaries and source code to implement are
available online: https://github.com/mit-ll/rubble_pile_simulator.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A continual visual navigation framework, C-Nav, for continual object navigation in dynamic open-world environments, using a dual-path anti-forgetting mechanism (feature distillation for representation consistency across modalities and feature replay for policy consistency) and adaptive sampling, achieving superior performance with lower memory than baselines; code release.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the real-world need for continual adaptation to evolving object categories and dynamic environments; current methods rely on fixed trajectories/categories and suffer catastrophic forgetting; proposes a benchmark and methods to study continual object navigation.

Method: Introduce C-Nav with two components: (1) dual-path anti-forgetting: feature distillation aligning multi-modal inputs into a shared representation space; feature replay preserving temporal features in the action decoder; (2) adaptive sampling selecting diverse/informative experiences to minimize redundancy and memory usage. Evaluated across multiple model architectures; benchmark for continual object navigation.

Result: C-Nav consistently outperforms existing approaches, even surpassing baselines with full trajectory retention, while significantly reducing memory requirements.

Conclusion: C-Nav offers effective continual learning for embodied navigation in open-world dynamics, enabling continual acquisition of new object categories with retained prior knowledge; code will be publicly released.

Abstract: Embodied agents are expected to perform object navigation in dynamic,
open-world environments. However, existing approaches typically rely on static
trajectories and a fixed set of object categories during training, overlooking
the real-world requirement for continual adaptation to evolving scenarios. To
facilitate related studies, we introduce the continual object navigation
benchmark, which requires agents to acquire navigation skills for new object
categories while avoiding catastrophic forgetting of previously learned
knowledge. To tackle this challenge, we propose C-Nav, a continual visual
navigation framework that integrates two key innovations: (1) A dual-path
anti-forgetting mechanism, which comprises feature distillation that aligns
multi-modal inputs into a consistent representation space to ensure
representation consistency, and feature replay that retains temporal features
within the action decoder to ensure policy consistency. (2) An adaptive
sampling strategy that selects diverse and informative experiences, thereby
reducing redundancy and minimizing memory overhead. Extensive experiments
across multiple model architectures demonstrate that C-Nav consistently
outperforms existing approaches, achieving superior performance even compared
to baselines with full trajectory retention, while significantly lowering
memory requirements. The code will be publicly available at

### [249] [Real-Time Gait Adaptation for Quadrupeds using Model Predictive Control and Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20706)
*Ganga Nair B,Prakrut Kotecha,Shishir Kolathaya*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A model-free RL framework combines MPPI and Dreamer to adapt quadruped gait in a continuous gait space, achieving energy-efficient, adaptive gaits with real-time optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional model-free RL tends to converge to a single gait; MPC yields optimal policies but struggles to adapt to changing environments. The paper aims to enable real-time, adaptive gait optimization across a continuum of gaits.

Method: At each step, MPPI jointly optimizes actions and gait variables using a Dreamer-based reward; includes velocity tracking, energy efficiency, stability, smooth gait transitions; penalties for abrupt gait changes; a learned value function is used as terminal reward, enabling infinite-horizon planning.

Result: In simulation on Unitree Go1, energy consumption reduced by up to 36.48% across target speeds, with accurate tracking and adaptive gaits.

Conclusion: The framework enables real-time, continuous-gait adaptation with improved energy efficiency and task-appropriate locomotion, validated in simulation; suggests potential for deployment on physical quadrupeds with learned rewards.

Abstract: Model-free reinforcement learning (RL) has enabled adaptable and agile
quadruped locomotion; however, policies often converge to a single gait,
leading to suboptimal performance. Traditionally, Model Predictive Control
(MPC) has been extensively used to obtain task-specific optimal policies but
lacks the ability to adapt to varying environments. To address these
limitations, we propose an optimization framework for real-time gait adaptation
in a continuous gait space, combining the Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI)
algorithm with a Dreamer module to produce adaptive and optimal policies for
quadruped locomotion. At each time step, MPPI jointly optimizes the actions and
gait variables using a learned Dreamer reward that promotes velocity tracking,
energy efficiency, stability, and smooth transitions, while penalizing abrupt
gait changes. A learned value function is incorporated as terminal reward,
extending the formulation to an infinite-horizon planner. We evaluate our
framework in simulation on the Unitree Go1, demonstrating an average reduction
of up to 36.48\% in energy consumption across varying target speeds, while
maintaining accurate tracking and adaptive, task-appropriate gaits.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: FieldGen uses an attractor-field-guided data generation to collect scalable, diverse, high-quality real-world manipulation data with minimal supervision, achieving better policy performance than teleoperation while cutting human effort.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need for large-scale, diverse, and high-quality real-world data for robotic manipulation. Simulation suffers from sim-to-real gaps, and teleoperation provides high-quality data but with limited diversity and high labor costs.

Method: FieldGen decomposes manipulation into two stages: a pre-manipulation phase to diversify trajectories and a fine manipulation phase requiring precision. Human demonstrations capture key contact and pose information; an attraction field automatically generates diverse trajectories converging to successful configurations. FieldGen-Reward provides reward annotations to further enhance learning.

Result: Policies trained with FieldGen show higher success rates and improved stability compared to teleoperation baselines, while significantly reducing human effort in long-term real-world data collection.

Conclusion: FieldGen enables scalable, diverse, and high-quality real-world data collection with minimal supervision by decoupling trajectory diversity from precise manipulation; the reward-augmented variant further improves policy learning.

Abstract: Large-scale and diverse datasets are vital for training robust robotic
manipulation policies, yet existing data collection methods struggle to balance
scale, diversity, and quality. Simulation offers scalability but suffers from
sim-to-real gaps, while teleoperation yields high-quality demonstrations with
limited diversity and high labor cost. We introduce FieldGen, a field-guided
data generation framework that enables scalable, diverse, and high-quality
real-world data collection with minimal human supervision. FieldGen decomposes
manipulation into two stages: a pre-manipulation phase, allowing trajectory
diversity, and a fine manipulation phase requiring expert precision. Human
demonstrations capture key contact and pose information, after which an
attraction field automatically generates diverse trajectories converging to
successful configurations. This decoupled design combines scalable trajectory
diversity with precise supervision. Moreover, FieldGen-Reward augments
generated data with reward annotations to further enhance policy learning.
Experiments demonstrate that policies trained with FieldGen achieve higher
success rates and improved stability compared to teleoperation-based baselines,
while significantly reducing human effort in long-term real-world data

Motivation: Closing the simulation-to-reality gap is critical for reliable deployment of learned robotic policies from simulation to the real world.

Method: Literature survey and synthesis: taxonomy of root causes of the reality gap, review of proposed solutions and evaluation metrics, and discussion of gaps and future directions.

Result: A comprehensive overview and taxonomy of the sim-to-real landscape, summarizing current methods, their evaluation, practical guidance for researchers, and a synthesis of progress and limitations.

Conclusion: While advances exist across locomotion, navigation, and manipulation, the reality gap remains a core challenge; there is a need for deeper cause analysis, standardized evaluation, and integrated approaches to improve sim-to-real transfer.

Abstract: Machine learning has facilitated significant advancements across various
robotics domains, including navigation, locomotion, and manipulation. Many such
achievements have been driven by the extensive use of simulation as a critical
tool for training and testing robotic systems prior to their deployment in
real-world environments. However, simulations consist of abstractions and
approximations that inevitably introduce discrepancies between simulated and
real environments, known as the reality gap. These discrepancies significantly
hinder the successful transfer of systems from simulation to the real world.
Closing this gap remains one of the most pressing challenges in robotics.
Recent advances in sim-to-real transfer have demonstrated promising results
across various platforms, including locomotion, navigation, and manipulation.
By leveraging techniques such as domain randomization, real-to-sim transfer,
state and action abstractions, and sim-real co-training, many works have
overcome the reality gap. However, challenges persist, and a deeper
understanding of the reality gap's root causes and solutions is necessary. In
this survey, we present a comprehensive overview of the sim-to-real landscape,
highlighting the causes, solutions, and evaluation metrics for the reality gap
and sim-to-real transfer.

Conclusion: GSWorld provides a robust, reproducible pipeline for photo-realistic manipulation simulation, enabling close-loop development from real data to sim2real training, with the GSDF asset format facilitating scalable, diverse scenes and robot embodiments.

Abstract: This paper presents GSWorld, a robust, photo-realistic simulator for robotics
manipulation that combines 3D Gaussian Splatting with physics engines. Our
framework advocates "closing the loop" of developing manipulation policies with
reproducible evaluation of policies learned from real-robot data and sim2real
policy training without using real robots. To enable photo-realistic rendering
of diverse scenes, we propose a new asset format, which we term GSDF (Gaussian
Scene Description File), that infuses Gaussian-on-Mesh representation with
robot URDF and other objects. With a streamlined reconstruction pipeline, we
curate a database of GSDF that contains 3 robot embodiments for single-arm and
bimanual manipulation, as well as more than 40 objects. Combining GSDF with
physics engines, we demonstrate several immediate interesting applications: (1)
learning zero-shot sim2real pixel-to-action manipulation policy with
photo-realistic rendering, (2) automated high-quality DAgger data collection
for adapting policies to deployment environments, (3) reproducible benchmarking
of real-robot manipulation policies in simulation, (4) simulation data
collection by virtual teleoperation, and (5) zero-shot sim2real visual
reinforcement learning. Website: https://3dgsworld.github.io/.

Motivation: To solve generalization across diverse environments while respecting distinct robot embodiments, by separating semantic planning from physical grounding and leveraging open-world data plus safe simulation.

Method: Train a generalist planner in image-space from open-world data; train a specialist affordance model in safe, low-cost simulation to capture robot constraints; integrate via an interface where planner outputs image-space candidate paths that the affordance model evaluates and re-ranks; enable cross-embodiment navigation and natural-language steering.

Result: Real-world experiments show higher success rates than state-of-the-art model-based and end-to-end methods in indoor/outdoor navigation; demonstrates cross-embodiment navigation across legged and wheeled robots; ablations show the specialist model is key; 3x higher success by rejecting infeasible plans.

Conclusion: A hierarchical planner-grounding approach enables robust, cross-embodiment navigation and easier steering, by decoupling planning from embodiment and grounding high-level plans in affordance evaluations; enables deployment of a single planner across diverse robots.

Abstract: A fundamental challenge in robot navigation lies in learning policies that
generalize across diverse environments while conforming to the unique physical
constraints and capabilities of a specific embodiment (e.g., quadrupeds can
walk up stairs, but rovers cannot). We propose VAMOS, a hierarchical VLA that
decouples semantic planning from embodiment grounding: a generalist planner
learns from diverse, open-world data, while a specialist affordance model
learns the robot's physical constraints and capabilities in safe, low-cost
simulation. We enabled this separation by carefully designing an interface that
lets a high-level planner propose candidate paths directly in image space that
the affordance model then evaluates and re-ranks. Our real-world experiments
show that VAMOS achieves higher success rates in both indoor and complex
outdoor navigation than state-of-the-art model-based and end-to-end learning
methods. We also show that our hierarchical design enables cross-embodied
navigation across legged and wheeled robots and is easily steerable using
natural language. Real-world ablations confirm that the specialist model is key
to embodiment grounding, enabling a single high-level planner to be deployed
across physically distinct wheeled and legged robots. Finally, this model
significantly enhances single-robot reliability, achieving 3X higher success
rates by rejecting physically infeasible plans. Website:
