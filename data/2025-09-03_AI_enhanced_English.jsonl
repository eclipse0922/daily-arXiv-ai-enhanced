Although contemporary dehazing models have\ndemonstrated promising performance, few have thoroughly investigated\nhigh-resolution imagery. In such scenarios, practitioners often resort to\ndownsampling the input image or processing it in smaller patches, which leads\nto a notable performance degradation.

Object-centric learning aims\nto mimic this process in an unsupervised manner. Recently, the slot\nattention-based framework has emerged as a leading approach in this area and\nhas been widely used in various downstream tasks. However, existing slot\nattention methods face two key limitations: (1) a lack of high-level semantic\ninformation. In current methods, image areas are assigned to slots based on\nlow-level features such as color and texture. This makes the model overly\nsensitive to low-level features and limits its understanding of object\ncontours, shapes, or other semantic characteristics. (2) The inability to\nfine-tune the encoder.

This paper addresses\nthe problem of detecting and correcting label noise in ordinal image\nclassification tasks. To this end, a novel data-centric method called ORDinal\nAdaptive Correction (ORDAC) is proposed for adaptive correction of noisy\nlabels. The proposed approach leverages the capabilities of Label Distribution\nLearning (LDL) to model the inherent ambiguity and uncertainty present in\nordinal labels. During training, ORDAC dynamically adjusts the mean and\nstandard deviation of the label distribution for each sample. Rather than\ndiscarding potentially noisy samples, this approach aims to correct them and\nmake optimal use of the entire training dataset. The effectiveness of the\nproposed method is evaluated on benchmark datasets for age estimation (Adience)\nand disease severity detection (Diabetic Retinopathy) under various asymmetric\nGaussian noise scenarios. Results show that ORDAC and its extended versions\n(ORDAC_C and ORDAC_R) lead to significant improvements in model performance.\nFor instance, on the Adience dataset with 40% noise, ORDAC_R reduced the mean\nabsolute error from 0.86 to 0.62 and increased the recall metric from 0.37 to\n0.49. The method also demonstrated its effectiveness in correcting intrinsic\nnoise present in the original datasets. This research indicates that adaptive\nlabel correction using label distributions is an effective strategy to enhance\nthe robustness and accuracy of ordinal classification models in the presence of\nnoisy data.", "AI": {"tldr": "A data-centric approach ORDAC uses Label Distribution Learning to adaptively correct noisy ordinal labels during training, improving robustness and accuracy on age estimation and disease severity tasks, with extensions ORDAC_C and ORDAC_R showing notable gains under asymmetric noise.", "motivation": "Ordinal image classification faces label noise due to ambiguous class boundaries; traditional denoising or discarding data loses information.
