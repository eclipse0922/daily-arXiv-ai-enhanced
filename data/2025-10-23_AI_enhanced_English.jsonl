Due to the\nsurround-view with minimal overlap regions, existing methods typically fail to\nensure geometric consistency and reconstruction quality for novel views. To\ntackle this tension, we claim that geometric information must be learned\nexplicitly, and the resulting features should be leveraged to guide the\nelevating of semantic quality in novel views. In this paper, we introduce\n\\textbf{Visual Gaussian Driving (VGD)}, a novel feed-forward end-to-end\nlearning framework designed to address this challenge. To achieve generalizable\ngeometric estimation, we design a lightweight variant of the VGGT architecture\nto efficiently distill its geometric priors from the pre-trained VGGT to the\ngeometry branch. Furthermore, we design a Gaussian Head that fuses multi-scale\ngeometry tokens to predict Gaussian parameters for novel view rendering, which\nshares the same patch backbone as the geometry branch. Finally, we integrate\nmulti-scale features from both geometry and Gaussian head branches to jointly\nsupervise a semantic refinement model, optimizing rendering quality through\nfeature-consistent learning.

When monitoring such systems by means of sensors, one\noften assumes that some form of `age' is latently present in the data, but\nperhaps the available sensors do not readily provide this useful information.\nThe task that we study in this paper is to extract potential proxies for this\n`age' from the available multi-variate time series without having clear data on\nwhat `age' actually is. We argue that when we find a sensor, or more likely\nsome discovered function of the available sensors, that is sufficiently\nmonotonic, that function can act as the proxy we are searching for. Using a\ncarefully defined grammar and optimising the resulting equations in terms of\nmonotonicity, defined as the absolute Spearman's Rank Correlation between time\nand the candidate formula, the proposed approach generates a set of candidate\nfeatures which are then fitted and assessed on monotonicity. The proposed\nsystem is evaluated against an artificially generated dataset and two\nreal-world datasets. In all experiments, we show that the system is able to\ncombine sensors with low individual monotonicity into latent features with high\nmonotonicity. For the real-world dataset of InfraWatch, a structural health\nmonitoring project, we show that two features with individual absolute\nSpearman's $\\rho$ values of $0.13$ and $0.09$ can be combined into a proxy with\nan absolute Spearman's $\\rho$ of $0.95$.
