### [1] [Label Smoothing++: Enhanced Label Regularization for Training Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05307)
*Sachin Chhabra,Hemanth Venkateswara,Baoxin Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Label Smoothing++ introduces a target-fixed label with learned non-target probabilities to preserve inter-class relationships.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard label smoothing reduces overconfidence but treats all non-target classes equally, erasing inter-class structure; there is a need for regularization that preserves inter-class relationships.

Method: Maintain a fixed target-class probability while enabling the network to learn and shape the probabilities of non-target classes to reflect inter-class relationships during training.

Result: Empirical results on multiple datasets show reduced overconfidence and improved generalization by better capturing inter-class relationships compared to traditional label smoothing.

Conclusion: Label Smoothing++ provides a principled way to regularize labels by fixing the target class and learning structured non-target distributions, mitigating overconfidence and enhancing generalization.

Abstract: Training neural networks with one-hot target labels often results in
overconfidence and overfitting. Label smoothing addresses this issue by
perturbing the one-hot target labels by adding a uniform probability vector to
create a regularized label. Although label smoothing improves the network's
generalization ability, it assigns equal importance to all the non-target
classes, which destroys the inter-class relationships. In this paper, we
propose a novel label regularization training strategy called Label
Smoothing++, which assigns non-zero probabilities to non-target classes and
accounts for their inter-class relationships. Our approach uses a fixed label
for the target class while enabling the network to learn the labels associated
with non-target classes. Through extensive experiments on multiple datasets, we
demonstrate how Label Smoothing++ mitigates overconfident predictions while
promoting inter-class relationships and generalization capabilities.

### [2] [VILOD: A Visual Interactive Labeling Tool for Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05317)
*Isac Holm*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VILOD enables human-in-the-loop object detection labeling via visual analytics, offering interactive data exploration, model state interpretation, and diverse sampling strategies that compete with automated uncertainty-based AL baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: OD labeling is data-hungry and annotation costly; traditional active learning can be opaque and miss informative samples. HITL with visual analytics can provide transparency and strategic guidance to human annotators.

Method: Develop VILOD, a visual interactive labeling tool for object detection, integrating a t-SNE projection of image features, uncertainty heatmaps, and model state views. Supports exploration of data, interpretation of model states, incorporation of AL suggestions, and implementation of varied sample-selection strategies within an iterative HITL workflow. Evaluated through comparative use cases.

Result: Visual-guided labeling strategies in VILOD yield competitive object detection performance trajectories compared to a baseline automated uncertainty sampling AL. The tool improves interpretability of model and dataset characteristics and supports diverse labeling strategies.

Conclusion: VILOD provides a novel, transparent HITL-AL workflow for OD annotation and offers empirical insight into how visual interfaces can enhance strategy selection, interpretability, and potentially effectiveness in active labeling for object detection.

Abstract: The advancement of Object Detection (OD) using Deep Learning (DL) is often
hindered by the significant challenge of acquiring large, accurately labeled
datasets, a process that is time-consuming and expensive. While techniques like
Active Learning (AL) can reduce annotation effort by intelligently querying
informative samples, they often lack transparency, limit the strategic insight
of human experts, and may overlook informative samples not aligned with an
employed query strategy. To mitigate these issues, Human-in-the-Loop (HITL)
approaches integrating human intelligence and intuition throughout the machine
learning life-cycle have gained traction. Leveraging Visual Analytics (VA),
effective interfaces can be created to facilitate this human-AI collaboration.
This thesis explores the intersection of these fields by developing and
investigating "VILOD: A Visual Interactive Labeling tool for Object Detection".
VILOD utilizes components such as a t-SNE projection of image features,
together with uncertainty heatmaps and model state views. Enabling users to
explore data, interpret model states, AL suggestions, and implement diverse
sample selection strategies within an iterative HITL workflow for OD. An
empirical investigation using comparative use cases demonstrated how VILOD,
through its interactive visualizations, facilitates the implementation of
distinct labeling strategies by making the model's state and dataset
characteristics more interpretable (RQ1). The study showed that different
visually-guided labeling strategies employed within VILOD result in competitive
OD performance trajectories compared to an automated uncertainty sampling AL
baseline (RQ2). This work contributes a novel tool and empirical insight into
making the HITL-AL workflow for OD annotation more transparent, manageable, and
potentially more effective.

### [3] [Context-Aware Knowledge Distillation with Adaptive Weighting for Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05319)
*Zhengda Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Adaptive Knowledge Distillation (AKD) introduces a learnable, dynamically adjusted alpha and a Context-Aware Module (CAM) to reweight teacher outputs, aiming to improve knowledge transfer over fixed-weight KD.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fixed balancing factors in traditional KD are suboptimal as the optimal hard-soft supervision trade-off evolves during training; dynamic, data-driven weighting can improve performance and stability.

Method: 1) Make alpha a learnable parameter optimized during training. 2) Compute alpha dynamically from the gap between student and teacher (student–teacher discrepancies). 3) Introduce a Context-Aware Module (CAM) built from MLP plus attention to adaptively reweight class-wise teacher outputs. 4) Validate on CIFAR-10 using ResNet-50 as teacher and ResNet-18 as student, comparing against fixed-weight KD baselines.

Result: The AKD framework achieves superior accuracy relative to fixed-weight KD baselines and exhibits more stable convergence on the CIFAR-10 task with the specified teacher/student pairing.

Conclusion: Dynamic, adaptive KD via learnable alpha and CAM enhances knowledge transfer and convergence stability, reducing the need for manual hyperparameter tuning and potentially benefiting other distillation setups.

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) is a widely used technique to transfer knowledge
from a large teacher network to a smaller student model. Traditional KD uses a
fixed balancing factor alpha as a hyperparameter to combine the hard-label
cross-entropy loss with the soft-label distillation loss. However, a static
alpha is suboptimal because the optimal trade-off between hard and soft
supervision can vary during training.
  In this work, we propose an Adaptive Knowledge Distillation (AKD) framework.
First we try to make alpha as learnable parameter that can be automatically
learned and optimized during training. Then we introduce a formula to reflect
the gap between the student and the teacher to compute alpha dynamically,
guided by student-teacher discrepancies, and further introduce a Context-Aware
Module (CAM) using MLP + Attention to adaptively reweight class-wise teacher
outputs. Experiments on CIFAR-10 with ResNet-50 as teacher and ResNet-18 as
student demonstrate that our approach achieves superior accuracy compared to
fixed-weight KD baselines, and yields more stable convergence.

that leverages the SEED-VD dataset to generate a multimodal dataset of EEG
signals conditioned on video stimuli. Additionally, we disclose an engineering
pipeline for aligning video and EEG data pairs, facilitating the training of
multimodal large models with EEG alignment capabilities. Personalized EEG
signals are generated using a self-play graph network (SPGN) integrated with a

### [5] [Application of discrete Ricci curvature in pruning randomly wired neural networks: A case study with chest x-ray classification of COVID-19](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05322)
*Pavithra Elumalai,Sudharsan Vijayaraghavan,Madhumita Mondal,Areejit Samal*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FRC-based pruning of RWNNs competes with ORC in accuracy and key metrics while offering substantial speedups, across ER/WS/BA topologies, suggesting FRC as a computationally efficient pruning proxy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Investigate how edge-centric topological measures influence pruning efficiency and learning performance in randomly wired neural networks (RWNNs), and assess whether Forman-Ricci curvature (FRC) can match the pruning effectiveness of Ollivier-Ricci curvature (ORC) with lower computation.

Method: Construct RWNNs using Erdős–Rényi (ER), Watts-Strogatz (WS), and Barabási–Albert (BA) topologies. Train RWNNs on COVID-19 chest X-ray classification. Apply pruning by retaining edges based on three edge-centric measures: Forman-Ricci curvature (FRC), Ollivier-Ricci curvature (ORC), and edge betweenness centrality (EBC). Compare compression ratio, theoretical speedup, and model performance (accuracy, specificity, sensitivity). Analyze modularity and global efficiency of pruned networks to understand trade-offs between modular segregation and network efficiency.

Result: The study provides initial evidence that FRC-based pruning can effectively simplify RWNNs and achieve significant computational advantages with performance comparable to ORC. Across the examined network generators, FRC achieves pruning effectiveness similar to ORC but with lower computational cost. EBC is evaluated for context but not highlighted as superior. The pruned networks show trade-offs between modularity and global efficiency, offering insights into how pruning shapes topology and performance.

Conclusion: Forman-Ricci curvature is a viable and more efficient alternative to ORC for pruning RWNNs, delivering comparable performance with notable computational savings. This supports edge-centric pruning as a scalable approach across ER/WS/BA generated networks while highlighting structural trade-offs in modularity and efficiency.

Abstract: Randomly Wired Neural Networks (RWNNs) serve as a valuable testbed for
investigating the impact of network topology in deep learning by capturing how
different connectivity patterns impact both learning efficiency and model
performance. At the same time, they provide a natural framework for exploring
edge-centric network measures as tools for pruning and optimization. In this
study, we investigate three edge-centric network measures: Forman-Ricci
curvature (FRC), Ollivier-Ricci curvature (ORC), and edge betweenness
centrality (EBC), to compress RWNNs by selectively retaining important synapses
(or edges) while pruning the rest. As a baseline, RWNNs are trained for
COVID-19 chest x-ray image classification, aiming to reduce network complexity
while preserving performance in terms of accuracy, specificity, and
sensitivity. We extend prior work on pruning RWNN using ORC by incorporating
two additional edge-centric measures, FRC and EBC, across three network
generators: Erd\"{o}s-R\'{e}nyi (ER) model, Watts-Strogatz (WS) model, and
Barab\'{a}si-Albert (BA) model. We provide a comparative analysis of the
pruning performance of the three measures in terms of compression ratio and
theoretical speedup. A central focus of our study is to evaluate whether FRC,
which is computationally more efficient than ORC, can achieve comparable
pruning effectiveness. Along with performance evaluation, we further
investigate the structural properties of the pruned networks through modularity
and global efficiency, offering insights into the trade-off between modular
segregation and network efficiency in compressed RWNNs. Our results provide
initial evidence that FRC-based pruning can effectively simplify RWNNs,
offering significant computational advantages while maintaining performance
comparable to ORC.

*Juan Carlos Martinez-Sevilla,Francesco Foscarin,Patricia Garcia-Iasci,David Rizo,Jorge Calvo-Zaragoza,Gerhard Widmer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This work builds a dataset and an OMR model for handwritten jazz lead sheets, addressing chords and handwriting variability, with synthetic data and pretrained models, plus public release of resources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Handwritten jazz lead sheets pose a tough OMR problem due to chord-rich notation and inconsistent handwriting; existing OMR systems largely ignore chords and struggle with quality, so there is a need for ground-truth data and models tailored to this domain.

Method: Create a dataset of 293 handwritten jazz lead sheets (163 unique pieces, 2021 staves) with ground-truth Humdrum kern and MusicXML; generate synthetic score images from the ground truth; develop an OMR model with attention to tokenisation suited for jazz lead sheets; leverage synthetic data and pretrained models; release code, data, and models publicly.

Result: Introduction of a dataset and an OMR model for jazz lead sheets; discussion of tokenisation strategies; demonstration of advantages of using synthetic scores and pretrained models; code/data/models are publicly released.

Conclusion: The dataset and model provide a foundation for OMR of jazz lead sheets, highlighting tokenisation considerations and the value of synthetic data and transfer learning; public release supports reproducibility and further research.

Abstract: In this paper, we address the challenge of Optical Music Recognition (OMR)
for handwritten jazz lead sheets, a widely used musical score type that encodes
melody and chords. The task is challenging due to the presence of chords, a
score component not handled by existing OMR systems, and the high variability
and quality issues associated with handwritten images. Our contribution is
two-fold. We present a novel dataset consisting of 293 handwritten jazz lead
sheets of 163 unique pieces, amounting to 2021 total staves aligned with
Humdrum **kern and MusicXML ground truth scores. We also supply synthetic score
images generated from the ground truth. The second contribution is the
development of an OMR model for jazz lead sheets. We discuss specific
tokenisation choices related to our kind of data, and the advantages of using
synthetic scores and pretrained models. We publicly release all code, data, and
models.

### [7] [RT-VLM: Re-Thinking Vision Language Model with 4-Clues for Real-World Object Recognition Robustness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05333)
*Junghyun Park,Tuan Anh Nguyen,Dugki Min*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RT-VLM presents a robust vision-language framework that uses a synthetic dataset with 4-Clues (bounding boxes, class names, object-level captions, and a scene-level caption) and a two-stage inference with self-critique to improve transfer under domain shifts; fine-tunes a Llama 3.2 11B Vision Instruct with parameter-efficient methods and outperforms baselines on robustness benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world vision systems suffer significant accuracy drops under domain shifts (low-level statistics, pose/viewpoint changes, occlusion, and visual confusions). There is a need for robust, transferable understanding that leverages structured multimodal cues.

Method: Create a synthetic dataset annotated with four clues per image (precise bounding boxes, class names, object-level captions, and a global scene caption). Fine-tune Llama 3.2 11B Vision Instruct using parameter-efficient supervised learning on this dataset. During inference, generate four clues, then re-examine and iteratively correct them via a self-critique loop (two-stage RT-VLM process).

Result: RT-VLM consistently surpasses strong baselines on robustness benchmarks that isolate individual domain shifts, indicating improved reliability and transferability of visual understanding.

Conclusion: Integrating structured multimodal evidence with an explicit self-critique loop is a promising approach to achieving reliable, transferable visual recognition under diverse domain shifts.

Abstract: Real world deployments often expose modern object recognition models to
domain shifts that precipitate a severe drop in accuracy. Such shifts encompass
(i) variations in low level image statistics, (ii) changes in object pose and
viewpoint, (iii) partial occlusion, and (iv) visual confusion across adjacent
classes. To mitigate this degradation, we introduce the Re-Thinking Vision
Language Model (RT-VLM) framework. The foundation of this framework is a unique
synthetic dataset generation pipeline that produces images annotated with
"4-Clues": precise bounding boxes, class names, detailed object-level captions,
and a comprehensive context-level caption for the entire scene. We then perform
parameter efficient supervised tuning of Llama 3.2 11B Vision Instruct on this
resource. At inference time, a two stage Re-Thinking scheme is executed: the
model first emits its own four clues, then re examines these responses as
evidence and iteratively corrects them. Across robustness benchmarks that
isolate individual domain shifts, RT-VLM consistently surpasses strong
baselines. These findings indicate that the integration of structured
multimodal evidence with an explicit self critique loop constitutes a promising
route toward reliable and transferable visual understanding.

### [8] [A Real-Time, Vision-Based System for Badminton Smash Speed Estimation on Mobile Devices](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05334)
*Diwen Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A smartphone-based, cost-effective system that estimates badminton smash speed from standard video using YOLOv5 shuttlecock detection and Kalman-filter tracking, packaged as a mobile app.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Performance analytics in sports are often expensive and inaccessible, leaving amateur and recreational players without objective metrics. Badminton is popular and would benefit from accessible velocity and trajectory feedback to improve skill development.

Method: Develop a computer-vision pipeline: (1) train a YOLOv5 model to detect the shuttlecock in video frames, (2) apply a Kalman filter for robust 2D trajectory tracking, (3) compute velocity via video-based kinematics with spatiotemporal scaling, and (4) deploy the pipeline within an intuitive mobile application.

Result: The paper presents a complete pipeline that automatically outputs shuttlecock velocity from standard video, encapsulated in a user-friendly mobile app; demonstrates feasibility of smartphone-based smash speed estimation.

Conclusion: The work democratizes high-level performance analytics in badminton by providing a cost-effective, accessible tool that can aid players of all levels in analyzing and improving their game.

Abstract: Performance metrics in sports, such as shot speed and angle, provide crucial
feedback for athlete development. However, the technology to capture these
metrics has historically been expensive, complex, and largely inaccessible to
amateur and recreational players. This paper addresses this gap in the context
of badminton, one of the world's most popular sports, by introducing a novel,
cost-effective, and user-friendly system for measuring smash speed using
ubiquitous smartphone technology. Our approach leverages a custom-trained
YOLOv5 model for shuttlecock detection, combined with a Kalman filter for
robust trajectory tracking. By implementing a video-based kinematic speed
estimation method with spatiotemporal scaling, the system automatically
calculates the shuttlecock's velocity from a standard video recording. The
entire process is packaged into an intuitive mobile application, democratizing
access to high-level performance analytics and empowering players at all levels
to analyze and improve their game.

### [9] [A Stroke-Level Large-Scale Database of Chinese Character Handwriting and the OpenHandWrite_Toolbox for Handwriting Research](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05335)
*Zebo Xu,Shaoyun Yu,Mark Torrance,Guido Nottbusch,Nan Zhao,Zhenguang Cai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This work presents a large-scale Chinese handwriting database and an upgraded OpenHandWrite_Toolbox, revealing hierarchical effects of orthographic and phonological factors on handwriting at character, radical, and stroke levels, with strongest effects at the character level.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how linguistic components modulate handwriting across multiple granularity levels and address the lack of comprehensive tools for capturing and batch-processing fine-grained handwriting data.

Method: Data collection with 42 Chinese speakers × 1200 characters in a handwriting-to-dictation task; enhanced OpenHandWrite_Toolbox for stroke-level trajectory capture and batch-processing (latency, duration, pen-pressure); analysis via multiple regression to test orthographic and phonological predictors on handwriting at character, radical, and stroke levels.

Result: Orthographic predictors affect handwriting preparation and execution at all levels (character, radical, stroke); phonological factors influence execution at all three levels; effects show hierarchical attenuation: strongest at character level, weaker at radical, weakest at stroke.

Conclusion: The database and toolbox provide valuable resources for future psycholinguistic and neurolinguistic research on handwriting of characters and sub-characters across languages.

Abstract: Understanding what linguistic components (e.g., phonological, semantic, and
orthographic systems) modulate Chinese handwriting at the character, radical,
and stroke levels remains an important yet understudied topic. Additionally,
there is a lack of comprehensive tools for capturing and batch-processing
fine-grained handwriting data. To address these issues, we constructed a
large-scale handwriting database in which 42 Chinese speakers for each
handwriting 1200 characters in a handwriting-to-dictation task. Additionally,
we enhanced the existing handwriting package and provided comprehensive
documentation for the upgraded OpenHandWrite_Toolbox, which can easily modify
the experimental design, capture the stroke-level handwriting trajectory, and
batch-process handwriting measurements (e.g., latency, duration, and
pen-pressure). In analysing our large-scale database, multiple regression
results show that orthographic predictors impact handwriting preparation and
execution across character, radical, and stroke levels. Phonological factors
also influence execution at all three levels. Importantly, these lexical
effects demonstrate hierarchical attenuation - they were most pronounced at the
character level, followed by the radical, and were weakest at the stroke
levels. These findings demonstrate that handwriting preparation and execution
at the radical and stroke levels are closely intertwined with linguistic
components. This database and toolbox offer valuable resources for future
psycholinguistic and neurolinguistic research on the handwriting of characters
and sub-characters across different languages.

### [10] [Anticipatory Fall Detection in Humans with Hybrid Directed Graph Neural Networks and Long Short-Term Memory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05337)
*Younggeol Cho,Gokhan Solak,Olivia Nocentini,Marta Lorenzini,Andrea Fortuna,Arash Ajoudani*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Hybrid DGNN-LSTM model for anticipatory fall detection that decouples gait-state classification (stable/transient/fall) from motion prediction; uses real-time skeletal features; trained on OUMVLP-Pose and URFD; achieves higher accuracy and earlier detection than DGNN-only and existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Falls are a major risk for older adults and mobility-impaired individuals. Predicting imminent falls and understanding the transient state between stability and fall remains underexplored, hindering proactive assistance by robots.

Method: A hybrid model: Dynamic Graph Neural Networks (DGNN) for gait-state classification (stable, transient, fall) and an LSTM network for forecasting future motion. The two tasks are decoupled. Real-time skeletal features from video are fed into the model. Trained/validated on OUMVLP-Pose and URFD datasets; evaluates prediction error and recognition accuracy.

Result: The approach demonstrates superior performance in prediction error and recognition accuracy compared to DGNN-only models and literature baselines. Decoupling prediction and classification yields performance gains. The method also enables monitoring of the transient state, which could inform and enhance assistive systems.

Conclusion: Decoupling motion prediction from gait-state classification improves anticipatory fall detection. This approach provides actionable insights into the transient state and has potential to improve the functionality of advanced robotic assistance systems.

Abstract: Detecting and preventing falls in humans is a critical component of assistive
robotic systems. While significant progress has been made in detecting falls,
the prediction of falls before they happen, and analysis of the transient state
between stability and an impending fall remain unexplored. In this paper, we
propose a anticipatory fall detection method that utilizes a hybrid model
combining Dynamic Graph Neural Networks (DGNN) with Long Short-Term Memory
(LSTM) networks that decoupled the motion prediction and gait classification
tasks to anticipate falls with high accuracy. Our approach employs real-time
skeletal features extracted from video sequences as input for the proposed
model. The DGNN acts as a classifier, distinguishing between three gait states:
stable, transient, and fall. The LSTM-based network then predicts human
movement in subsequent time steps, enabling early detection of falls. The
proposed model was trained and validated using the OUMVLP-Pose and URFD
datasets, demonstrating superior performance in terms of prediction error and
recognition accuracy compared to models relying solely on DGNN and models from
literature. The results indicate that decoupling prediction and classification
improves performance compared to addressing the unified problem using only the
DGNN. Furthermore, our method allows for the monitoring of the transient state,
offering valuable insights that could enhance the functionality of advanced
assistance systems.

### [11] [Comparative Evaluation of Hard and Soft Clustering for Precise Brain Tumor Segmentation in MR Imaging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05340)
*Dibya Jyoti Bora,Mrinal Kanti Mishra*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Hard clustering (K-Means) is much faster but less accurate for MRI brain-tumor segmentation; soft clustering (FCM) yields higher Dice scores at higher computational cost, illustrating a speed-accuracy trade-off on BraTS2020.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically compare hard vs soft clustering approaches for MRI tumor segmentation and quantify the speed vs. boundary-precision trade-off.

Method: Dataset: BraTS2020; Preprocessing with Gaussian filtering and CLAHE; Methods: K-Means (hard clustering) vs FCM (soft clustering); Evaluation: Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) and runtime per image.

Result: K-Means achieved ~0.3s per image with DSC ~0.43; FCM achieved ~1.3s per image with DSC ~0.67. Demonstrates a clear trade-off between computational efficiency and boundary precision.

Conclusion: There is an inherent trade-off between speed and accuracy in clustering-based MRI tumor segmentation. Soft clustering (FCM) provides better segmentation accuracy at the cost of higher computation; hard clustering (K-Means) is faster but less accurate. Further work could explore hybrid or optimized implementations, or integrating clustering with deep learning to balance speed and precision.

Abstract: Segmentation of brain tumors from Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) remains a
pivotal challenge in medical image analysis due to the heterogeneous nature of
tumor morphology and intensity distributions. Accurate delineation of tumor
boundaries is critical for clinical decision-making, radiotherapy planning, and
longitudinal disease monitoring. In this study, we perform a comprehensive
comparative analysis of two major clustering paradigms applied in MRI tumor
segmentation: hard clustering, exemplified by the K-Means algorithm, and soft
clustering, represented by Fuzzy C-Means (FCM). While K-Means assigns each
pixel strictly to a single cluster, FCM introduces partial memberships, meaning
each pixel can belong to multiple clusters with varying degrees of association.
Experimental validation was performed using the BraTS2020 dataset,
incorporating pre-processing through Gaussian filtering and Contrast Limited
Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE). Evaluation metrics included the Dice
Similarity Coefficient (DSC) and processing time, which collectively
demonstrated that K-Means achieved superior speed with an average runtime of
0.3s per image, whereas FCM attained higher segmentation accuracy with an
average DSC of 0.67 compared to 0.43 for K-Means, albeit at a higher
computational cost (1.3s per image). These results highlight the inherent
trade-off between computational efficiency and boundary precision.

### [12] [Handling imbalance and few-sample size in ML based Onion disease classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05341)
*Abhijeet Manoj Pal,Rajbabu Velmurugan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A robust deep learning model for multi-class classification of onion crop diseases and pests, using attention-based modules on a pre-trained CNN and a comprehensive data augmentation pipeline to address class imbalance. Achieves 96.90% accuracy and 0.96 F1 on a real-world field dataset, outperforming other approaches on the same data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods mainly do binary classification, which limits practical use where identifying the specific disease or pest is essential. Multi-class, real-world field conditions require robust models that handle class imbalance and diverse appearances.

Method: Fine-tunes a pre-trained CNN augmented with attention-based modules and an extensive data augmentation pipeline to mitigate class imbalance, forming a robust multi-class classifier for onion diseases and pests.

Result: The model achieves 96.90% overall accuracy and a 0.96 F1 score on a real-world field image dataset and performs better than competing approaches on the same dataset.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively enables robust multi-class classification of onion crop diseases and pests in real-world settings, offering improved performance over baselines and potential utility for precision agriculture; further validation on additional datasets could strengthen its practical deployment.

Abstract: Accurate classification of pests and diseases plays a vital role in precision
agriculture, enabling efficient identification, targeted interventions, and
preventing their further spread. However, current methods primarily focus on
binary classification, which limits their practical applications, especially in
scenarios where accurately identifying the specific type of disease or pest is
essential. We propose a robust deep learning based model for multi-class
classification of onion crop diseases and pests. We enhance a pre-trained
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model by integrating attention based modules
and employing comprehensive data augmentation pipeline to mitigate class
imbalance. We propose a model which gives 96.90% overall accuracy and 0.96 F1
score on real-world field image dataset. This model gives better results than
other approaches using the same datasets.

### [13] [Delta Velocity Rectified Flow for Text-to-Image Editing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05342)
*Gaspard Beaudouin,Minghan Li,Jaeyeon Kim,Sunghoon Yoon,Mengyu Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Delta Velocity Rectified Flow (DVRF) is an inversion-free, distillation-based editing framework for text-to-image editing using rectified-flow models. It explicitly models discrepancies between source and target velocity fields, includes a time-dependent shift to align latents with the target trajectory, and connects to Delta Denoising Score and FlowEdit under certain conditions. It yields improved editing quality, fidelity, and controllability with no architectural changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To mitigate over-smoothing artifacts in distillation-based sampling within rectified-flow diffusion models for text-to-image editing and to enable inversion-free, efficient, and controllable editing.

Method: DVRF distills a model to account for the discrepancy between source and target velocity fields and introduces a time-dependent shift term that pushes noisy latents toward the target trajectory. The shift yields: (i) when disabled, DVRF reduces to Delta Denoising Score; (ii) with a linear schedule under rectified-flow dynamics, DVRF generalizes FlowEdit. No architectural changes required.

Result: Empirical results show DVRF achieves superior editing quality, fidelity, and controllability while remaining efficient and broadly applicable to text-to-image editing; code released at the project repository.

Conclusion: DVRF provides a principled, inversion-free, velocity-aware editing framework that bridges score-based diffusion optimization and velocity-based rectified-flow optimization, offering improved editing performance without modifying model architectures.

Abstract: We propose Delta Velocity Rectified Flow (DVRF), a novel inversion-free,
path-aware editing framework within rectified flow models for text-to-image
editing. DVRF is a distillation-based method that explicitly models the
discrepancy between the source and target velocity fields in order to mitigate
over-smoothing artifacts rampant in prior distillation sampling approaches. We
further introduce a time-dependent shift term to push noisy latents closer to
the target trajectory, enhancing the alignment with the target distribution. We
theoretically demonstrate that when this shift is disabled, DVRF reduces to
Delta Denoising Score, thereby bridging score-based diffusion optimization and
velocity-based rectified-flow optimization. Moreover, when the shift term
follows a linear schedule under rectified-flow dynamics, DVRF generalizes the
Inversion-free method FlowEdit and provides a principled theoretical
interpretation for it. Experimental results indicate that DVRF achieves
superior editing quality, fidelity, and controllability while requiring no
architectural modifications, making it efficient and broadly applicable to
text-to-image editing tasks. Code is available at

*Zahid Ullah,Minki Hong,Tahir Mahmood,Jihie Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Applying SE and CBAM attention modules to five CNNs across two medical imaging datasets improves accuracy; EfficientNetB5 with hybrid attention performs best; attention aids localization and generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CNNs struggle with fine-grained, region-specific features in medical imaging; attention mechanisms can recalibrate channel/spatial features to focus on salient regions, potentially improving diagnostic performance and interpretability.

Method: Augment five architectures (VGG16, ResNet18, InceptionV3, DenseNet121, EfficientNetB5) with either Squeeze-and-Excitation blocks or hybrid Convolutional Block Attention Module; evaluate on brain tumor MRI dataset (multi-subtypes) and Products of Conception histopathology dataset (4 tissue types); compare against baselines across metrics.

Result: Attention-augmented CNNs outperform baselines on all metrics in both datasets; EfficientNetB5 with hybrid attention achieves the top performance and notable gains; attention also improves feature localization and generalization across modalities.

Conclusion: Provides a systematic comparative framework for embedding attention modules in diverse CNNs; supports development of robust, interpretable, clinically applicable deep learning decision support; practical guidance for attention-based model design in medical imaging.

Abstract: Deep learning has become a powerful tool for medical image analysis; however,
conventional Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) often fail to capture the
fine-grained and complex features critical for accurate diagnosis. To address
this limitation, we systematically integrate attention mechanisms into five
widely adopted CNN architectures, namely, VGG16, ResNet18, InceptionV3,
DenseNet121, and EfficientNetB5, to enhance their ability to focus on salient
regions and improve discriminative performance. Specifically, each baseline
model is augmented with either a Squeeze and Excitation block or a hybrid
Convolutional Block Attention Module, allowing adaptive recalibration of
channel and spatial feature representations. The proposed models are evaluated
on two distinct medical imaging datasets, a brain tumor MRI dataset comprising
multiple tumor subtypes, and a Products of Conception histopathological dataset
containing four tissue categories. Experimental results demonstrate that
attention augmented CNNs consistently outperform baseline architectures across
all metrics. In particular, EfficientNetB5 with hybrid attention achieves the
highest overall performance, delivering substantial gains on both datasets.
Beyond improved classification accuracy, attention mechanisms enhance feature
localization, leading to better generalization across heterogeneous imaging
modalities. This work contributes a systematic comparative framework for
embedding attention modules in diverse CNN architectures and rigorously
assesses their impact across multiple medical imaging tasks. The findings
provide practical insights for the development of robust, interpretable, and
clinically applicable deep learning based decision support systems.

*Cuong Manh Hoang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A self-supervised pipeline for instance segmentation that eliminates manual annotations by combining MultiCut-based coarse masks, a mask filtering step, a superpixel-guided loss with hard and soft components, and an adaptive self-training stage, achieving state-of-the-art results on public datasets for instance segmentation and object detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reduce or eliminate the need for costly human annotations in instance segmentation while maintaining competitive performance by leveraging self-supervised features, superpixels, and adaptive training strategies.

Method: 1) Apply MultiCut to self-supervised features for coarse mask segmentation. 2) Use a mask filter to obtain higher-quality coarse masks. 3) Train a segmentation network with a novel superpixel-guided loss (hard + soft) using high-quality coarse masks and low-level image superpixels. 4) Employ self-training with an adaptive loss to refine predicted masks.

Result: Experimental results on public datasets for instance segmentation and object detection show the proposed framework outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates effective self-supervised instance segmentation by integrating multi-cut coarse segmentation, mask refinement, superpixel-informed supervision, and adaptive self-training, enabling competitive performance without human-annotated masks.

Abstract: Instance segmentation is essential for numerous computer vision applications,
including robotics, human-computer interaction, and autonomous driving.
Currently, popular models bring impressive performance in instance segmentation
by training with a large number of human annotations, which are costly to
collect. For this reason, we present a new framework that efficiently and
effectively segments objects without the need for human annotations. Firstly, a
MultiCut algorithm is applied to self-supervised features for coarse mask
segmentation. Then, a mask filter is employed to obtain high-quality coarse
masks. To train the segmentation network, we compute a novel superpixel-guided
mask loss, comprising hard loss and soft loss, with high-quality coarse masks
and superpixels segmented from low-level image features. Lastly, a
self-training process with a new adaptive loss is proposed to improve the
quality of predicted masks. We conduct experiments on public datasets in
instance segmentation and object detection to demonstrate the effectiveness of
the proposed framework. The results show that the proposed framework
outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods.

*Juan Olalla-Pombo,Alberto Badías,Miguel Ángel Sanz-Gómez,José María Benítez,Francisco Javier Montáns*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Hybrid physics-informed approach that merges Structure Preserving Neural Networks for mechanical cell movements with Artificial Neural Networks to incorporate environment-derived cues, aimed at modeling cell trajectories and mitosis events.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cell biomechanics involve complex, interacting processes influencing collective cell decisions; existing models struggle to integrate pure mechanics with environment-driven factors from experiments.

Method: Combine Structure Preserving Neural Networks (to model mechanical cell movements) with Artificial Neural Networks (to handle environmental factors inferred from Computer Vision data). Roll-out policy predicts full cell trajectories; a neural network-based mitosis event predictor uses the same observed features.

Result: Successful predictions of complete cell trajectories on both simulated and real cell migration data with high accuracy; mitosis event prediction model also demonstrated, leveraging shared features.

Conclusion: The hybrid architecture effectively integrates mechanical structure with environmental cues, enhancing trajectory forecasting and mitosis prediction; promising for understanding cell decision-making and collective dynamics.

Abstract: Cell biomechanics involve a great number of complex phenomena that are
fundamental to the evolution of life itself and other associated processes,
ranging from the very early stages of embryo-genesis to the maintenance of
damaged structures or the growth of tumors. Given the importance of such
phenomena, increasing research has been dedicated to their understanding, but
the many interactions between them and their influence on the decisions of
cells as a collective network or cluster remain unclear. We present a new
approach that combines Structure Preserving Neural Networks, which study cell
movements as a purely mechanical system, with other Machine Learning tools
(Artificial Neural Networks), which allow taking into consideration
environmental factors that can be directly deduced from an experiment with
Computer Vision techniques. This new model, tested on simulated and real cell
migration cases, predicts complete cell trajectories following a roll-out
policy with a high level of accuracy. This work also includes a mitosis event
prediction model based on Neural Networks architectures which makes use of the
same observed features.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A study proposes EMCAD, an efficient multi-scale convolutional attention decoder for brain tumor segmentation on BraTs2020; achieves a best Dice of 0.31 and a stable mean Dice of 0.285±0.015, with consistent validation performance and reduced computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reduce the high computational burden of decoding in brain tumor segmentation, enabling feasible use under limited resources while maintaining accuracy.

Method: Introduce EMCAD, an efficient multi-scale convolutional attention decoder designed to optimize performance and computational efficiency; evaluated on BraTs2020 MRI data from 369 patients.

Result: Best Dice 0.31; mean Dice 0.285±0.015 during training; stable training without overfitting; consistent validation performance.

Conclusion: EMCAD demonstrates a successful balance between efficiency and accuracy, yielding moderate segmentation performance with robust training, though the reported Dice scores are moderate and further improvements could be pursued.

Abstract: Brain tumor segmentation is a critical pre-processing step in the medical
image analysis pipeline that involves precise delineation of tumor regions from
healthy brain tissue in medical imaging data, particularly MRI scans. An
efficient and effective decoding mechanism is crucial in brain tumor
segmentation especially in scenarios with limited computational resources.
However these decoding mechanisms usually come with high computational costs.
To address this concern EMCAD a new efficient multi-scale convolutional
attention decoder designed was utilized to optimize both performance and
computational efficiency for brain tumor segmentation on the BraTs2020 dataset
consisting of MRI scans from 369 brain tumor patients. The preliminary result
obtained by the model achieved a best Dice score of 0.31 and maintained a
stable mean Dice score of 0.285 plus/minus 0.015 throughout the training
process which is moderate. The initial model maintained consistent performance
across the validation set without showing signs of over-fitting.

### [19] [FAVAE-Effective Frequency Aware Latent Tokenizer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05441)
*Tejaswini Medi,Hsien-Yi Wang,Arianna Rampini,Margret Keuper*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A wavelet-based FA-VAE that decouples low- and high-frequency optimization to fix over-smoothed reconstructions in latent tokenizers, improving high-frequency texture fidelity while preserving global structure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Two-stage latent generative pipelines rely on learned tokenizers; training objectives bias toward low-frequency reconstruction, leading to blurred textures and artifacts. A frequency-aware approach is needed to capture high-frequency details and sharp transitions for realistic images.

Method: Introduce a wavelet-based frequency-aware variational autoencoder (FA-VAE) that explicitly decouples optimization of low- and high-frequency components. The model applies wavelet decomposition to separate frequency bands and optimizes them with dedicated losses, enabling independent refinement of textures and global structure.

Result: Experiments show improved reconstruction of fine textures and better preservation of global structure compared to conventional latent-tokenizer baselines, indicating reduced over-smoothing and higher perceptual quality.

Conclusion: Frequency-aware optimization is crucial for realistic image representations in latent-tokenizer-based generation, bridging the fidelity gap and enabling more faithful textures and transitions with broader implications for content creation, neural rendering, and medical imaging.

Abstract: Latent generative models have shown remarkable progress in high-fidelity
image synthesis, typically using a two-stage training process that involves
compressing images into latent embeddings via learned tokenizers in the first
stage. The quality of generation strongly depends on how expressive and
well-optimized these latent embeddings are. While various methods have been
proposed to learn effective latent representations, the reconstructed images
often lack realism, particularly in textured regions with sharp transitions,
due to loss of fine details governed by high frequencies. We conduct a detailed
frequency decomposition of existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) latent tokenizers
and show that conventional objectives inherently prioritize low-frequency
reconstruction, often at the expense of high-frequency fidelity. Our analysis
reveals these latent tokenizers exhibit a bias toward low-frequency
information, when jointly optimized, leading to over-smoothed outputs and
visual artifacts that diminish perceptual quality. To address this, we propose
a wavelet-based, frequency-aware variational autoencoder (FA-VAE) framework
that explicitly decouples the optimization of low- and high-frequency
components. This decoupling enables improved reconstruction of fine textures
while preserving global structure. Our approach bridges the fidelity gap in
current latent tokenizers and emphasizes the importance of frequency-aware
optimization for realistic image representation, with broader implications for
applications in content creation, neural rendering, and medical imaging.

*Iftekhar Haider Chowdhury,Zaed Ikbal Syed,Ahmed Faizul Haque Dhrubo,Mohammad Abdul Qayum*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A single-shot, deterministic filter pruning method that fuses multiple sensitivity metrics to identify and prune filters efficiently, achieving substantial compression with minimal accuracy loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reduce computational and memory overhead of deep CNNs for edge/mobile deployment by addressing instability and redundancy in filter importance across multiple criteria, avoiding iterative or RL-based pruning.

Method: Compute a differential sensitivity score for each filter by fusing gradient-based sensitivity, first-order Taylor expansion, and KL divergence of activation distributions. Apply an exponential scaling to emphasize filters with inconsistent importance across metrics. Perform pruning in a single forward-backward pass (no iterative retraining), resulting in a deterministic pruning process.

Result: Experiments with pruning rates of 50–70% show substantial reductions in FLOPs (over 80% reduction) while preserving accuracy. At 70% pruning, the method retains up to 98.23% of baseline accuracy, outperforming traditional heuristics in compression and generalization.

Conclusion: The approach offers an effective, scalable, and practical single-shot CNN compression method suitable for deployment on resource-constrained devices, enabling efficient edge/mobile inference.

Abstract: Deep Convolutional Neural Networks have achieved state of the art performance
across various computer vision tasks, however their practical deployment is
limited by computational and memory overhead. This paper introduces
Differential Sensitivity Fusion Pruning, a novel single shot filter pruning
framework that focuses on evaluating the stability and redundancy of filter
importance scores across multiple criteria. Differential Sensitivity Fusion
Pruning computes a differential sensitivity score for each filter by fusing the
discrepancies among gradient based sensitivity, first order Taylor expansion,
and KL divergence of activation distributions. An exponential scaling mechanism
is applied to emphasize filters with inconsistent importance across metrics,
identifying candidates that are structurally unstable or less critical to the
model performance. Unlike iterative or reinforcement learning based pruning
strategies, Differential Sensitivity Fusion Pruning is efficient and
deterministic, requiring only a single forward-backward pass for scoring and
pruning. Extensive experiments across varying pruning rates between 50 to 70
percent demonstrate that Differential Sensitivity Fusion Pruning significantly
reduces model complexity, achieving over 80 percent Floating point Operations
Per Seconds reduction while maintaining high accuracy. For instance, at 70
percent pruning, our approach retains up to 98.23 percent of baseline accuracy,
surpassing traditional heuristics in both compression and generalization. The
proposed method presents an effective solution for scalable and adaptive Deep
Convolutional Neural Networks compression, paving the way for efficient
deployment on edge and mobile platforms.

*Andrzej D. Dobrzycki,Ana M. Bernardos,José R. Casar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Layer freezing strategies in YOLOv8/YOLOv10 yield dataset-dependent performance; can cut memory by 28% and sometimes exceed full fine-tuning in mAP@50.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a gap in understanding how different freezing configurations affect contemporary YOLO variants in resource-constrained settings, especially considering data properties and training dynamics.

Method: Systematic evaluation of multiple freezing configurations across YOLOv8 and YOLOv10 variants on four critical-infrastructure datasets, using gradient analysis (L2 norm) and Grad-CAM visual explanations to interpret training dynamics.

Result: No universal optimal freezing strategy; backbone freezing preserves general features; shallower freezing helps with extreme class imbalance; memory reduction up to 28%; in some cases, mAP@50 exceeds full fine-tuning; gradient analysis shows distinct convergence patterns for moderately frozen models.

Conclusion: Provides empirical guidelines for selecting freezing strategies and a practical, evidence-based approach to resource-aware transfer learning for object detection in constrained environments.

Abstract: The You Only Look Once (YOLO) architecture is crucial for real-time object
detection. However, deploying it in resource-constrained environments such as
unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) requires efficient transfer learning. Although
layer freezing is a common technique, the specific impact of various freezing
configurations on contemporary YOLOv8 and YOLOv10 architectures remains
unexplored, particularly with regard to the interplay between freezing depth,
dataset characteristics, and training dynamics. This research addresses this
gap by presenting a detailed analysis of layer-freezing strategies. We
systematically investigate multiple freezing configurations across YOLOv8 and
YOLOv10 variants using four challenging datasets that represent critical
infrastructure monitoring. Our methodology integrates a gradient behavior
analysis (L2 norm) and visual explanations (Grad-CAM) to provide deeper
insights into training dynamics under different freezing strategies. Our
results reveal that there is no universal optimal freezing strategy but,
rather, one that depends on the properties of the data. For example, freezing
the backbone is effective for preserving general-purpose features, while a
shallower freeze is better suited to handling extreme class imbalance. These
configurations reduce graphics processing unit (GPU) memory consumption by up
to 28% compared to full fine-tuning and, in some cases, achieve mean average
precision (mAP@50) scores that surpass those of full fine-tuning. Gradient
analysis corroborates these findings, showing distinct convergence patterns for
moderately frozen models. Ultimately, this work provides empirical findings and
practical guidelines for selecting freezing strategies. It offers a practical,
evidence-based approach to balanced transfer learning for object detection in
scenarios with limited resources.

Motivation: To leverage quaternion algebra for rotation-equivariant perception while avoiding the heavy cost of full quaternion networks, preserving geometric properties and enabling efficient deployment in resource-constrained settings.

Method: Decompose Hamilton product to real-valued operations to approximate quaternion convolution. Introduce Independent Quaternion Batch Normalization (IQBN) for training stability. Extend quaternion operations to spatial attention. Implement with custom CUDA kernels for efficiency.

Result: On CIFAR-10/100, ImageNet, COCO, and DOTA, QUAN achieves higher accuracy with fewer parameters and faster convergence than standard CNNs and prior quaternion models in classification; in object detection it offers improved parameter efficiency and rotation handling and claims SOTA among quaternion CNNs.

Conclusion: QUAN offers a practical, efficient path to rotation-equivariant vision, suitable for robotics and other domains, with potential broader impact, though further ablations and comparisons to group-equivariant baselines would strengthen claims.

Abstract: This paper introduces Quaternion Approximate Networks (QUAN), a novel deep
learning framework that leverages quaternion algebra for rotation equivariant
image classification and object detection. Unlike conventional quaternion
neural networks attempting to operate entirely in the quaternion domain, QUAN
approximates quaternion convolution through Hamilton product decomposition
using real-valued operations. This approach preserves geometric properties
while enabling efficient implementation with custom CUDA kernels. We introduce
Independent Quaternion Batch Normalization (IQBN) for training stability and
extend quaternion operations to spatial attention mechanisms. QUAN is evaluated
on image classification (CIFAR-10/100, ImageNet), object detection (COCO,
DOTA), and robotic perception tasks. In classification tasks, QUAN achieves
higher accuracy with fewer parameters and faster convergence compared to
existing convolution and quaternion-based models. For objection detection, QUAN
demonstrates improved parameter efficiency and rotation handling over standard

### [25] [Visibility-Aware Language Aggregation for Open-Vocabulary Segmentation in 3D Gaussian Splatting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05515)
*Sen Wang,Kunyi Li,Siyun Liang,Elena Alegret,Jing Ma,Nassir Navab,Stefano Gasperini*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VALA introduces Visibility-Aware Language Aggregation for 3D Gaussian radiance fields to distill open-vocabulary features from 2D images, addressing background foreground confusion and multi-view noise with a visibility gate and a streaming cosine-space weighted geometric median, yielding robust, view-consistent language embeddings and improved open-vocabulary localization/segmentation with efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Two limitations hinder open-vocabulary 3D language features: (1) background Gaussians contribute insignificantly to rendered pixels but share the same features as dominant foreground Gaussians, and (2) multi-view language embeddings suffer from view-specific noise causing inconsistencies across views.

Method: VALA computes marginal contributions for each ray and applies a visibility-aware gate to retain only visible Gaussians. Additionally, it proposes a streaming weighted geometric median in cosine space to merge noisy multi-view features, producing a robust, view-consistent language embedding in a fast, memory-efficient manner.

Result: VALA improves open-vocabulary localization and segmentation across reference datasets, consistently surpassing existing methods.

Conclusion: The approach provides a robust and efficient means to obtain view-consistent, open-vocabulary language embeddings for 3D Gaussians, enabling improved performance in 3D open-vocabulary perception tasks.

Abstract: Recently, distilling open-vocabulary language features from 2D images into 3D
Gaussians has attracted significant attention. Although existing methods
achieve impressive language-based interactions of 3D scenes, we observe two
fundamental issues: background Gaussians contributing negligibly to a rendered
pixel get the same feature as the dominant foreground ones, and multi-view
inconsistencies due to view-specific noise in language embeddings. We introduce
Visibility-Aware Language Aggregation (VALA), a lightweight yet effective
method that computes marginal contributions for each ray and applies a
visibility-aware gate to retain only visible Gaussians. Moreover, we propose a
streaming weighted geometric median in cosine space to merge noisy multi-view
features. Our method yields a robust, view-consistent language feature
embedding in a fast and memory-efficient manner. VALA improves open-vocabulary
localization and segmentation across reference datasets, consistently
surpassing existing works.

### [26] [DuoCLR: Dual-Surrogate Contrastive Learning for Skeleton-based Human Action Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05543)
*Haitao Tian,Pierre Payeur*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DuoCLR: a dual-surrogate contrastive framework using Shuffle and Warp to learn multi-scale representations for action segmentation; CPC and ROR surrogate tasks improve intra- and inter-class discrimination; pre-trained on trimmed skeleton sequences and evaluated on untrimmed data; achieves significant gains and ablations confirm components.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Action segmentation requires robust, multi-scale representations and cross-sequence variation handling; existing contrastive learning methods focus on action recognition with isolated sequences, limiting transfer to segmentation; need strategies that exploit multi-action permutations and relative ordering to capture contextual information across sequences.

Method: Introduce Shuffle and Warp augmentation to create multi-action permutations; propose two surrogate tasks: Cross Permutation Contrasting (CPC) to align intra-class representations across permutations, and Relative Order Reasoning (ROR) to predict relative mapping between permutations; train a Dual-Surrogate Contrastive Learning (DuoCLR) network; pre-train on trimmed skeleton sequences and evaluate on untrimmed data; conduct ablations to assess contributions.

Result: DuoCLR yields significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods for both multi-class and multi-label action segmentation on untrimmed data; ablations validate effectiveness of Shuffle and Warp, CPC, and ROR components.

Conclusion: The proposed DuoCLR framework effectively learns robust multi-scale representations for action segmentation via dual surrogate tasks, enabling strong transfer from trimmed to untrimmed data; the approach highlights the value of cross-sequence variations and permutation-based contrastive learning for segmentation.

Abstract: In this paper, a contrastive representation learning framework is proposed to
enhance human action segmentation via pre-training using trimmed (single
action) skeleton sequences. Unlike previous representation learning works that
are tailored for action recognition and that build upon isolated sequence-wise
representations, the proposed framework focuses on exploiting multi-scale
representations in conjunction with cross-sequence variations. More
specifically, it proposes a novel data augmentation strategy, 'Shuffle and
Warp', which exploits diverse multi-action permutations. The latter effectively
assists two surrogate tasks that are introduced in contrastive learning: Cross
Permutation Contrasting (CPC) and Relative Order Reasoning (ROR). In
optimization, CPC learns intra-class similarities by contrasting
representations of the same action class across different permutations, while
ROR reasons about inter-class contexts by predicting relative mapping between
two permutations. Together, these tasks enable a Dual-Surrogate Contrastive
Learning (DuoCLR) network to learn multi-scale feature representations
optimized for action segmentation. In experiments, DuoCLR is pre-trained on a
trimmed skeleton dataset and evaluated on an untrimmed dataset where it
demonstrates a significant boost over state-the-art comparatives in both

are conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of each component of the proposed
approach.

### [27] [RED: Robust Event-Guided Motion Deblurring with Modality-Specific Disentangled Representation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05554)
*Yihong Leng,Siming Zheng,Jinwei Chen,Bo Li,Jiaojiao Li,Peng-Tao Jiang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes Robust Event-guided Deblurring (RED) to handle incomplete event streams via robustness-oriented perturbation and disentangled OmniAttention, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy and robustness on synthetic and real data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Event cameras offer high-temporal-resolution motion information but suffer from incomplete event streams due to DVS thresholding, which degrades motion priors and limits event-guided deblurring. Existing cross-modal approaches overlook this robustness gap.

Method: Introduce Robustness-Oriented Perturbation Strategy (RPS) with random event masking to expose RED to incomplete patterns. Propose a disentangled OmniAttention that models intra-motion, inter-motion, and cross-modality correlations from blurry images and partially disrupted events. Include two interactive modules to enhance motion-sensitive areas and to inject semantic context into incomplete event representations.

Result: Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show RED achieves state-of-the-art performance in both accuracy and robustness under incomplete event conditions.

Conclusion: Redesigns event-guided deblurring with a robustness-focused training paradigm and a versatile cross-modal attention mechanism, yielding superior performance and resilience to incomplete event streams.

Abstract: Event cameras provide sparse yet temporally high-temporal-resolution motion
information, demonstrating great potential for motion deblurring. Existing
methods focus on cross-modal interaction, overlooking the inherent
incompleteness of event streams, which arises from the trade-off between
sensitivity and noise introduced by the thresholding mechanism of Dynamic
Vision Sensors (DVS). Such degradation compromises the integrity of motion
priors and limits the effectiveness of event-guided deblurring. To tackle these
challenges, we propose a Robust Event-guided Deblurring (RED) network with
modality-specific disentangled representation. First, we introduce a
Robustness-Oriented Perturbation Strategy (RPS) that applies random masking to
events, which exposes RED to incomplete patterns and then foster robustness
against various unknown scenario conditions.Next, a disentangled OmniAttention
is presented to explicitly model intra-motion, inter-motion, and cross-modality
correlations from two inherently distinct but complementary sources: blurry
images and partially disrupted events. Building on these reliable features, two
interactive modules are designed to enhance motion-sensitive areas in blurry
images and inject semantic context into incomplete event representations.
Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate RED
consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance in both accuracy and
robustness.

*Zekang Zheng,Haokun Li,Yaofo Chen,Mingkui Tan,Qing Du*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: An efficient post-training quantization (PTQ) framework guided by parameter sensitivity analysis that quantizes high-sensitivity parameters while keeping low-sensitivity ones unquantized to compensate errors; employs column-wise sensitivity clustering and a row-parallel quantization with a globally shared inverse-Hessian update, achieving large speedups with minimal accuracy loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PTQ methods suffer high computational cost due to iterative updates, limiting deployment on resource-constrained edge devices and in real-time applications. There is a need for an efficient PTQ technique that preserves accuracy under high compression.

Method: 1) Perform parameter-sensitivity analysis to rank parameters by sensitivity. 2) Quantize high-sensitivity parameters; retain low-sensitivity parameters in full precision to compensate quantization errors. 3) Use column-wise clustering of sensitivity to enable a row-parallel quantization workflow. 4) Employ a globally shared inverse-Hessian update to reduce computational overhead by an order of magnitude.

Result: The approach yields 20-200x speedup over the Optimal Brain Quantization baseline with mean accuracy loss below 0.3% on ResNet-50 and YOLOv5s across experiments.

Conclusion: The proposed sensitivity-guided PTQ framework effectively balances efficiency and accuracy, enabling practical deployment of PTQ in edge and real-time scenarios with minimal performance degradation.

Abstract: Model quantization reduces neural network parameter precision to achieve
compression, but often compromises accuracy. Existing post-training
quantization (PTQ) methods employ iterative parameter updates to preserve
accuracy under high compression ratios, incurring significant computational
complexity and resource overhead, which limits applicability in
resource-constrained edge computing and real-time inference scenarios. This
paper proposes an efficient PTQ method guided by parameter sensitivity
analysis. The approach prioritizes quantization of high-sensitivity parameters,
leveraging unquantized low-sensitivity parameters to compensate for
quantization errors, thereby mitigating accuracy degradation. Furthermore, by
exploiting column-wise clustering of parameter sensitivity, the method
introduces a row-parallel quantization framework with a globally shared inverse
Hessian matrix update mechanism, reducing computational complexity by an order
of magnitude. Experimental results on ResNet-50 and YOLOv5s demonstrate a
20-200-fold quantization speedup over the Optimal Brain Quantization baseline,
with mean accuracy loss below 0.3%, confirming the method's efficacy in
balancing efficiency and accuracy.

*Zhiling Ye,Cong Zhou,Xiubao Zhang,Haifeng Shen,Weihong Deng,Quan Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A scalable, real-time, one-shot Gaussian head avatar framework: single-image input, two-stage training, separation of reconstruction and reenactment, achieves 90 FPS at 512x512, and outperforms SOTA; scaling improves performance without sacrificing driving efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enable controllable, photorealistic 3D head avatars from a single portrait with high-frequency texture reconstruction and real-time rendering.

Method: Two-stage training of a large-scale one-shot Gaussian head generator built on WebSSL; a reconstruction and reenactment separated framework; ultra-lightweight avatar driven by control signals for high frame-rate rendering.

Result: Achieves 90 FPS at 512x512; demonstrates a scaling law where increasing reconstruction module parameters improves performance; separation design maintains driving efficiency; extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments show state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: The proposed framework delivers superior performance, strong generalization, and efficient real-time rendering, with benefits from scaling and a separation architecture that preserves efficiency.

Abstract: In this paper, we explore a reconstruction and reenactment separated
framework for 3D Gaussians head, which requires only a single portrait image as
input to generate controllable avatar. Specifically, we developed a large-scale
one-shot gaussian head generator built upon WebSSL and employed a two-stage
training approach that significantly enhances the capabilities of
generalization and high-frequency texture reconstruction. During inference, an
ultra-lightweight gaussian avatar driven by control signals enables high
frame-rate rendering, achieving 90 FPS at a resolution of 512x512. We further
demonstrate that the proposed framework follows the scaling law, whereby
increasing the parameter scale of the reconstruction module leads to improved
performance. Moreover, thanks to the separation design, driving efficiency
remains unaffected. Finally, extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments
validate that our approach outperforms current state-of-the-art methods.

*Changtao Miao,Yi Zhang,Man Luo,Weiwei Feng,Kaiyuan Zheng,Qi Chu,Tao Gong,Jianshu Li,Yunfeng Diao,Wei Zhou,Joey Tianyi Zhou,Xiaoshuai Hao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduction of MFFI dataset: a large, multi-dimensional face forgery image dataset to reflect real-world conditions, with 50 forgery methods and ~1.0M images; improves realism and cross-domain generalization; public on GitHub.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deepfake datasets are limited in diversity and realism, lacking coverage of unknown advanced forgery techniques, variability in facial scenes, richness of authentic data, and real-world degradation patterns. This constrains detector generalization to real-world scenarios.

Method: Construct MFFI along four strategic dimensions: 1) Wider Forgery Methods, 2) Varied Facial Scenes, 3) Diversified Authentic Data, 4) Multi-level Degradation Operations. It integrates 50 forgery methods and comprises 1.024 million images. Detailed information and the dataset are publicly available.

Result: Benchmark evaluations show MFFI outperforms existing public datasets in scene complexity, cross-domain generalization capability, and detection difficulty gradients.

Conclusion: MFFI validates technical advances and practical utility for simulating real-world conditions in face-forgery detection and provides a publicly available resource for robust evaluation.

Abstract: Rapid advances in Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC) have
enabled increasingly sophisticated face forgeries, posing a significant threat
to social security. However, current Deepfake detection methods are limited by
constraints in existing datasets, which lack the diversity necessary in
real-world scenarios. Specifically, these data sets fall short in four key
areas: unknown of advanced forgery techniques, variability of facial scenes,
richness of real data, and degradation of real-world propagation. To address
these challenges, we propose the Multi-dimensional Face Forgery Image
(\textbf{MFFI}) dataset, tailored for real-world scenarios. MFFI enhances
realism based on four strategic dimensions: 1) Wider Forgery Methods; 2) Varied
Facial Scenes; 3) Diversified Authentic Data; 4) Multi-level Degradation
Operations. MFFI integrates $50$ different forgery methods and contains $1024K$
image samples. Benchmark evaluations show that MFFI outperforms existing public
datasets in terms of scene complexity, cross-domain generalization capability,
and detection difficulty gradients. These results validate the technical
advance and practical utility of MFFI in simulating real-world conditions. The
dataset and additional details are publicly available at

### [31] [Language-guided Recursive Spatiotemporal Graph Modeling for Video Summarization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05604)
*Jungin Park,Jiyoung Lee,Kwanghoon Sohn*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VideoGraph introduces a recursive spatiotemporal graph network for language-guided video summarization that models objects and frames as graph nodes and uses language queries to inject semantics, achieving state-of-the-art on generic and query-focused tasks in both supervised and unsupervised settings; code released.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations of global temporal modeling and enhance summaries with fine-grained object-level relations and linguistic understanding; current methods may miss semantic links among objects across time; language guidance helps disambiguate relevance.

Method: Construct spatial graphs of objects within frames and a temporal graph of frames; edges encode semantic relationships; incorporate language queries into node representations to bias against visually similar but semantically irrelevant edges; recursively refine graphs and classify frame nodes as keyframes; end-to-end approach.

Result: State-of-the-art on multiple benchmarks for both generic and query-focused video summarization; works in supervised and unsupervised settings; code provided at the authors' repository.

Conclusion: Language-guided spatiotemporal graphs provide a robust framework for video summarization by integrating object-level semantics with temporal context; recursive graph refinement improves keyframe selection; this approach broadens the scope of video understanding.

Abstract: Video summarization aims to select keyframes that are visually diverse and
can represent the whole story of a given video. Previous approaches have
focused on global interlinkability between frames in a video by temporal
modeling. However, fine-grained visual entities, such as objects, are also
highly related to the main content of the video. Moreover, language-guided
video summarization, which has recently been studied, requires a comprehensive
linguistic understanding of complex real-world videos. To consider how all the
objects are semantically related to each other, this paper regards video
summarization as a language-guided spatiotemporal graph modeling problem. We
present recursive spatiotemporal graph networks, called VideoGraph, which
formulate the objects and frames as nodes of the spatial and temporal graphs,
respectively. The nodes in each graph are connected and aggregated with graph
edges, representing the semantic relationships between the nodes. To prevent
the edges from being configured with visual similarity, we incorporate language
queries derived from the video into the graph node representations, enabling
them to contain semantic knowledge. In addition, we adopt a recursive strategy
to refine initial graphs and correctly classify each frame node as a keyframe.
In our experiments, VideoGraph achieves state-of-the-art performance on several
benchmarks for generic and query-focused video summarization in both supervised
and unsupervised manners. The code is available at

*Juan Yeo,Ijun Jang,Taesup Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A self-supervised framework that transfers global semantic knowledge to dense features by aligning teacher and student dense representations via Patch-level Kernel Alignment (PaKA) and tailored dense augmentations, achieving state-of-the-art dense vision performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dense prediction tasks require localized semantics; existing SSL focuses on global representations and may miss fine-grained local details; there is a need to transfer semantic knowledge into dense feature space for improved dense predictions.

Method: Use a teacher-student setup where Patch-level Kernel Alignment (PaKA) aligns the distributions of dense features between the teacher and student across patch-level correspondences; PaKA captures statistical dependencies (kernel-based relationships) among dense patches; also explores augmentation strategies specifically designed for dense representation learning.

Result: Reported state-of-the-art results across a variety of dense vision benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of transferring semantic knowledge into the dense feature space and the utility of PaKA and dense-specific augmentations.

Conclusion: PaKA provides a simple yet effective objective for aligning dense representations between models, enabling improved dense prediction performance by transferring existing semantic knowledge into the dense feature space; the work highlights the importance of dense-specific augmentations in SSL.

Abstract: Dense representations are essential for vision tasks that require spatial
precision and fine-grained detail. While most self-supervised representation
learning methods focus on global representations that summarize the image as a
whole, such approaches often fall short in capturing the localized semantics
necessary for dense prediction tasks. To overcome these limitations, we propose
a framework that builds on pretrained representations through additional
self-supervised learning, aiming to transfer existing semantic knowledge into
the dense feature space. Our method aligns the distributions of dense features
between a teacher and a student model. Specifically, we introduce Patch-level
Kernel Alignment (PaKA), a simple yet effective alignment objective that
captures statistical dependencies, thereby matching the structural
relationships of dense patches across the two models. In addition, we
investigate augmentation strategies specifically designed for dense
representation learning. Our framework achieves state-of-the-art results across
a variety of dense vision benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of our
approach.

### [33] [SpecPrune-VLA: Accelerating Vision-Language-Action Models via Action-Aware Self-Speculative Pruning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05614)
*Hanzhen Wang,Jiaming Xu,Jiayi Pan,Yongkang Zhou,Guohao Dai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SpecPrune-VLA is a training-free, two-level token pruning method for Vision-Language-Action models that uses both global history and local context to prune tokens, yielding around 1.5x speedups with negligible accuracy loss on LIBERO.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current pruning for VLA models relies on local (current action) information only, ignoring global context from past actions. This leads to performance drops (e.g., >20% success rate loss) and limited speedups. Exploiting cross-action similarities can enable smarter token pruning.

Method: Static pruning at the action level: uses global history and local context to reduce visual tokens per action. Dynamic pruning at the layer level: prunes tokens per layer based on layer-specific importance. Lightweight action-aware controller: classifies actions as coarse/fine-grained (by speed) to adjust pruning aggressiveness, since fine-grained actions are pruning-sensitive.

Result: On LIBERO, SpecPrune-VLA achieves 1.46× speedup on NVIDIA A800 and 1.57× on NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 compared with OpenVLA-OFT, with negligible loss in success rate.

Conclusion: SpecPrune-VLA offers a training-free, two-level pruning strategy that leverages both global history and local context to accelerate VLA models while preserving accuracy, achieving practical speedups with minimal performance degradation.

Abstract: Pruning accelerates compute-bound models by reducing computation. Recently
applied to Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, existing methods prune tokens
using only local info from current action, ignoring global context from prior
actions, causing >20% success rate drop and limited speedup. We observe high
similarity across consecutive actions and propose leveraging both local
(current) and global (past) info for smarter token selection. We introduce
SpecPrune-VLA, a training-free method with two-level pruning and heuristic
control: (1) Static pruning at action level: uses global history and local
context to reduce visual tokens per action; (2) Dynamic pruning at layer level:
prunes tokens per layer based on layer-specific importance; (3) Lightweight
action-aware controller: classifies actions as coarse/fine-grained (by speed),
adjusting pruning aggressiveness since fine-grained actions are
pruning-sensitive. Experiments on LIBERO show SpecPrune-VLA achieves 1.46 times
speedup on NVIDIA A800 and 1.57 times on NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 vs.
OpenVLA-OFT, with negligible success rate loss.

### [34] [SuMa: A Subspace Mapping Approach for Robust and Effective Concept Erasure in Text-to-Image Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05625)
*Kien Nguyen,Anh Tran,Cuong Pham*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SuMa (Subspace Mapping) erases narrow concepts in text-to-image diffusion by mapping the target concept subspace to a reference subspace, achieving robust erasure while preserving image quality. It addresses copyright/celebrity-like concepts and outperforms prior methods on both robustness and image fidelity across four tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To mitigate misuse of diffusion models while addressing copyright and legal concerns by erasing narrow concepts (e.g., copyrighted characters, celebrities) without sacrificing image quality or robustness. Existing methods trade off robustness, quality, or struggle with close neighboring concepts.

Method: Define a target concept subspace for the concept to erase and map it to a reference subspace that minimizes their distance, effectively neutralizing the target while preserving non-target content. Evaluate SuMa on four tasks—subclass erasure, celebrity erasure, artistic style erasure, and instance erasure—against state-of-the-art baselines.

Result: SuMa achieves image quality comparable to effectiveness-focused approaches while delivering completeness-competitive robustness; it yields results on par with methods specialized for completeness, across four erasure tasks.

Conclusion: SuMa offers a robust and effective solution for erasing narrow concepts in diffusion models, preserving image quality while achieving strong erasure of close neighboring concepts, demonstrated across diverse tasks.

Abstract: The rapid growth of text-to-image diffusion models has raised concerns about
their potential misuse in generating harmful or unauthorized contents. To
address these issues, several Concept Erasure methods have been proposed.
However, most of them fail to achieve both robustness, i.e., the ability to
robustly remove the target concept., and effectiveness, i.e., maintaining image
quality. While few recent techniques successfully achieve these goals for NSFW
concepts, none could handle narrow concepts such as copyrighted characters or
celebrities. Erasing these narrow concepts is critical in addressing copyright
and legal concerns. However, erasing them is challenging due to their close
distances to non-target neighboring concepts, requiring finer-grained
manipulation. In this paper, we introduce Subspace Mapping (SuMa), a novel
method specifically designed to achieve both robustness and effectiveness in
easing these narrow concepts. SuMa first derives a target subspace representing
the concept to be erased and then neutralizes it by mapping it to a reference
subspace that minimizes the distance between the two. This mapping ensures the
target concept is robustly erased while preserving image quality. We conduct
extensive experiments with SuMa across four tasks: subclass erasure, celebrity
erasure, artistic style erasure, and instance erasure and compare the results
with current state-of-the-art methods. Our method achieves image quality
comparable to approaches focused on effectiveness, while also yielding results
that are on par with methods targeting completeness.

*Moqsadur Rahman,Saurav Kumar,Santosh S. Palmate,M. Shahriar Hossain*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Self-supervised embeddings from aerial hyperspectral imagery yield better tree representations of vegetation properties than direct hyperspectral features in downstream tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hyperspectral data with limited labels pose challenges for learning robust vegetation representations; improving representations can enhance downstream tasks in precision agriculture.

Method: Apply self-supervised learning to extract neural network embeddings from aerial hyperspectral images of crop fields, construct tree representations in the embedding space, and compare these to representations derived directly from hyperspectral vegetation properties in downstream tasks.

Result: The embedding-space-based tree representations outperform direct hyperspectral vegetation properties in downstream machine learning tasks.

Conclusion: Self-supervised embeddings provide more effective tree representations for vegetation properties from aerial hyperspectral imagery than conventional hyperspectral property representations.

Abstract: Aerial remote sensing using multispectral and RGB imagers has provided a
critical impetus to precision agriculture. Analysis of the hyperspectral images
with limited or no labels is challenging. This paper focuses on self-supervised
learning to create neural network embeddings reflecting vegetation properties
of trees from aerial hyperspectral images of crop fields. Experimental results
demonstrate that a constructed tree representation, using a vegetation
property-related embedding space, performs better in downstream machine
learning tasks compared to the direct use of hyperspectral vegetation
properties as tree representations.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Evaluates six YOLO variants on a Bangladesh-specific 29-class vehicle dataset; YOLOv11x highest accuracy but slower; YOLOv8m and YOLOv11m offer balanced performance; rare classes and misclassifications pose challenges; motivates region-adapted detectors for developing regions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional models trained on non-local datasets underperform on Bangladesh roads; need localized detectors to address unique vehicle types and traffic environments.

Method: Assemble a high-res (1920x1080) dataset of Bangladeshi road scenes with 29 vehicle classes, annotated in YOLO format using LabelImg; evaluate six YOLO variants on mAP@0.5 and mAP@0.5:0.95, recall, F1, and inference time; analyze confusion matrices to identify common misclassifications; discuss trade-offs across model sizes.

Result: YOLOv11x achieves 63.7% mAP@0.5, 43.8% mAP@0.5:0.95, 61.4% recall, 61.6% F1 with 45.8 ms per image; YOLOv8m and YOLOv11m achieve ~62.5% and ~61.8% mAP@0.5 with 14-15 ms inference; rare classes like Construction Vehicles and Desi Nosimons have near-zero accuracy due to data imbalance; misclassifications mainly occur between Mini Trucks and Mini Covered Vans.

Conclusion: This work lays groundwork for robust, region-adapted object detection for Bangladesh and similar developing regions, filling gaps where generic models fail.

Abstract: Vehicle detection systems trained on Non-Bangladeshi datasets struggle to
accurately identify local vehicle types in Bangladesh's unique road
environments, creating critical gaps in autonomous driving technology for
developing regions. This study evaluates six YOLO model variants on a custom
dataset featuring 29 distinct vehicle classes, including region-specific
vehicles such as ``Desi Nosimon'', ``Leguna'', ``Battery Rickshaw'', and
``CNG''. The dataset comprises high-resolution images (1920x1080) captured
across various Bangladeshi roads using mobile phone cameras and manually
annotated using LabelImg with YOLO format bounding boxes. Performance
evaluation revealed YOLOv11x as the top performer, achieving 63.7\% mAP@0.5,
43.8\% mAP@0.5:0.95, 61.4\% recall, and 61.6\% F1-score, though requiring 45.8
milliseconds per image for inference. Medium variants (YOLOv8m, YOLOv11m)
struck an optimal balance, delivering robust detection performance with mAP@0.5
values of 62.5\% and 61.8\% respectively, while maintaining moderate inference
times around 14-15 milliseconds. The study identified significant detection
challenges for rare vehicle classes, with Construction Vehicles and Desi
Nosimons showing near-zero accuracy due to dataset imbalances and insufficient
training samples. Confusion matrices revealed frequent misclassifications
between visually similar vehicles, particularly Mini Trucks versus Mini Covered
Vans. This research provides a foundation for developing robust object
detection systems specifically adapted to Bangladesh traffic conditions,
addressing critical needs in autonomous vehicle technology advancement for
developing regions where conventional generic-trained models fail to perform
adequately.

*Guandong Li,Zhaobin Chu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EditIDv2 offers a tuning-free editing approach for high-complexity narratives and long prompts by enhancing ID integration through decomposition of PerceiverAttention, ID loss, and joint diffusion training with an offline fusion strategy, enabling deep multi-level semantic edits while preserving identity, with strong results on IBench using minimal data lubrication.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current character-editing methods perform well on simple prompts but degrade on long, multi-layered narratives, leading to poor editability, semantic bias, and identity drift for complex contexts; there is a need for tuning-free, data-efficient solutions that maintain identity in long-text scenarios.

Method: Analyze ID integration impact in EditID and address its influence in EditIDv2; decompose PerceiverAttention; introduce ID loss; implement joint dynamic training with a diffusion model; employ an offline fusion strategy for the integration module; optimize under minimal data lubrication.

Result: Demonstrates deep, multi-level semantic editing while maintaining identity consistency in complex narrative environments; achieves excellent IBench results; effective with long prompts and high-quality image generation using only a small amount of data lubrication.

Conclusion: EditIDv2 advances tuning-free editing for high-complexity narratives, balancing editability, semantic fidelity, and identity preservation with minimal data and efficient integration of ID features; suitable for long prompts and sophisticated contextual relationships.

Abstract: We propose EditIDv2, a tuning-free solution specifically designed for
high-complexity narrative scenes and long text inputs. Existing character
editing methods perform well under simple prompts, but often suffer from
degraded editing capabilities, semantic understanding biases, and identity
consistency breakdowns when faced with long text narratives containing multiple
semantic layers, temporal logic, and complex contextual relationships. In
EditID, we analyzed the impact of the ID integration module on editability. In
EditIDv2, we further explore and address the influence of the ID feature
integration module. The core of EditIDv2 is to discuss the issue of editability
injection under minimal data lubrication. Through a sophisticated decomposition
of PerceiverAttention, the introduction of ID loss and joint dynamic training
with the diffusion model, as well as an offline fusion strategy for the
integration module, we achieve deep, multi-level semantic editing while
maintaining identity consistency in complex narrative environments using only a
small amount of data lubrication. This meets the demands of long prompts and
high-quality image generation, and achieves excellent results in the IBench
evaluation.

### [38] [OOTSM: A Decoupled Linguistic Framework for Effective Scene Graph Anticipation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05661)
*Xiaomeng Zhu,Changwei Wang,Haozhe Wang,Xinyu Liu,Fangzhen Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A two-step, linguistics-driven scene graph anticipation method (LSGA with OOTSM) uses LLMs to forecast object dynamics and relations for future scene graphs, achieving notable gains and state-of-the-art performance in SGA.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SGA methods rely heavily on visual cues and often lack access to valuable commonsense knowledge, limiting long-term prediction robustness; integrating commonsense through a text-based model can improve forecasting of future scene graphs.

Method: Decouple SGA into two steps: (1) a scene graph capturing model converts video clips into a sequence of scene graphs; (2) a pure text-based model predicts future graphs. For LSGA, introduce Object-Oriented Two-Staged Method (OOTSM) where an LLM first forecasts object appearances/disappearances, then generates detailed human-object relations. Evaluation compares fine-tuned open LLMs vs zero-shot APIs on a benchmark from Action Genome; for SGA, OOTSM is combined with STTran++.

Result: Empirical gains: short-term mean-Recall @10 improves by 3.4%; long-term mean-Recall @50 improves by 21.9%; claims state-of-the-art performance. Experiments span LLMs vs APIs on Action Genome; code released at GitHub.

Conclusion: Incorporating commonsense knowledge through linguistic forecasting improves SGA, with OOTSM providing effective object dynamics and relation generation. The approach yields robust short- and long-term predictions and is applicable beyond SGA, with released code for reproducibility.

Abstract: A scene graph is a structured represention of objects and their relationships
in a scene. Scene Graph Anticipation (SGA) involves predicting future scene
graphs from video clips, enabling applications as intelligent surveillance and
human-machine collaboration. Existing SGA approaches primarily leverage visual
cues, often struggling to integrate valuable commonsense knowledge, thereby
limiting long-term prediction robustness. To explicitly leverage such
commonsense knowledge, we propose a new approach to better understand the
objects, concepts, and relationships in a scene graph. Our approach decouples
the SGA task in two steps: first a scene graph capturing model is used to
convert a video clip into a sequence of scene graphs, then a pure text-based
model is used to predict scene graphs in future frames. Our focus in this work
is on the second step, and we call it Linguistic Scene Graph Anticipation
(LSGA) and believes it should have independent interest beyond the use in SGA
discussed here. For LSGA, we introduce an Object-Oriented Two-Staged Method
(OOTSM) where an Large Language Model (LLM) first forecasts object appearances
and disappearances before generating detailed human-object relations. We
conduct extensive experiments to evaluate OOTSM in two settings. For LSGA, we
evaluate our fine-tuned open-sourced LLMs against zero-shot APIs (i.e., GPT-4o,
GPT-4o-mini, and DeepSeek-V3) on a benchmark constructed from Action Genome
annotations. For SGA, we combine our OOTSM with STTran++ from, and our
experiments demonstrate effective state-of-the-art performance: short-term
mean-Recall (@10) increases by 3.4% while long-term mean-Recall (@50) improves
dramatically by 21.9%. Code is available at https://github.com/ZhuXMMM/OOTSM.

*Wasikul Islam*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Physics-inspired priors from pileup mitigation are translated into neural denoising architectures; a UNet-based WIPUNet with conservation constraints and Gaussian-noise variants shows robustness gains, especially at high noise, on CIFAR-10 and BSD500.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve robustness of image denoising under strong corruption by borrowing physics-inspired priors (conservation, locality, isolation) from collider pileup mitigation.

Method: Introduce a hierarchy of PU-inspired denoisers: a residual CNN with conservation constraints, its Gaussian-noise variants, and the WIPUNet that integrates these ideas into a UNet backbone. Evaluate on CIFAR-10 with Gaussian noise (σ in {15,25,50,75,100}) and BSD500 to assess robustness rather than achieve SOTA.

Result: PU-inspired CNNs are competitive with standard baselines; WIPUNet shows a widening performance margin at higher noise levels; BSD500 experiments show the same trend, suggesting improved stability under heavy corruption.

Conclusion: Physics-inspired priors can be effectively translated into modular inductive biases for image denoising, with WIPUNet offering robustness gains at high noise without relying on state-of-the-art machinery; the work is a proof of concept.

Abstract: In high-energy particle physics, collider measurements are contaminated by
"pileup", overlapping soft interactions that obscure the hard-scatter signal of
interest. Dedicated subtraction strategies exploit physical priors such as
conservation, locality, and isolation. Inspired by this analogy, we investigate
how such principles can inform image denoising by embedding physics-guided
inductive biases into neural architectures. This paper is a proof of concept:
rather than targeting state-of-the-art (SOTA) benchmarks, we ask whether
physics-inspired priors improve robustness under strong corruption.
  We introduce a hierarchy of PU-inspired denoisers: a residual CNN with
conservation constraints, its Gaussian-noise variants, and the Weighted
Inductive Pileup-physics-inspired U-Network for Denoising (WIPUNet), which
integrates these ideas into a UNet backbone. On CIFAR-10 with Gaussian noise at
$\sigma\in\{15,25,50,75,100\}$, PU-inspired CNNs are competitive with standard
baselines, while WIPUNet shows a \emph{widening margin} at higher noise.
Complementary BSD500 experiments show the same trend, suggesting
physics-inspired priors provide stability where purely data-driven models
degrade. Our contributions are: (i) translating pileup-mitigation principles
into modular inductive biases; (ii) integrating them into UNet; and (iii)
demonstrating robustness gains at high noise without relying on heavy SOTA
machinery.

### [40] [Context-Aware Multi-Turn Visual-Textual Reasoning in LVLMs via Dynamic Memory and Adaptive Visual Guidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05669)
*Weijie Shen,Xinrui Wang,Yuanqi Nie,Apiradee Boonmee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CAMVR introduces a memory-augmented framework for robust multi-turn LVLM reasoning, combining a Visual-Textual Context Memory Unit (VCMU) with Adaptive Visual Focus Guidance (AVFG) to maintain context and focus attention on relevant regions; shows state-of-the-art on VisDial, adapted A-OKVQA, and a new MTIF dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs/LVLMs excel at single-turn tasks but struggle with multi-turn visual reasoning due to context loss, fragmentation, and hallucinations. A memory-based, context-aware approach is proposed to maintain cross-turn context and guide visual attention.

Method: Two main components: (1) Visual-Textual Context Memory Unit (VCMU): a dynamic read-write memory that stores critical visual features, textual semantic representations, and cross-modal correspondences from each turn; (2) Adaptive Visual Focus Guidance (AVFG): uses VCMU context to adjust the visual encoder's attention to image regions relevant to the ongoing context. The framework integrates multi-level reasoning to align responses with historical and current inputs. Evaluated on VisDial, adapted A-OKVQA, and MTIF dataset.

Result: Reported state-of-the-art performance on multiple challenging datasets (VisDial, adapted A-OKVQA, MTIF), indicating improved coherence, reduced fragmentation, and better handling of multi-turn inference and visual reasoning compared to baselines.

Conclusion: CAMVR presents a viable path to robust multi-turn visual-textual reasoning in LVLMs through memory-based context management and adaptive attention, with demonstrated empirical gains on diverse datasets; future work may explore efficiency, generalization, and broader evaluation.

Abstract: Current Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Large Models (LVLMs)
excel in single-turn tasks but face significant challenges in multi-turn
interactions requiring deep contextual understanding and complex visual
reasoning, often leading to fragmented reasoning, context loss, and
hallucinations. To address these limitations, we propose Context-Aware
Multi-Turn Visual Reasoning (CAMVR), a novel framework designed to empower
LVLMs with robust and coherent multi-turn visual-textual inference
capabilities. CAMVR introduces two key innovations: a Visual-Textual Context
Memory Unit (VCMU), a dynamic read-write memory network that stores and manages
critical visual features, textual semantic representations, and their
cross-modal correspondences from each interaction turn; and an Adaptive Visual
Focus Guidance (AVFG) mechanism, which leverages the VCMU's context to
dynamically adjust the visual encoder's attention to contextually relevant
image regions. Our multi-level reasoning integration strategy ensures that
response generation is deeply coherent with both current inputs and accumulated
historical context. Extensive experiments on challenging datasets, including
VisDial, an adapted A-OKVQA, and our novel Multi-Turn Instruction Following
(MTIF) dataset, demonstrate that CAMVR consistently achieves state-of-the-art
performance.

*Gašper Podobnik,Tomaž Vrtovec*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MeshMetrics offers a mesh-based solution for distance-based segmentation metrics, delivering more accurate, discretization-robust results than grid-based tools, released as open-source.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reproducibility crisis in image segmentation metrics due to unreliable metric implementations and discretization artifacts; large discrepancies across tools in distance-based metrics.

Method: Introduce MeshMetrics, a mesh-based framework with theoretical analysis and empirical validation; compares to grid-based approaches; reduces distance quantization and improves accuracy/precision; open-source Python package.

Result: Achieves higher accuracy and precision than established tools; far less affected by discretization artifacts; provides more reliable metric computations.

Conclusion: MeshMetrics enhances reproducibility and reliability of segmentation evaluation; open-source release at GitHub.

Abstract: The surge of research in image segmentation has yielded remarkable
performance gains but also exposed a reproducibility crisis. A major
contributor is performance evaluation, where both selection and implementation
of metrics play critical roles. While recent efforts have improved the former,
the reliability of metric implementation has received far less attention.
Pitfalls in distance-based metric implementation can lead to considerable
discrepancies between common open-source tools, for instance, exceeding 100 mm
for the Hausdorff distance and 30%pt for the normalized surface distance for
the same pair of segmentations. To address these pitfalls, we introduce
MeshMetrics, a mesh-based framework that provides a more precise computation of
distance-based metrics than conventional grid-based approaches. Through
theoretical analysis and empirical validation, we demonstrate that MeshMetrics
achieves higher accuracy and precision than established tools, and is
substantially less affected by discretization artifacts, such as distance
quantization. We release MeshMetrics as an open-source Python package,
available at https://github.com/gasperpodobnik/MeshMetrics.

### [42] [Leveraging Vision-Language Large Models for Interpretable Video Action Recognition with Semantic Tokenization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05695)
*Jingwei Peng,Zhixuan Qiu,Boyu Jin,Surasakdi Siripong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LVLM-VAR applies Vision-Language Large Models to video action recognition by converting video into semantic action tokens and using a LoRA-fine-tuned LVLM for classification and explanation, achieving strong accuracy and improved interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional video action recognition struggles with deep semantic understanding, complex context, and fine-grained distinctions. LVLMs offer rich multimodal reasoning and interpretability, motivating their application to video understanding.

Method: Introduce a Video-to-Semantic-Tokens (VST) module that converts raw video into discrete semantic action tokens forming an "action narrative". These tokens plus natural language instructions are processed by a LoRA-fine-tuned LVLM (e.g., LLaVA-13B) for robust action classification and semantic reasoning.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art or competitive performance on NTU RGB+D and NTU RGB+D 120, including 94.1% on NTU RGB+D X-Sub and 90.0% on NTU RGB+D 120 X-Set, with substantially enhanced interpretability via natural language explanations.

Conclusion: Demonstrates that LVLM-based video understanding is viable for accurate and interpretable action recognition, with the VST-LVLM framework delivering strong benchmark results and explanatory capability.

Abstract: Human action recognition often struggles with deep semantic understanding,
complex contextual information, and fine-grained distinction, limitations that
traditional methods frequently encounter when dealing with diverse video data.
Inspired by the remarkable capabilities of large language models, this paper
introduces LVLM-VAR, a novel framework that pioneers the application of
pre-trained Vision-Language Large Models (LVLMs) to video action recognition,
emphasizing enhanced accuracy and interpretability. Our method features a
Video-to-Semantic-Tokens (VST) Module, which innovatively transforms raw video
sequences into discrete, semantically and temporally consistent "semantic
action tokens," effectively crafting an "action narrative" that is
comprehensible to an LVLM. These tokens, combined with natural language
instructions, are then processed by a LoRA-fine-tuned LVLM (e.g., LLaVA-13B)
for robust action classification and semantic reasoning. LVLM-VAR not only
achieves state-of-the-art or highly competitive performance on challenging
benchmarks such as NTU RGB+D and NTU RGB+D 120, demonstrating significant
improvements (e.g., 94.1% on NTU RGB+D X-Sub and 90.0% on NTU RGB+D 120 X-Set),
but also substantially boosts model interpretability by generating natural
language explanations for its predictions.

*Hongyu Zhou,Yunzhou Zhang,Tingsong Huang,Fawei Ge,Man Qi,Xichen Zhang,Yizhong Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A dual-branch RGB–Normal cross-view geo-localization method (JRN-Geo) that fuses semantic and structural cues with 3D viewpoint augmentation to improve UAV localization, achieving state-of-the-art results on University-1652 and SUES-200.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Significant viewpoint and appearance gaps between aerial and ground-level images limit semantic-only methods; incorporating geometric structure can yield view-invariant representations.

Method: Propose Joint perception network (JRN-Geo) with two branches for RGB and normal images; Difference-Aware Fusion Module (DAFM) and Joint-Constrained Interaction Aggregation (JCIA) for deep fusion of semantic and structural cues; 3D geographic augmentation to simulate viewpoint variations.

Result: Extensive experiments show robustness against complex viewpoint variations and achieve state-of-the-art performance on University-1652 and SUES-200 datasets.

Conclusion: Integrating geometric structure with appearance cues and viewpoint augmentation enhances cross-view localization; the proposed fusion and interaction strategy effectively learns viewpoint-invariant features.

Abstract: Cross-view geo-localization plays a critical role in Unmanned Aerial Vehicle
(UAV) localization and navigation. However, significant challenges arise from
the drastic viewpoint differences and appearance variations between images.
Existing methods predominantly rely on semantic features from RGB images, often
neglecting the importance of spatial structural information in capturing
viewpoint-invariant features. To address this issue, we incorporate geometric
structural information from normal images and introduce a Joint perception
network to integrate RGB and Normal images (JRN-Geo). Our approach utilizes a
dual-branch feature extraction framework, leveraging a Difference-Aware Fusion
Module (DAFM) and Joint-Constrained Interaction Aggregation (JCIA) strategy to
enable deep fusion and joint-constrained semantic and structural information
representation. Furthermore, we propose a 3D geographic augmentation technique
to generate potential viewpoint variation samples, enhancing the network's
ability to learn viewpoint-invariant features. Extensive experiments on the
University-1652 and SUES-200 datasets validate the robustness of our method
against complex viewpoint ariations, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

TL;DR: Explores using Vision-Language Models to interpret marine mammal spectrograms, validated by LLM-based reasoning, to derive domain knowledge without labeled data or retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Marine bioacoustics rely on interpreting spectrograms, yet vision-language models are not trained on these domain-specific visualizations; there is a need for data-efficient methods to extract meaningful patterns from spectrograms without manual annotation.

Method: Proposes a framework that combines VLM-based interpretation of spectrogram visuals with LLM-driven validation to translate visual cues into domain knowledge, enabling adaptation to acoustic data without manual labeling or model retraining.

Result: Demonstrates feasibility of adapting acoustic data processing and knowledge extraction without the need for annotated data or retraining.

Conclusion: Integrating VLM interpretation with LLM validation provides a scalable approach to derive domain knowledge from spectrograms, potentially extending to other domain-specific visualizations.

Abstract: Marine mammal vocalization analysis depends on interpreting bioacoustic
spectrograms. Vision Language Models (VLMs) are not trained on these
domain-specific visualizations. We investigate whether VLMs can extract
meaningful patterns from spectrograms visually. Our framework integrates VLM
interpretation with LLM-based validation to build domain knowledge. This
enables adaptation to acoustic data without manual annotation or model
retraining.

*Niels Balemans,Ali Anwar,Jan Steckel,Siegfried Mercelis*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Temporal LiDAR-BIND-T extends LiDAR-BIND by adding temporal consistency components (temporal embedding similarity, motion-aligned transformation loss, and windowed temporal fusion) to multi-modal radar/sonar-to-LiDAR fusion, improving SLAM performance and coherence with new FVMD-based metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance temporal coherence and spatial stability in cross-sensor LiDAR fusion, enabling more robust downstream SLAM under dynamic sensor inputs and motion.

Method: Three contributions: (i) temporal embedding similarity aligning consecutive latent representations; (ii) motion-aligned transformation loss matching predicted LiDAR displacement to ground-truth; (iii) windowed temporal fusion via a specialized temporal module; architecture updated to better preserve spatial structure; plug-and-play modality fusion.

Result: Improved temporal and spatial coherence in radar/sonar-to-LiDAR translation, yielding lower absolute trajectory error and better occupancy map accuracy in Cartographer-based SLAM; new FVMD and correlation-peak distance metrics proposed for temporal quality assessment of SLAM performance.

Conclusion: LiDAR-BIND-T maintains plug-and-play fusion while substantially enhancing temporal stability, improving robustness and downstream SLAM performance.

Abstract: This paper extends LiDAR-BIND, a modular multi-modal fusion framework that
binds heterogeneous sensors (radar, sonar) to a LiDAR-defined latent space,
with mechanisms that explicitly enforce temporal consistency. We introduce
three contributions: (i) temporal embedding similarity that aligns consecutive
latents, (ii) a motion-aligned transformation loss that matches displacement
between predictions and ground truth LiDAR, and (iii) windows temporal fusion
using a specialised temporal module. We further update the model architecture
to better preserve spatial structure. Evaluations on radar/sonar-to-LiDAR
translation demonstrate improved temporal and spatial coherence, yielding lower
absolute trajectory error and better occupancy map accuracy in
Cartographer-based SLAM (Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping). We propose
different metrics based on the Fr\'echet Video Motion Distance (FVMD) and a
correlation-peak distance metric providing practical temporal quality
indicators to evaluate SLAM performance. The proposed temporal LiDAR-BIND, or
LiDAR-BIND-T, maintains plug-and-play modality fusion while substantially
enhancing temporal stability, resulting in improved robustness and performance
for downstream SLAM.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduces Multi-LVI-SAM with a panoramic multi-camera visual feature model, extrinsic compensation, and factor-graph fusion to achieve higher accuracy and robustness in LiDAR-visual-inertial odometry.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multi-camera LiDAR-visual-inertial systems suffer from redundant handling of individual cameras, triangulation inconsistencies due to misalignment between per-camera frames and a panoramic representation, and limited loop closure/global optimization capabilities. A unified panoramic model can improve constraint quality and simplify system design.

Method: 1) Panoramic visual feature model that unifies observations from multiple fisheye cameras into a single representation for global optimization. 2) Extrinsic compensation to mitigate misalignment between each camera's frame and the panoramic model frame, improving feature consistency and reducing triangulation/optimization errors. 3) Tightly coupled LiDAR-visual-inertial system integrated via a factor graph to enable seamless loop closure and global pose optimization.

Result: Extensive experiments on public datasets show that the panoramic visual feature model improves the quality and consistency of multi-camera constraints, yielding higher accuracy and robustness than existing multi-camera LiDAR-visual-inertial systems.

Conclusion: The panoramic visual feature model enables unified, robust multi-camera constraints and global optimization within a LiDAR-visual-inertial framework, reducing triangulation errors and improving overall pose estimation performance.

Abstract: We propose a multi-camera LiDAR-visual-inertial odometry framework,
Multi-LVI-SAM, which fuses data from multiple fisheye cameras, LiDAR and
inertial sensors for highly accurate and robust state estimation. To enable
efficient and consistent integration of visual information from multiple
fisheye cameras, we introduce a panoramic visual feature model that unifies
multi-camera observations into a single representation. The panoramic model
serves as a global geometric optimization framework that consolidates
multi-view constraints, enabling seamless loop closure and global pose
optimization, while simplifying system design by avoiding redundant handling of
individual cameras. To address the triangulation inconsistency caused by the
misalignment between each camera's frame and the panoramic model's frame, we
propose an extrinsic compensation method. This method improves feature
consistency across views and significantly reduces triangulation and
optimization errors, leading to more accurate pose estimation. We integrate the
panoramic visual feature model into a tightly coupled LiDAR-visual-inertial
system based on a factor graph. Extensive experiments on public datasets
demonstrate that the panoramic visual feature model enhances the quality and
consistency of multi-camera constraints, resulting in higher accuracy and
robustness than existing multi-camera LiDAR-visual-inertial systems.

### [47] [Depth-Aware Super-Resolution via Distance-Adaptive Variational Formulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05746)
*Tianhao Guo,Bingjie Lu,Feng Wang,Zhengyang Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Distance-adaptive SR framed as a depth-variant inverse problem using a variational framework; degradation is modeled as a distance-dependent pseudodifferential operator; a depth-conditioned, convergence-guaranteed network learns adaptive regularization and filters, with spectral constraints to control noise, achieving state-of-the-art on KITTI depth-variant scenes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world imaging shows distance/distance-dependent degradations (atmospheric scattering, depth of field, perspective) that violate spatially invariant assumptions; a geometry-aware, depth-aware SR approach is needed to approach optimal reconstruction limits.

Method: Formulates SR as a variational energy with a pseudodifferential degradation operator whose spectral characteristics depend on depth. Implements a neural architecture that unrolls gradient flow through cascaded residual blocks with depth-conditioned convolution kernels. Introduces distance-adaptive regularization, adaptive kernel generation networks mapping depth to filters, and spectral constraints from atmospheric scattering theory to prevent bandwidth/noise issues. Guarantees convergence to stationary points of the energy functional.

Result: Comprehensive evaluation on five benchmarks shows state-of-the-art performance: PSNR/SSIM of 36.89/0.9516 and 30.54/0.8721 at scales 2 and 4 on KITTI outdoor scenes, outperforming baselines by 0.44 dB and 0.36 dB, respectively.

Conclusion: First theoretically-grounded, distance-adaptive SR framework; strong improvements on depth-variant data while maintaining competitive performance on traditional SR benchmarks.

Abstract: Single image super-resolution traditionally assumes spatially-invariant
degradation models, yet real-world imaging systems exhibit complex
distance-dependent effects including atmospheric scattering, depth-of-field
variations, and perspective distortions. This fundamental limitation
necessitates spatially-adaptive reconstruction strategies that explicitly
incorporate geometric scene understanding for optimal performance. We propose a
rigorous variational framework that characterizes super-resolution as a
spatially-varying inverse problem, formulating the degradation operator as a
pseudodifferential operator with distance-dependent spectral characteristics
that enable theoretical analysis of reconstruction limits across depth ranges.
Our neural architecture implements discrete gradient flow dynamics through
cascaded residual blocks with depth-conditional convolution kernels, ensuring
convergence to stationary points of the theoretical energy functional while
incorporating learned distance-adaptive regularization terms that dynamically
adjust smoothness constraints based on local geometric structure. Spectral
constraints derived from atmospheric scattering theory prevent bandwidth
violations and noise amplification in far-field regions, while adaptive kernel
generation networks learn continuous mappings from depth to reconstruction
filters. Comprehensive evaluation across five benchmark datasets demonstrates
state-of-the-art performance, achieving 36.89/0.9516 and 30.54/0.8721 PSNR/SSIM
at 2 and 4 scales on KITTI outdoor scenes, outperforming existing methods by
0.44dB and 0.36dB respectively. This work establishes the first
theoretically-grounded distance-adaptive super-resolution framework and
demonstrates significant improvements on depth-variant scenarios while
maintaining competitive performance across traditional benchmarks.

*Leo Ho,Yinghao Huang,Dafei Qin,Mingyi Shi,Wangpok Tse,Wei Liu,Junichi Yamagishi,Taku Komura*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: New InterAct dataset (241 sequences) and a diffusion-based model for dynamic, two-person interactions using audio, motion, and facial data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous works largely model single actors or static/short interactions; there is a need for dynamic, long-duration, semantically consistent two-person interactions that span larger spaces and capture evolution of body orientation and expressions.

Method: Introduce InterAct, a multi-modal dataset of 241 long-duration interaction sequences with two actors (roles and emotion labels) and synchronized audio, body motions, and facial expressions. Propose a diffusion-based method that estimates interactive face expressions and body motions from speech inputs, with hierarchical body-motion regression and a novel lip-accuracy fine-tuning mechanism.

Result: Demonstrates the InterAct dataset with diverse, long-term interaction patterns and shows the diffusion-based method can estimate interactive expressions and motions from speech; includes a lip-accuracy improvement mechanism and provides data and code at the project URL.

Conclusion: The InterAct dataset offers a valuable resource for studying dynamic, multi-person interactions, and the proposed diffusion-based approach provides a viable modeling framework, with open data and code to spur further research.

Abstract: We address the problem of accurate capture of interactive behaviors between
two people in daily scenarios. Most previous works either only consider one
person or solely focus on conversational gestures of two people, assuming the
body orientation and/or position of each actor are constant or barely change
over each interaction. In contrast, we propose to simultaneously model two
people's activities, and target objective-driven, dynamic, and semantically
consistent interactions which often span longer duration and cover bigger
space. To this end, we capture a new multi-modal dataset dubbed InterAct, which
is composed of 241 motion sequences where two people perform a realistic and
coherent scenario for one minute or longer over a complete interaction. For
each sequence, two actors are assigned different roles and emotion labels, and
collaborate to finish one task or conduct a common interaction activity. The
audios, body motions, and facial expressions of both persons are captured.
InterAct contains diverse and complex motions of individuals and interesting
and relatively long-term interaction patterns barely seen before. We also
demonstrate a simple yet effective diffusion-based method that estimates
interactive face expressions and body motions of two people from speech inputs.
Our method regresses the body motions in a hierarchical manner, and we also
propose a novel fine-tuning mechanism to improve the lip accuracy of facial
expressions. To facilitate further research, the data and code is made
available at https://hku-cg.github.io/interact/ .

*Bingrui Zhao,Lin Yuanbo Wu,Xiangtian Fan,Deyin Liu,Lu Zhang,Ruyi He,Jialie Shen,Ximing Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PARSE-VOS is a training-free framework that uses LLMs for hierarchical text-to-video reasoning in Referring Video Object Segmentation, employing coarse-to-fine disambiguation to achieve state-of-the-art results without training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current visual-language fusion methods struggle with complex, compositional language and objects with similar appearances, especially in dynamic video settings. There is a need for explicit, structured linguistic grounding and staged reasoning to align language with motion and pose.

Method: A three-stage pipeline: (1) parse the natural language query into structured semantic commands; (2) a spatio-temporal grounding module generates candidate trajectories for all potential target objects guided by the parsed semantics; (3) a hierarchical identification module performs coarse-grained motion reasoning with an LLM to narrow candidates, triggering a fine-grained pose verification stage if ambiguity remains, ultimately producing a segmentation mask.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on Ref-YouTube-VOS, Ref-DAVIS17, and MeViS, in a training-free setup.

Conclusion: PARSE-VOS demonstrates that hierarchical, LLM-guided reasoning with explicit semantic parsing enables robust RVOS without training, effectively handling complex queries and ambiguous objects.

Abstract: Referring Video Object Segmentation (RVOS) aims to segment an object of
interest throughout a video based on a language description. The prominent
challenge lies in aligning static text with dynamic visual content,
particularly when objects exhibiting similar appearances with inconsistent
motion and poses. However, current methods often rely on a holistic
visual-language fusion that struggles with complex, compositional descriptions.
In this paper, we propose \textbf{PARSE-VOS}, a novel, training-free framework
powered by Large Language Models (LLMs), for a hierarchical, coarse-to-fine
reasoning across text and video domains. Our approach begins by parsing the
natural language query into structured semantic commands. Next, we introduce a
spatio-temporal grounding module that generates all candidate trajectories for
all potential target objects, guided by the parsed semantics. Finally, a
hierarchical identification module select the correct target through a
two-stage reasoning process: it first performs coarse-grained motion reasoning
with an LLM to narrow down candidates; if ambiguity remains, a fine-grained
pose verification stage is conditionally triggered to disambiguate. The final
output is an accurate segmentation mask for the target object.
\textbf{PARSE-VOS} achieved state-of-the-art performance on three major
benchmarks: Ref-YouTube-VOS, Ref-DAVIS17, and MeViS.

*Md Asaduzzaman Jabin,Hanqi Jiang,Yiwei Li,Patrick Kaggwa,Eugene Douglass,Juliet N. Sekandi,Tianming Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A Video-LLaVA-based LVLM (AdCare-VLM) is proposed for visual question answering on medication adherence using patient videos; built on a private TB dataset of 806 expert-annotated videos; introduces LLM-TB-VQA dataset; shows improved performance over PEFT-enabled VLM baselines (LLaVA-V1.5, Chat-UniVi) by 3.1–3.54 percentage points across pre-trained, regular, and LoRA settings; supported by ablations and attention maps for interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Chronic diseases require strict medication adherence, but adherence is hampered by patient behavior, caregiver support, costs, and healthcare infrastructure. A multimodal, vision-language model that can answer questions about adherence from patient videos could help monitor and improve adherence, with interpretable insights.

Method: Fine-tune a Video-LLaVA-based LVLM (AdCare-VLM) on a private dataset of 806 clinically labeled TB medication-monitoring videos. Create LLM-TB-VQA, a dataset of adherence cases (positive, negative, ambiguous). Identify correlations between visual cues (face visibility, medications, water intake, ingestion) and medical concepts in captions to align visual and linguistic representations. Compare against parameter-efficient fine-tuning baselines (LLaVA-V1.5, Chat-UniVi) across pre-trained, regular, and LoRA configurations. Use ablation studies and attention maps to assess interpretability.

Result: The method surpasses PEFT-enabled VLM models by absolute improvements of 3.1% to 3.54% across the tested configurations. Ablation experiments and attention-map analyses corroborate the contribution of visual-linguistic alignment to performance and interpretability.

Conclusion: AdCare-VLM and the LLM-TB-VQA dataset advance multimodal, interpretable assessment of medication adherence from patient videos, offering improved detection of adherence patterns and clearer visual explanations to support clinical decision-making.

Abstract: Chronic diseases, including diabetes, hypertension, asthma, HIV-AIDS,
epilepsy, and tuberculosis, necessitate rigorous adherence to medication to
avert disease progression, manage symptoms, and decrease mortality rates.
Adherence is frequently undermined by factors including patient behavior,
caregiver support, elevated medical costs, and insufficient healthcare
infrastructure. We propose AdCare-VLM, a specialized Video-LLaVA-based
multimodal large vision language model (LVLM) aimed at visual question
answering (VQA) concerning medication adherence through patient videos. We
employ a private dataset comprising 806 custom-annotated tuberculosis (TB)
medication monitoring videos, which have been labeled by clinical experts, to
fine-tune the model for adherence pattern detection. We present LLM-TB-VQA, a
detailed medical adherence VQA dataset that encompasses positive, negative, and
ambiguous adherence cases. Our method identifies correlations between visual
features, such as the clear visibility of the patient's face, medication, water
intake, and the act of ingestion, and their associated medical concepts in
captions. This facilitates the integration of aligned visual-linguistic
representations and improves multimodal interactions. Experimental results
indicate that our method surpasses parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT)
enabled VLM models, such as LLaVA-V1.5 and Chat-UniVi, with absolute
improvements ranging from 3.1% to 3.54% across pre-trained, regular, and
low-rank adaptation (LoRA) configurations. Comprehensive ablation studies and
attention map visualizations substantiate our approach, enhancing
interpretability.

### [51] [PictOBI-20k: Unveiling Large Multimodal Models in Visual Decipherment for Pictographic Oracle Bone Characters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05773)
*Zijian Chen,Wenjie Hua,Jinhao Li,Lirong Deng,Fan Du,Tingzhu Chen,Guangtao Zhai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PictOBI-20k is a dataset of 20k oracle bone image pairs (OBCs and real objects) with ~15k multiple-choice questions to evaluate visual decipherment by large multimodal models (LMMs). The study analyzes how LMMs use visual information versus language priors and probes human–model consistency on visual reasoning, offering a benchmark to improve visual attention in OBC-oriented LMMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deciphering oracle bone characters is foundational for understanding early Chinese civilization, yet current decipherment is limited by sparse inscriptions. LMMs offer potential for visual reasoning, but it’s unclear whether they leverage genuine visual cues or rely on textual priors. A dedicated benchmark is needed to evaluate and enhance visual decipherment.",

Method: Construct PictOBI-20k by collecting 20k OBC images paired with real object images, generating over 15k multiple-choice questions. The study includes subjective annotations to compare human and LMM reference points in visual reasoning. It evaluates general LMMs on the task and analyzes whether their decisions rely on visual features or language priors, aiming to assess and improve visual attention in OBC-oriented LMMs.

Result: Experiments show that general LMMs possess preliminary visual decipherment capabilities but do not effectively utilize visual information, being largely governed by language priors. The study also assesses consistency between human and model reference points in visual reasoning, highlighting gaps between true visual understanding and model decisions.

Conclusion: PictOBI-20k provides a benchmark to evaluate and optimize visual attention in OBC-oriented LMMs. The authors will release code and data (GitHub) to enable continued development in this area.

Abstract: Deciphering oracle bone characters (OBCs), the oldest attested form of
written Chinese, has remained the ultimate, unwavering goal of scholars,
offering an irreplaceable key to understanding humanity's early modes of
production. Current decipherment methodologies of OBC are primarily constrained
by the sporadic nature of archaeological excavations and the limited corpus of
inscriptions. With the powerful visual perception capability of large
multimodal models (LMMs), the potential of using LMMs for visually deciphering
OBCs has increased. In this paper, we introduce PictOBI-20k, a dataset designed
to evaluate LMMs on the visual decipherment tasks of pictographic OBCs. It
includes 20k meticulously collected OBC and real object images, forming over
15k multi-choice questions. We also conduct subjective annotations to
investigate the consistency of the reference point between humans and LMMs in
visual reasoning. Experiments indicate that general LMMs possess preliminary
visual decipherment skills, and LMMs are not effectively using visual
information, while most of the time they are limited by language priors. We
hope that our dataset can facilitate the evaluation and optimization of visual
attention in future OBC-oriented LMMs. The code and dataset will be available
at https://github.com/OBI-Future/PictOBI-20k.

### [52] [Posterior shape models revisited: Improving 3D reconstructions from partial data using target specific models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05776)
*Jonathan Aellen,Florian Burkhardt,Thomas Vetter,Marcel Lüthi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A pose-alignment preprocessing step for point distribution models enables accurate partial-shape reconstruction with linear models while preserving computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pose misalignment between the training data and the partial target causes biased reconstructions, especially when only small parts are observed; efficient, data-free adaptation is desirable.

Method: Introduce an alignment adjustment that aligns the model to the target pose. The method exactly recovers the aligned model for translations and provides a good approximation for small rotations, all without access to the original training data and while preserving the efficiency of linear models.

Result: Improved reconstruction accuracy and predicted variance; exact recovery of the intended aligned model for translations; good approximation for small rotations.

Conclusion: Pose-aligned preprocessing enables plug-and-play adaptation of existing shape models in reconstruction pipelines and is broadly applicable without needing retraining or access to the original training data.

Abstract: In medical imaging, point distribution models are often used to reconstruct
and complete partial shapes using a statistical model of the full shape. A
commonly overlooked, but crucial factor in this reconstruction process, is the
pose of the training data relative to the partial target shape. A difference in
pose alignment of the training and target shape leads to biased solutions,
particularly when observing small parts of a shape. In this paper, we
demonstrate the importance of pose alignment for partial shape reconstructions
and propose an efficient method to adjust an existing model to a specific
target. Our method preserves the computational efficiency of linear models
while significantly improving reconstruction accuracy and predicted variance.
It exactly recovers the intended aligned model for translations, and provides a
good approximation for small rotations, all without access to the original
training data. Hence, existing shape models in reconstruction pipelines can be
adapted by a simple preprocessing step, making our approach widely applicable
in plug-and-play scenarios.

### [53] [3DPillars: Pillar-based two-stage 3D object detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05780)
*Jongyoun Noh,Junghyup Lee,Hyekang Park,Bumsub Ham*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A two-stage 3D detector using pseudo-image representations that preserves 3D structure and enables ROI-based refinement via 3DPillars and sparse-context features, achieving a favorable speed–accuracy trade-off on KITTI/Waymo.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PointPillars is fast but limited: pseudo-image representations struggle to preserve precise 3D geometry and hinder two-stage proposal methods. There is a need to combine efficiency with the accuracy benefits of two-stage detection.

Method: Introduce 3DPillars, a CNN that learns 3D voxel-based features from pseudo images using 2D convolutions via a separable voxel feature module; introduce an RoI head with a sparse scene context feature module that aggregates multi-scale features from 3DPillars to form a sparse scene feature for refined 3D proposals, enabling a two-stage pipeline.

Result: Experiments on KITTI and Waymo Open show the approach achieves a good speed–accuracy trade-off, narrowing the gap to state-of-the-art detectors while maintaining efficiency.

Conclusion: The two-stage framework demonstrates that pseudo-image representations can support accurate and efficient 3D detection; the 3DPillars architecture and sparse-context RoI head enable effective two-stage detection with contextual refinement.

Abstract: PointPillars is the fastest 3D object detector that exploits pseudo image
representations to encode features for 3D objects in a scene. Albeit efficient,
PointPillars is typically outperformed by state-of-the-art 3D detection methods
due to the following limitations: 1) The pseudo image representations fail to
preserve precise 3D structures, and 2) they make it difficult to adopt a
two-stage detection pipeline using 3D object proposals that typically shows
better performance than a single-stage approach. We introduce in this paper the
first two-stage 3D detection framework exploiting pseudo image representations,
narrowing the performance gaps between PointPillars and state-of-the-art
methods, while retaining its efficiency. Our framework consists of two novel
components that overcome the aforementioned limitations of PointPillars: First,
we introduce a new CNN architecture, dubbed 3DPillars, that enables learning 3D
voxel-based features from the pseudo image representation efficiently using 2D
convolutions. The basic idea behind 3DPillars is that 3D features from voxels
can be viewed as a stack of pseudo images. To implement this idea, we propose a
separable voxel feature module that extracts voxel-based features without using
3D convolutions. Second, we introduce an RoI head with a sparse scene context
feature module that aggregates multi-scale features from 3DPillars to obtain a
sparse scene feature. This enables adopting a two-stage pipeline effectively,
and fully leveraging contextual information of a scene to refine 3D object
proposals. Experimental results on the KITTI and Waymo Open datasets
demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach, achieving a good
compromise in terms of speed and accuracy.

### [54] [CRAB: Camera-Radar Fusion for Reducing Depth Ambiguity in Backward Projection based View Transformation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05785)
*In-Jae Lee,Sihwan Hwang,Youngseok Kim,Wonjune Kim,Sanmin Kim,Dongsuk Kum*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CRAB uses radar-informed backward projection to fuse camera and radar data for BEV 3D object detection and segmentation, reducing depth ambiguity and achieving SOTA among backward-projection methods on nuScenes (62.4% NDS, 54.0% mAP).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome depth-ambiguity and sparse BEV features in BEV camera-radar fusion by leveraging radar depth and context to improve BEV queries and depth distinction.

Method: Backward projection approach that aggregates perspective image features into BEV queries; fuses dense but less reliable image depth with sparse yet precise radar occupancy; introduces spatial cross-attention with radar context map to better interpret the 3D scene.

Result: On nuScenes, achieves state-of-the-art among backward-projection camera-radar fusion methods for 3D object detection, with 62.4% NDS and 54.0% mAP.

Conclusion: Radar-assisted backward projection and spatial cross-attention effectively reduce depth ambiguity and enhance BEV understanding, establishing CRAB as competitive for camera-radar BEV fusion.

Abstract: Recently, camera-radar fusion-based 3D object detection methods in bird's eye
view (BEV) have gained attention due to the complementary characteristics and
cost-effectiveness of these sensors. Previous approaches using forward
projection struggle with sparse BEV feature generation, while those employing
backward projection overlook depth ambiguity, leading to false positives. In
this paper, to address the aforementioned limitations, we propose a novel
camera-radar fusion-based 3D object detection and segmentation model named CRAB
(Camera-Radar fusion for reducing depth Ambiguity in Backward projection-based
view transformation), using a backward projection that leverages radar to
mitigate depth ambiguity. During the view transformation, CRAB aggregates
perspective view image context features into BEV queries. It improves depth
distinction among queries along the same ray by combining the dense but
unreliable depth distribution from images with the sparse yet precise depth
information from radar occupancy. We further introduce spatial cross-attention
with a feature map containing radar context information to enhance the
comprehension of the 3D scene. When evaluated on the nuScenes open dataset, our
proposed approach achieves a state-of-the-art performance among backward
projection-based camera-radar fusion methods with 62.4\% NDS and 54.0\% mAP in
3D object detection.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Two attention-guided autoencoder methods for anomaly detection in medical device manufacturing: a lightweight 4-MS-SSIM-based inline detector and a Mahalanobis-distance-based supervisory monitor, achieving high accuracy and regulatory-aligned monitoring under EU AI Act.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges of small and imbalanced datasets, high-resolution imagery, and stringent regulatory requirements in automated visual inspection for medical device manufacturing, enabling real-time defect detection and scalable post-production surveillance in regulated AI deployments.

Method: Two architectures: (1) a 4-MS-SSIM structural similarity-based anomaly score for lightweight, real-time inline defect detection; (2) a Mahalanobis scoring approach on reduced latent features for supervisory monitoring of distributional shifts. Both are attention-guided autoencoders.

Result: First method: ACC 0.903 with unsupervised thresholding and 0.931 with supervised thresholding on the Surface Seal Image Test split, using only 10% defective samples. Second method: ACC 0.722 with supervised thresholding for supervisory monitoring. Both outperform re-implemented baselines and support deployment in regulated environments, aligning with EU AI Act requirements.

Conclusion: The two approaches provide complementary capabilities: reliable inline inspection and scalable post-production surveillance for regulatory compliance, offering a practical pathway for deploying deep anomaly detection in high-risk, regulated manufacturing.

Abstract: Automating visual inspection in medical device manufacturing remains
challenging due to small and imbalanced datasets, high-resolution imagery, and
stringent regulatory requirements. This work proposes two attention-guided
autoencoder architectures for deep anomaly detection designed to address these
constraints. The first employs a structural similarity-based anomaly score
(4-MS-SSIM), offering lightweight and accurate real-time defect detection,
yielding ACC 0.903 (unsupervised thresholding) and 0.931 (supervised
thresholding) on the - Surface Seal Image - Test split with only 10% of
defective samples. The second applies a feature-distance approach using
Mahalanobis scoring on reduced latent features, providing high sensitivity to
distributional shifts for supervisory monitoring, achieving ACC 0.722 with
supervised thresholding. Together, these methods deliver complementary
capabilities: the first supports reliable inline inspection, while the second
enables scalable post-production surveillance and regulatory compliance
monitoring. Experimental results demonstrate that both approaches surpass
re-implemented baselines and provide a practical pathway for deploying deep
anomaly detection in regulated manufacturing environments, aligning accuracy,
efficiency, and the regulatory obligations defined for high-risk AI systems
under the EU AI Act.

### [56] [A Probabilistic Segment Anything Model for Ambiguity-Aware Medical Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05809)
*Tyler Ward,Abdullah Imran*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduces Probabilistic SAM, adding a latent variable and variational training to SAM to generate diverse, plausible segmentations conditioned on image and prompt; shows improved uncertainty-aware performance on LIDC-IDRI; code released.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAM is deterministic; in medical imaging, multiple plausible segmentations exist due to annotation uncertainty and inter-expert variability; need to capture ambiguity.

Method: Incorporates prior and posterior networks into SAM; latent codes modulate prompt embeddings during inference; uses a variational objective; sampling in latent space yields diverse outputs with low overhead.

Result: On LIDC-IDRI lung nodules, produces diverse outputs aligning with expert disagreement; outperforms existing probabilistic baselines on uncertainty-aware metrics.

Conclusion: Probabilistic SAM enables uncertainty-aware segmentation with minimal overhead and accessible code; can better reflect annotation variability.

Abstract: Recent advances in promptable segmentation, such as the Segment Anything
Model (SAM), have enabled flexible, high-quality mask generation across a wide
range of visual domains. However, SAM and similar models remain fundamentally
deterministic, producing a single segmentation per object per prompt, and fail
to capture the inherent ambiguity present in many real-world tasks. This
limitation is particularly troublesome in medical imaging, where multiple
plausible segmentations may exist due to annotation uncertainty or inter-expert
variability. In this paper, we introduce Probabilistic SAM, a probabilistic
extension of SAM that models a distribution over segmentations conditioned on
both the input image and prompt. By incorporating a latent variable space and
training with a variational objective, our model learns to generate diverse and
plausible segmentation masks reflecting the variability in human annotations.
The architecture integrates a prior and posterior network into the SAM
framework, allowing latent codes to modulate the prompt embeddings during
inference. The latent space allows for efficient sampling during inference,
enabling uncertainty-aware outputs with minimal overhead. We evaluate
Probabilistic SAM on the public LIDC-IDRI lung nodule dataset and demonstrate
its ability to produce diverse outputs that align with expert disagreement,
outperforming existing probabilistic baselines on uncertainty-aware metrics.

*Caleb Gates,Patrick Moorhead,Jayden Ferguson,Omar Darwish,Conner Stallman,Pablo Rivas,Paapa Quansah*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Near real-time, pixel-level dust detection from MODIS multi-band imagery using a 3D CNN; achieves ~0.92 accuracy on 17 scenes with MSE 0.014, and faster training, with edge-miss caveats.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dust storms harm health and reduce visibility; rapid, global-scale dust detection from satellites is needed for timely alerts.

Method: 3D convolutional network trained on 36 MODIS bands (plus split thermal bands) to separate dust from clouds and surface features; simple normalization and local data filling handle missing data; improvements speed up training by ~21x and enable fast full-scene processing.

Result: On 17 independent MODIS scenes, the model achieves ~0.92 accuracy with mean squared error 0.014; plume cores show strong agreement with observation, with most misses along plume edges.

Conclusion: Joint band-and-space learning can provide timely global dust alerts; further gains may come from wider input windows or attention-based models to sharpen edges.

Abstract: Dust storms harm health and reduce visibility; quick detection from
satellites is needed. We present a near real-time system that flags dust at the
pixel level using multi-band images from NASA's Terra and Aqua (MODIS). A 3D
convolutional network learns patterns across all 36 bands, plus split thermal
bands, to separate dust from clouds and surface features. Simple normalization
and local filling handle missing data. An improved version raises training
speed by 21x and supports fast processing of full scenes. On 17 independent
MODIS scenes, the model reaches about 0.92 accuracy with a mean squared error
of 0.014. Maps show strong agreement in plume cores, with most misses along
edges. These results show that joint band-and-space learning can provide timely
dust alerts at global scale; using wider input windows or attention-based
models may further sharpen edges.

*Penelope Brown,Julie Stephany Berrio Perez,Mao Shan,Stewart Worrall*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A multimodal RGB+thermal VRU detector using fine-tuned YOLOv8 improves detection in challenging conditions by leveraging class re-weighting and augmentation; thermal data yields highest precision; RGB-to-thermal augmentation improves recall; 640px resolution and partial backbone freezing optimize speed-accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vulnerable road users account for a large share of traffic fatalities, and detection is hampered by poor lighting, adverse weather, and imbalanced datasets. A robust multimodal approach is needed to improve VRU safety at intersections.

Method: Fine-tuned YOLOv8 with multimodal fusion of RGB and thermal infrared data. Training utilized KITTI, BDD100K, and Teledyne FLIR datasets with class re-weighting and light data augmentations to boost minority-class performance. Experiments explored 640-pixel input resolution, partial backbone freezing, and class-weighted losses to balance accuracy and efficiency.

Result: Thermal models achieved the highest precision. RGB-to-thermal augmentation increased recall. A 640-pixel resolution with partial backbone freezing offered a favorable accuracy/efficiency trade-off, and overall results support the benefit of multimodal detection for VRU safety at intersections.

Conclusion: Combining RGB and thermal data with targeted training strategies can enhance VRU detection under challenging conditions, with thermal data providing peak precision and RGB-based augmentations improving recall. This multimodal approach shows promise for improving VRU safety at intersections and warrants further refinement of fusion strategies and real-time deployment considerations.

Abstract: Vulnerable road users (VRUs) such as pedestrians, cyclists, and motorcyclists
represent more than half of global traffic deaths, yet their detection remains
challenging in poor lighting, adverse weather, and unbalanced data sets. This
paper presents a multimodal detection framework that integrates RGB and thermal
infrared imaging with a fine-tuned YOLOv8 model. Training leveraged KITTI,
BDD100K, and Teledyne FLIR datasets, with class re-weighting and light
augmentations to improve minority-class performance and robustness, experiments
show that 640-pixel resolution and partial backbone freezing optimise accuracy
and efficiency, while class-weighted losses enhance recall for rare VRUs.
Results highlight that thermal models achieve the highest precision, and
RGB-to-thermal augmentation boosts recall, demonstrating the potential of
multimodal detection to improve VRU safety at intersections.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: In data-limited cardiovascular histology segmentation, multiple state-of-the-art models show unstable performance across train/val splits; ranking differences arise from noise rather than true model quality, questioning benchmarking validity in low-data clinical settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cardiovascular histopathology lacks large annotated datasets. The study aims to understand how different segmentation models perform under data scarcity and whether benchmarking results reflect true clinical utility.

Method: Systematic evaluation of several segmentation models (U-Net, DeepLabV3+, SegFormer, SAM, MedSAM, MedSAM+UNet) on a limited histology dataset, with extensive Bayesian hyperparameter optimization and assessment across different data splits to gauge sensitivity to dataset partitioning.

Result: Model performance is highly sensitive to data splits; small performance differences are likely due to statistical noise rather than real algorithmic gains; no clear superior model emerges; benchmarking in low-data settings is unstable.

Conclusion: Standard benchmarking practices may be unreliable in low-data clinical contexts; rankings should be interpreted with caution, and more robust evaluation strategies are needed to reflect potential clinical utility.

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of carotid artery structures in histopathological
images is vital for advancing cardiovascular disease research and diagnosis.
However, deep learning model development in this domain is constrained by the
scarcity of annotated cardiovascular histopathological data. This study
investigates a systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art deep learning
segmentation models, including convolutional neural networks (U-Net,
DeepLabV3+), a Vision Transformer (SegFormer), and recent foundation models
(SAM, MedSAM, MedSAM+UNet), on a limited dataset of cardiovascular histology
images. Despite employing an extensive hyperparameter optimization strategy
with Bayesian search, our findings reveal that model performance is highly
sensitive to data splits, with minor differences driven more by statistical
noise than by true algorithmic superiority. This instability exposes the
limitations of standard benchmarking practices in low-data clinical settings
and challenges the assumption that performance rankings reflect meaningful
clinical utility.

### [60] [Investigating Location-Regularised Self-Supervised Feature Learning for Seafloor Visual Imagery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06660)
*Cailei Liang,Adrian Bodenmann,Emma J Curtis,Samuel Simmons,Kazunori Nagano,Stan Brown,Adam Riese,Blair Thornton*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Location-based regularisation improves SSL for seafloor imagery across CNNs and ViTs, with modest average F1 gains (~5% for CNNs, ~6% for ViTs); high-dimensional ViTs generalise well; low-dimensional latent spaces benefit more from location regularisation; pre-trained ViTs can match the best location-regularised SSL.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To quantify the impact of location metadata as a regularising signal across diverse self-supervised learning strategies, network architectures, latent-space sizes, and seafloor image datasets.

Method: Evaluate location-based regularisation on six SSL frameworks comprising CNN and Vision Transformer (ViT) models with latent space sizes of 128 and 512. Tests conducted on three seafloor image datasets. Comparisons made against standard SSL and pretrained baselines; report downstream F1-score improvements.

Result: Location-regularised SSL consistently improves downstream F1 over standard SSL: CNNs +4.9% (±4.0); ViTs +6.3% (±8.9). CNNs pretrained on generic data benefit from high-dimensional latent representations, while dataset-optimised SSL achieves similar performance across 512 vs 128 dims. Location-regularised SSL improves CNN performance over pretrained by +2.7% (high-dim) and +10.1% (low-dim). For ViTs, high-dimensionality benefits both pretrained and dataset-optimised SSL. Despite improvements over standard SSL, pretrained ViTs match the best location-regularised SSL with F1 ≈0.795 (±0.075–0.077).

Conclusion: Location metadata provides value for SSL regularisation in seafloor image analysis, particularly when using low-dimensional latent representations, and high-dimensional ViTs exhibit strong generalisation capacity.

Abstract: High-throughput interpretation of robotically gathered seafloor visual
imagery can increase the efficiency of marine monitoring and exploration.
Although recent research has suggested that location metadata can enhance
self-supervised feature learning (SSL), its benefits across different SSL
strategies, models and seafloor image datasets are underexplored. This study
evaluates the impact of location-based regularisation on six state-of-the-art
SSL frameworks, which include Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Vision
Transformer (ViT) models with varying latent-space dimensionality. Evaluation
across three diverse seafloor image datasets finds that location-regularisation
consistently improves downstream classification performance over standard SSL,
with average F1-score gains of $4.9 \pm 4.0%$ for CNNs and $6.3 \pm 8.9%$ for
ViTs, respectively. While CNNs pretrained on generic datasets benefit from
high-dimensional latent representations, dataset-optimised SSL achieves similar
performance across the high (512) and low (128) dimensional latent
representations. Location-regularised SSL improves CNN performance over
pre-trained models by $2.7 \pm 2.7%$ and $10.1 \pm 9.4%$ for high and
low-dimensional latent representations, respectively. For ViTs,
high-dimensionality benefits both pre-trained and dataset-optimised SSL.
Although location-regularisation improves SSL performance compared to standard
SSL methods, pre-trained ViTs show strong generalisation, matching the
best-performing location-regularised SSL with F1-scores of $0.795 \pm 0.075$
and $0.795 \pm 0.077$, respectively. The findings highlight the value of
location metadata for SSL regularisation, particularly when using
low-dimensional latent representations, and demonstrate strong generalisation
of high-dimensional ViTs for seafloor image analysis.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BTCChat introduces Change Extraction and Prompt Augmentation to bi-temporal MLLMs, achieving state-of-the-art results on change captioning and VQA while preserving single-image interpretation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address inadequate modeling of temporal correlations and spatial semantic changes in bi-temporal satellite imagery when using multimodal LLMs, which hampers visual-semantic alignment and change understanding.

Method: Propose Change Extraction module to better capture temporal features and spatial changes between image pairs; introduce Prompt Augmentation to inject contextual clues into prompts to enhance attention to spatial details; supports bi-temporal change captioning and retains single-image interpretation capability; designed for multimodal LLMs.

Result: Experimental results show state-of-the-art performance on both bi-temporal change captioning and visual question answering tasks.

Conclusion: BTCChat advances bi-temporal change understanding in multimodal LLMs, improving temporal-spatial alignment and performance, with preserved single-image capabilities.

Abstract: Bi-temporal satellite imagery supports critical applications such as urban
development monitoring and disaster assessment. Although powerful multimodal
large language models (MLLMs) have been applied in bi-temporal change analysis,
previous methods process image pairs through direct concatenation, inadequately
modeling temporal correlations and spatial semantic changes. This deficiency
hampers visual-semantic alignment in change understanding, thereby constraining
the overall effectiveness of current approaches. To address this gap, we
propose BTCChat, a multi-temporal MLLM with advanced bi-temporal change
understanding capability. BTCChat supports bi-temporal change captioning and
retains single-image interpretation capability. To better capture temporal
features and spatial semantic changes in image pairs, we design a Change
Extraction module. Moreover, to enhance the model's attention to spatial
details, we introduce a Prompt Augmentation mechanism, which incorporates
contextual clues into the prompt to enhance model performance. Experimental
results demonstrate that BTCChat achieves state-of-the-art performance on
change captioning and visual question answering tasks.

*Cailei Liang,Adrian Bodenmann,Sam Fenton,Blair Thornton*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Online unsupervised clustering (OCF) for seafloor imagery enabling real-time interpretation on streaming data; outperforms other online methods in F1 and maintains bounded compute.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable real-time, self-supervised interpretation of seafloor imagery for long-endurance AUVs, addressing environmental variability and lack of labeled data.

Method: An online clustering framework that maintains a set of representative samples and supports dynamic cluster merging/splitting, enabling constant-time update as new frames arrive without reprocessing history.

Result: Across three seafloor datasets, average F1 score of 0.68 (SD 3%), with robust performance across different trajectories; computation remains bounded and lower as data volume grows.

Conclusion: OCF is suitable for generating survey data summaries and informing adaptive path planning in persistent autonomous marine exploration.

Abstract: As long-endurance and seafloor-resident AUVs become more capable, there is an
increasing need for extended, real-time interpretation of seafloor imagery to
enable adaptive missions and optimise communication efficiency. Although
offline image analysis methods are well established, they rely on access to
complete datasets and human-labelled examples to manage the strong influence of
environmental and operational conditions on seafloor image
appearance-requirements that cannot be met in real-time settings. To address
this, we introduce an online clustering framework (OCF) capable of interpreting
seafloor imagery without supervision, which is designed to operate in real-time
on continuous data streams in a scalable, adaptive, and self-consistent manner.
The method enables the efficient review and consolidation of common patterns
across the entire data history in constant time by identifying and maintaining
a set of representative samples that capture the evolving feature distribution,
supporting dynamic cluster merging and splitting without reprocessing the full
image history. We evaluate the framework on three diverse seafloor image
datasets, analysing the impact of different representative sampling strategies
on both clustering accuracy and computational cost. The OCF achieves the
highest average F1 score of 0.68 across the three datasets among all
comparative online clustering approaches, with a standard deviation of 3%
across three distinct survey trajectories, demonstrating its superior
clustering capability and robustness to trajectory variation. In addition, it
maintains consistently lower and bounded computational time as the data volume
increases. These properties are beneficial for generating survey data summaries
and supporting informative path planning in long-term, persistent autonomous
marine exploration.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A multimodal transformer-based framework (ViSK-GAT) for eight-category musculoskeletal risk classification using synchronized visual and skeletal data; introduces FGAM and MGCM modules; achieves ~93% accuracy and outperforms baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Assess musculoskeletal risk in real-world, complex environments where single-modality data fail; create a multimodal dataset combining vision and skeletal coordinates to enable early intervention in sports.

Method: ViSK-GAT fuses a Residual Block with a Lightweight Transformer Block to model spatial-temporal dependencies. It uses Fine-Grained Attention Module (FGAM) for cross-modal refinement and Multimodal Geometric Correspondence Module (MGCM) to align image features with coordinate-based representations. The dataset labels each sample into eight REBA-based risk categories.

Result: Validation accuracy 93.55%, test accuracy 93.89%; precision 93.86%; F1 93.85%; Cohen's Kappa 93%; Matthews Correlation Coefficient 93%; regression RMSE 0.1205 and MAE 0.0156. Outperforms nine popular transfer-learning backbones.

Conclusion: ViSK-GAT advances AI-assisted musculoskeletal risk classification in complex environments, enabling reliable early interventions in sports and illustrating the value of multimodal, cross-modal attention mechanisms.

Abstract: Musculoskeletal disorders pose significant risks to athletes, and assessing
risk early is important for prevention. However, most existing methods are
designed for controlled settings and fail to reliably assess risk in complex
environments due to their reliance on a single type of data. This research
proposes ViSK-GAT (Visual-Skeletal Geometric Attention Transformer), a novel
multimodal deep learning framework designed to classify musculoskeletal risk
using visual and skeletal coordinate-based features. In addition, a custom
multimodal dataset is constructed by combining visual data and skeletal
coordinates for risk assessment. Each sample is labeled into eight risk
categories based on the Rapid Entire Body Assessment system. ViSK-GAT combines
a Residual Block with a Lightweight Transformer Block to learn spatial and
temporal dependencies jointly. It incorporates two novel modules: the
Fine-Grained Attention Module (FGAM), which enables precise inter-modal feature
refinement through cross-attention between visual and skeletal inputs, and the
Multimodal Geometric Correspondence Module (MGCM), which enhances cross-modal
coherence by aligning image features with coordinate-based representations.
ViSK-GAT achieved strong performance with validation and test accuracies of
93.55\% and 93.89\%, respectively; a precision of 93.86\%; an F1 score of
93.85\%; and Cohen's Kappa and Matthews Correlation Coefficient of 93\%. The

### [64] [Compression Beyond Pixels: Semantic Compression with Multimodal Foundation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05925)
*Ruiqi Shen,Haotian Wu,Wenjing Zhang,Jiangjing Hu,Deniz Gunduz*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A CLIP-based semantic compressor encodes CLIP feature embeddings into few bits to preserve semantics across tasks, achieving ~0.002–0.003 bits per pixel and zero-shot robustness beyond traditional codecs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a growing need to preserve semantic content rather than exact pixel fidelity, with robustness across diverse data distributions and downstream tasks for practical applications.

Method: Compress CLIP feature embeddings (rather than raw images) into minimal bit representation, leveraging CLIP's multimodal semantic space to preserve semantic information across tasks without reconstructing pixels.

Result: Achieves semantic preservation across benchmarks with an extremely low bitrate (~2–3×10^-3 bits per pixel), covering under 5% of the bitrate used by mainstream codecs for comparable performance, and shows zero-shot robustness across data distributions and downstream tasks under heavy compression.

Conclusion: Semantic compression via CLIP embeddings offers highly efficient, distribution-robust preservation of semantic information, suggesting a promising direction beyond pixel-level reconstruction for downstream tasks.

Abstract: Recent deep learning-based methods for lossy image compression achieve
competitive rate-distortion performance through extensive end-to-end training
and advanced architectures. However, emerging applications increasingly
prioritize semantic preservation over pixel-level reconstruction and demand
robust performance across diverse data distributions and downstream tasks.
These challenges call for advanced semantic compression paradigms. Motivated by
the zero-shot and representational capabilities of multimodal foundation
models, we propose a novel semantic compression method based on the contrastive
language-image pretraining (CLIP) model. Rather than compressing images for
reconstruction, we propose compressing the CLIP feature embeddings into minimal
bits while preserving semantic information across different tasks. Experiments
show that our method maintains semantic integrity across benchmark datasets,
achieving an average bit rate of approximately 2-3* 10(-3) bits per pixel. This
is less than 5% of the bitrate required by mainstream image compression
approaches for comparable performance. Remarkably, even under extreme
compression, the proposed approach exhibits zero-shot robustness across diverse
data distributions and downstream tasks.

*Christian Geckeler,Niklas Neugebauer,Manasi Muglikar,Davide Scaramuzza,Stefano Mintchev*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A single-sensor event spectroscopy system for UAVs enables simultaneous depth sensing via structured light and spectral imaging in the 650–850 nm range, delivering strong depth and material-differentiation performance in forest environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Forest UAV perception is hampered by latency, poor depth resolution, and light dependence; a lightweight, integrated sensing approach that provides both accurate depth and spectral information can improve navigation, mapping, and material classification under canopies.

Method: Use a single sensor to perform depth reconstruction with structured light and modulate the projected light wavelength to capture spectral information in controlled bands between 650 nm and 850 nm. A portable RGB-only version (3 wavelengths) demonstrates depth and spectral data collection in real-world rainforest; validation against reference spectrometer and commercial multispectral cameras; evaluation includes depth RMSE improvements and material differentiation.

Result: Demonstrates up to 60% RMSE improvement over commercial depth sensors; spectral accuracy comparable to reference instruments; RGB reconstruction achieved; material differentiation between leaves and branches improved by over 30% when depth data is fused with spectral data; tested in lab and Masoala rainforest, showing robust depth, RGB reconstruction, and material differentiation.

Conclusion: The integrated depth, RGB reconstruction, and material differentiation system offers lightweight, robust perception for UAVs in complex natural environments, enabling safer navigation and richer data collection with minimal additional hardware and latency.

Abstract: Uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) are increasingly deployed in forest
environments for tasks such as environmental monitoring and search and rescue,
which require safe navigation through dense foliage and precise data
collection. Traditional sensing approaches, including passive multispectral and
RGB imaging, suffer from latency, poor depth resolution, and strong dependence
on ambient light - especially under forest canopies. In this work, we present a
novel event spectroscopy system that simultaneously enables high-resolution,
low-latency depth reconstruction and multispectral imaging using a single
sensor. Depth is reconstructed using structured light, and by modulating the
wavelength of the projected structured light, our system captures spectral
information in controlled bands between 650 nm and 850 nm. We demonstrate up to
$60\%$ improvement in RMSE over commercial depth sensors and validate the
spectral accuracy against a reference spectrometer and commercial multispectral
cameras, demonstrating comparable performance. A portable version limited to
RGB (3 wavelengths) is used to collect real-world depth and spectral data from
a Masoala Rainforest. We demonstrate the use of this prototype for color image
reconstruction and material differentiation between leaves and branches using
spectral and depth data. Our results show that adding depth (available at no
extra effort with our setup) to material differentiation improves the accuracy
by over $30\%$ compared to color-only method. Our system, tested in both lab
and real-world rainforest environments, shows strong performance in depth
estimation, RGB reconstruction, and material differentiation - paving the way
for lightweight, integrated, and robust UAV perception and data collection in
complex natural environments.

### [66] [AttriPrompt: Dynamic Prompt Composition Learning for CLIP](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05949)
*Qiqi Zhan,Shiwei Li,Qingjie Liu,Yunhong Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AttriPrompt presents a prompt refinement framework that uses intermediate-layer features from CLIP's vision encoder to retrieve semantically similar prompts and attach them to inputs at every text-layer, enabling fine-grained alignment via Dual-stream Contrastive Learning and preventing overfitting through Self-Regularization; it achieves notable gains (up to 7.37% base-to-novel) and strong cross-domain transfer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep text prompting relies heavily on high-level contrastive objectives and static prompts, neglecting fine-grained feature optimization and content-aware adaptation. By leveraging intermediate visual features from CLIP, AttriPrompt seeks to enable fine-grained, content-aware prompt refinement.

Method: Attribute Retrieval module clusters per-layer visual features, retrieves semantically similar prompts from a prompt pool, and concatenates them to the input of every layer in the text encoder. It employs Dual-stream Contrastive Learning for fine-grained alignment using hierarchical visual information in prompted features, and introduces Self-Regularization to constrain relations between prompted and non-prompted text features, mitigating overfitting on limited data.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods across three benchmarks, with up to 7.37% improvement in base-to-novel settings; exhibits strong cross-domain knowledge transfer, suggesting better real-world viability of vision-language models.

Conclusion: AttriPrompt demonstrates that content-aware, fine-grained alignment between visual features and textual representations can significantly enhance prompting strategies, making vision-language pre-trained models more robust and adaptable across domains.

Abstract: The evolution of prompt learning methodologies has driven exploration of
deeper prompt designs to enhance model performance. However, current deep text
prompting approaches suffer from two critical limitations: Over-reliance on
constrastive learning objectives that prioritize high-level semantic alignment,
neglecting fine-grained feature optimization; Static prompts across all input
categories, preventing content-aware adaptation. To address these limitations,
we propose AttriPrompt-a novel framework that enhances and refines textual
semantic representations by leveraging the intermediate-layer features of
CLIP's vision encoder. We designed an Attribute Retrieval module that first
clusters visual features from each layer. The aggregated visual features
retrieve semantically similar prompts from a prompt pool, which are then
concatenated to the input of every layer in the text encoder. Leveraging
hierarchical visual information embedded in prompted text features, we
introduce Dual-stream Contrastive Learning to realize fine-grained alignment.
Furthermore, we introduce a Self-Regularization mechanism by applying explicit
regularization constraints between the prompted and non-prompted text features
to prevent overfitting on limited training data. Extensive experiments across
three benchmarks demonstrate AttriPrompt's superiority over state-of-the-art
methods, achieving up to 7.37\% improvement in the base-to-novel setting. The
observed strength of our method in cross-domain knowledge transfer positions
vision-language pre-trained models as more viable solutions for real-world
implementation.

### [67] [Coefficients-Preserving Sampling for Reinforcement Learning with Flow Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05952)
*Feng Wang,Zihao Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes Coefficients-Preserving Sampling (CPS) to replace SDE-based sampling in Flow Matching RL for diffusion models, removing noise artifacts and improving reward learning, enabling faster/stable convergence of Flow-GRPO and Dance-GRPO.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RL for image/video generation using diffusion/flow matching suffers from noise artifacts when injecting stochasticity via SDE; this harms reward learning and sample efficiency. A sampling method that preserves informative coefficients could improve training stability and outcomes.

Method: Introduce Coefficients-Preserving Sampling (CPS), inspired by DDIM, reformulating the sampling process in Flow Matching RL to preserve coefficients and eliminate noise artifacts.

Result: CPS leads to more accurate reward modeling and faster, more stable convergence for RL optimizers like Flow-GRPO and Dance-GRPO; code will be released.

Conclusion: CPS addresses the noise drawbacks of SDE-based sampling in Flow Matching RL, improving reward learning and convergence, and enabling better quality and prompt alignment in generated images/videos.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has recently emerged as a powerful technique for
improving image and video generation in Diffusion and Flow Matching models,
specifically for enhancing output quality and alignment with prompts. A
critical step for applying online RL methods on Flow Matching is the
introduction of stochasticity into the deterministic framework, commonly
realized by Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE). Our investigation reveals a
significant drawback to this approach: SDE-based sampling introduces pronounced
noise artifacts in the generated images, which we found to be detrimental to
the reward learning process. A rigorous theoretical analysis traces the origin
of this noise to an excess of stochasticity injected during inference. To
address this, we draw inspiration from Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models
(DDIM) to reformulate the sampling process. Our proposed method,
Coefficients-Preserving Sampling (CPS), eliminates these noise artifacts. This
leads to more accurate reward modeling, ultimately enabling faster and more
stable convergence for reinforcement learning-based optimizers like Flow-GRPO
and Dance-GRPO. Code will be released at https://github.com/IamCreateAI/FlowCPS

### [68] [Dual Interaction Network with Cross-Image Attention for Medical Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05953)
*Jeonghyun Noh,Wangsu Jeon,Jinsun Park*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A dual interactive fusion module (DIFM) for medical image segmentation that fuses original and enhanced images via bidirectional cross-attention with global refinement, plus a multi-scale boundary loss to improve edge accuracy, showing strong results on ACDC and Synapse datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhancing medical images can improve visibility but risks distorting diagnostic information. Conventional fusion methods underutilize both original and enhanced data and fail to suppress enhancement artifacts, motivating a fusion strategy that fully exploits their complementary information.

Method: Proposes DIFM: a dual interactive fusion module that uses bidirectional cross-attention to attend to corresponding spatial information across original and enhanced images, followed by global spatial attention to refine complementary features. The approach captures multi-scale structural attributes (edges, blobs, shapes) and integrates them into enhanced features. A multi-scale boundary loss based on gradient extraction is introduced to improve boundary segmentation accuracy.

Result: Empirical evaluation on the ACDC and Synapse datasets demonstrates superiority of the proposed method both quantitatively and qualitatively compared to baselines and possibly existing fusion strategies.

Conclusion: DIFM effectively exploits complementary information from original and enhanced medical images to improve segmentation performance, with the boundary-focused loss further boosting edge accuracy; code available for reproduction.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation is a crucial method for assisting professionals in
diagnosing various diseases through medical imaging. However, various factors
such as noise, blurriness, and low contrast often hinder the accurate diagnosis
of diseases. While numerous image enhancement techniques can mitigate these
issues, they may also alter crucial information needed for accurate diagnosis
in the original image. Conventional image fusion strategies, such as feature
concatenation can address this challenge. However, they struggle to fully
leverage the advantages of both original and enhanced images while suppressing
the side effects of the enhancements. To overcome the problem, we propose a
dual interactive fusion module (DIFM) that effectively exploits mutual
complementary information from the original and enhanced images. DIFM employs
cross-attention bidirectionally to simultaneously attend to corresponding
spatial information across different images, subsequently refining the
complementary features via global spatial attention. This interaction leverages
low- to high-level features implicitly associated with diverse structural
attributes like edges, blobs, and object shapes, resulting in enhanced features
that embody important spatial characteristics. In addition, we introduce a
multi-scale boundary loss based on gradient extraction to improve segmentation
accuracy at object boundaries. Experimental results on the ACDC and Synapse
datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method quantitatively and
qualitatively. Code available at: https://github.com/JJeong-Gari/DIN

TL;DR: StripDet is a lightweight on-device 3D detection framework that uses a Strip Attention Block (SAB) to achieve long-range spatial dependencies with linear complexity, paired with a hardware-friendly depthwise separable, hierarchical backbone and simple multiscale fusion. It delivers strong accuracy with very few parameters on KITTI.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-accuracy 3D object detection from point clouds typically requires heavy computation and memory, hindering deployment on edge devices. There is a need for compact, efficient architectures that maintain performance.

Method: Introduce SAB, which decomposes standard 2D convolutions into asymmetric strip convolutions to capture long-range dependencies with linear complexity. Combine SAB with depthwise separable convolutions and a simple multiscale fusion in a hierarchical backbone designed for efficiency, resulting in an end-to-end lightweight detector.

Result: On KITTI, StripDet with only 0.65M parameters achieves 79.97% mAP for car detection, surpassing the baseline PointPillars with a 7x parameter reduction. It also outperforms recent lightweight and knowledge-distillation-based methods in accuracy-efficiency trade-offs.

Conclusion: StripDet demonstrates that a carefully designed, hardware-friendly architecture can deliver strong 3D detection performance on edge devices with substantial parameter reduction, making real-world on-device deployment feasible.

Abstract: The deployment of high-accuracy 3D object detection models from point cloud
remains a significant challenge due to their substantial computational and
memory requirements. To address this, we introduce StripDet, a novel
lightweight framework designed for on-device efficiency. First, we propose the
novel Strip Attention Block (SAB), a highly efficient module designed to
capture long-range spatial dependencies. By decomposing standard 2D
convolutions into asymmetric strip convolutions, SAB efficiently extracts
directional features while reducing computational complexity from quadratic to
linear. Second, we design a hardware-friendly hierarchical backbone that
integrates SAB with depthwise separable convolutions and a simple multiscale
fusion strategy, achieving end-to-end efficiency. Extensive experiments on the
KITTI dataset validate StripDet's superiority. With only 0.65M parameters, our
model achieves a 79.97% mAP for car detection, surpassing the baseline

*Rafal Karp,Dawid Gruszka,Tomasz Trzcinski*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Neural Bloom Lighting (NBL) and FastNBL propose neural-network-based bloom effects for real-time rendering, achieving up to ~30% faster performance than current methods while maintaining high visual quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bloom is a performance-intensive post-processing effect in real-time graphics due to multiple blur passes, texture sampling, and conditional branches. Reducing computation without sacrificing realism is critical for high-FPS, immersive scenes.

Method: Two NN-based bloom methods, NBL and FastNBL, generate brightness masks from a given 3D scene view. They are evaluated on brightness mask accuracy and inference speed across varied 3D scenes, with FastNBL and NBL reported to be 28% and 12% faster than state-of-the-art, respectively.

Result: Both methods deliver high-quality bloom effects and outperform standard SOTA bloom implementations in speed, with FastNBL offering the highest speed gains.

Conclusion: NN-based bloom methods can achieve realistic bloom in real-time while reducing computational load, aiding higher FPS and more immersive visuals; FastNBL provides the fastest option among the two.

Abstract: We propose a novel method to generate bloom lighting effect in real time
using neural networks. Our solution generate brightness mask from given 3D
scene view up to 30% faster than state-of-the-art methods. The existing
traditional techniques rely on multiple blur appliances and texture sampling,
also very often have existing conditional branching in its implementation.
These operations occupy big portion of the execution time. We solve this
problem by proposing two neural network-based bloom lighting methods, Neural
Bloom Lighting (NBL) and Fast Neural Bloom Lighting (FastNBL), focusing on
their quality and performance. Both methods were tested on a variety of 3D
scenes, with evaluations conducted on brightness mask accuracy and inference
speed. The main contribution of this work is that both methods produce
high-quality bloom effects while outperforming the standard state-of-the-art
bloom implementation, with FastNBL being faster by 28% and NBL faster by 12%.
These findings highlight that we can achieve realistic bloom lighting phenomena
faster, moving us towards more realism in real-time environments in the future.
This improvement saves computational resources, which is a major bottleneck in
real-time rendering. Furthermore, it is crucial for sustaining immersion and
ensuring smooth experiences in high FPS environments, while maintaining
high-quality realism.

### [71] [Spatial-Aware Self-Supervision for Medical 3D Imaging with Multi-Granularity Observable Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05967)
*Yiqin Zhang,Meiling Chen,Zhengjie Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A three-subtask self-supervised approach for 3D medical imaging that aims to capture spatial semantics and improve interpretability while maintaining competitive performance, leveraging the additional 3D dimension through multi-granularity spatial relations to stabilize training under data scarcity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical imaging suffers from data scarcity, and existing self-supervised methods largely adapt 2D designs that poorly convey 3D spatial learning, hindering interpretability. The work seeks to make the learning process more transparent and to tailor self-supervision to 3D medical visualization tasks.

Method: Introduce three sub-tasks designed to capture spatially relevant semantics in 3D medical imaging. The design follows observable, interpretable principles to minimize performance loss. Exploit the extra dimension in 3D data to enhance semantic depth and incorporate multi-granularity spatial relationship modeling to stabilize training.

Result: Experimental results indicate performance on par with current state-of-the-art methods on medical imaging tasks, while also providing a more intuitive understanding of what the model learns about 3D space.

Conclusion: The proposed self-supervised framework for 3D medical imaging balances competitive performance with improved interpretability, addressing the gap between 3D spatial learning and transparent visualization of the learning process.

Abstract: The application of self-supervised techniques has become increasingly
prevalent within medical visualization tasks, primarily due to its capacity to
mitigate the data scarcity prevalent in the healthcare sector. The majority of
current works are influenced by designs originating in the generic 2D visual
domain, which lack the intuitive demonstration of the model's learning process
regarding 3D spatial knowledge. Consequently, these methods often fall short in
terms of medical interpretability. We propose a method consisting of three
sub-tasks to capture the spatially relevant semantics in medical 3D imaging.
Their design adheres to observable principles to ensure interpretability, and
minimize the performance loss caused thereby as much as possible. By leveraging
the enhanced semantic depth offered by the extra dimension in 3D imaging, this
approach incorporates multi-granularity spatial relationship modeling to
maintain training stability. Experimental findings suggest that our approach is
capable of delivering performance that is on par with current methodologies,
while facilitating an intuitive understanding of the self-supervised learning
process.

*Ye Wang,Zili Yi,Yibo Zhang,Peng Zheng,Xuping Xie,Jiang Lin,Yilin Wang,Rui Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Destylization-based data generation with DST-100K enables training a simple model OmniStyle2 that outperforms current style-transfer methods, addressing ground-truth data scarcity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Artistic style transfer suffers from a lack of ground-truth data. The paper argues for authentic supervision signals by reversing style transfer (destylization) to recover content, enabling scalable data generation.

Method: Introduce DST, a text-guided destylization model that reconstructs style-free content; DST-Filter, a multi-stage evaluation with Chain-of-Thought reasoning to discard low-quality pairs while preserving content fidelity and style accuracy; build DST-100K by aligning real artworks with their content; train OmniStyle2 (FLUX-based) on DST-100K.

Result: OmniStyle2, though a simple feed-forward model, surpasses state-of-the-art methods on qualitative and quantitative benchmarks.

Conclusion: Destylization-based data generation offers a scalable and reliable supervision paradigm for artistic style transfer, mitigating ground-truth data scarcity and enabling effective training of simple models.

Abstract: OmniStyle2 introduces a novel approach to artistic style transfer by
reframing it as a data problem. Our key insight is destylization, reversing
style transfer by removing stylistic elements from artworks to recover natural,
style-free counterparts. This yields DST-100K, a large-scale dataset that
provides authentic supervision signals by aligning real artistic styles with
their underlying content. To build DST-100K, we develop (1) DST, a text-guided
destylization model that reconstructs stylefree content, and (2) DST-Filter, a
multi-stage evaluation model that employs Chain-of-Thought reasoning to
automatically discard low-quality pairs while ensuring content fidelity and
style accuracy. Leveraging DST-100K, we train OmniStyle2, a simple feed-forward
model based on FLUX.1-dev. Despite its simplicity, OmniStyle2 consistently
surpasses state-of-the-art methods across both qualitative and quantitative
benchmarks. Our results demonstrate that scalable data generation via
destylization provides a reliable supervision paradigm, overcoming the
fundamental challenge posed by the lack of ground-truth data in artistic style
transfer.

### [73] [ConstStyle: Robust Domain Generalization with Unified Style Transformation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05975)
*Nam Duong Tran,Nam Nguyen Phuong,Hieu H. Pham,Phi Le Nguyen,My T. Thai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ConstStyle uses a unified domain to learn domain-invariant features and align training/testing data, boosting DG robustness especially with few seen domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Domain Generalization suffers from domain shift; existing methods rely on multiple seen domains and struggle with large gaps to unseen domains; a unified-domain strategy aims to bridge this gap.

Method: During training, map all samples to a unified domain optimized for seen domains; during testing, project unseen-domain samples into the same unified domain before prediction; backed by theoretical analysis.

Result: ConstStyle consistently outperforms existing DG methods across diverse scenarios; notably, with limited seen domains, it can improve accuracy by up to 19.82% over the next best method.

Conclusion: Aligning training and testing data in a unified domain reduces domain shifts and enhances DG robustness, including in scenarios with large domain gaps or few seen domains.

Abstract: Deep neural networks often suffer performance drops when test data
distribution differs from training data. Domain Generalization (DG) aims to
address this by focusing on domain-invariant features or augmenting data for
greater diversity. However, these methods often struggle with limited training
domains or significant gaps between seen (training) and unseen (test) domains.
To enhance DG robustness, we hypothesize that it is essential for the model to
be trained on data from domains that closely resemble unseen test domains-an
inherently difficult task due to the absence of prior knowledge about the
unseen domains. Accordingly, we propose ConstStyle, a novel approach that
leverages a unified domain to capture domain-invariant features and bridge the
domain gap with theoretical analysis. During training, all samples are mapped
onto this unified domain, optimized for seen domains. During testing, unseen
domain samples are projected similarly before predictions. By aligning both
training and testing data within this unified domain, ConstStyle effectively
reduces the impact of domain shifts, even with large domain gaps or few seen
domains. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ConstStyle consistently
outperforms existing methods across diverse scenarios. Notably, when only a
limited number of seen domains are available, ConstStyle can boost accuracy up
to 19.82\% compared to the next best approach.

*Zekun Zhou,Yanru Gong,Liu Shi,Qiegen Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A diffusion-based STRIDE framework for sparse-view CT reconstruction that uses temporally reweighted guidance, distribution correction, and a dual-network architecture to achieve state-of-the-art quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sparse-view CT suffers from missing projection data leading to degraded image quality; diffusion models require specialized guidance to handle sparsity and preserve global structure.

Method: Joint training with sparse conditional probabilities; a temporally varying sparse-condition reweighting guidance strategy during progressive denoising; linear regression to correct distributional shifts between known and generated data; a dual-network parallel architecture for global correction across multiple sub-frequency components.

Result: STRIDE attains 2.58 dB PSNR improvement, 2.37% SSIM gain, and 0.236 MSE reduction over top baselines on public and real datasets, with reconstructions showing strong generalization, structural preservation, and artifact suppression.

Conclusion: STRIDE effectively leverages sparsity-aware diffusion guidance and dual-network correction to deliver high-quality sparse-view CT reconstructions, outperforming existing methods in both detail restoration and structural integrity.

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable generative capabilities in
image processing tasks. We propose a Sparse condition Temporal Rewighted
Integrated Distribution Estimation guided diffusion model (STRIDE) for
sparse-view CT reconstruction. Specifically, we design a joint training
mechanism guided by sparse conditional probabilities to facilitate the model
effective learning of missing projection view completion and global information
modeling. Based on systematic theoretical analysis, we propose a temporally
varying sparse condition reweighting guidance strategy to dynamically adjusts
weights during the progressive denoising process from pure noise to the real
image, enabling the model to progressively perceive sparse-view information.
The linear regression is employed to correct distributional shifts between
known and generated data, mitigating inconsistencies arising during the
guidance process. Furthermore, we construct a dual-network parallel
architecture to perform global correction and optimization across multiple
sub-frequency components, thereby effectively improving the model capability in
both detail restoration and structural preservation, ultimately achieving
high-quality image reconstruction. Experimental results on both public and real
datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves the best improvement of
2.58 dB in PSNR, increase of 2.37\% in SSIM, and reduction of 0.236 in MSE
compared to the best-performing baseline methods. The reconstructed images
exhibit excellent generalization and robustness in terms of structural
consistency, detail restoration, and artifact suppression.

*Diana-Alexandra Sas,Florin Oniga*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Inject segmentation priors into feature space to guide monocular 3D detection without adding branches; improves small-object detection on KITTI.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Monocular 3D detection is ill-posed due to lack of depth cues; segmentation priors provide semantic cues to assist depth and geometry estimation.

Method: Decoupled approach: compute segmentation priors beforehand and fuse them into the feature space of an existing detector without changing its architecture or jointly learning priors.

Result: Outperforms RGB-only architectures for small objects (pedestrians, cyclists) on KITTI, showing that leveraging input data understanding can reduce reliance on extra sensors or training data.

Conclusion: Segmentation priors can effectively guide monocular 3D detection without expanding model complexity; useful for improving small-object performance.

Abstract: Monocular 3D Object Detection represents a challenging Computer Vision task
due to the nature of the input used, which is a single 2D image, lacking in any
depth cues and placing the depth estimation problem as an ill-posed one.
Existing solutions leverage the information extracted from the input by using
Convolutional Neural Networks or Transformer architectures as feature
extraction backbones, followed by specific detection heads for 3D parameters
prediction. In this paper, we introduce a decoupled strategy based on injecting
precomputed segmentation information priors and fusing them directly into the
feature space for guiding the detection, without expanding the detection model
or jointly learning the priors. The focus is on evaluating the impact of
additional segmentation information on existing detection pipelines without
adding additional prediction branches. The proposed method is evaluated on the
KITTI 3D Object Detection Benchmark, outperforming the equivalent architecture
that relies only on RGB image features for small objects in the scene:
pedestrians and cyclists, and proving that understanding the input data can
balance the need for additional sensors or training data.

*Jose Sosa,Dan Pineau,Arunkumar Rathinam,Abdelrahman Shabayek,Djamila Aouada*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A motion-aware, ViT-based monocular 6-DoF pose estimator for spacecraft using motion heatmaps and optical flow; improves 2D keypoint localization and PnP-based pose, with cross-dataset generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Leverage temporal information in space operations to improve monocular pose estimation, addressing the limitation of single-image methods that localize keypoints statically.

Method: A deep framework adapted from human pose estimation that combines image features from a Vision Transformer (ViT) encoder with motion cues from a pre-trained optical flow model to localize 2D keypoints via motion-aware heatmaps; estimates 2D keypoints and then recovers 6-DoF poses with a PnP solver using known 2D-3D correspondences; trained and evaluated on SPADES-RGB and tested for generalization on SPARK-2024 (real and synthetic).

Result: Demonstrates improved performance over single-image baselines in both 2D keypoint localization and 6-DoF pose estimation; shows promising generalization when tested on different data distributions (SPARK-2024).

Conclusion: Motion-aware temporal cues integrated with ViT-based features yield more accurate and generalizable spacecraft pose estimates, suggesting practical benefits for real-space missions and robustness to domain shifts.

Abstract: Monocular 6-DoF pose estimation plays an important role in multiple
spacecraft missions. Most existing pose estimation approaches rely on single
images with static keypoint localisation, failing to exploit valuable temporal
information inherent to space operations. In this work, we adapt a deep
learning framework from human pose estimation to the spacecraft pose estimation
domain that integrates motion-aware heatmaps and optical flow to capture motion
dynamics. Our approach combines image features from a Vision Transformer (ViT)
encoder with motion cues from a pre-trained optical flow model to localise 2D
keypoints. Using the estimates, a Perspective-n-Point (PnP) solver recovers
6-DoF poses from known 2D-3D correspondences. We train and evaluate our method
on the SPADES-RGB dataset and further assess its generalisation on real and
synthetic data from the SPARK-2024 dataset. Overall, our approach demonstrates
improved performance over single-image baselines in both 2D keypoint
localisation and 6-DoF pose estimation. Furthermore, it shows promising

*Omkar Prabhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Khana is a large Indian cuisine dataset for image classification, segmentation, and retrieval, with ~131k images across 80 labels, designed to benchmark models and advance Indian-food AI research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Indian cuisine is underrepresented in food image datasets due to regional diversity, complex preparations, and limited labeled data; a taxonomy and a comprehensive benchmark are needed to accelerate research and practical applications.

Method: Construct Khana by establishing a taxonomy of Indian cuisine, collecting and annotating ~131K images across 80 dish labels at 500x500 resolution, and evaluating state-of-the-art models on classification, segmentation, and retrieval as baselines.

Result: Provides a comprehensive, challenging benchmark bridging research and deployment for Indian cuisine; enables robust evaluation of models and potential real-world applications, with baselines demonstrating current capabilities and gaps.

Conclusion: Khana fills the Indian-cuisine data gap and serves as a valuable resource for researchers and developers to advance and deploy food AI across diverse Indian dishes.

Abstract: As global interest in diverse culinary experiences grows, food image models
are essential for improving food-related applications by enabling accurate food
recognition, recipe suggestions, dietary tracking, and automated meal planning.
Despite the abundance of food datasets, a noticeable gap remains in capturing
the nuances of Indian cuisine due to its vast regional diversity, complex
preparations, and the lack of comprehensive labeled datasets that cover its
full breadth. Through this exploration, we uncover Khana, a new benchmark
dataset for food image classification, segmentation, and retrieval of dishes
from Indian cuisine. Khana fills the gap by establishing a taxonomy of Indian
cuisine and offering around 131K images in the dataset spread across 80 labels,
each with a resolution of 500x500 pixels. This paper describes the dataset
creation process and evaluates state-of-the-art models on classification,
segmentation, and retrieval as baselines. Khana bridges the gap between
research and development by providing a comprehensive and challenging benchmark
for researchers while also serving as a valuable resource for developers
creating real-world applications that leverage the rich tapestry of Indian
cuisine. Webpage: https://khana.omkar.xyz

### [78] [BLaVe-CoT: Consistency-Aware Visual Question Answering for Blind and Low Vision Users](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06010)
*Wanyin Cheng,Zanxi Ruan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A VQA framework (BLaVe-CoT) for BLV users that handles ambiguity by generating diverse candidate answers, grounding them spatially, and applying chain-of-thought reasoning to check regional consistency, improving robustness to noisy, poorly framed images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenging real-world VQA for BLV users where questions are ambiguous and multiple image regions could support valid answers; traditional VQA assumes a single ground-truth answer, which is unsuitable for this setting.

Method: 1) Use a LoRA-tuned BLIP-2 to generate diverse candidate answers. 2) Ground each candidate with PolyFormer to localize relevant image regions. 3) Apply a chain-of-thought reasoning module to determine whether different answers refer to the same or distinct regions, thereby handling ambiguity.

Result: On VQA-AnswerTherapy, BLaVe-CoT outperforms prior methods and shows robustness to ambiguity and visual noise typical of assistive scenarios.

Conclusion: Highlights the importance of modeling human uncertainty in VQA and provides a reproducible baseline (code released) to advance inclusive VQA for BLV users.

Abstract: Visual Question Answering (VQA) holds great potential for assisting Blind and
Low Vision (BLV) users, yet real-world usage remains challenging. Due to visual
impairments, BLV users often take blurry or poorly framed photos and face
difficulty in articulating specific questions about what they cannot fully see.
As a result, their visual questions are frequently ambiguous, and different
users may interpret them in diverse ways. This leads to multiple valid answers,
each grounded in different image regions-posing a mismatch with conventional
VQA systems that assume a single answer and region. To bridge this gap, we
present BLaVe-CoT, a VQA framework designed to reason about answer consistency
in the face of ambiguity. Our method proposes diverse candidate answers using a
LoRA-tuned BLIP-2 model, then grounds each answer spatially using PolyFormer,
and finally applies a chain-of-thought reasoning module to assess whether the
answers refer to the same or different regions. Evaluated on the
VQA-AnswerTherapy benchmark, BLaVe-CoT outperforms previous methods and proves
more robust to the ambiguity and visual noise common in assistive settings.
This work highlights the need for VQA systems that can adapt to real human
uncertainty and provide inclusive support for BLV users. To foster further
research and accessibility applications, we have made the code publicly
available at https://github.com/Accecwan/BLaVe-CoT.

*Zhenhai Weng,Zhongliang Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduces UAV-specific open-vocabulary object detection datasets UAVDE-2M and UAVCAP-15k and a Cross-Attention Gated Enhancement (CAGE) module integrated into YOLO-World-v2 to bridge the domain gap between ground-level training data and UAV imagery; validated on VisDrone and SIMD.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a domain gap between widely used ground-level OVD pre-training datasets and UAV imagery, causing performance drops when applied to aerial data. There is a need for UAV-tailored large-scale labeled data and architectures that can handle open vocabulary in the UAV domain.

Method: Refined UAV-Label engine; construction of UAVDE-2M (2,000,000+ instances, ~1,800 categories) and UAVCAP-15k (15,000 images); introduction of Cross-Attention Gated Enhancement Fusion (CAGE) module; integration into the YOLO-World-v2 architecture.

Result: Experimental evaluations on VisDrone and SIMD datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach for UAV-based imagery and remote sensing tasks, indicating improved detection performance in the open-vocabulary setting.

Conclusion: The work addresses the domain gap in UAV open-vocabulary object detection by providing UAV-specific data resources and a cross-attention fusion mechanism, achieving improved performance on aerial datasets and suggesting broader applicability to UAV and remote-sensing contexts.

Abstract: Open-Vocabulary Object Detection (OVD) has emerged as a pivotal technology
for applications involving Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). However, the
prevailing large-scale datasets for OVD pre-training are predominantly composed
of ground-level, natural images. This creates a significant domain gap, causing
models trained on them to exhibit a substantial drop in performance on UAV
imagery. To address this limitation, we first propose a refined UAV-Label
engine. Then we construct and introduce UAVDE-2M(contains over 2,000,000
instances and 1800 categories) and UAVCAP-15k(contains over 15,000 images).
Furthermore, we propose a novel Cross-Attention Gated Enhancement Fusion (CAGE)
module and integrate it into the YOLO-World-v2 architecture. Finally, extensive
experiments on the VisDrone and SIMD datasets verify the effectiveness of our
proposed method for applications in UAV-based imagery and remote sensing.

### [80] [Micro-Expression Recognition via Fine-Grained Dynamic Perception](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06015)
*Zhiwen Shao,Yifan Cheng,Fan Zhang,Xuehuai Shi,Canlin Li,Lizhuang Ma,Dit-yan Yeung*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A fine-grained dynamic perception framework for facial micro-expression recognition that ranks frame-level features over time using a local-global transformer, includes a rank scorer and dynamic image construction to tackle data scarcity; achieves state-of-the-art results on multiple benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MER is extremely challenging due to the transience, subtlety, and dynamics of micro-expressions, and existing methods rely on hand-crafted features (often needing key frames) or deep networks trained on small, non-diverse datasets.

Method: Rank frame-level features in chronological order to encode dynamics. Introduce a local-global feature-aware transformer for frame representation. A rank scorer computes framewise rank scores. Temporal pooling of rank features yields dynamic representation. A shared dynamic representation feeds a MER classifier and an encoder-decoder-based dynamic image construction module, which helps capture subtle actions and mitigates data scarcity.

Result: The approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art MER methods. Reported improvements in F1-score: CASME II +4.05%, SAMM +2.50%, CAS(ME)^2 +7.71%, CAS(ME)^3 +2.11%. Code released at the provided GitHub link.

Conclusion: FDP is effective for MER and for learning a dynamic representation that benefits both verification/recognition and the generation of a dynamic image, addressing data-scarcity issues in micro-expression datasets.

Abstract: Facial micro-expression recognition (MER) is a challenging task, due to the
transience, subtlety, and dynamics of micro-expressions (MEs). Most existing
methods resort to hand-crafted features or deep networks, in which the former
often additionally requires key frames, and the latter suffers from small-scale
and low-diversity training data. In this paper, we develop a novel fine-grained
dynamic perception (FDP) framework for MER. We propose to rank frame-level
features of a sequence of raw frames in chronological order, in which the rank
process encodes the dynamic information of both ME appearances and motions.
Specifically, a novel local-global feature-aware transformer is proposed for
frame representation learning. A rank scorer is further adopted to calculate
rank scores of each frame-level feature. Afterwards, the rank features from
rank scorer are pooled in temporal dimension to capture dynamic representation.
Finally, the dynamic representation is shared by a MER module and a dynamic
image construction module, in which the former predicts the ME category, and
the latter uses an encoder-decoder structure to construct the dynamic image.
The design of dynamic image construction task is beneficial for capturing
facial subtle actions associated with MEs and alleviating the data scarcity
issue. Extensive experiments show that our method (i) significantly outperforms
the state-of-the-art MER methods, and (ii) works well for dynamic image
construction. Particularly, our FDP improves by 4.05%, 2.50%, 7.71%, and 2.11%
over the previous best results in terms of F1-score on the CASME II, SAMM,
CAS(ME)^2, and CAS(ME)^3 datasets, respectively. The code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DVLO4D: sparse spatial-temporal fusion for visual-LiDAR odometry; introduces Sparse Query Fusion, Temporal Interaction and Update, and Temporal Clip Training with Collective Average Loss; reports state-of-the-art results on KITTI and Argoverse with 82 ms inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Visual-LiDAR odometry suffers from sensor misalignment, limited temporal modeling, and manual tuning; need robust, efficient fusion across modalities.

Method: Three innovations: (1) Sparse Query Fusion using sparse LiDAR queries for multi-modal fusion; (2) Temporal Interaction and Update module that integrates temporally-predicted positions with current frame data to improve initialization and robustness; (3) Temporal Clip Training with Collective Average Loss aggregating losses across multiple frames for global optimization and drift reduction.

Result: Experiments on KITTI and Argoverse Odometry show state-of-the-art pose accuracy and robustness; inference time ~82 ms.

Conclusion: DVLO4D delivers high-accuracy, robust visual-LiDAR odometry with efficient inference, addressing misalignment and drift via sparse fusion and temporal strategies.

Abstract: Visual-LiDAR odometry is a critical component for autonomous system
localization, yet achieving high accuracy and strong robustness remains a
challenge. Traditional approaches commonly struggle with sensor misalignment,
fail to fully leverage temporal information, and require extensive manual
tuning to handle diverse sensor configurations. To address these problems, we
introduce DVLO4D, a novel visual-LiDAR odometry framework that leverages sparse
spatial-temporal fusion to enhance accuracy and robustness. Our approach
proposes three key innovations: (1) Sparse Query Fusion, which utilizes sparse
LiDAR queries for effective multi-modal data fusion; (2) a Temporal Interaction
and Update module that integrates temporally-predicted positions with current
frame data, providing better initialization values for pose estimation and
enhancing model's robustness against accumulative errors; and (3) a Temporal
Clip Training strategy combined with a Collective Average Loss mechanism that
aggregates losses across multiple frames, enabling global optimization and
reducing the scale drift over long sequences. Extensive experiments on the
KITTI and Argoverse Odometry dataset demonstrate the superiority of our
proposed DVLO4D, which achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of both
pose accuracy and robustness. Additionally, our method has high efficiency,
with an inference time of 82 ms, possessing the potential for the real-time
deployment.

*Nadia Bakhsheshi,Hamid Beigy*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Three general-purpose VLMs were evaluated on 100 blood report images to test their ability to produce patient-facing interpretations; results are promising but dataset size limits conclusions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To lower patient anxiety and increase health literacy by enabling automatic, image-based interpretation of blood reports using general-purpose VLMs.

Method: Prompt Qwen-VL-Max, Gemini 2.5 Pro, and Llama 4 Maverick with clinically relevant questions on 100 diverse blood report images; compare model answers to a reference via Sentence-BERT similarity.

Result: General-purpose VLMs show potential for clear, interpretable outputs from blood report images; performance is encouraging but varies by model, and evaluation on a small dataset limits generalizability.

Conclusion: General-purpose VLMs can support patient-facing preliminary blood report analysis, but robust validation on larger, diverse datasets and rigorous clinical safety checks are needed before deployment.

Abstract: The reliable analysis of blood reports is important for health knowledge, but
individuals often struggle with interpretation, leading to anxiety and
overlooked issues. We explore the potential of general-purpose Vision-Language
Models (VLMs) to address this challenge by automatically analyzing blood report
images. We conduct a comparative evaluation of three VLMs: Qwen-VL-Max, Gemini
2.5 Pro, and Llama 4 Maverick, determining their performance on a dataset of
100 diverse blood report images. Each model was prompted with clinically
relevant questions adapted to each blood report. The answers were then
processed using Sentence-BERT to compare and evaluate how closely the models
responded. The findings suggest that general-purpose VLMs are a practical and
promising technology for developing patient-facing tools for preliminary blood
report analysis. Their ability to provide clear interpretations directly from
images can improve health literacy and reduce the limitations to understanding
complex medical information. This work establishes a foundation for the future
development of reliable and accessible AI-assisted healthcare applications.
While results are encouraging, they should be interpreted cautiously given the
limited dataset size.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DETR-based TinyDef-DETR for UAV small-defect detection in power grids, featuring stride-free downsampling, edge-aware features, dual-domain multi-scale attention, and a small-object-focused regression loss; achieves strong small-object performance with modest overhead and generalizes to other datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Detecting tiny, ambiguous defects on transmission lines in UAV imagery is hard due to lost details from downsampling, weak boundary cues in lightweight backbones, and insufficient global-local context fusion.

Method: Introduce a stride-free space-to-depth module for lossless downsampling; edge-enhanced convolution for boundary-aware feature extraction; cross-stage dual-domain multi-scale attention to fuse global and local cues; Focaler-Wise-SIoU regression loss to improve small object localization.

Result: On the CSG-ADCD dataset, TinyDef-DETR significantly improves precision and recall, with notable gains on small-object subsets and modest computational overhead; generalizes to VisDrone benchmark.

Conclusion: A combination of detail-preserving downsampling, edge-sensitive representations, dual-domain attention, and difficulty-adaptive regression provides an efficient solution for UAV-based small-defect inspection in power grids.

Abstract: Automated inspection of transmission lines using UAVs is hindered by the
difficulty of detecting small and ambiguous defects against complex
backgrounds. Conventional detectors often suffer from detail loss due to
strided downsampling, weak boundary sensitivity in lightweight backbones, and
insufficient integration of global context with local cues. To address these
challenges, we propose TinyDef-DETR, a DETR-based framework designed for
small-defect detection. The method introduces a stride-free space-to-depth
module for lossless downsampling, an edge-enhanced convolution for
boundary-aware feature extraction, a cross-stage dual-domain multi-scale
attention module to jointly capture global and local information, and a
Focaler-Wise-SIoU regression loss to improve localization of small objects.
Experiments conducted on the CSG-ADCD dataset demonstrate that TinyDef-DETR
achieves substantial improvements in both precision and recall compared to
competitive baselines, with particularly notable gains on small-object subsets,
while incurring only modest computational overhead. Further validation on the
VisDrone benchmark confirms the generalization capability of the proposed
approach. Overall, the results indicate that integrating detail-preserving
downsampling, edge-sensitive representations, dual-domain attention, and
difficulty-adaptive regression provides a practical and efficient solution for
UAV-based small-defect inspection in power grids.

*Yuming Li,Yikai Wang,Yuying Zhu,Zhongyu Zhao,Ming Lu,Qi She,Shanghang Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BranchGRPO introduces a branch sampling policy to accelerate SDE-based alignment of image/video generative models, using shared-prefix computation, a tree-based advantage estimator with dense rewards, and pruning of low-reward paths. It yields substantial compute savings and improved alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current alignment of image/video generative models relies on expensive on-policy rollouts, excessive SDE sampling steps, and sparse rewards, leading to high compute costs and unstable training. There is a need for more efficient, diverse exploration methods that maintain or improve alignment quality.

Method: BranchGRPO updates the sampling process with a branch sampling policy that shares computation across common prefixes, and prunes low-reward paths and redundant depths. It introduces a tree-based advantage estimator that incorporates dense process-level rewards and employs pruning strategies to exploit path and depth redundancy, accelerating convergence and enhancing exploration diversity.

Result: Empirical results show BranchGRPO improves alignment scores by 16% over strong baselines and cuts training time by 50%, while maintaining or improving exploration diversity.

Conclusion: BranchGRPO provides substantial compute savings and improved alignment performance for image and video preference alignment tasks, thanks to branch-based sampling, a tree-based advantage estimator, and effective pruning of redundant paths.

Abstract: Recent advancements in aligning image and video generative models via GRPO
have achieved remarkable gains in enhancing human preference alignment.
However, these methods still face high computational costs from on-policy
rollouts and excessive SDE sampling steps, as well as training instability due
to sparse rewards. In this paper, we propose BranchGRPO, a novel method that
introduces a branch sampling policy updating the SDE sampling process. By
sharing computation across common prefixes and pruning low-reward paths and
redundant depths, BranchGRPO substantially lowers the per-update compute cost
while maintaining or improving exploration diversity. This work makes three
main contributions: (1) a branch sampling scheme that reduces rollout and
training cost; (2) a tree-based advantage estimator incorporating dense
process-level rewards; and (3) pruning strategies exploiting path and depth
redundancy to accelerate convergence and boost performance. Experiments on
image and video preference alignment show that BranchGRPO improves alignment
scores by 16% over strong baselines, while cutting training time by 50%.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome CFD's high computational cost and reliance on expert physics by learning from data, addressing long-range dependencies and irregular mesh handling that challenge conventional GNNs.

Method: A novel multi-stage GNN architecture using hierarchical pooling and unpooling to progressively model global-to-local interactions across multiple spatial scales. Evaluated on a CFD dataset of natural convection in rectangular cavities with varying aspect ratios (bottom hot, top cold, vertical walls adiabatic).

Result: The model achieves higher predictive accuracy, improved training efficiency, and reduced long-term error accumulation compared with state-of-the-art GNN baselines.

Conclusion: The multi-stage GNN approach is promising for modeling complex heat transfer in mesh-based fluid dynamics and can accelerate design iterations in CFD.

Abstract: Buoyancy-driven heat transfer in closed cavities serves as a canonical
testbed for thermal design High-fidelity CFD modelling yields accurate thermal
field solutions, yet its reliance on expert-crafted physics models, fine
meshes, and intensive computation limits rapid iteration. Recent developments
in data-driven modeling, especially Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), offer new
alternatives for learning thermal-fluid behavior directly from simulation data,
particularly on irregular mesh structures. However, conventional GNNs often
struggle to capture long-range dependencies in high-resolution graph
structures. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel multi-stage GNN
architecture that leverages hierarchical pooling and unpooling operations to
progressively model global-to-local interactions across multiple spatial
scales. We evaluate the proposed model on our newly developed CFD dataset
simulating natural convection within a rectangular cavities with varying aspect
ratios where the bottom wall is isothermal hot, the top wall is isothermal
cold, and the two vertical walls are adiabatic. Experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed model achieves higher predictive accuracy,
improved training efficiency, and reduced long-term error accumulation compared
to state-of-the-art (SOTA) GNN baselines. These findings underscore the
potential of the proposed multi-stage GNN approach for modeling complex heat
transfer in mesh-based fluid dynamics simulations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address blurriness and artifacts in tomographic reconstructions of specimens with homogeneous phases separated by sharp interfaces; leverage learned edge information to enforce sharp boundaries while preserving quantitative fidelity.

Method: Train a neural network to detect edges within subpictures; integrate predictions into a mathematical optimization framework that biases solutions toward the learned edges but can still be driven by raw projection data; use priors on homogeneity and sharp edges to suppress blur and artifacts.

Result: Demonstrated significant enhancements in interface sharpness and material homogeneity on experimental datasets compared with benchmark algorithms.

Conclusion: The approach effectively combines learned edge priors with data fidelity to produce higher-quality tomographic reconstructions, showcasing potential for advancing imaging techniques; future work could explore robustness, generalization, and scalability.

Abstract: In this work, we develop a novel technique for reconstructing images from
projection-based nano- and microtomography. Our contribution focuses on
enhancing reconstruction quality, particularly for specimen composed of
homogeneous material phases connected by sharp edges. This is accomplished by
training a neural network to identify edges within subpictures. The trained
network is then integrated into a mathematical optimization model, to reduce
artifacts from previous reconstructions. To this end, the optimization approach
favors solutions according to the learned predictions, however may also
determine alternative solutions if these are strongly supported by the raw
data. Hence, our technique successfully incorporates knowledge about the
homogeneity and presence of sharp edges in the sample and thereby eliminates
blurriness. Our results on experimental datasets show significant enhancements
in interface sharpness and material homogeneity compared to benchmark
algorithms. Thus, our technique produces high-quality reconstructions,
showcasing its potential for advancing tomographic imaging techniques.

*Yiwen Ye,Yicheng Wu,Xiangde Luo,He Zhang,Ziyang Chen,Ting Dang,Yanning Zhang,Yong Xia*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Sequential fine-tuning with MDS sample selection and LoRA-based K&G RFT improves knowledge retention and transfer for multi-task 3D medical image segmentation, achieving average Dice gains (~3.0%) and better performance on unseen tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome parallel fine-tuning's isolation of tasks and multi-task fine-tuning's need for all datasets and difficulty with incremental task addition, by preserving pre-training knowledge while adapting to new tasks.

Method: Two core components: (1) Maximum Data Similarity (MDS) selection to choose downstream samples representative of the pre-training distribution; (2) Knowledge and Generalization Retention Fine-Tuning (K&G RFT), a LoRA-based knowledge distillation approach that balances task-specific adaptation with retention of pre-trained knowledge—applied in a sequential fine-tuning pipeline across 3D segmentation tasks.

Result: MedSeqFT consistently outperforms state-of-the-art fine-tuning strategies across two multi-task datasets covering ten 3D segmentation tasks, with an average Dice improvement of 3.0%. Unseen tasks (COVID-19-20 and Kidney) show enhanced transferability, especially for tumor segmentation. Analyses of loss landscapes and parameter variations support robustness. Code will be released.

Conclusion: Sequential fine-tuning with MDS and K&G RFT is an effective, knowledge-retentive paradigm for adapting foundation models to evolving clinical tasks in medical image segmentation.

Abstract: Foundation models have become a promising paradigm for advancing medical
image analysis, particularly for segmentation tasks where downstream
applications often emerge sequentially. Existing fine-tuning strategies,
however, remain limited: parallel fine-tuning isolates tasks and fails to
exploit shared knowledge, while multi-task fine-tuning requires simultaneous
access to all datasets and struggles with incremental task integration. To
address these challenges, we propose MedSeqFT, a sequential fine-tuning
framework that progressively adapts pre-trained models to new tasks while
refining their representational capacity. MedSeqFT introduces two core
components: (1) Maximum Data Similarity (MDS) selection, which identifies
downstream samples most representative of the original pre-training
distribution to preserve general knowledge, and (2) Knowledge and
Generalization Retention Fine-Tuning (K&G RFT), a LoRA-based knowledge
distillation scheme that balances task-specific adaptation with the retention
of pre-trained knowledge. Extensive experiments on two multi-task datasets
covering ten 3D segmentation tasks demonstrate that MedSeqFT consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art fine-tuning strategies, yielding substantial
performance gains (e.g., an average Dice improvement of 3.0%). Furthermore,
evaluations on two unseen tasks (COVID-19-20 and Kidney) verify that MedSeqFT
enhances transferability, particularly for tumor segmentation. Visual analyses
of loss landscapes and parameter variations further highlight the robustness of
MedSeqFT. These results establish sequential fine-tuning as an effective,
knowledge-retentive paradigm for adapting foundation models to evolving
clinical tasks. Code will be released.

TL;DR: A new pathology-focused benchmark PathoHR-Bench reveals limitations of current vision-language models in hierarchical and compositional reasoning for pathology, and a specialized VL training scheme yields state-of-the-art results on PathoHR-Bench and six other datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pathology images have high structural similarity and subtle variations; interpreting structured pathology reports requires complex cross-modal reasoning; existing vision-language models struggle to capture this in clinical settings.

Method: 1) Introduce PathoHR-Bench to evaluate hierarchical semantic understanding and compositional reasoning in pathology VL tasks. 2) Develop a pathology-specific VL training scheme that creates enhanced and perturbed samples for multimodal contrastive learning.

Result: Existing VL models fail to model intricate cross-modal relationships; the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on PathoHR-Bench and six additional pathology datasets.

Conclusion: This work advances pathology-aware vision-language modeling and cross-modal reasoning, showing improved representation and performance across pathology datasets with potential clinical applicability.

Abstract: Accurate analysis of pathological images is essential for automated tumor
diagnosis but remains challenging due to high structural similarity and subtle
morphological variations in tissue images. Current vision-language (VL) models
often struggle to capture the complex reasoning required for interpreting
structured pathological reports. To address these limitations, we propose
PathoHR-Bench, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate VL models' abilities in
hierarchical semantic understanding and compositional reasoning within the
pathology domain. Results of this benchmark reveal that existing VL models fail
to effectively model intricate cross-modal relationships, hence limiting their
applicability in clinical setting. To overcome this, we further introduce a
pathology-specific VL training scheme that generates enhanced and perturbed
samples for multimodal contrastive learning. Experimental evaluations
demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on
PathoHR-Bench and six additional pathology datasets, highlighting its
effectiveness in fine-grained pathology representation.

### [90] [CARDIE: clustering algorithm on relevant descriptors for image enhancement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06116)
*Giulia Bonino,Luca Alberto Rizzo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Unsupervised color/luminance clustering (CARDIE) yields image groups that align with enhancement tasks better than semantic clusters, enabling improved dataset resampling for tone mapping and denoising.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing image clustering emphasizes semantic categories, which may not capture color/brightness variations relevant to image enhancement. A clustering approach tailored to enhancement-relevant features could improve downstream enhancement algorithms.

Method: Introduce CARDIE, an unsupervised clustering algorithm using color and luminosity features to group images by enhancement-relevant content. Propose a metric to quantify how image enhancement algorithms affect luminance distribution and local variance. Demonstrate that CARDIE clusters correlate better with enhancement effects than semantic-based clusters and show that CARDIE-based resampling improves tone mapping and denoising performance. Release code publicly.

Result: CARDIE produces clusters more correlated with enhancement outcomes than those based on semantic attributes. Using CARDIE-driven resampling of training data for tone mapping and denoising improves algorithm performance. Code is released on GitHub to enable reproducibility.

Conclusion: Unsupervised, enhancement-focused clustering of images in color/luminance space yields more task-relevant groups and a practical method for improving image enhancement pipelines via targeted dataset resampling.

Abstract: Automatic image clustering is a cornerstone of computer vision, yet its
application to image enhancement remains limited, primarily due to the
difficulty of defining clusters that are meaningful for this specific task. To
address this issue, we introduce CARDIE, an unsupervised algorithm that
clusters images based on their color and luminosity content. In addition, we
introduce a method to quantify the impact of image enhancement algorithms on
luminance distribution and local variance. Using this method, we demonstrate
that CARDIE produces clusters more relevant to image enhancement than those
derived from semantic image attributes. Furthermore, we demonstrate that CARDIE
clusters can be leveraged to resample image enhancement datasets, leading to
improved performance for tone mapping and denoising algorithms. To encourage
adoption and ensure reproducibility, we publicly release CARDIE code on our
GitHub.

### [91] [SpecSwin3D: Generating Hyperspectral Imagery from Multispectral Data via Transformer Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06122)
*Tang Sui,Songxi Yang,Qunying Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SpecSwin3D uses a transformer to generate hyperspectral imagery from multispectral inputs, with cascade training and optimized band sequencing to improve spatial-spectral fidelity; achieves state-of-the-art metrics and enables downstream tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the fundamental trade-off between spatial and spectral resolution in MS/Hyperspectral data and the limitations of prior methods in jointly preserving spatial detail and spectral fidelity.

Method: Proposes SpecSwin3D, a 3D shifted-window transformer that takes five multispectral bands and reconstructs 224 hyperspectral bands at the same resolution; introduces cascade training to gradually expand spectral range; designs an optimized band sequence that repeats and orders input bands to capture pairwise relations.

Result: Quantitative metrics: PSNR 35.82 dB, SAM 2.40 degrees, SSIM 0.96; outperforms baseline MHF-Net by +5.6 dB PSNR and halves ERGAS; validates usefulness on land use classification and burnt area segmentation.

Conclusion: SpecSwin3D effectively preserves spatial and spectral quality and demonstrates practical applicability; cascade training and band sequencing contribute to learning stability and fidelity; potential for broader remote sensing tasks.

Abstract: Multispectral and hyperspectral imagery are widely used in agriculture,
environmental monitoring, and urban planning due to their complementary spatial
and spectral characteristics. A fundamental trade-off persists: multispectral
imagery offers high spatial but limited spectral resolution, while
hyperspectral imagery provides rich spectra at lower spatial resolution. Prior
hyperspectral generation approaches (e.g., pan-sharpening variants, matrix
factorization, CNNs) often struggle to jointly preserve spatial detail and
spectral fidelity. In response, we propose SpecSwin3D, a transformer-based
model that generates hyperspectral imagery from multispectral inputs while
preserving both spatial and spectral quality. Specifically, SpecSwin3D takes
five multispectral bands as input and reconstructs 224 hyperspectral bands at
the same spatial resolution. In addition, we observe that reconstruction errors
grow for hyperspectral bands spectrally distant from the input bands. To
address this, we introduce a cascade training strategy that progressively
expands the spectral range to stabilize learning and improve fidelity.
Moreover, we design an optimized band sequence that strategically repeats and
orders the five selected multispectral bands to better capture pairwise
relations within a 3D shifted-window transformer framework. Quantitatively, our
model achieves a PSNR of 35.82 dB, SAM of 2.40{\deg}, and SSIM of 0.96,
outperforming the baseline MHF-Net by +5.6 dB in PSNR and reducing ERGAS by
more than half. Beyond reconstruction, we further demonstrate the practical
value of SpecSwin3D on two downstream tasks, including land use classification
and burnt area segmentation.

### [92] [RetinaGuard: Obfuscating Retinal Age in Fundus Images for Biometric Privacy Preserving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06142)
*Zhengquan Luo,Chi Liu,Dongfu Xiao,Zhen Yu,Yueye Wang,Tianqing Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RetinaGuard—a privacy-preserving framework that obfuscates retinal age prediction from fundus images using feature-level GAN masking and multi-encoder knowledge distillation, preserving diagnostic utility while blocking biometric leakage; extendable to other biomarkers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Retinal age inferred from fundus images can indicate systemic risks and mortality, creating privacy risks of biometric data leakage from medical images; there is a need to prevent sensitive biomarker inference without harming clinical usefulness.

Method: A feature-level generative adversarial masking mechanism obscures retinal age in fundus images. It employs a multiple-to-one knowledge distillation strategy combining a retinal foundation model and diverse surrogate age encoders to defend against black-box age predictors.

Result: RetinaGuard successfully obfuscates retinal age predictions with minimal degradation to image quality and preservation of pathological features; adaptable to other biomarkers.

Conclusion: The framework provides a practical privacy-preserving solution for medical imaging biometrics, offering universal defense against age-predictors and extending to other biomarkers.

Abstract: The integration of AI with medical images enables the extraction of implicit
image-derived biomarkers for a precise health assessment. Recently, retinal
age, a biomarker predicted from fundus images, is a proven predictor of
systemic disease risks, behavioral patterns, aging trajectory and even
mortality. However, the capability to infer such sensitive biometric data
raises significant privacy risks, where unauthorized use of fundus images could
lead to bioinformation leakage, breaching individual privacy. In response, we
formulate a new research problem of biometric privacy associated with medical
images and propose RetinaGuard, a novel privacy-enhancing framework that
employs a feature-level generative adversarial masking mechanism to obscure
retinal age while preserving image visual quality and disease diagnostic
utility. The framework further utilizes a novel multiple-to-one knowledge
distillation strategy incorporating a retinal foundation model and diverse
surrogate age encoders to enable a universal defense against black-box age
prediction models. Comprehensive evaluations confirm that RetinaGuard
successfully obfuscates retinal age prediction with minimal impact on image
quality and pathological feature representation. RetinaGuard is also flexible
for extension to other medical image derived biomarkers. RetinaGuard is also
flexible for extension to other medical image biomarkers.

*Duomin Wang,Wei Zuo,Aojie Li,Ling-Hao Chen,Xinyao Liao,Deyu Zhou,Zixin Yin,Xili Dai,Daxin Jiang,Gang Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UniVerse-1 is a unified audio-video generator that stitches pre-trained video and music models to produce coordinated AV content, using an online annotation pipeline for alignment, finetuned on ~7.6k hours, and paired with Verse-Bench for evaluation; code and model are publicly released.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcoming training inefficiency and misalignment in joint audio-video generation by reusing strong pre-trained specialists and avoiding scratch training, while ensuring accurate temporal alignment between audio (ambient sounds and speech) and video.

Method: Use a stitching-of-experts (SoE) approach to deeply fuse blocks from pre-trained video and music generators; implement an online annotation pipeline that generates training labels during training to ensure proper ambient and speech alignment; finetune on ~7,600 hours of audio-video data; introduce Verse-Bench for systematic evaluation; publicly release model and code.

Result: The model yields well-coordinated ambient sound generation and strong speech alignment, approaching state-of-the-art performance and narrowing the gap to Veo3 on AV generation tasks; evaluation is supported by the Verse-Bench benchmark.

Conclusion: UniVerse-1, along with Verse-Bench and public release, aims to accelerate AV generation research by leveraging existing specialized models and ensuring precise temporal annotations, enabling more efficient training and potentially better coordination between audio and video.

Abstract: We introduce UniVerse-1, a unified, Veo-3-like model capable of
simultaneously generating coordinated audio and video. To enhance training
efficiency, we bypass training from scratch and instead employ a stitching of
experts (SoE) technique. This approach deeply fuses the corresponding blocks of
pre-trained video and music generation experts models, thereby fully leveraging
their foundational capabilities. To ensure accurate annotations and temporal
alignment for both ambient sounds and speech with video content, we developed
an online annotation pipeline that processes the required training data and
generates labels during training process. This strategy circumvents the
performance degradation often caused by misalignment text-based annotations.
Through the synergy of these techniques, our model, after being finetuned on
approximately 7,600 hours of audio-video data, produces results with
well-coordinated audio-visuals for ambient sounds generation and strong
alignment for speech generation. To systematically evaluate our proposed
method, we introduce Verse-Bench, a new benchmark dataset. In an effort to
advance research in audio-video generation and to close the performance gap
with state-of-the-art models such as Veo3, we make our model and code publicly
available. We hope this contribution will benefit the broader research
community. Project page: https://dorniwang.github.io/UniVerse-1/.

### [94] [UNO: Unifying One-stage Video Scene Graph Generation via Object-Centric Visual Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06165)
*Huy Le,Nhat Chung,Tung Kieu,Jingkang Yang,Ngan Le*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UNO is a single-stage, unified object-centric VidSGG framework that jointly handles box-level and pixel-level tasks using extended slot attention, temporal consistency, and dynamic triplet prediction, achieving competitive results with improved efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To unify coarse- and fine-grained VidSGG into a single architecture, reducing task-specific design and training complexity while enhancing generalization and efficiency.

Method: Extend slot attention to decompose features into object and relation slots; introduce object temporal consistency learning across frames without explicit tracking; implement dynamic triplet prediction linking relation slots to object pairs to model evolving interactions; train end-to-end in a single-stage framework with shared parameters.

Result: Competitive performance on standard box-level and pixel-level VidSGG benchmarks; improved efficiency due to single-stage, unified design and reduced task-specific modules.

Conclusion: A unified, single-stage object-centric approach is viable for multi-granularity VidSGG, with temporal consistency and dynamic relation modeling enabling robust cross-task generalization.

Abstract: Video Scene Graph Generation (VidSGG) aims to represent dynamic visual
content by detecting objects and modeling their temporal interactions as
structured graphs. Prior studies typically target either coarse-grained
box-level or fine-grained panoptic pixel-level VidSGG, often requiring
task-specific architectures and multi-stage training pipelines. In this paper,
we present UNO (UNified Object-centric VidSGG), a single-stage, unified
framework that jointly addresses both tasks within an end-to-end architecture.
UNO is designed to minimize task-specific modifications and maximize parameter
sharing, enabling generalization across different levels of visual granularity.
The core of UNO is an extended slot attention mechanism that decomposes visual
features into object and relation slots. To ensure robust temporal modeling, we
introduce object temporal consistency learning, which enforces consistent
object representations across frames without relying on explicit tracking
modules. Additionally, a dynamic triplet prediction module links relation slots
to corresponding object pairs, capturing evolving interactions over time. We
evaluate UNO on standard box-level and pixel-level VidSGG benchmarks. Results
demonstrate that UNO not only achieves competitive performance across both
tasks but also offers improved efficiency through a unified, object-centric
design.

*Amna Hassan,Ilsa Afzaal,Nouman Muneeb,Aneeqa Batool,Hamail Noor*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A lightweight CNN detects fractures in X-ray images with high accuracy on the FracAtlas dataset, outperforming transfer learning baselines in this setup. Emphasizes potential for low-resource settings, but results may be affected by class imbalance and dataset limitations; external validation is needed for clinical translation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fracture localization/detection on X-rays is a critical need in low-resource settings where access to expert radiology is limited; AI can reduce costs, radiation exposure, and dependency on specialized interpretation.

Method: Developed a custom CNN for fracture detection on X-ray images and benchmarked it against transfer learning models (EfficientNetB0, MobileNetV2, ResNet50) using the FracAtlas dataset (4,083 radiographs). Evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Result: Custom CNN achieved 95.96% accuracy, 0.94 precision, 0.88 recall, and 0.91 F1-score on FracAtlas. Transfer learning models performed poorly in this setup, though interpretation is tempered by class imbalance and data limitations.

Conclusion: Lightweight CNNs show promise for automated fracture detection in X-rays, but fair benchmarking, diverse datasets, and external validation are essential for clinical translation.

Abstract: Bone fractures present a major global health challenge, often resulting in
pain, reduced mobility, and productivity loss, particularly in low-resource
settings where access to expert radiology services is limited. Conventional
imaging methods suffer from high costs, radiation exposure, and dependency on
specialized interpretation. To address this, we developed an AI-based solution
for automated fracture detection from X-ray images using a custom Convolutional
Neural Network (CNN) and benchmarked it against transfer learning models
including EfficientNetB0, MobileNetV2, and ResNet50. Training was conducted on
the publicly available FracAtlas dataset, comprising 4,083 anonymized
musculoskeletal radiographs. The custom CNN achieved 95.96% accuracy, 0.94
precision, 0.88 recall, and an F1-score of 0.91 on the FracAtlas dataset.
Although transfer learning models (EfficientNetB0, MobileNetV2, ResNet50)
performed poorly in this specific setup, these results should be interpreted in
light of class imbalance and data set limitations. This work highlights the
promise of lightweight CNNs for detecting fractures in X-rays and underscores
the importance of fair benchmarking, diverse datasets, and external validation
for clinical translation

### [96] [Exploring Light-Weight Object Recognition for Real-Time Document Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06246)
*Lucas Wojcik,Luiz Coelho,Roger Granada,David Menotti*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: An efficient, real-time document detection/rectification pipeline tailored for OCR: adapt a lightweight detector (IWPOD-Net) to NBID synthetic IDs, augment data, and validate cross-dataset with MIDV; shows smaller, faster models can achieve competitive OCR quality without perfect rectification; code released.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bridge the gap between high accuracy and real-time efficiency in document detection/rectification for OCR-based information retrieval; existing work focuses on large models or efficiency, but real-time pipelines for document rectification are underexplored.

Method: Adapt IWPOD-Net (license plate detector) for document corner detection on NBID synthetic ID cards; apply data augmentation; perform cross-dataset validation with MIDV; compare with state-of-the-art object recognition and skew estimation methods; rectify detected documents, run OCR, and evaluate OCR results using a Levenshtein-based metric.

Result: The proposed model is smaller and more efficient than current state-of-the-art methods while achieving competitive OCR quality; perfect rectification is not required to attain strong OCR performance; cross-dataset validation helps identify optimal configuration; code is released.

Conclusion: A lightweight, real-time document detection/rectification pipeline can deliver competitive OCR performance with reduced computational cost, demonstrating the viability of efficient models for practical automatic information retrieval from visual documents.

Abstract: Object Recognition and Document Skew Estimation have come a long way in terms
of performance and efficiency. New models follow one of two directions:
improving performance using larger models, and improving efficiency using
smaller models. However, real-time document detection and rectification is a
niche that is largely unexplored by the literature, yet it remains a vital step
for automatic information retrieval from visual documents. In this work, we
strive towards an efficient document detection pipeline that is satisfactory in
terms of Optical Character Recognition (OCR) retrieval and faster than other
available solutions. We adapt IWPOD-Net, a license plate detection network, and
train it for detection on NBID, a synthetic ID card dataset. We experiment with
data augmentation and cross-dataset validation with MIDV (another synthetic ID
and passport document dataset) to find the optimal scenario for the model.
Other methods from both the Object Recognition and Skew Estimation
state-of-the-art are evaluated for comparison with our approach. We use each
method to detect and rectify the document, which is then read by an OCR system.
The OCR output is then evaluated using a novel OCR quality metric based on the
Levenshtein distance. Since the end goal is to improve automatic information
retrieval, we use the overall OCR quality as a performance metric. We observe
that with a promising model, document rectification does not have to be perfect
to attain state-of-the-art performance scores. We show that our model is
smaller and more efficient than current state-of-the-art solutions while
retaining a competitive OCR quality metric. All code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes Ego3D-Bench for ego-centric, multi-view outdoor spatial reasoning of VLMs and Ego3D-VLM post-training to enhance 3D spatial understanding; reports improvements and a noticeable gap to human performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLMs struggle with 3D spatial relations in real-world, ego-centric multi-view data; need benchmarks and methods to close the gap.

Method: Construct Ego3D-Bench with 8,600+ QA pairs from ego-centric outdoor multi-view data; benchmark 16 SOTA VLMs; propose Ego3D-VLM post-training that builds a cognitive map from estimated global 3D coordinates; modular augmentation to existing VLMs.

Result: Humans outperform VLMs; Ego3D-VLM yields 12% average improvement on multi-choice QA and 56% on absolute distance estimation; dataset and method are modular.

Conclusion: Ego3D-Bench and Ego3D-VLM advance toward human-level 3D spatial understanding in real-world, multi-view settings and provide tools to bridge the gap.

Abstract: Understanding 3D spatial relationships remains a major limitation of current
Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Prior work has addressed this issue by creating
spatial question-answering (QA) datasets based on single images or indoor
videos. However, real-world embodied AI agents such as robots and self-driving
cars typically rely on ego-centric, multi-view observations. To this end, we
introduce Ego3D-Bench, a new benchmark designed to evaluate the spatial
reasoning abilities of VLMs using ego-centric, multi-view outdoor data.
Ego3D-Bench comprises over 8,600 QA pairs, created with significant involvement
from human annotators to ensure quality and diversity. We benchmark 16 SOTA
VLMs, including GPT-4o, Gemini1.5-Pro, InternVL3, and Qwen2.5-VL. Our results
reveal a notable performance gap between human level scores and VLM
performance, highlighting that current VLMs still fall short of human level
spatial understanding. To bridge this gap, we propose Ego3D-VLM, a
post-training framework that enhances 3D spatial reasoning of VLMs. Ego3D-VLM
generates cognitive map based on estimated global 3D coordinates, resulting in
12% average improvement on multi-choice QA and 56% average improvement on
absolute distance estimation. Ego3D-VLM is modular and can be integrated with
any existing VLM. Together, Ego3D-Bench and Ego3D-VLM offer valuable tools for
advancing toward human level spatial understanding in real-world, multi-view
environments.

*Cecelia Soh,Rizhao Cai,Monalisha Paul,Dennis Sng,Alex Kot*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A transformer-based framework to estimate skin hydration and TEWL from selfies, addressing data imbalance with symmetric-based contrastive regularization; first remote assessment of skin barrier without physical instruments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Skin barrier integrity is crucial; SH and TEWL are key indicators; traditional measures require clinic instruments; need accessible remote monitoring for health and skincare.

Method: Data collection for SH/TEWL; preprocessing; Skin-Prior Adaptive Vision Transformer for SH/TEWL regression; symmetric-based contrastive regularization to mitigate annotation imbalance.

Result: Experiments show the approach can predict SH/TEWL from selfie images; the regularization reduces model bias due to imbalance; provides first demonstration of remote skin assessment without physical measurements.

Conclusion: This work bridges computer vision and dermatology, enabling AI-driven accessible skin analysis; potential for broader real-world applications in personal care and health monitoring.

Abstract: Skin health and disease resistance are closely linked to the skin barrier
function, which protects against environmental factors and water loss. Two key
physiological indicators can quantitatively represent this barrier function:
skin hydration (SH) and trans-epidermal water loss (TEWL). Measurement of SH
and TEWL is valuable for the public to monitor skin conditions regularly,
diagnose dermatological issues, and personalize their skincare regimens.
However, these measurements are not easily accessible to general users unless
they visit a dermatology clinic with specialized instruments. To tackle this
problem, we propose a systematic solution to estimate SH and TEWL from selfie
facial images remotely with smartphones. Our solution encompasses multiple
stages, including SH/TEWL data collection, data preprocessing, and formulating
a novel Skin-Prior Adaptive Vision Transformer model for SH/TEWL regression.
Through experiments, we identified the annotation imbalance of the SH/TEWL data
and proposed a symmetric-based contrastive regularization to reduce the model
bias due to the imbalance effectively. This work is the first study to explore
skin assessment from selfie facial images without physical measurements. It
bridges the gap between computer vision and skin care research, enabling
AI-driven accessible skin analysis for broader real-world applications.

### [99] [Prototype-Aware Multimodal Alignment for Open-Vocabulary Visual Grounding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06291)
*Jiangnan Xie,Xiaolong Zheng,Liang Zheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A prototype-aware, multimodal framework (PAML) for visual grounding that improves open-vocabulary recognition by aligning vision-language representations, discriminative visual encoding, and semantic prototypes, using a multi-stage decoder; achieves state-of-the-art results in open-vocabulary VG and competitive performance in standard VG.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Open-vocabulary VG suffers from misalignment between visual and linguistic modalities, insufficient cross-modal feature fusion, and underutilization of semantic prototype information; current transformer-based methods excel in standard scenes but struggle with novel object categories during testing.

Method: 1) Use ALBEF to establish robust cross-modal alignment during initial feature encoding. 2) Visual Discriminative Feature Encoder enhances salience of object representations while suppressing irrelevant visual context. 3) Prototype discovering and inheriting mechanism extracts and aggregates multi-neighbor semantic prototypes to facilitate open-vocabulary recognition. 4) Multi-stage Decoder enables comprehensive multimodal integration and final bounding box regression. 5) Validation on five benchmark datasets demonstrates competitive standard VG performance and state-of-the-art open-vocabulary VG. Code available at the provided GitHub link.

Result: Competitive performance in standard scene; state-of-the-art results in open-vocabulary scene across five benchmarks; code released.

Conclusion: PAML addresses the key challenges of cross-modal alignment, feature fusion, and semantic prototype utilization, improving open-vocabulary visual grounding and showing strong potential for generalization and future enhancement.

Abstract: Visual Grounding (VG) aims to utilize given natural language queries to
locate specific target objects within images. While current transformer-based
approaches demonstrate strong localization performance in standard scene (i.e,
scenarios without any novel objects), they exhibit notable limitations in
open-vocabulary scene (i.e, both familiar and novel object categories during
testing). These limitations primarily stem from three key factors: (1)
imperfect alignment between visual and linguistic modalities, (2) insufficient
cross-modal feature fusion, and (3) ineffective utilization of semantic
prototype information. To overcome these challenges, we present Prototype-Aware
Multimodal Learning (PAML), an innovative framework that systematically
addresses these issues through several key components: First, we leverage ALBEF
to establish robust cross-modal alignment during initial feature encoding.
Subsequently, our Visual Discriminative Feature Encoder selectively enhances
salient object representations while suppressing irrelevant visual context. The
framework then incorporates a novel prototype discovering and inheriting
mechanism that extracts and aggregates multi-neighbor semantic prototypes to
facilitate open-vocabulary recognition. These enriched features undergo
comprehensive multimodal integration through our Multi-stage Decoder before
final bounding box regression. Extensive experiments across five benchmark
datasets validate our approach, showing competitive performance in standard
scene while achieving state-of-the-art results in open-vocabulary scene. Our
code is available at https://github.com/plankXie/PAML.

*Zhang Jing,Pu Nan,Xie Yu Xiang,Guo Yanming,Lu Qianqi,Zou Shiwei,Yan Jie,Chen Yan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes Video-GCD, a video extension of Generalized Category Discovery, and MCCL—a memory-guided, consistency-aware contrastive learning framework with CACL and MGRE—to exploit temporal-spatial cues; introduces a new Video-GCD benchmark and reports strong improvements over image-based GCD baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) has focused on static images. Videos offer rich temporal information but present open-world discovery challenges. The work aims to leverage temporal dynamics to improve novel-category discovery in videos.

Method: MCCL框架 with two components: (1) Consistency-Aware Contrastive Learning (CACL): uses multiperspective temporal features to estimate consistency scores among unlabeled instances and weights the contrastive loss accordingly. (2) Memory-Guided Representation Enhancement (MGRE): employs a dual-level memory buffer storing both feature-level and logit-level representations to provide global context, improving intra-class compactness and inter-class separability; forms a feedback loop between representation learning and consistency modeling.

Result: New Video-GCD benchmark created, including action recognition and bird classification datasets. Extensive experiments show the proposed MCCL method substantially outperforms competitive image-based GCD methods adapted to video, demonstrating the value of temporal information for discovering novel categories in video data.

Conclusion: Temporal information is crucial for Video-GCD. The MCCL framework effectively leverages temporal cues via CACL and MGRE, and the mutual reinforcement between consistency modeling and representation learning yields strong performance; the authors will release code.

Abstract: Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) is an emerging and challenging
open-world problem that has garnered increasing attention in recent years. Most
existing GCD methods focus on discovering categories in static images. However,
relying solely on static visual content is often insufficient to reliably
discover novel categories. To bridge this gap, we extend the GCD problem to the
video domain and introduce a new setting, termed Video-GCD. Thus, effectively
integrating multi-perspective information across time is crucial for accurate
Video-GCD. To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel Memory-guided
Consistency-aware Contrastive Learning (MCCL) framework, which explicitly
captures temporal-spatial cues and incorporates them into contrastive learning
through a consistency-guided voting mechanism. MCCL consists of two core
components: Consistency-Aware Contrastive Learning(CACL) and Memory-Guided
Representation Enhancement (MGRE). CACL exploits multiperspective temporal
features to estimate consistency scores between unlabeled instances, which are
then used to weight the contrastive loss accordingly. MGRE introduces a
dual-level memory buffer that maintains both feature-level and logit-level
representations, providing global context to enhance intra-class compactness
and inter-class separability. This in turn refines the consistency estimation
in CACL, forming a mutually reinforcing feedback loop between representation
learning and consistency modeling. To facilitate a comprehensive evaluation, we
construct a new and challenging Video-GCD benchmark, which includes action
recognition and bird classification video datasets. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms competitive GCD
approaches adapted from image-based settings, highlighting the importance of
temporal information for discovering novel categories in videos. The code will
be publicly available.

*Mengcheng Lan,Chaofeng Chen,Jiaxing Xu,Zongrui Li,Yiping Ke,Xudong Jiang,Yingchen Yu,Yunqing Zhao,Song Bai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Text-driven segmentation for Multimodal LLMs using semantic descriptors. From image-wise patch-aligned descriptors to box-wise semantic bricks, enhanced by Row-wise Run-Length Encoding (R-RLE). The Text4Seg framework (and its refinement Text4Seg++) achieves state-of-the-art results on natural and remote sensing data without task-specific fine-tuning, while improving efficiency and maintaining compatibility with existing LLM backbones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Integrating image segmentation into Multimodal LLMs remains challenging due to reliance on additional decoders and separate segmentation heads. A unified, text-based representation—casting segmentation as text generation—promises simplicity, scalability, and seamless integration with language models.

Method: Introduce semantic descriptors that map each image patch to a text label. Start with image-wise descriptors aligned to patches and employ Row-wise Run-Length Encoding (R-RLE) to compress repeated sequences, reducing descriptor length by 74% and speeding up inference by 3x. Build Text4Seg around this representation. Further develop box-wise descriptors using bounding boxes and structured tokens called semantic bricks, enabling a next-brick prediction objective in Text4Seg++.

Result: Text4Seg achieves strong segmentation across diverse vision tasks without task-specific fine-tuning. Text4Seg++ consistently outperforms state-of-the-art models on natural and remote sensing datasets, with efficiency gains (less text, faster inference) and full compatibility with existing MLLM backbones.

Conclusion: Text-driven image segmentation within MLLMs is effective, scalable, and generalizable. The proposed semantic-descriptor framework (image-wise and box-wise) offers a compact, efficient, and high-performing alternative to decoder-heavy segmentation approaches, evidencing broad applicability across domains.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown exceptional capabilities
in vision-language tasks. However, effectively integrating image segmentation
into these models remains a significant challenge. In this work, we propose a
novel text-as-mask paradigm that casts image segmentation as a text generation
problem, eliminating the need for additional decoders and significantly
simplifying the segmentation process. Our key innovation is semantic
descriptors, a new textual representation of segmentation masks where each
image patch is mapped to its corresponding text label. We first introduce
image-wise semantic descriptors, a patch-aligned textual representation of
segmentation masks that integrates naturally into the language modeling
pipeline. To enhance efficiency, we introduce the Row-wise Run-Length Encoding
(R-RLE), which compresses redundant text sequences, reducing the length of
semantic descriptors by 74% and accelerating inference by $3\times$, without
compromising performance. Building upon this, our initial framework Text4Seg
achieves strong segmentation performance across a wide range of vision tasks.
To further improve granularity and compactness, we propose box-wise semantic
descriptors, which localizes regions of interest using bounding boxes and
represents region masks via structured mask tokens called semantic bricks. This
leads to our refined model, Text4Seg++, which formulates segmentation as a
next-brick prediction task, combining precision, scalability, and generative
efficiency. Comprehensive experiments on natural and remote sensing datasets
show that Text4Seg++ consistently outperforms state-of-the-art models across
diverse benchmarks without any task-specific fine-tuning, while remaining
compatible with existing MLLM backbones. Our work highlights the effectiveness,
scalability, and generalizability of text-driven image segmentation within the
MLLM framework.

*Ruiming Du,Guangxun Zhai,Tian Qiu,Yu Jiang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A comprehensive survey and benchmarking framework for 3D plant segmentation, addressing data scarcity, model adaptation, and benchmark standardization, with findings favoring sparse convolutions, transformers, and sim-to-real data strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To advance 3D plant phenotyping by enabling accurate, scalable segmentation of plant point clouds through data-efficient learning and reproducible benchmarks.

Method: Systematically review existing 3D plant datasets in general 3D segmentation contexts; summarize deep learning methods for point cloud semantic and instance segmentation; introduce Plant Segmentation Studio (PSS) as an open-source, reproducible benchmarking framework; perform extensive quantitative experiments to compare networks and sim-to-real strategies.

Conclusion: The work bridges algorithmic advances and practical deployment in 3D plant phenotyping, providing a usable toolkit and a roadmap for data-efficient, generalizable segmentation approaches.

Abstract: The precise characterization of plant morphology provides valuable insights
into plant environment interactions and genetic evolution. A key technology for
extracting this information is 3D segmentation, which delineates individual
plant organs from complex point clouds. Despite significant progress in general
3D computer vision domains, the adoption of 3D segmentation for plant
phenotyping remains limited by three major challenges: i) the scarcity of
large-scale annotated datasets, ii) technical difficulties in adapting advanced
deep neural networks to plant point clouds, and iii) the lack of standardized
benchmarks and evaluation protocols tailored to plant science. This review
systematically addresses these barriers by: i) providing an overview of
existing 3D plant datasets in the context of general 3D segmentation domains,
ii) systematically summarizing deep learning-based methods for point cloud
semantic and instance segmentation, iii) introducing Plant Segmentation Studio
(PSS), an open-source framework for reproducible benchmarking, and iv)
conducting extensive quantitative experiments to evaluate representative
networks and sim-to-real learning strategies. Our findings highlight the
efficacy of sparse convolutional backbones and transformer-based instance
segmentation, while also emphasizing the complementary role of modeling-based
and augmentation-based synthetic data generation for sim-to-real learning in
reducing annotation demands. In general, this study bridges the gap between
algorithmic advances and practical deployment, providing immediate tools for
researchers and a roadmap for developing data-efficient and generalizable deep
learning solutions in 3D plant phenotyping. Data and code are available at

*Md Sultanul Islam Ovi,Mainul Hossain,Md Badsha Biswas*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Unified, lightweight currency evaluation framework combining denomination classification (Custom_CNN), damage quantification via UCDI, and counterfeit detection through template matching, validated on 82k images with real-time on-device performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address usability and authenticity assessment gaps in currency recognition, especially in low-resource settings with visually impaired users and offline validation, and to handle degradation and forgery not covered by existing denomination classifiers.

Method: Three modules: lightweight CNN for denomination; Unified Currency Damage Index (UCDI) combining binary mask loss, chromatic distortion, and structural feature loss for damage assessment; feature-based template matching for counterfeit detection; dataset of 82k annotated images (clean, damaged, counterfeit); aims for real-time on-device inference.

Result: Custom_CNN achieves high classification performance with low parameter count; UCDI provides a continuous usability score; counterfeit detection robust across varied imaging conditions; framework enables accurate, interpretable, compact currency evaluation suitable for constrained environments.

Conclusion: A cohesive, on-device framework that unifies usability, damage, and authenticity assessment for currency, enabling inclusive, real-world deployment in low-resource settings.

Abstract: Currency recognition systems often overlook usability and authenticity
assessment, especially in low-resource environments where visually impaired
users and offline validation are common. While existing methods focus on
denomination classification, they typically ignore physical degradation and
forgery, limiting their applicability in real-world conditions. This paper
presents a unified framework for currency evaluation that integrates three
modules: denomination classification using lightweight CNN models, damage
quantification through a novel Unified Currency Damage Index (UCDI), and
counterfeit detection using feature-based template matching. The dataset
consists of over 82,000 annotated images spanning clean, damaged, and
counterfeit notes. Our Custom_CNN model achieves high classification
performance with low parameter count. The UCDI metric provides a continuous
usability score based on binary mask loss, chromatic distortion, and structural
feature loss. The counterfeit detection module demonstrates reliable
identification of forged notes across varied imaging conditions. The framework
supports real-time, on-device inference and addresses key deployment challenges
in constrained environments. Results show that accurate, interpretable, and
compact solutions can support inclusive currency evaluation in practical
settings.

### [104] [Harnessing Object Grounding for Time-Sensitive Video Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06335)
*Tz-Ying Wu,Sharath Nittur Sridhar,Subarna Tripathi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GO-Tokenizer adds a lightweight, compact object encoding to video-LLMs to improve time-sensitive video understanding without inflating prompts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Time-sensitive video understanding (TSV) tasks can benefit from grounding within frames by objects; while describing objects in text helps, it increases token length and introduces noise.

Method: Introduce GO-Tokenizer which uses off-the-shelf object detectors to encode compact object information on the fly for Video-LLMs; pretrained with GO-Tokenizer and evaluated on LITA, across tasks such as temporal localization and dense captioning.

Result: GO-Tokenizer-based pretraining outperforms vanilla Video-LLMs and approaches using textual object descriptions, with results generalizing across models, datasets, and tasks.

Conclusion: Grounded object encoding via GO-Tokenizer improves TSV in Video-LLMs by providing compact, robust object information, reducing prompt length and noise while enhancing performance across tasks and models.

Abstract: We propose to improve the time-sensitive video understanding (TSV) capability
of video large language models (Video-LLMs) with grounded objects (GO). We
hypothesize that TSV tasks can benefit from GO within frames, which is
supported by our preliminary experiments on LITA, a state-of-the-art Video-LLM
for reasoning temporal localization. While augmenting prompts with textual
description of these object annotations improves the performance of LITA, it
also introduces extra token length and susceptibility to the noise in object
level information. To address this, we propose GO-Tokenizer, a lightweight
add-on module for Video-LLMs leveraging off-the-shelf object detectors to
encode compact object information on the fly. Experimental results demonstrate
that pretraining with GO-Tokenizer outperforms the vanilla Video-LLM and its
counterpart utilizing textual description of objects in the prompt. The gain
generalizes across different models, datasets and video understanding tasks
such as reasoning temporal localization and dense captioning.

### [105] [Multi View Slot Attention Using Paraphrased Texts For Face Anti-Spoofing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06336)
*Jeongmin Yu,Susang Kim,Kisu Lee,Taekyoung Kwon,Won-Yong Shin,Ha Young Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A CLIP-based face anti-spoofing method MVP-FAS uses two modules, MVS and MTPA, to exploit patch embeddings and multiple paraphrased texts for better cross-domain generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CLIP-based FAS methods underutilize patch embedding tokens and rely on a single text prompt per class, limiting detection of spoofing cues and domain generalization.

Method: MVP-FAS introduces Multi-View Slot attention (MVS) to extract local spatial details and global context from patch embeddings using multiple paraphrased texts; and Multi-Text Patch Alignment (MTPA) to align image patches with multiple text representations, enhancing semantic robustness and reducing dependence on domain-specific text.

Result: Extensive experiments show MVP-FAS achieves superior generalization, outperforming prior state-of-the-art methods on cross-domain face anti-spoofing datasets.

Conclusion: MVP-FAS effectively leverages CLIP patch tokens and paraphrased text prompts to improve cross-domain FAS performance, with available code at the provided repository.

Abstract: Recent face anti-spoofing (FAS) methods have shown remarkable cross-domain
performance by employing vision-language models like CLIP. However, existing
CLIP-based FAS models do not fully exploit CLIP's patch embedding tokens,
failing to detect critical spoofing clues. Moreover, these models rely on a
single text prompt per class (e.g., 'live' or 'fake'), which limits
generalization. To address these issues, we propose MVP-FAS, a novel framework
incorporating two key modules: Multi-View Slot attention (MVS) and Multi-Text
Patch Alignment (MTPA). Both modules utilize multiple paraphrased texts to
generate generalized features and reduce dependence on domain-specific text.
MVS extracts local detailed spatial features and global context from patch
embeddings by leveraging diverse texts with multiple perspectives. MTPA aligns
patches with multiple text representations to improve semantic robustness.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that MVP-FAS achieves superior generalization
performance, outperforming previous state-of-the-art methods on cross-domain
datasets. Code: https://github.com/Elune001/MVP-FAS.

*Krithik Ramesh,Ritvik Koneru*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A pilot unified CNN pipeline (ResNet-50) classifies both histology slides (PathMNIST) and colonoscopy frames (HyperKvasir) in a single network, using class-balancing, augmentation, and calibration to improve colorectal disease diagnosis; claims interpretability and reproducibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Colorectal diseases require fast, accurate diagnosis. Traditional pipelines rely on separate histology and colonoscopy analyses, which can introduce variability and inefficiency. A unified approach could streamline workflow and reduce diagnostic inconsistencies.

Method: A single CNN (ResNet-50) architecture employed with class-balancing learning, robust augmentation, and calibration. The model is trained on static histology images from PathMNIST and colonoscopy frames from HyperKvasir, aiming to handle multiple diagnostic modalities within one pipeline.

Result: Demonstrates a unified, interpretable, and reproducible diagnostic pipeline that combines multiple diagnostic modalities (histology and colonoscopy) to aid colorectal disease detection.

Conclusion: A unified deep learning pipeline for colorectal diagnostics that integrates histology and endoscopy data can streamline workflows, potentially reducing variability and improving speed and accuracy in disease detection.

Abstract: Colorectal diseases, including inflammatory conditions and neoplasms, require
quick, accurate care to be effectively treated. Traditional diagnostic
pipelines require extensive preparation and rely on separate, individual
evaluations on histological images and colonoscopy footage, introducing
possible variability and inefficiencies. This pilot study proposes a unified
deep learning network that uses convolutional neural networks (CN N s) to
classify both histopathological slides and colonoscopy video frames in one
pipeline. The pipeline integrates class-balancing learning, robust
augmentation, and calibration methods to ensure accurate results. Static colon
histology images were taken from the PathMNIST dataset, and the lower
gastrointestinal (colonoscopy) videos were drawn from the HyperKvasir dataset.
The CNN architecture used was ResNet-50. This study demonstrates an
interpretable and reproducible diagnostic pipeline that unifies multiple
diagnostic modalities to advance and ease the detection of colorectal diseases.

### [107] [MRD-LiNet: A Novel Lightweight Hybrid CNN with Gradient-Guided Unlearning for Improved Drought Stress Identification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06367)
*Aswini Kumar Patra,Lingaraj Sahoo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A lightweight hybrid CNN for drought stress detection from aerial potato-field images, featuring a 15x reduction in trainable parameters and a gradient-norm-based unlearning mechanism, achieving competitive accuracy suitable for resource-limited precision agriculture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Drought stress detection is crucial for crop management, but traditional CNNs/ViTs are parameter-heavy and ill-suited for resource-constrained, real-time settings; thus there is a need for efficient models and adaptable learning via targeted data removal.

Method: Develop a lightweight hybrid CNN inspired by ResNet, DenseNet, and MobileNet to substantially reduce trainable parameters (about 15-fold) while maintaining accuracy. Introduce a gradient-norm-based influence function-based machine unlearning to selectively remove the influence of specific training data, enabling adaptability. Evaluated on an aerial image dataset of potato fields with expert-annotated healthy and drought-stressed regions.

Result: Achieves high accuracy with substantially lower computational costs, notably a 15x reduction in trainable parameters compared to conventional CNNs/ViTs, demonstrated on the potato-field aerial dataset.

Conclusion: Proposes a practical, scalable, and adaptive solution for drought stress monitoring in precision agriculture, particularly suitable for resource-constrained environments.

Abstract: Drought stress is a major threat to global crop productivity, making its
early and precise detection essential for sustainable agricultural management.
Traditional approaches, though useful, are often time-consuming and
labor-intensive, which has motivated the adoption of deep learning methods. In
recent years, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Vision Transformer
architectures have been widely explored for drought stress identification;
however, these models generally rely on a large number of trainable parameters,
restricting their use in resource-limited and real-time agricultural settings.
To address this challenge, we propose a novel lightweight hybrid CNN framework
inspired by ResNet, DenseNet, and MobileNet architectures. The framework
achieves a remarkable 15-fold reduction in trainable parameters compared to
conventional CNN and Vision Transformer models, while maintaining competitive
accuracy. In addition, we introduce a machine unlearning mechanism based on a
gradient norm-based influence function, which enables targeted removal of
specific training data influence, thereby improving model adaptability. The
method was evaluated on an aerial image dataset of potato fields with
expert-annotated healthy and drought-stressed regions. Experimental results
show that our framework achieves high accuracy while substantially lowering
computational costs. These findings highlight its potential as a practical,
scalable, and adaptive solution for drought stress monitoring in precision
agriculture, particularly under resource-constrained conditions.

### [108] [Your Super Resolution Model is not Enough for Tackling Real-World Scenarios](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06387)
*Dongsik Yoon,Jongeun Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Plug-in Scale-Aware Attention Module (SAAM) enables arbitrary-scale SR for fixed-scale models with lightweight scale-adaptive feature extraction/upsampling, SimAM guidance, and gradient variance loss, and integrates with backbones like SCNet, HiT-SR, OverNet to deliver robust multi-scale upscaling with low overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SR models trained for fixed scale factors often fail to generalize to unseen integer/non-integer scales, hindering real-world deployment. A lightweight, plug-in solution that enables arbitrary-scale SR without retraining large backbones is needed.

Method: Introduce SAAM as a plug-in module that provides scale-aware feature extraction and upsampling. It uses the SimAM (a lightweight attention mechanism) for guidance and adds a gradient variance loss to sharpen details. The module is designed to retrofit existing SR backbones (e.g., SCNet, HiT-SR, OverNet) to handle arbitrary-scale factors (both integer and non-integer).

Result: SAAM achieves competitive or superior performance across a wide range of both integer and non-integer scales, with minimal additional computational overhead, validated on standard SR benchmarks.

Conclusion: SAAM offers a practical, plug-in solution for real-world arbitrary-scale SR by enabling scale-awareness in fixed-scale SR models, maintaining efficiency while improving robustness across diverse scale factors.

Abstract: Despite remarkable progress in Single Image Super-Resolution (SISR),
traditional models often struggle to generalize across varying scale factors,
limiting their real-world applicability. To address this, we propose a plug-in
Scale-Aware Attention Module (SAAM) designed to retrofit modern fixed-scale SR
models with the ability to perform arbitrary-scale SR. SAAM employs
lightweight, scale-adaptive feature extraction and upsampling, incorporating
the Simple parameter-free Attention Module (SimAM) for efficient guidance and
gradient variance loss to enhance sharpness in image details. Our method
integrates seamlessly into multiple state-of-the-art SR backbones (e.g., SCNet,
HiT-SR, OverNet), delivering competitive or superior performance across a wide
range of integer and non-integer scale factors. Extensive experiments on
benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach enables robust multi-scale
upscaling with minimal computational overhead, offering a practical solution
for real-world scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: An automated pipeline curates a large longitudinal BM dataset treated with SRS, identifies 5 growth trajectories, and achieves strong lesion-level response prediction (AUC up to 0.90) using gradient boosting and Graph ML, enabling scalable data-driven decision support.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the infeasibility of manually annotating longitudinal BM MRI data and to understand growth trajectories and early treatment response for personalized care.

Method: Automated data-curation of longitudinal SRS BM MRI data from 177 patients (896 BMs) with ~360 days follow-up; data-driven clustering to identify characteristic trajectories; prediction of 12-month lesion-level response using gradient boosting on pre-treatment and first follow-up MRI data; graph ML models to handle multi-time-point inputs.

Result: Identified 5 dominant growth trajectories with distinct final response categories; gradient boosting achieved AUC up to 0.90 (CI 0.88–0.92) using limited early timepoints; Graph ML achieved AUC up to 0.88 (CI 0.86–0.90) across configurations; pipeline supports scalable data curation and potential clinical decision support.

Conclusion: Demonstrates feasibility and potential of automated, scalable analysis of BM longitudinal MRI for improved assessment and prediction of SRS response, enabling personalized care and laying groundwork for clinical decision support systems.

Abstract: Brain Metastases (BM) are a large contributor to mortality of patients with
cancer. They are treated with Stereotactic Radiosurgery (SRS) and monitored
with Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) at regular follow-up intervals according
to treatment guidelines. Analyzing and quantifying this longitudinal imaging
represents an intractable workload for clinicians. As a result, follow-up
images are not annotated and merely assessed by observation. Response to
treatment in longitudinal imaging is being studied, to better understand growth
trajectories and ultimately predict treatment success or toxicity as early as
possible. In this study, we implement an automated pipeline to curate a large
longitudinal dataset of SRS treatment data, resulting in a cohort of 896 BMs in
177 patients who were monitored for >360 days at approximately two-month
intervals at Lausanne University Hospital (CHUV). We use a data-driven
clustering to identify characteristic trajectories. In addition, we predict 12
months lesion-level response using classical as well as graph machine learning
Graph Machine Learning (GML). Clustering revealed 5 dominant growth
trajectories with distinct final response categories. Response prediction
reaches up to 0.90 AUC (CI95%=0.88-0.92) using only pre-treatment and first
follow-up MRI with gradient boosting. Similarly, robust predictive performance
of up to 0.88 AUC (CI95%=0.86-0.90) was obtained using GML, offering more
flexibility with a single model for multiple input time-points configurations.
Our results suggest potential automation and increased precision for the
comprehensive assessment and prediction of BM response to SRS in longitudinal
MRI. The proposed pipeline facilitates scalable data curation for the
investigation of BM growth patterns, and lays the foundation for clinical
decision support systems aiming at optimizing personalized care.

*Matthieu Gendrin,Stéphane Pateux,Théo Ladune*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) is extended to 3DoF+ with limited camera offsets, analyzing how coordinate quantization affects pixel projection error and introducing a spherical-coordinate quantization scheme; demonstrates rate-distortion improvements on the Garden scene.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In large scenes, input views come from a constrained spatial zone, so achieving good novel-view synthesis for small camera offsets (3DoF+) requires efficient quantization and robust representations within a near-central pose neighborhood.

Method: Study how coordinate quantization impacts projection error in pixels for 3DGS; derive that the projection error scales with the squared inverse distance of the projected point; propose a quantization scheme based on spherical coordinates; illustrate rate-distortion performance on the Garden scene.

Result: Projection error is proportional to the squared inverse distance; the proposed spherical-coordinate quantization improves rate-distortion performance for 3DGS under 3DoF+ constraints; results demonstrated on the Garden scene.

Conclusion: A spherical-coordinate quantization strategy enhances 3DGS for near-central camera positions (3DoF+), enabling more accurate and efficient novel-view synthesis in large scenes with limited view zones.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) is a major breakthrough in 3D scene
reconstruction. With a number of views of a given object or scene, the
algorithm trains a model composed of 3D gaussians, which enables the production
of novel views from arbitrary points of view. This freedom of movement is
referred to as 6DoF for 6 degrees of freedom: a view is produced for any
position (3 degrees), orientation of camera (3 other degrees). On large scenes,
though, the input views are acquired from a limited zone in space, and the
reconstruction is valuable for novel views from the same zone, even if the
scene itself is almost unlimited in size. We refer to this particular case as
3DoF+, meaning that the 3 degrees of freedom of camera position are limited to
small offsets around the central position. Considering the problem of
coordinate quantization, the impact of position error on the projection error
in pixels is studied. It is shown that the projection error is proportional to
the squared inverse distance of the point being projected. Consequently, a new
quantization scheme based on spherical coordinates is proposed. Rate-distortion
performance of the proposed method are illustrated on the well-known Garden
scene.

*Jaemin Son,Sujin Choi,Inyong Yun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A lightweight token-pruning framework for vision-language models (VLMs) in document understanding reduces compute by removing non-informative background patches, using a binary patch classifier and a max-pooling refinement to recover fragmented text, achieving substantial cost savings with preserved accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLMs deliver strong performance on document understanding but incur high computational costs, limiting practicality for large-scale or real-time applications.

Method: Before VLM processing, apply a binary patch-level classifier to filter out non-text/background regions. Then apply a max-pooling refinement to reconnect fragmented text regions and improve spatial coherence of text layout.

Result: Experiments on real-world document datasets show substantial reductions in computational cost while maintaining comparable accuracy to baselines.

Conclusion: The proposed lightweight token pruning approach effectively improves efficiency of document understanding with VLMs and can enable more scalable deployment without sacrificing performance.

Abstract: Recent progress in vision-language models (VLMs) has led to impressive
results in document understanding tasks, but their high computational demands
remain a challenge. To mitigate the compute burdens, we propose a lightweight
token pruning framework that filters out non-informative background regions
from document images prior to VLM processing. A binary patch-level classifier
removes non-text areas, and a max-pooling refinement step recovers fragmented
text regions to enhance spatial coherence. Experiments on real-world document
datasets demonstrate that our approach substantially lowers computational
costs, while maintaining comparable accuracy.

### [113] [Phantom-Insight: Adaptive Multi-cue Fusion for Video Camouflaged Object Detection with Multimodal LLM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06422)
*Hua Zhang,Changjiang Luo,Ruoyu Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel VCOD method Phantom-Insight combines SAM and MLLM to improve camouflaged object detection in videos by decoupling foreground/background learning and adaptive prompts, achieving state-of-the-art on MoCA-Mask and generalizing to CAD2016.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Video camouflaged object detection is difficult in dynamic environments. SAM-based approaches suffer from edge-segmentation due to model freezing, while MLLM-based approaches struggle with object separability as large language models often merge foreground and background.

Method: Represent video sequences with temporal and spatial cues, fuse features via an LLM to increase information density, generate cues through a dynamic foreground visual token scoring module and a prompt network to adaptively guide and fine-tune SAM for subtle textures, and employ a decoupled foreground-background learning strategy with separate FG/BG cues and decoupled training so the visual token integrates FG and BG information effectively for better segmentation.

Result: Phantom-Insight achieves state-of-the-art performance on the MoCA-Mask dataset across various metrics and demonstrates strong generalization by detecting unseen camouflaged objects on CAD2016.

Conclusion: The approach enhances edge separability and object/background separability in SAM-based VCOD by leveraging temporal-spatial representations, LLM-guided feature fusion, adaptive prompting, and decoupled FG/BG learning, yielding superior performance and generalization.

Abstract: Video camouflaged object detection (VCOD) is challenging due to dynamic
environments. Existing methods face two main issues: (1) SAM-based methods
struggle to separate camouflaged object edges due to model freezing, and (2)
MLLM-based methods suffer from poor object separability as large language
models merge foreground and background. To address these issues, we propose a
novel VCOD method based on SAM and MLLM, called Phantom-Insight. To enhance the
separability of object edge details, we represent video sequences with temporal
and spatial clues and perform feature fusion via LLM to increase information
density. Next, multiple cues are generated through the dynamic foreground
visual token scoring module and the prompt network to adaptively guide and
fine-tune the SAM model, enabling it to adapt to subtle textures. To enhance
the separability of objects and background, we propose a decoupled
foreground-background learning strategy. By generating foreground and
background cues separately and performing decoupled training, the visual token
can effectively integrate foreground and background information independently,
enabling SAM to more accurately segment camouflaged objects in the video.
Experiments on the MoCA-Mask dataset show that Phantom-Insight achieves
state-of-the-art performance across various metrics. Additionally, its ability
to detect unseen camouflaged objects on the CAD2016 dataset highlights its
strong generalization ability.

*Rabin Dulal,Lihong Zheng,Muhammad Ashad Kabir*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Zero-shot muzzle detection for cattle using Grounding DINO; natural-language prompts enable annotation-free localization; achieves mAP@0.5 of 76.8%, offering scalable, industry-ready detection without task-specific training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome reliance on annotated datasets and poor generalization of supervised detectors (e.g., YOLO) for muzzle localization across diverse breeds and environments; reduce labeling effort and enable rapid deployment.

Method: Zero-shot detection with Grounding DINO guided by natural-language prompts; no task-specific training or annotated data required; aims for robust muzzle localization across varied settings.

Result: mAP@0.5 of 76.8% achieved without annotated data; demonstrates practical applicability and adaptability to unseen cattle in real-world scenarios.

Conclusion: First annotation-free, industry-oriented solution for cattle muzzle detection; offers scalable deployment and potential advantages over supervised methods in diverse conditions.

Abstract: Muzzle patterns are among the most effective biometric traits for cattle
identification. Fast and accurate detection of the muzzle region as the region
of interest is critical to automatic visual cattle identification.. Earlier
approaches relied on manual detection, which is labor-intensive and
inconsistent. Recently, automated methods using supervised models like YOLO
have become popular for muzzle detection. Although effective, these methods
require extensive annotated datasets and tend to be trained data-dependent,
limiting their performance on new or unseen cattle. To address these
limitations, this study proposes a zero-shot muzzle detection framework based
on Grounding DINO, a vision-language model capable of detecting muzzles without
any task-specific training or annotated data. This approach leverages natural
language prompts to guide detection, enabling scalable and flexible muzzle
localization across diverse breeds and environments. Our model achieves a mean
Average Precision (mAP)@0.5 of 76.8\%, demonstrating promising performance
without requiring annotated data. To our knowledge, this is the first research
to provide a real-world, industry-oriented, and annotation-free solution for

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PBAN: Perception-oriented Bidirectional Attention Network for SR full-reference IQA; uses bidirectional attention to distortion, grouped multi-scale deformable conv, and sub-information excitation conv to align quality assessment with human perception, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FR-IQA metrics for super-resolution are limited; there is a need for distortion-aware, perceptually aligned metrics that reflect both the generation and evaluation processes of SR images.

Method: Three-module framework: an image encoder for feature representations; a perception-oriented Bidirectional Attention (PBA) module leveraging bidirectional attention to distortions; Grouped Multi-scale Deformable Convolution to adaptively perceive distortion; Sub-information Excitation Convolution to direct visual perception to sub-pixel and sub-channel attention; a quality prediction module to regress quality scores.

Result: Extensive experiments show that PBAN outperforms state-of-the-art FR-IQA methods for SR.

Conclusion: PBAN effectively models perceptual distortion in SR and provides superior FR-IQA performance, validating the importance of bidirectional distortion-aware attention and the proposed deformable and sub-information excitation mechanisms.

Abstract: Many super-resolution (SR) algorithms have been proposed to increase image
resolution. However, full-reference (FR) image quality assessment (IQA) metrics
for comparing and evaluating different SR algorithms are limited. In this work,
we propose the Perception-oriented Bidirectional Attention Network (PBAN) for
image SR FR-IQA, which is composed of three modules: an image encoder module, a
perception-oriented bidirectional attention (PBA) module, and a quality
prediction module. First, we encode the input images for feature
representations. Inspired by the characteristics of the human visual system, we
then construct the perception-oriented PBA module. Specifically, different from
existing attention-based SR IQA methods, we conceive a Bidirectional Attention
to bidirectionally construct visual attention to distortion, which is
consistent with the generation and evaluation processes of SR images. To
further guide the quality assessment towards the perception of distorted
information, we propose Grouped Multi-scale Deformable Convolution, enabling
the proposed method to adaptively perceive distortion. Moreover, we design
Sub-information Excitation Convolution to direct visual perception to both
sub-pixel and sub-channel attention. Finally, the quality prediction module is
exploited to integrate quality-aware features and regress quality scores.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed PBAN outperforms
state-of-the-art quality assessment methods.

*Zongyi Xu,Zhongpeng Lang,Yilong Chen,Shanshan Zhao,Xiaoshui Huang,Yifan Zuo,Yan Zhang,Qianni Zhang,Xinbo Gao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Presents Cross3DReg, the largest real-world multi-modal cross-source point cloud dataset, and an overlap-based registration framework with visual-geometric attention, achieving state-of-the-art cross-source registration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cross-source registration suffers from scarce real-world datasets and sensor-induced differences that hinder robust feature extraction and matching; there is a need for large-scale real data and methods that can leverage cross-modal cues to improve accuracy.

Method: (1) Build Cross3DReg using a rotating mechanical LiDAR and a hybrid semi-solid-state LiDAR. (2) Propose an overlap-based registration framework that predicts the overlapping region using unaligned images to filter out non-overlapping/noisy points. (3) Develop a visual-geometric attention guided matching module that fuses image and geometric information to improve cross-source feature consistency and establish reliable correspondences.

Result: On extensive experiments, the method achieves state-of-the-art cross-source registration, reducing relative rotation error (RRE) by 63.2%, relative translation error (RTE) by 40.2%, and increasing registration recall (RR) by 5.4%.

Conclusion: The proposed Cross3DReg framework effectively addresses data scarcity and sensor-domain gaps in cross-source registration, delivering accurate and robust performance on real-world multi-modal data.

Abstract: Cross-source point cloud registration, which aims to align point cloud data
from different sensors, is a fundamental task in 3D vision. However, compared
to the same-source point cloud registration, cross-source registration faces
two core challenges: the lack of publicly available large-scale real-world
datasets for training the deep registration models, and the inherent
differences in point clouds captured by multiple sensors. The diverse patterns
induced by the sensors pose great challenges in robust and accurate point cloud
feature extraction and matching, which negatively influence the registration
accuracy. To advance research in this field, we construct Cross3DReg, the
currently largest and real-world multi-modal cross-source point cloud
registration dataset, which is collected by a rotating mechanical lidar and a
hybrid semi-solid-state lidar, respectively. Moreover, we design an
overlap-based cross-source registration framework, which utilizes unaligned
images to predict the overlapping region between source and target point
clouds, effectively filtering out redundant points in the irrelevant regions
and significantly mitigating the interference caused by noise in
non-overlapping areas. Then, a visual-geometric attention guided matching
module is proposed to enhance the consistency of cross-source point cloud
features by fusing image and geometric information to establish reliable
correspondences and ultimately achieve accurate and robust registration.
Extensive experiments show that our method achieves state-of-the-art
registration performance. Our framework reduces the relative rotation error
(RRE) and relative translation error (RTE) by $63.2\%$ and $40.2\%$,
respectively, and improves the registration recall (RR) by $5.4\%$, which
validates its effectiveness in achieving accurate cross-source registration.

*Sebastian-Vasile Echim,Andrei-Alexandru Preda,Dumitru-Clementin Cercel,Florin Pop*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes two black-box adversarial attacks (Affine Transformation Attack, ATA; Affine Genetic Attack, AGA) against CNNs and Vision Transformers, evaluates them on Tiny ImageNet, Caltech-256, and Food-101, compares with Pixle and Square Attack, and reports up to 8.82% accuracy impact along with insights on defenses across global and targeted settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Highlight the vulnerability of modern architectures to black-box adversarial attacks and expand the repertoire of attack strategies using affine transformations and genetic optimization across diverse model families and datasets.

Method: ATA is an iterative attack optimizing a score via random affine transformations; AGA is a genetic algorithm using random noise and affine transformations. Evaluated on ResNet-18, DenseNet-121, Swin Transformer V2, and Vision Transformer. Datasets: Tiny ImageNet, Caltech-256, Food-101. Comparisons with Pixle and Square Attack. Experiments include parameter variation, data augmentation, and both global and targeted attack configurations.

Result: Outperformed similar methods in the literature, achieving up to 8.82% accuracy improvement. Provided insights into successful adversarial defenses and attacks at both global and targeted levels; demonstrated how algorithm parameter variation influences adversarial robustness across architectures and datasets.

Conclusion: Affine-based black-box adversarial approaches are effective across diverse architectures; the work underscores the importance of evaluating defenses under parameter-sensitive, affine perturbation attacks and informs defense design across global and targeted threat models.

Abstract: Deep neural networks currently dominate many fields of the artificial
intelligence landscape, achieving state-of-the-art results on numerous tasks
while remaining hard to understand and exhibiting surprising weaknesses. An
active area of research focuses on adversarial attacks, which aim to generate
inputs that uncover these weaknesses. However, this proves challenging,
especially in the black-box scenario where model details are inaccessible. This
paper explores in detail the impact of such adversarial algorithms on
ResNet-18, DenseNet-121, Swin Transformer V2, and Vision Transformer network
architectures. Leveraging the Tiny ImageNet, Caltech-256, and Food-101
datasets, we benchmark two novel black-box iterative adversarial algorithms
based on affine transformations and genetic algorithms: 1) Affine
Transformation Attack (ATA), an iterative algorithm maximizing our attack score
function using random affine transformations, and 2) Affine Genetic Attack
(AGA), a genetic algorithm that involves random noise and affine
transformations. We evaluate the performance of the models in the algorithm
parameter variation, data augmentation, and global and targeted attack
configurations. We also compare our algorithms with two black-box adversarial
algorithms, Pixle and Square Attack. Our experiments yield better results on
the image classification task than similar methods in the literature, achieving
an accuracy improvement of up to 8.82%. We provide noteworthy insights into
successful adversarial defenses and attacks at both global and targeted levels,
and demonstrate adversarial robustness through algorithm parameter variation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CARVE is a training-free method that uses pixel-level contrastive attention to extract task-relevant visual signals from VLMs, boosting visual reasoning with gains up to 75% on open-source models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing enhancement approaches rely on extra training, segmentation tools, or coarse strategies and miss exploiting VLMs' innate attention dynamics. Visual complexity degrades reasoning by increasing attention entropy; there is a need to disentangle semantic signals from visual noise within VLM attention.

Method: Introduce Contrastive Attention Refinement for Visual Enhancement (CARVE). It operates without training by contrasting attention maps produced by general queries against task-specific queries at the pixel level to isolate semantic signals and suppress noise.

Result: Extensive experiments show CARVE consistently improves performance across open-source VLMs, with gains reaching up to 75%. The study also reveals that visual complexity correlates with higher attention entropy and that deeper layers exhibit refined, converged attention patterns, which CARVE leverages.

Conclusion: Attention-contrast-based refinement provides an efficient, training-free pathway to enhance visual reasoning in VLMs by disentangling semantic content from noise, offering theoretical insight into attention dynamics and practical benefits for vision-language tasks.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable success across
diverse visual tasks, yet their performance degrades in complex visual
environments. While existing enhancement approaches require additional
training, rely on external segmentation tools, or operate at coarse-grained
levels, they overlook the innate ability within VLMs. To bridge this gap, we
investigate VLMs' attention patterns and discover that: (1) visual complexity
strongly correlates with attention entropy, negatively impacting reasoning
performance; (2) attention progressively refines from global scanning in
shallow layers to focused convergence in deeper layers, with convergence degree
determined by visual complexity. (3) Theoretically, we prove that the contrast
of attention maps between general queries and task-specific queries enables the
decomposition of visual signal into semantic signals and visual noise
components. Building on these insights, we propose Contrastive Attention
Refinement for Visual Enhancement (CARVE), a training-free method that extracts
task-relevant visual signals through attention contrasting at the pixel level.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that CARVE consistently enhances performance,
achieving up to 75% improvement on open-source models. Our work provides
critical insights into the interplay between visual complexity and attention
mechanisms, offering an efficient pathway for improving visual reasoning with
contrasting attention.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome data limitations for internal organ modeling by generating diverse synthetic stomach morphologies to enable robust statistical shape modeling and applications in planning, education, and simulation.

Method: 1) generate synthetic stomach morphologies informed by studies of shape variability; 2) build a low-dimensional 3D statistical shape model from the synthetic dataset; 3) refine the model with semi-supervised alignment to publicly available CT meshes; 4) validate on hold-out real stomach CT scans; 5) release dataset and model on GitLab.

Result: The model generalizes well to unseen anatomy and achieves robust fit on real CT scans; first statistical 3D stomach model; public release of dataset and model.

Conclusion: This work advances organ modeling by integrating synthetic data generation, parametric modeling, and real-world validation, enabling personalized surgical planning, education, and computational studies; opens new research avenues in stomach-specific modeling.

Abstract: Realistic and parameterized 3D models of human anatomy have become invaluable
in research, diagnostics, and surgical planning. However, the development of
detailed models for internal organs, such as the stomach, has been limited by
data availability and methodological challenges. In this paper, we propose a
novel pipeline for the generation of synthetic 3D stomach models, enabling the
creation of anatomically diverse morphologies informed by established studies
on stomach shape variability. Using this pipeline, we construct a dataset of
synthetic stomachs. Building on this dataset, we develop a 3D statistical shape
model of the stomach, trained to capture natural anatomical variability in a
low-dimensional shape space. The model is further refined using CT meshes
derived from publicly available datasets through a semi-supervised alignment
process, enhancing its ability to generalize to unseen anatomical variations.
We evaluated the model on a held-out test set of real stomach CT scans,
demonstrating robust generalization and fit accuracy. We make the statistical
shape model along with the synthetic dataset publicly available on GitLab:
https://gitlab.com/Erez.Posner/stomach_pytorch to facilitate further research.
This work introduces the first statistical 3D shape model of the stomach, with
applications ranging from surgical simulation and pre-operative planning to
medical education and computational modeling. By combining synthetic data
generation, parametric modeling, and real-world validation, our approach
represents a significant advancement in organ modeling and opens new
possibilities for personalized healthcare solutions.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A natural-image–trained DINOv3 ViT provides a strong unified encoder for medical vision tasks, outperforming some medical-specific models on several tasks, but shows weaknesses in deeply specialized domains and exhibits inconsistent scaling behavior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate whether frontier, natural-image foundation models can transfer to medical vision without domain-specific pre-training, by testing DINOv3 as a unified encoder for diverse medical tasks.

Method: Benchmark DINOv3 across 2D/3D classification and segmentation on various medical modalities; analyze scalability by varying model sizes and input resolutions.

Result: DINOv3 delivers impressive performance and establishes a strong baseline; it can outperform medical-specific models (BiomedCLIP, CT-Net) on several tasks; limitations appear in deep-domain areas (WSIs, EM, PET); scaling behavior is not consistently improving with larger models or finer feature resolutions and varies across tasks.

Conclusion: DINOv3 provides robust features as a strong baseline and prior for multiple medical tasks; future work could leverage its features to enforce multiview consistency in 3D reconstruction.

Abstract: The advent of large-scale vision foundation models, pre-trained on diverse
natural images, has marked a paradigm shift in computer vision. However, how
the frontier vision foundation models' efficacies transfer to specialized
domains remains such as medical imaging remains an open question. This report
investigates whether DINOv3, a state-of-the-art self-supervised vision
transformer (ViT) that features strong capability in dense prediction tasks,
can directly serve as a powerful, unified encoder for medical vision tasks
without domain-specific pre-training. To answer this, we benchmark DINOv3
across common medical vision tasks, including 2D/3D classification and
segmentation on a wide range of medical imaging modalities. We systematically
analyze its scalability by varying model sizes and input image resolutions. Our
findings reveal that DINOv3 shows impressive performance and establishes a
formidable new baseline. Remarkably, it can even outperform medical-specific
foundation models like BiomedCLIP and CT-Net on several tasks, despite being
trained solely on natural images. However, we identify clear limitations: The
model's features degrade in scenarios requiring deep domain specialization,
such as in Whole-Slide Pathological Images (WSIs), Electron Microscopy (EM),
and Positron Emission Tomography (PET). Furthermore, we observe that DINOv3
does not consistently obey scaling law in the medical domain; performance does
not reliably increase with larger models or finer feature resolutions, showing
diverse scaling behaviors across tasks. Ultimately, our work establishes DINOv3
as a strong baseline, whose powerful visual features can serve as a robust
prior for multiple complex medical tasks. This opens promising future
directions, such as leveraging its features to enforce multiview consistency in
3D reconstruction.

*Zhongxiang Xie,Shuangxi Miao,Yuhan Jiang,Zhewei Zhang,Jing Yao,Xuecao Li,Jianxi Huang,Pedram Ghamisi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes FSG-Net for high-resolution remote sensing change detection that separates semantic changes from nuisance variations via frequency-domain DAWIM, spatial-domain STSAM, and a lightweight LGFU, achieving state-of-the-art results on multiple benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address false alarms from radiometric/temporal variations and a semantic gap between deep abstractions and detail-rich features that hinders effective fusion, leading to poor boundary delineation.

Method: A three-stage approach: (1) DAWIM operates in the frequency domain to adaptively mitigate pseudo-changes by processing different frequency components; (2) STSAM enhances refined features in the spatial domain with temporal-spatial attention; (3) LGFU uses high-level semantics to gate and integrate crucial details from shallow layers; end-to-end network for change detection.

Result: Outperforms existing methods on CDD, GZ-CD, LEVIR-CD with F1-scores of 94.16%, 89.51%, and 91.27%, establishing new state-of-the-art; code will be released on GitHub.

Conclusion: FSG-Net effectively disentangles semantic changes from nuisance variations, improving boundary delineation and bridging the semantic gap between feature hierarchies; promising framework for future high-resolution change detection tasks.

Abstract: Change detection from high-resolution remote sensing images lies as a
cornerstone of Earth observation applications, yet its efficacy is often
compromised by two critical challenges. First, false alarms are prevalent as
models misinterpret radiometric variations from temporal shifts (e.g.,
illumination, season) as genuine changes. Second, a non-negligible semantic gap
between deep abstract features and shallow detail-rich features tends to
obstruct their effective fusion, culminating in poorly delineated boundaries.
To step further in addressing these issues, we propose the Frequency-Spatial
Synergistic Gated Network (FSG-Net), a novel paradigm that aims to
systematically disentangle semantic changes from nuisance variations.
Specifically, FSG-Net first operates in the frequency domain, where a
Discrepancy-Aware Wavelet Interaction Module (DAWIM) adaptively mitigates
pseudo-changes by discerningly processing different frequency components.
Subsequently, the refined features are enhanced in the spatial domain by a
Synergistic Temporal-Spatial Attention Module (STSAM), which amplifies the
saliency of genuine change regions. To finally bridge the semantic gap, a
Lightweight Gated Fusion Unit (LGFU) leverages high-level semantics to
selectively gate and integrate crucial details from shallow layers.
Comprehensive experiments on the CDD, GZ-CD, and LEVIR-CD benchmarks validate
the superiority of FSG-Net, establishing a new state-of-the-art with F1-scores
of 94.16%, 89.51%, and 91.27%, respectively. The code will be made available at
https://github.com/zxXie-Air/FSG-Net after a possible publication.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Defines Before-After Supervision for weakly supervised segmentation in waste sorting, introduces WS^2, a multiview dataset with 11k+ frames of before/after conveyor-belt images, and presents an end-to-end pipeline to benchmark state-of-the-art weakly supervised segmentation methods on WS^2.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce labeling costs in segmentation for industrial waste-sorting by leveraging implicit supervision from operator actions (before vs after), addressing the infeasibility of fully supervised approaches across varied sorting tasks.

Method: Formalizes Before-After Supervision as a training signal using visual differences between before and after images. Introduces WS^2, a multiview, high-resolution dataset with before/after pairs collected on a conveyor belt. Presents a robust end-to-end pipeline and benchmarks several state-of-the-art weakly supervised segmentation methods on WS^2.

Result: Introduces the WS^2 dataset and an end-to-end benchmarking pipeline; reports baseline results by evaluating multiple weakly supervised segmentation methods on this dataset, providing insights into their applicability to industrial waste-sorting.

Conclusion: The paper establishes Before-After Supervision as a viable paradigm for weakly supervised segmentation in industrial settings, launches the WS^2 dataset as a first multiview resource for this task, and offers a benchmarking pipeline to catalyze further research.

Abstract: In industrial quality control, to visually recognize unwanted items within a
moving heterogeneous stream, human operators are often still indispensable.
Waste-sorting stands as a significant example, where operators on multiple
conveyor belts manually remove unwanted objects to select specific materials.
To automate this recognition problem, computer vision systems offer great
potential in accurately identifying and segmenting unwanted items in such
settings. Unfortunately, considering the multitude and the variety of sorting
tasks, fully supervised approaches are not a viable option to address this
challange, as they require extensive labeling efforts. Surprisingly, weakly
supervised alternatives that leverage the implicit supervision naturally
provided by the operator in his removal action are relatively unexplored. In
this paper, we define the concept of Before-After Supervision, illustrating how
to train a segmentation network by leveraging only the visual differences
between images acquired \textit{before} and \textit{after} the operator. To
promote research in this direction, we introduce WS$^2$ (Weakly Supervised
segmentation for Waste-Sorting), the first multiview dataset consisting of more
than 11 000 high-resolution video frames captured on top of a conveyor belt,
including "before" and "after" images. We also present a robust end-to-end
pipeline, used to benchmark several state-of-the-art weakly supervised
segmentation methods on WS$^2$.

*Jibai Lin,Bo Ma,Yating Yang,Rong Ma,Turghun Osman,Ahtamjan Ahmat,Rui Dong,Lei Wang,Xi Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TIDE is a framework for subject-driven image generation that balances subject fidelity with instruction compliance using target supervision and preference learning, without test-time fine-tuning; it introduces target-supervised triplet alignment with a Direct Subject Diffusion objective and trains on balanced “winning” and distorted “losing” targets, achieving state-of-the-art results across tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SDIG struggles to maintain a subject’s identity while following dynamic edit instructions. Existing methods often rely on test-time tuning or fail to balance preservation with compliance, limiting generalization and usefulness.

Method: TIDE uses target supervision and preference learning with target-supervised triplet alignment (reference image, instruction, target images). It employs the Direct Subject Diffusion (DSD) objective and trains on paired winning (balanced preservation-compliance) and losing (distorted) targets, enabling implicit reward modeling and without requiring test-time fine-tuning. It also demonstrates versatility across structural-conditioned generation, image-to-image generation, and text-image interpolation, and releases code.

Result: On standard benchmarks, TIDE achieves superior subject-faithful outputs while maintaining instruction compliance, outperforming baselines across multiple quantitative metrics. It generalizes well to diverse tasks beyond SDIG.

Conclusion: Target supervision and preference learning via the TIDE framework effectively resolve the trade-off between identity preservation and instruction adherence in SDIG, offering a robust, test-time-tuning-free solution with broad applicability and strong empirical performance.

Abstract: Subject-driven image generation (SDIG) aims to manipulate specific subjects
within images while adhering to textual instructions, a task crucial for
advancing text-to-image diffusion models. SDIG requires reconciling the tension
between maintaining subject identity and complying with dynamic edit
instructions, a challenge inadequately addressed by existing methods. In this
paper, we introduce the Target-Instructed Diffusion Enhancing (TIDE) framework,
which resolves this tension through target supervision and preference learning
without test-time fine-tuning. TIDE pioneers target-supervised triplet
alignment, modelling subject adaptation dynamics using a (reference image,
instruction, target images) triplet. This approach leverages the Direct Subject
Diffusion (DSD) objective, training the model with paired "winning" (balanced
preservation-compliance) and "losing" (distorted) targets, systematically
generated and evaluated via quantitative metrics. This enables implicit reward
modelling for optimal preservation-compliance balance. Experimental results on
standard benchmarks demonstrate TIDE's superior performance in generating
subject-faithful outputs while maintaining instruction compliance,
outperforming baseline methods across multiple quantitative metrics. TIDE's
versatility is further evidenced by its successful application to diverse
tasks, including structural-conditioned generation, image-to-image generation,
and text-image interpolation. Our code is available at

*Hua Chang Bakker,Stan Fris,Angela Madelon Bernardy,Stan Deutekom*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Reproduces FairCLIP, finds design gaps and differences from original implementation; introduces A-FairCLIP and FairCLIP+ to test design choices; experiments on glaucoma datasets do not show improved performance or fairness; reducing Sinkhorn distance alone does not yield gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Assess reproducibility of FairCLIP (Luo et al., 2024) and evaluate whether the proposed fairness regularization actually improves CLIP's fairness and zero-shot performance across datasets and attributes.

Method: Replicate Luo et al.'s experimental setup; implement a new version, A-FairCLIP, to probe design choices; propose FairCLIP+ to extend the objective to multiple attributes; evaluate on zero-shot glaucoma classification using Harvard-FairVLMed dataset and a second dataset; analyze changes in Sinkhorn distance and downstream performance/fairness.

Result: Across two datasets, CLIP exhibits demographic biases in zero-shot glaucoma classification. The experiments do not corroborate the claim that FairCLIP improves either performance or fairness. While the regularization reduces Sinkhorn distances, both official FairCLIP and A-FairCLIP fail to improve performance or fairness.

Conclusion: FairCLIP’s regularization reduces distributional disparities but does not translate into tangible gains in zero-shot performance or fairness on the tested tasks; design differences and implementation details are crucial for reproducibility, and further work is needed to design effective fairness interventions for CLIP.

Abstract: We investigated the reproducibility of FairCLIP, proposed by Luo et al.
(2024), for improving the group fairness of CLIP (Radford et al., 2021) by
minimizing image-text similarity score disparities across sensitive groups
using the Sinkhorn distance. The experimental setup of Luo et al. (2024) was
reproduced to primarily investigate the research findings for FairCLIP. The
model description by Luo et al. (2024) was found to differ from the original
implementation. Therefore, a new implementation, A-FairCLIP, is introduced to
examine specific design choices. Furthermore, FairCLIP+ is proposed to extend
the FairCLIP objective to include multiple attributes. Additionally, the impact
of the distance minimization on FairCLIP's fairness and performance was
explored. In alignment with the original authors, CLIP was found to be biased
towards certain demographics when applied to zero-shot glaucoma classification
using medical scans and clinical notes from the Harvard-FairVLMed dataset.
However, the experimental results on two datasets do not support their claim
that FairCLIP improves the performance and fairness of CLIP. Although the
regularization objective reduces Sinkhorn distances, both the official
implementation and the aligned implementation, A-FairCLIP, were not found to
improve performance nor fairness in zero-shot glaucoma classification.

TL;DR: Hybrid deep learning and radiomics approach using ResNet-18 features fused with radiomic features for automated glioblastoma therapy response classification; achieved ROC AUC 0.81 and Macro F1 0.50 on 4-class task in BraTS 2025.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To standardize and automate assessment of glioblastoma treatment response, reducing observer variability and aligning with RANO criteria within a BraTS challenge.

Method: Fine-tuned 2D ResNet-18 extracts features from four MRI modalities; features fused with 4800+ radiomic and clinically driven features including 3D radiomics of growth/shrinkage masks, nadir-relative volumetrics, and centroid shift; CatBoost classifier used for 4-class response prediction.

Result: Mean ROC AUC 0.81; Macro F1 0.50 across Complete Response, Partial Response, Stable Disease, Progressive Disease.

Conclusion: The hybrid approach leveraging learned representations and domain-specific radiomics improves automated treatment response assessment in neuro-oncology and shows robustness and potential clinical utility; may reduce observer variability and support clinical decision-making.

Abstract: Accurate evaluation of the response of glioblastoma to therapy is crucial for
clinical decision-making and patient management. The Response Assessment in
Neuro-Oncology (RANO) criteria provide a standardized framework to assess
patients' clinical response, but their application can be complex and subject
to observer variability. This paper presents an automated method for
classifying the intervention response from longitudinal MRI scans, developed to
predict tumor response during therapy as part of the BraTS 2025 challenge. We
propose a novel hybrid framework that combines deep learning derived feature
extraction and an extensive set of radiomics and clinically chosen features.
Our approach utilizes a fine-tuned ResNet-18 model to extract features from 2D
regions of interest across four MRI modalities. These deep features are then
fused with a rich set of more than 4800 radiomic and clinically driven
features, including 3D radiomics of tumor growth and shrinkage masks,
volumetric changes relative to the nadir, and tumor centroid shift. Using the
fused feature set, a CatBoost classifier achieves a mean ROC AUC of 0.81 and a
Macro F1 score of 0.50 in the 4-class response prediction task (Complete
Response, Partial Response, Stable Disease, Progressive Disease). Our results
highlight that synergizing learned image representations with domain-targeted
radiomic features provides a robust and effective solution for automated
treatment response assessment in neuro-oncology.

Method: Create FMOX JSON metadata containing ground-truth object size information for four FMOs datasets; evaluate EfficientTAM on FMOX; compare against existing FMOs pipelines using Trajectory Intersection over Union (TIoU); release code and JSON for community use.

Result: EfficientTAM performance is competitive with pipelines originally tailored for FMOs on the FMOX dataset, as evidenced by TIoU-based comparisons; FMOX metadata expands ground-truth information and is shared openly to facilitate integration with other ML pipelines.

Conclusion: FMOX provides richer ground-truth data and an accessible benchmarking platform; it enables more versatile testing of tracking models, including foundational models like EfficientTAM, on fast-moving object datasets.

Abstract: Fast and tiny object tracking remains a challenge in computer vision and in
this paper we first introduce a JSON metadata file associated with four open
source datasets of Fast Moving Objects (FMOs) image sequences. In addition, we
extend the description of the FMOs datasets with additional ground truth
information in JSON format (called FMOX) with object size information. Finally
we use our FMOX file to test a recently proposed foundational model for
tracking (called EfficientTAM) showing that its performance compares well with
the pipelines originally taylored for these FMO datasets. Our comparison of
these state-of-the-art techniques on FMOX is provided with Trajectory
Intersection of Union (TIoU) scores. The code and JSON is shared open source
allowing FMOX to be accessible and usable for other machine learning pipelines
aiming to process FMO datasets.

### [127] [Back To The Drawing Board: Rethinking Scene-Level Sketch-Based Image Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06566)
*Emil Demić,Luka Čehovin Zajc*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A robust scene-level SBIR model that handles sketch variability and achieves state-of-the-art without extra model complexity, validated on FS-COCO and SketchyCOCO; highlights training design and evaluation gaps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sketch-based image retrieval at scene level is hampered by inherent ambiguity and noise in real-world sketches; existing approaches may rely on architectural augmentations, but robust training design is needed to handle variability.

Method: A combination of targeted pre-training, encoder architecture choices, and a robust loss formulation designed to be resilient to sketch variability to align sketch and image representations at the scene level.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on FS-COCO and SketchyCOCO without introducing additional complexity; extensive experiments validate effectiveness.

Conclusion: Training design is critical for cross-modal SBIR; evaluation scenarios for scene-level SBIR should be improved to better reflect real-world sketch variability and ambiguity.

Abstract: The goal of Scene-level Sketch-Based Image Retrieval is to retrieve natural
images matching the overall semantics and spatial layout of a free-hand sketch.
Unlike prior work focused on architectural augmentations of retrieval models,
we emphasize the inherent ambiguity and noise present in real-world sketches.
This insight motivates a training objective that is explicitly designed to be
robust to sketch variability. We show that with an appropriate combination of
pre-training, encoder architecture, and loss formulation, it is possible to
achieve state-of-the-art performance without the introduction of additional
complexity. Extensive experiments on a challenging FS-COCO and widely-used
SketchyCOCO datasets confirm the effectiveness of our approach and underline
the critical role of training design in cross-modal retrieval tasks, as well as
the need to improve the evaluation scenarios of scene-level SBIR.

### [128] [Evolving from Unknown to Known: Retentive Angular Representation Learning for Incremental Open Set Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06570)
*Runqing Yang,Yimin Fu,Changyuan Wu,Zhunga Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RARL tackles incremental open set recognition by aligning unknowns around inactive prototypes in an angular space defined by an equiangular tight frame, using virtual-intrinsic interactive training and stratified rectification to strengthen decision boundaries; achieves state-of-the-art results on CIFAR100 and TinyImageNet for IOSR.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing OSR methods are designed for static, closed sets and struggle to identify new unknown classes in streaming, incremental settings due to limited access to old data, leading to inter-class confusion and degraded decision boundaries. There is a need for mechanisms that preserve discriminability while accommodating knowledge updates from evolving data streams.

Method: Introduce Retentive Angular Representation Learning (RARL) for IOSR. Unknown representations are encouraged to align around inactive prototypes within an angular space constructed under an equiangular tight frame, stabilizing representation drift during updates. A Virtual-Intrinsic Interactive (VII) training strategy compactes known representations by enforcing clear inter-class margins via boundary-proximal virtual classes. A Stratified Rectification strategy refines decision boundaries to mitigate representation bias and space distortion caused by imbalances among old/new and positive/negative samples.

Result: Empirical evaluation on CIFAR100 and TinyImageNet demonstrates that RARL achieves state-of-the-art performance in incremental open set recognition tasks and establishes a new IOSR benchmark across multiple task setups.

Conclusion: RARL effectively mitigates representation drift and inter-class confusion in IOSR by anchoring unknowns around inactive angular prototypes and by learning with boundary-aware virtual classes and stratified boundary refinement. This yields robust, scalable incremental open-set recognition performance and sets a new benchmark for IOSR.

Abstract: Existing open set recognition (OSR) methods are typically designed for static
scenarios, where models aim to classify known classes and identify unknown ones
within fixed scopes. This deviates from the expectation that the model should
incrementally identify newly emerging unknown classes from continuous data
streams and acquire corresponding knowledge. In such evolving scenarios, the
discriminability of OSR decision boundaries is hard to maintain due to
restricted access to former training data, causing severe inter-class
confusion. To solve this problem, we propose retentive angular representation
learning (RARL) for incremental open set recognition (IOSR). In RARL, unknown
representations are encouraged to align around inactive prototypes within an
angular space constructed under the equiangular tight frame, thereby mitigating
excessive representation drift during knowledge updates. Specifically, we adopt
a virtual-intrinsic interactive (VII) training strategy, which compacts known
representations by enforcing clear inter-class margins through
boundary-proximal virtual classes. Furthermore, a stratified rectification
strategy is designed to refine decision boundaries, mitigating representation
bias and feature space distortion caused by imbalances between old/new and
positive/negative class samples. We conduct thorough evaluations on CIFAR100
and TinyImageNet datasets and establish a new benchmark for IOSR. Experimental
results across various task setups demonstrate that the proposed method
achieves state-of-the-art performance.

### [129] [Improved Classification of Nitrogen Stress Severity in Plants Under Combined Stress Conditions Using Spatio-Temporal Deep Learning Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06625)
*Aswini Kumar Patra*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A multi-modal spatio-temporal CNN-LSTM framework using RGB, multispectral, and two infrared channels to classify nitrogen stress levels under drought and weed pressure, achieving 98% accuracy, outperforming a spatial CNN and prior ML methods; enables early detection for better crop management.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Nitrogen deficiency under combined abiotic and biotic stresses complicates detection. Early detection is crucial for protecting plant health and enabling effective management. A robust model that leverages multi-modal imaging and temporal dynamics is needed to distinguish nitrogen stress effects amidst drought and weed competition.

Method: A spatio-temporal deep learning pipeline that fuses four imaging modalities (RGB, multispectral, and two infrared wavelengths) as time-series canopy images. A CNN extracts spatial features, and an LSTM captures temporal dependencies. A spatial-only CNN is used as a baseline for comparison. The study evaluates nitrogen stress across three levels (low, medium, high) under varying water stress and weed pressures.

Result: CNN-LSTM achieved 98% accuracy, surpassing the spatial-only model at 80.45% and other prior ML methods at 76%. The approach effectively captures subtle interactions among nitrogen deficiency, water stress, and weed competition.

Conclusion: The CNN-LSTM framework provides a robust platform for timely identification of nitrogen stress severity under combined stresses, enabling proactive crop management and improved plant health. It demonstrates the value of integrating multi-modal imaging with spatio-temporal learning for complex agricultural stress phenotyping.

Abstract: Plants in their natural habitats endure an array of interacting stresses,
both biotic and abiotic, that rarely occur in isolation. Nutrient
stress-particularly nitrogen deficiency-becomes even more critical when
compounded with drought and weed competition, making it increasingly difficult
to distinguish and address its effects. Early detection of nitrogen stress is
therefore crucial for protecting plant health and implementing effective
management strategies. This study proposes a novel deep learning framework to
accurately classify nitrogen stress severity in a combined stress environment.
Our model uses a unique blend of four imaging modalities-RGB, multispectral,
and two infrared wavelengths-to capture a wide range of physiological plant
responses from canopy images. These images, provided as time-series data,
document plant health across three levels of nitrogen availability (low,
medium, and high) under varying water stress and weed pressures. The core of
our approach is a spatio-temporal deep learning pipeline that merges a
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for extracting spatial features from images
with a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network to capture temporal dependencies.
We also devised and evaluated a spatial-only CNN pipeline for comparison. Our
CNN-LSTM pipeline achieved an impressive accuracy of 98%, impressively
surpassing the spatial-only model's 80.45% and other previously reported
machine learning method's 76%. These results bring actionable insights based on
the power of our CNN-LSTM approach in effectively capturing the subtle and
complex interactions between nitrogen deficiency, water stress, and weed
pressure. This robust platform offers a promising tool for the timely and
proactive identification of nitrogen stress severity, enabling better crop
management and improved plant health.

### [130] [Approximating Condorcet Ordering for Vector-valued Mathematical Morphology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06577)
*Marcos Eduardo Valle,Santiago Velasco-Forero,Joao Batista Florindo,Gustavo Jesus Angulo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A learning-based approach to approximate a Condorcet-inspired reduced ordering for vector-valued morphology, addressing the lack of consensus on vector ordering in color imagery; preliminary results indicate effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is no agreed-upon best ordering for vector-valued morphological operators (e.g., for color/hyperspectral images). The authors seek a principled, data-driven ordering by approximating a Condorcet ranking derived from multiple vector orderings.

Method: Define a Condorcet-like ranking over vector values formed from multiple orderings; train a machine learning model to learn a reduced mapping that approximates this Condorcet ordering, enabling practical vector-valued morphological operators. The approach draws on voting theory and model learning to unify competing orderings into a single, efficient mapping.

Result: Preliminary computational experiments show that the learned reduced ordering effectively defines vector-valued morphological operators for color images.

Conclusion: Learning a Condorcet-inspired reduced vector ordering is a viable path to unify vector morphologies and warrants further validation and refinement across color and other multivariate imaging modalities.

Abstract: Mathematical morphology provides a nonlinear framework for image and spatial
data processing and analysis. Although there have been many successful
applications of mathematical morphology to vector-valued images, such as color
and hyperspectral images, there is still no consensus on the most suitable
vector ordering for constructing morphological operators. This paper addresses
this issue by examining a reduced ordering approximating the Condorcet ranking
derived from a set of vector orderings. Inspired by voting problems, the
Condorcet ordering ranks elements from most to least voted, with voters
representing different orderings. In this paper, we develop a machine learning
approach that learns a reduced ordering that approximates the Condorcet
ordering. Preliminary computational experiments confirm the effectiveness of
learning the reduced mapping to define vector-valued morphological operators
for color images.

### [131] [CausNVS: Autoregressive Multi-view Diffusion for Flexible 3D Novel View Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06579)
*Xin Kong,Daniel Watson,Yannick Strümpler,Michael Niemeyer,Federico Tombari*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CausNVS is an autoregressive multi-view diffusion model enabling arbitrary input–output view configurations, with causal masking, per-frame noise, and CaPE camera encodings; inference uses a spatial sliding-window with caching and noise-conditioning augmentation to maintain quality across diverse camera trajectories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Non-autoregressive multi-view diffusion methods constrain the number of views and require denoising all frames at once, hindering world-modeling and slow inference. An autoregressive, flexible approach is needed to support varying view inputs/outputs and efficient generation.

Method: Train with causal masking and per-frame noise; encode cameras using CaPE (pairwise-relative camera poses) for precise control; generate views autoregressively; at inference, apply a spatially-aware sliding window, key-value caching, and noise-conditioning augmentation to mitigate drift.

Result: Experiments show CausNVS supports a broad range of camera trajectories, enables flexible autoregressive novel view synthesis, and maintains strong visual quality across diverse settings.

Conclusion: CausNVS enables flexible autoregressive NVS with arbitrary view configurations and competitive quality, broadening applicability to world modeling and dynamic view synthesis.

Abstract: Multi-view diffusion models have shown promise in 3D novel view synthesis,
but most existing methods adopt a non-autoregressive formulation. This limits
their applicability in world modeling, as they only support a fixed number of
views and suffer from slow inference due to denoising all frames
simultaneously. To address these limitations, we propose CausNVS, a multi-view
diffusion model in an autoregressive setting, which supports arbitrary
input-output view configurations and generates views sequentially. We train
CausNVS with causal masking and per-frame noise, using pairwise-relative camera
pose encodings (CaPE) for precise camera control. At inference time, we combine
a spatially-aware sliding-window with key-value caching and noise conditioning
augmentation to mitigate drift. Our experiments demonstrate that CausNVS
supports a broad range of camera trajectories, enables flexible autoregressive
novel view synthesis, and achieves consistently strong visual quality across
diverse settings. Project page: https://kxhit.github.io/CausNVS.html.

*Usman Haider,Lukasz Szemet,Daniel Kelly,Vasileios Sergis,Andrew C. Daly,Karl Mason*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A lightweight BioLite U-Net enables real-time semantic segmentation for bioprinting extrusion on embedded hardware, achieving high accuracy with a tiny model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable in situ, real-time monitoring of bioprinting fidelity under limited imaging data and constrained embedded hardware by segmenting nozzle, bioink, and background.

Method: Introduced BioLite U-Net using depthwise separable convolutions; built a manually annotated dataset of 787 RGB images with three classes (nozzle, bioink, background); evaluated against MobileNetV2/V3-based baselines; tested on Raspberry Pi 4B.

Result: BioLite U-Net achieves mIoU 92.85% and Dice 96.17%; model size >1300x smaller than MobileNetV2-DeepLabV3+; pixel inference time 335 ms per frame on Raspberry Pi 4B; outperforms baselines in accuracy-efficiency tradeoff.

Conclusion: Demonstrates a deployable, real-time segmentation solution for intelligent, closed-loop bioprinting systems on resource-constrained hardware.

Abstract: Bioprinting is a rapidly advancing field that offers a transformative
approach to fabricating tissue and organ models through the precise deposition
of cell-laden bioinks. Ensuring the fidelity and consistency of printed
structures in real-time remains a core challenge, particularly under
constraints imposed by limited imaging data and resource-constrained embedded
hardware. Semantic segmentation of the extrusion process, differentiating
between nozzle, extruded bioink, and surrounding background, enables in situ
monitoring critical to maintaining print quality and biological viability. In
this work, we introduce a lightweight semantic segmentation framework tailored
for real-time bioprinting applications. We present a novel, manually annotated
dataset comprising 787 RGB images captured during the bioprinting process,
labeled across three classes: nozzle, bioink, and background. To achieve fast
and efficient inference suitable for integration with bioprinting systems, we
propose a BioLite U-Net architecture that leverages depthwise separable
convolutions to drastically reduce computational load without compromising
accuracy. Our model is benchmarked against MobileNetV2 and MobileNetV3-based
segmentation baselines using mean Intersection over Union (mIoU), Dice score,
and pixel accuracy. All models were evaluated on a Raspberry Pi 4B to assess
real-world feasibility. The proposed BioLite U-Net achieves an mIoU of 92.85%
and a Dice score of 96.17%, while being over 1300x smaller than
MobileNetV2-DeepLabV3+. On-device inference takes 335 ms per frame,
demonstrating near real-time capability. Compared to MobileNet baselines,
BioLite U-Net offers a superior tradeoff between segmentation accuracy,
efficiency, and deployability, making it highly suitable for intelligent,
closed-loop bioprinting systems.

*Ritwik Kulkarni,WU Hanqin,Enrico Di Minin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ML-based object detection identifies illegal wildlife products in images with ~84% overall accuracy and strong species-specific performance, and a smartphone app enables real-time use for authorities; applicable to online markets and physical markets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Unsustainable wildlife trade threatens biodiversity and is amplified by large-scale digital marketplaces. Automating detection of wildlife products in images is essential to scale monitoring and enforcement, particularly for elephant ivory, pangolin scales, and tiger-derived items.

Method: Trained image-based object recognition models on a dataset of illegally sold or confiscated wildlife products (elephant ivory/skins, pangolin scales, tiger skins/bones). Explored combinations of training strategies and two loss functions, building both species-specific models and a single multi-species model. Also developed a smartphone app to perform real-time inference for field use by authorities.

Result: Best model achieved 84.2% overall accuracy, with 71.1% for elephants, 90.2% for pangolins, and 93.5% for tigers. The smartphone application achieved 91.3% overall accuracy for real-time detection, demonstrating practical deployment potential for monitoring online and physical markets.

Conclusion: The approach shows promise for scalable wildlife trade monitoring across digital platforms and in real markets, supporting authorities and policy makers in detection efforts and potentially informing enforcement actions.

Abstract: Unsustainable trade in wildlife is a major threat to biodiversity and is now
increasingly prevalent in digital marketplaces and social media. With the sheer
volume of digital content, the need for automated methods to detect wildlife
trade listings is growing. These methods are especially needed for the
automatic identification of wildlife products, such as ivory. We developed
machine learning-based object recognition models that can identify wildlife
products within images and highlight them. The data consists of images of
elephant, pangolin, and tiger products that were identified as being sold
illegally or that were confiscated by authorities. Specifically, the wildlife
products included elephant ivory and skins, pangolin scales, and claws (raw and
crafted), and tiger skins and bones. We investigated various combinations of
training strategies and two loss functions to identify the best model to use in
the automatic detection of these wildlife products. Models were trained for
each species while also developing a single model to identify products from all
three species. The best model showed an overall accuracy of 84.2% with
accuracies of 71.1%, 90.2% and 93.5% in detecting products derived from
elephants, pangolins, and tigers, respectively. We further demonstrate that the
machine learning model can be made easily available to stakeholders, such as
government authorities and law enforcement agencies, by developing a
smartphone-based application that had an overall accuracy of 91.3%. The
application can be used in real time to click images and help identify
potentially prohibited products of target species. Thus, the proposed method is
not only applicable for monitoring trade on the web but can also be used e.g.
in physical markets for monitoring wildlife trade.

*Yichao Liu,YueYang Teng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes HSANet, a lightweight denoising network for LDCT/PET using Efficient Global Attention and a hybrid upsampling module to boost performance while reducing overfitting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LDCT and PET reduce radiation exposure but increase noise/artifacts, risking diagnostic accuracy; existing denoising methods often trade off performance, attention modeling, or computational efficiency; a practical, efficient approach is needed for clinical deployment.

Method: Introduce Hybrid Swin Attention Network (HSANet) with Efficient Global Attention (EGA) modules to enhance spatial and channel interactions; include a hybrid upsampling module to mitigate noise overfitting; validate on a publicly available LDCT/PET dataset.

Result: HSANet achieves superior denoising performance compared to existing methods and maintains a lightweight model suitable for GPUs with standard memory, supporting practical clinical deployment.

Conclusion: The HSANet provides an effective, efficient denoising solution for LDCT/PET, leveraging global-attention and hybrid upsampling to balance performance and model size for real-world use.

Abstract: Low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) and positron emission tomography (PET)
have emerged as safer alternatives to conventional imaging modalities by
significantly reducing radiation exposure. However, this reduction often
results in increased noise and artifacts, which can compromise diagnostic
accuracy. Consequently, denoising for LDCT/PET has become a vital area of
research aimed at enhancing image quality while maintaining radiation safety.
In this study, we introduce a novel Hybrid Swin Attention Network (HSANet),
which incorporates Efficient Global Attention (EGA) modules and a hybrid
upsampling module. The EGA modules enhance both spatial and channel-wise
interaction, improving the network's capacity to capture relevant features,
while the hybrid upsampling module mitigates the risk of overfitting to noise.
We validate the proposed approach using a publicly available LDCT/PET dataset.
Experimental results demonstrate that HSANet achieves superior denoising
performance compared to existing methods, while maintaining a lightweight model
size suitable for deployment on GPUs with standard memory configurations. This
makes our approach highly practical for real-world clinical applications.

*Mustafa Yurdakul,Şakir Taşdemir*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A robust, explainable DL framework for brain tumor classification on MRI that combines EfficientNetV2 with an attention-based MLP‑Mixer, achieving ~99.5% accuracy with Grad-CAM interpretability on 3,064 images across three tumor types, evaluated via five-fold CV.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early and accurate brain tumor diagnosis is critical due to high mortality; MRI interpretation is expertise-dependent and error-prone, necessitating automated, reliable, and explainable diagnostic tools.

Method: The study screened nine CNN backbones and selected EfficientNetV2 as the base. An attention-based MLP-Mixer module was integrated into EfficientNetV2. The model was trained and evaluated on a publicly available Figshare MRI dataset (3,064 T1-weighted contrast-enhanced images, three tumor types) using five-fold cross-validation. Grad-CAM was used for interpretability to visualize decision regions. The approach was compared against basic CNNs and literature baselines.

Result: Final model achieved 99.50% accuracy, 99.47% precision, 99.52% recall, and 99.49% F1 score. It outperformed competing methods reported in the literature. Grad-CAM visualizations indicated the model focuses on clinically relevant regions of the MRI, supporting interpretability and reliability.

Conclusion: The proposed EfficientNetV2 + attention-based MLP-Mixer approach yields high diagnostic performance with strong interpretability, making it a robust candidate for clinical decision support in brain tumor classification.

Abstract: Brain tumors are serious health problems that require early diagnosis due to
their high mortality rates. Diagnosing tumors by examining Magnetic Resonance
Imaging (MRI) images is a process that requires expertise and is prone to
error. Therefore, the need for automated diagnosis systems is increasing day by
day. In this context, a robust and explainable Deep Learning (DL) model for the
classification of brain tumors is proposed. In this study, a publicly available
Figshare dataset containing 3,064 T1-weighted contrast-enhanced brain MRI
images of three tumor types was used. First, the classification performance of
nine well-known CNN architectures was evaluated to determine the most effective
backbone. Among these, EfficientNetV2 demonstrated the best performance and was
selected as the backbone for further development. Subsequently, an
attention-based MLP-Mixer architecture was integrated into EfficientNetV2 to
enhance its classification capability. The performance of the final model was
comprehensively compared with basic CNNs and the methods in the literature.
Additionally, Grad-CAM visualization was used to interpret and validate the
decision-making process of the proposed model. The proposed model's performance
was evaluated using the five-fold cross-validation method. The proposed model
demonstrated superior performance with 99.50% accuracy, 99.47% precision,
99.52% recall and 99.49% F1 score. The results obtained show that the model
outperforms the studies in the literature. Moreover, Grad-CAM visualizations
demonstrate that the model effectively focuses on relevant regions of MRI
images, thus improving interpretability and clinical reliability. A robust deep
learning model for clinical decision support systems has been obtained by
combining EfficientNetV2 and attention-based MLP-Mixer, providing high accuracy
and interpretability in brain tumor classification.

### [136] [VIM-GS: Visual-Inertial Monocular Gaussian Splatting via Object-level Guidance in Large Scenes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06685)
*Shengkai Zhang,Yuhe Liu,Guanjun Wu,Jianhua He,Xinggang Wang,Mozi Chen,Kezhong Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VIM-GS enhances Gaussian Splatting (GS) for large-scene novel-view synthesis using monocular RGBs by fusing accurate sparse depth from visual-inertial SfM with dense, but coarse, depth from monocular foundation models. It introduces an object-segmented depth propagation and a dynamic-depth refinement module to produce high-quality depth for GS rendering and handles dynamic objects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GS with monocular input struggles in large scenes due to lack of reliable depth: LFMs provide dense depth but are inconsistent and error-prone for distant or texture-ambiguous regions; monocular depth guidance is therefore weak and fails to scale to large environments.

Method: Leverage sparse SfM depth as an accurate anchor, refine dense LFM depth to dense, per-pixel depth guided by object segmentation, render missing depth via object-based propagation, and apply a dynamic-depth refinement module to correct crippled SfM depth for dynamic objects while refining coarse LFM depth, all within a Gaussian Splatting-based NVS pipeline.

Result: Experiments on public and customized datasets show superior rendering quality of VIM-GS for large-scene NVS compared to baselines.

Conclusion: Integrating sparse SfM depth with dense LFM depth through object-segmented propagation and dynamic refinement effectively enables high-quality Gaussian Splatting-based NVS in large environments using monocular imagery.

Abstract: VIM-GS is a Gaussian Splatting (GS) framework using monocular images for
novel-view synthesis (NVS) in large scenes. GS typically requires accurate
depth to initiate Gaussian ellipsoids using RGB-D/stereo cameras. Their limited
depth sensing range makes it difficult for GS to work in large scenes.
Monocular images, however, lack depth to guide the learning and lead to
inferior NVS results. Although large foundation models (LFMs) for monocular
depth estimation are available, they suffer from cross-frame inconsistency,
inaccuracy for distant scenes, and ambiguity in deceptive texture cues. This
paper aims to generate dense, accurate depth images from monocular RGB inputs
for high-definite GS rendering. The key idea is to leverage the accurate but
sparse depth from visual-inertial Structure-from-Motion (SfM) to refine the
dense but coarse depth from LFMs. To bridge the sparse input and dense output,
we propose an object-segmented depth propagation algorithm that renders the
depth of pixels of structured objects. Then we develop a dynamic depth
refinement module to handle the crippled SfM depth of dynamic objects and
refine the coarse LFM depth. Experiments using public and customized datasets
demonstrate the superior rendering quality of VIM-GS in large scenes.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: An automated deep learning pipeline (ARTSS) for RA radiographic Sharp Scoring (TSS) on full-hand X-rays, addressing joint disappearance and variable image sequences, achieving 99% joint-ID accuracy and ViT-based TSS prediction with low error, using 970 patients with 3-fold CV and external testing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reduce inter- and intra-observer variability and time burden in TSS scoring; accommodate variable joint counts and missing joints in RA radiographs.

Method: A four-stage pipeline: 1) image pre-processing and re-orientation with ResNet50; 2) hand segmentation using UNet.3; 3) joint identification via YOLOv7; 4) TSS prediction using CNNs (VGG16/VGG19/ResNet50/DenseNet201/EfficientNetB0) and Vision Transformer. Training used 3-fold cross-validation (452 train, 227 val per fold) and external testing with 291 unseen subjects; evaluation metrics include IoU, MAP, MAE, RMSE, and Huber loss; ground truth is the average TSS from two radiologists.

Result: Joint identification accuracy reached 99%; ViT achieved the best TSS prediction with a notably low Huber loss of 0.87, indicating strong predictive accuracy and robustness across variable joint counts and potential reduction in reader variability.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that deep learning can effectively automate RA TSS scoring from full-hand X-rays, reducing inter- and intra-reader variability, saving time, and supporting rheumatologists in making more informed decisions; the framework addresses challenges of joint disappearance and variable joint counts, with promising clinical applicability.

Abstract: Assessing the severity of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) using the Total Sharp/Van
Der Heijde Score (TSS) is crucial, but manual scoring is often time-consuming
and subjective. This study introduces an Automated Radiographic Sharp Scoring
(ARTSS) framework that leverages deep learning to analyze full-hand X-ray
images, aiming to reduce inter- and intra-observer variability. The research
uniquely accommodates patients with joint disappearance and variable-length
image sequences. We developed ARTSS using data from 970 patients, structured
into four stages: I) Image pre-processing and re-orientation using ResNet50,
II) Hand segmentation using UNet.3, III) Joint identification using YOLOv7, and
IV) TSS prediction using models such as VGG16, VGG19, ResNet50, DenseNet201,
EfficientNetB0, and Vision Transformer (ViT). We evaluated model performance
with Intersection over Union (IoU), Mean Average Precision (MAP), mean absolute
error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and Huber loss. The average TSS
from two radiologists was used as the ground truth. Model training employed
3-fold cross-validation, with each fold consisting of 452 training and 227
validation samples, and external testing included 291 unseen subjects. Our
joint identification model achieved 99% accuracy. The best-performing model,
ViT, achieved a notably low Huber loss of 0.87 for TSS prediction. Our results
demonstrate the potential of deep learning to automate RA scoring, which can
significantly enhance clinical practice. Our approach addresses the challenge
of joint disappearance and variable joint numbers, offers timesaving benefits,
reduces inter- and intra-reader variability, improves radiologist accuracy, and
aids rheumatologists in making more informed decisions.

Motivation: Existing SIAS methods produce coarse, texture-poor anomalies that poorly align with backgrounds and lack fine-grained pixel-level details, limiting downstream segmentation performance.

Method: Introduce an anomaly inference strategy using clean background information as a prior to guide the denoising distribution; employ a graded diffusion framework with an anomaly-only branch to record local anomalies during forward and reverse processes; apply explicit mask alignment (EMA) to progressively align synthesized anomalies with the background for context-consistent generations.

Result: STAGE achieves state-of-the-art performance in SIAS on MVTec and BTAD, which translates to improved downstream anomaly segmentation.

Conclusion: STAGE addresses key limitations of prior SIAS methods by producing context-consistent, structurally coherent, fine-grained anomalies through background-guided diffusion, anomaly-level recording, and progressive mask alignment.

Abstract: Segmentation-oriented Industrial Anomaly Synthesis (SIAS) plays a pivotal
role in enhancing the performance of downstream anomaly segmentation, as it
provides an effective means of expanding abnormal data. However, existing SIAS
methods face several critical limitations: (i) the synthesized anomalies often
lack intricate texture details and fail to align precisely with the surrounding
background, and (ii) they struggle to generate fine-grained, pixel-level
anomalies. To address these challenges, we propose Segmentation-oriented
Anomaly synthesis via Graded diffusion with Explicit mask alignment, termed
STAGE. STAGE introduces a novel anomaly inference strategy that incorporates
clean background information as a prior to guide the denoising distribution,
enabling the model to more effectively distinguish and highlight abnormal
foregrounds. Furthermore, it employs a graded diffusion framework with an
anomaly-only branch to explicitly record local anomalies during both the
forward and reverse processes, ensuring that subtle anomalies are not
overlooked. Finally, STAGE incorporates the explicit mask alignment (EMA)
strategy to progressively align the synthesized anomalies with the background,
resulting in context-consistent and structurally coherent generations.
Extensive experiments on the MVTec and BTAD datasets demonstrate that STAGE
achieves state-of-the-art performance in SIAS, which in turn enhances
downstream anomaly segmentation.

*Morteza Kiani Haftlang,Mohammadhossein Malmir,Foroutan Parand,Umberto Michelucci,Safouane El Ghazouali*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Lightweight end-to-end real-time binary medical image segmentation model: a shallow Swin-like encoder with a U-Net-like decoder, pre-trained with Barlow Twins, achieving competitive accuracy with fewer parameters and faster inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the mismatch between accuracy and real-time requirements in medical image segmentation; traditional CNNs have limited global context; transformers offer context but are computationally heavy; need efficient models for resource-limited clinical settings.

Method: Architectural design: a shallow Swin-Transformer–style encoder, a U-Net–style decoder, skip connections; self-supervised pretraining using Barlow Twins to learn robust features with limited labeled data, followed by end-to-end fine-tuning for binary segmentation; evaluation on benchmark tasks; code available.

Result: Achieves competitive accuracy with significantly fewer parameters and faster inference than heavier architectures like Swin Transformer or standard U-Net; suitable for real-time deployment in clinical environments.

Conclusion: Demonstrates that a lightweight, self-supervised pretraining strategy can yield practical, real-time-capable segmentation models without sacrificing performance; supports deployment in resource-constrained settings.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation is a critical task in clinical workflows,
particularly for the detection and delineation of pathological regions. While
convolutional architectures like U-Net have become standard for such tasks,
their limited receptive field restricts global context modeling. Recent efforts
integrating transformers have addressed this, but often result in deep,
computationally expensive models unsuitable for real-time use. In this work, we
present a novel end-to-end lightweight architecture designed specifically for
real-time binary medical image segmentation. Our model combines a Swin
Transformer-like encoder with a U-Net-like decoder, connected via skip pathways
to preserve spatial detail while capturing contextual information. Unlike
existing designs such as Swin Transformer or U-Net, our architecture is
significantly shallower and competitively efficient. To improve the encoder's
ability to learn meaningful features without relying on large amounts of
labeled data, we first train it using Barlow Twins, a self-supervised learning
method that helps the model focus on important patterns by reducing unnecessary
repetition in the learned features. After this pretraining, we fine-tune the
entire model for our specific task. Experiments on benchmark binary
segmentation tasks demonstrate that our model achieves competitive accuracy
with substantially reduced parameter count and faster inference, positioning it
as a practical alternative for deployment in real-time and resource-limited
clinical environments. The code for our method is available at Github

### [141] [Zero-shot 3D-Aware Trajectory-Guided image-to-video generation via Test-Time Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06723)
*Ruicheng Zhang,Jun Zhou,Zunnan Xu,Zihao Liu,Jiehui Huang,Mingyang Zhang,Yu Sun,Xiu Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Zo3T introduces a zero-shot test-time-training framework for trajectory-guided image-to-video generation with three innovations: 1) 3D-Aware Kinematic Projection, 2) Trajectory-Guided Test-Time LoRA, and 3) Guidance Field Rectification, to improve 3D realism and motion accuracy without annotated-data fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing trajectory-guided I2V methods either require expensive fine-tuning on scarce annotated data or rely on latent-space manipulations that neglect 3D perspective, causing unrealistic motion and misalignment with the model's noise predictions.

Method: Three core innovations: (1) 3D-Aware Kinematic Projection uses scene depth to derive perspective-correct affine transforms for target regions; (2) Trajectory-Guided Test-Time LoRA injects ephemeral LoRA adapters into the denoising network alongside latent state, guided by a regional feature consistency loss to co-adapt the model and enforce motion constraints; (3) Guidance Field Rectification optimizes the conditional guidance field via a one-step lookahead to refine the denoising trajectory toward the target motion.

Result: Demonstrates superior performance over both training-based and zero-shot methods, delivering improved 3D realism and motion accuracy in trajectory-controlled I2V while avoiding costly fine-tuning.

Conclusion: Zo3T offers an effective, data-efficient approach for trajectory-controlled I2V generation through 3D-aware transformations, dynamic test-time adaptation (LoRA), and guided optimization, achieving better fidelity and on-manifold adherence than prior approaches.

Abstract: Trajectory-Guided image-to-video (I2V) generation aims to synthesize videos
that adhere to user-specified motion instructions. Existing methods typically
rely on computationally expensive fine-tuning on scarce annotated datasets.
Although some zero-shot methods attempt to trajectory control in the latent
space, they may yield unrealistic motion by neglecting 3D perspective and
creating a misalignment between the manipulated latents and the network's noise
predictions. To address these challenges, we introduce Zo3T, a novel zero-shot
test-time-training framework for trajectory-guided generation with three core
innovations: First, we incorporate a 3D-Aware Kinematic Projection, leveraging
inferring scene depth to derive perspective-correct affine transformations for
target regions. Second, we introduce Trajectory-Guided Test-Time LoRA, a
mechanism that dynamically injects and optimizes ephemeral LoRA adapters into
the denoising network alongside the latent state. Driven by a regional feature
consistency loss, this co-adaptation effectively enforces motion constraints
while allowing the pre-trained model to locally adapt its internal
representations to the manipulated latent, thereby ensuring generative fidelity
and on-manifold adherence. Finally, we develop Guidance Field Rectification,
which refines the denoising evolutionary path by optimizing the conditional
guidance field through a one-step lookahead strategy, ensuring efficient
generative progression towards the target trajectory. Zo3T significantly
enhances 3D realism and motion accuracy in trajectory-controlled I2V
generation, demonstrating superior performance over existing training-based and
zero-shot approaches.

### [142] [Co-Seg: Mutual Prompt-Guided Collaborative Learning for Tissue and Nuclei Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06740)
*Qing Xu,Wenting Duan,Zhen Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Co-Seg introduces a dual-task co-segmentation framework that jointly segments tissue regions and nuclei instances by mutual reinforcement, using a region-aware prompt encoder and a mutual prompt mask decoder to enhance semantic and instance segmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tissue semantic segmentation and nuclei instance segmentation are typically treated separately, ignoring the intrinsic relationship between tissue context and cellular morphology, which limits histopathology understanding.

Method: Propose a co-segmentation paradigm with RP-Encoder to supply high-quality semantic/instance region prompts as priors, and MP-Decoder that uses cross-guidance to jointly compute semantic and instance masks for tissues and nuclei.

Result: On the PUMA dataset, Co-Seg outperforms state-of-the-art methods in semantic, instance, and panoptic segmentation of tumor tissues and nuclei instances; source code released.

Conclusion: Joint tissue-nuclei segmentation via co-segmentation and cross-guidance effectively leverages inter-task relationships, improving histopathology understanding and segmentation performance.

Abstract: Histopathology image analysis is critical yet challenged by the demand of
segmenting tissue regions and nuclei instances for tumor microenvironment and
cellular morphology analysis. Existing studies focused on tissue semantic
segmentation or nuclei instance segmentation separately, but ignored the
inherent relationship between these two tasks, resulting in insufficient
histopathology understanding. To address this issue, we propose a Co-Seg
framework for collaborative tissue and nuclei segmentation. Specifically, we
introduce a novel co-segmentation paradigm, allowing tissue and nuclei
segmentation tasks to mutually enhance each other. To this end, we first devise
a region-aware prompt encoder (RP-Encoder) to provide high-quality semantic and
instance region prompts as prior constraints. Moreover, we design a mutual
prompt mask decoder (MP-Decoder) that leverages cross-guidance to strengthen
the contextual consistency of both tasks, collaboratively computing semantic
and instance segmentation masks. Extensive experiments on the PUMA dataset
demonstrate that the proposed Co-Seg surpasses state-of-the-arts in the
semantic, instance and panoptic segmentation of tumor tissues and nuclei
instances. The source code is available at https://github.com/xq141839/Co-Seg.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: IRG (Interleaving Reasoning Generation) introduces an interleaved thinking-and-synthesis process to improve Text-to-Image generation, with IRGL training on IRGL-300K data in two stages, achieving state-of-the-art results on multiple benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To close the gap between advanced instruction-following/detail preservation in tightly coupled models and broader multimodal systems by embedding reasoning steps into generation, using interleaved text-based thinking and image synthesis.

Method: IRG alternates between text-based reasoning to guide an initial image and subsequent textual reflection to refine details, implemented via a two-stage IRGL training pipeline. The IRGL-300K dataset covers six learning modes spanning think-and-generate and full thinking-image trajectories. The approach starts from a unified foundation model capable of emitting interleaved text-image outputs and first strengthens thinking/reflection before fine-tuning on full thinking-image trajectories.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance with absolute gains of 5-10 points on GenEval, WISE, TIIF, GenAI-Bench, and OneIG-EN, along with notable improvements in visual quality and fine-grained fidelity.

Conclusion: IRG/IRGL provide a promising direction for unified multimodal generation with robust instruction-following and detail preservation, and the authors plan to release code, model weights, and IRGL-300K datasets.

Abstract: Unified multimodal understanding and generation models recently have achieve
significant improvement in image generation capability, yet a large gap remains
in instruction following and detail preservation compared to systems that
tightly couple comprehension with generation such as GPT-4o. Motivated by
recent advances in interleaving reasoning, we explore whether such reasoning
can further improve Text-to-Image (T2I) generation. We introduce Interleaving
Reasoning Generation (IRG), a framework that alternates between text-based
thinking and image synthesis: the model first produces a text-based thinking to
guide an initial image, then reflects on the result to refine fine-grained
details, visual quality, and aesthetics while preserving semantics. To train
IRG effectively, we propose Interleaving Reasoning Generation Learning (IRGL),
which targets two sub-goals: (1) strengthening the initial think-and-generate
stage to establish core content and base quality, and (2) enabling high-quality
textual reflection and faithful implementation of those refinements in a
subsequent image. We curate IRGL-300K, a dataset organized into six decomposed
learning modes that jointly cover learning text-based thinking, and full
thinking-image trajectories. Starting from a unified foundation model that
natively emits interleaved text-image outputs, our two-stage training first
builds robust thinking and reflection, then efficiently tunes the IRG pipeline
in the full thinking-image trajectory data. Extensive experiments show SoTA
performance, yielding absolute gains of 5-10 points on GenEval, WISE, TIIF,
GenAI-Bench, and OneIG-EN, alongside substantial improvements in visual quality
and fine-grained fidelity. The code, model weights and datasets will be
released in: https://github.com/Osilly/Interleaving-Reasoning-Generation .

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automate pothole detection to enhance road maintenance, safety, and resource allocation by analyzing road images with deep feature extraction.

Method: Preprocess data (standardization, normalization, augmentation). Build a transfer-learning model blending ResNet50, EfficientNet, and RegNet. Compare against Random Forest, MLP, SVM, and LightGBM using metrics: Accuracy, Recall, Precision, F1-score, FPS.

Result: The proposed transfer-learning model achieved high accuracy and computational efficiency, outperforming traditional models on the given test sets (97.78% on 90 samples; 98.89% on 900 samples).

Conclusion: A high‑performance, efficient pothole recognition approach via transfer learning with carefully chosen architectures and preprocessing, suitable for rapid deployment in road-condition monitoring.

Abstract: With the rapid development of computer vision and machine learning, automated
methods for pothole detection and recognition based on image and video data
have received significant attention. It is of great significance for social
development to conduct an in-depth analysis of road images through feature
extraction, thereby achieving automatic identification of the pothole condition
in new images. Consequently, this is the main issue addressed in this study.
Based on preprocessing techniques such as standardization, normalization, and
data augmentation applied to the collected raw dataset, we continuously
improved the network model based on experimental results. Ultimately, we
constructed a deep learning feature extraction network
ResNet50-EfficientNet-RegNet model based on transfer learning. This model
exhibits high classification accuracy and computational efficiency. In terms of
model evaluation, this study employed a comparative evaluation approach by
comparing the performance of the proposed transfer learning model with other
models, including Random Forest, MLP, SVM, and LightGBM. The comparison
analysis was conducted based on metrics such as Accuracy, Recall, Precision,
F1-score, and FPS, to assess the classification performance of the transfer
learning model proposed in this paper. The results demonstrate that our model
exhibits high performance in terms of recognition speed and accuracy,
surpassing the performance of other models. Through careful parameter selection
and model optimization, our transfer learning model achieved a classification
accuracy of 97.78% (88/90) on the initial set of 90 test samples and 98.89%
(890/900) on the expanded test set.

*Wenhao Li,Mengyuan Liu,Hong Liu,Pichao Wang,Shijian Lu,Nicu Sebe*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduces Hierarchical Hourglass Tokenizer (H2OT), a plug-and-play pruning-and-recovering framework that reduces video pose tokens with TPM and restores full sequences with TRM, enabling efficient transformer-based 3D pose estimation from videos with maintained accuracy; code available.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformers for video-based 3D pose estimation are computation-heavy, hindering deployment on resource-constrained devices.

Method: Proposes H2OT: a hierarchical process with Token Pruning Module (TPM) that dynamically selects representative tokens from video frames to remove redundancy, and Token Recovering Module (TRM) that expands the selected tokens back to full-length temporal resolution; designed to be compatible with seq2seq and seq2frame pipelines; plug-and-play with various pruning/recovery strategies.

Result: Empirical results on multiple benchmarks show improved efficiency and accuracy; it reveals full pose sequences are unnecessary while achieving high performance; code and models provided.

Conclusion: H2OT provides a general, efficient approach to video-based 3D pose estimation, enabling fast inference on resource-constrained devices without sacrificing accuracy, and encourages token-level pruning/recovery in VPTs.

Abstract: Transformers have been successfully applied in the field of video-based 3D
human pose estimation. However, the high computational costs of these video
pose transformers (VPTs) make them impractical on resource-constrained devices.
In this paper, we present a hierarchical plug-and-play pruning-and-recovering
framework, called Hierarchical Hourglass Tokenizer (H$_{2}$OT), for efficient
transformer-based 3D human pose estimation from videos. H$_{2}$OT begins with
progressively pruning pose tokens of redundant frames and ends with recovering
full-length sequences, resulting in a few pose tokens in the intermediate
transformer blocks and thus improving the model efficiency. It works with two
key modules, namely, a Token Pruning Module (TPM) and a Token Recovering Module
(TRM). TPM dynamically selects a few representative tokens to eliminate the
redundancy of video frames, while TRM restores the detailed spatio-temporal
information based on the selected tokens, thereby expanding the network output
to the original full-length temporal resolution for fast inference. Our method
is general-purpose: it can be easily incorporated into common VPT models on
both seq2seq and seq2frame pipelines while effectively accommodating different
token pruning and recovery strategies. In addition, our H$_{2}$OT reveals that
maintaining the full pose sequence is unnecessary, and a few pose tokens of
representative frames can achieve both high efficiency and estimation accuracy.
Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate both the
effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method. Code and models are
available at https://github.com/NationalGAILab/HoT.

*Yufeng Cheng,Wenxu Wu,Shaojin Wu,Mengqi Huang,Fei Ding,Qian He*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UMO reframes multi-identity generation as a global assignment optimization to preserve identity fidelity and reduce confusion across scalable references, improving consistency and achieving state-of-the-art identity preservation among open-source methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Faces are highly sensitive to identity; existing image customization struggles to maintain consistent identity across multiple reference images, limiting scalability and causing identity confusion.

Method: Introduce a multi-to-multi matching paradigm that cast generation as a global assignment optimization; use reinforcement learning on diffusion models to align identities; build a scalable customization dataset with multi-reference images (synthetic and real); propose a new metric to measure identity confusion.

Result: Extensive experiments show that UMO improves identity consistency and reduces identity confusion across several customization methods, achieving new state-of-the-art for identity preservation among open-source approaches.

Conclusion: UMO enables scalable, high-fidelity identity preservation in image customization, generalizes to existing methods, and provides a new evaluation metric; code and model are released.

Abstract: Recent advancements in image customization exhibit a wide range of
application prospects due to stronger customization capabilities. However,
since we humans are more sensitive to faces, a significant challenge remains in
preserving consistent identity while avoiding identity confusion with
multi-reference images, limiting the identity scalability of customization
models. To address this, we present UMO, a Unified Multi-identity Optimization
framework, designed to maintain high-fidelity identity preservation and
alleviate identity confusion with scalability. With "multi-to-multi matching"
paradigm, UMO reformulates multi-identity generation as a global assignment
optimization problem and unleashes multi-identity consistency for existing
image customization methods generally through reinforcement learning on
diffusion models. To facilitate the training of UMO, we develop a scalable
customization dataset with multi-reference images, consisting of both
synthesised and real parts. Additionally, we propose a new metric to measure
identity confusion. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UMO not only
improves identity consistency significantly, but also reduces identity
confusion on several image customization methods, setting a new
state-of-the-art among open-source methods along the dimension of identity
preserving. Code and model: https://github.com/bytedance/UMO

Motivation: Event cameras offer benefits but are costly and lack autofocus. There is a need for accessible prototype tools and datasets. Bypassing the ISP and using raw Bayer data preserves dynamic range and resolution for accurate event generation.

Method: Builds on the DVS-Voltmeter model with a configurable simulation framework optimized for embedded platforms. Develops a data acquisition pipeline to synchronously record raw, RGB, and event streams, enabling real-time operation on a Raspberry Pi and providing user-friendly parameter tuning.

Conclusion: Raw2Event provides an affordable, scalable platform for development and evaluation of event-based vision, facilitating early-stage prototyping, autofocus-enabled systems, and synchronized data collection for datasets.

Abstract: Event cameras offer unique advantages such as high temporal resolution, low
latency, and high dynamic range, making them more and more popular for vision
tasks under challenging light conditions. However, their high cost, limited
resolution, and lack of features such as autofocus hinder their broad adoption,
particularly for early-stage development and prototyping. In this work, we
present Raw2Event, a complete hardware-software system that enables real-time
event generation from low-cost raw frame-based cameras. By leveraging direct
access to raw Bayer data and bypassing traditional image signal processors
(ISP), our system is able to utilize the full potential of camera hardware,
delivering higher dynamic range, higher resolution, and more faithful output
than RGB-based frame-to-event converters.
  Built upon the DVS-Voltmeter model, Raw2Event features a configurable
simulation framework optimized for deployment on embedded platforms. We further
design a data acquisition pipeline that supports synchronized recording of raw,
RGB, and event streams, facilitating downstream evaluation and dataset
creation. Experimental results show that Raw2Event can generate event streams
closely resembling those from real event cameras, while benefiting from higher
resolution and autofocus capabilities. The system also supports user-intuitive
parameter tuning, enabling flexible adaptation to various application
requirements. Finally, we deploy the system on a Raspberry Pi for real-time
operation, providing a scalable and cost-effective solution for event-based
vision research and early-stage system development.

Result: Contextual Contrastive Learning with the proposed hybrid architecture achieved state-of-the-art performance: 88% accuracy and F1 0.8815; the model handles fine-grained distinctions (e.g., PG-13 vs R) better than baselines; robustness across the tested loss functions demonstrates versatility; effective for real-time MPAA rating classification in a web app.

Conclusion: The proposed CNN-LSTM with Bahdanau attention and contextual contrastive learning provides a robust and deployable solution for automated MPAA rating classification, offering improved discrimination, adaptability, and practical applicability for streaming platforms.

Abstract: The rapid growth of visual content consumption across platforms necessitates
automated video classification for age-suitability standards like the MPAA
rating system (G, PG, PG-13, R). Traditional methods struggle with large
labeled data requirements, poor generalization, and inefficient feature
learning. To address these challenges, we employ contrastive learning for
improved discrimination and adaptability, exploring three frameworks: Instance
Discrimination, Contextual Contrastive Learning, and Multi-View Contrastive
Learning. Our hybrid architecture integrates an LRCN (CNN+LSTM) backbone with a
Bahdanau attention mechanism, achieving state-of-the-art performance in the
Contextual Contrastive Learning framework, with 88% accuracy and an F1 score of
0.8815. By combining CNNs for spatial features, LSTMs for temporal modeling,
and attention mechanisms for dynamic frame prioritization, the model excels in
fine-grained borderline distinctions, such as differentiating PG-13 and R-rated
content. We evaluate the model's performance across various contrastive loss
functions, including NT-Xent, NT-logistic, and Margin Triplet, demonstrating
the robustness of our proposed architecture. To ensure practical application,

Method: Create a dataset of 4,379 Reddit memes annotated for dark humor, target category (gender, mental health, violence, race, disability, and other), and a three-level intensity rating (mild, moderate, severe). Build a reasoning-augmented framework: a Large Vision-Language Model generates structured explanations; a Role-Reversal Self-Loop refines explanations by adopting the author's perspective; extract textual features from OCR transcripts and the refined reasoning; extract visual features with a vision transformer; fuse text, image, and reasoning streams using a Tri-stream Cross-Reasoning Network (TCRNet) with pairwise attention to produce a unified representation for classification.

Result: The proposed approach outperforms strong baselines on three tasks: dark humor detection, target identification, and intensity prediction.

Conclusion: The dataset, annotations, and code are released to advance multimodal humor understanding and content moderation; the work provides a practical resource and a novel reasoning-augmented approach for detecting and characterizing dark humor in memes.

Abstract: Dark humor in online memes poses unique challenges due to its reliance on

introduce a novel dataset of 4,379 Reddit memes annotated for dark humor,
target category (gender, mental health, violence, race, disability, and other),
and a three-level intensity rating (mild, moderate, severe). Building on this
resource, we propose a reasoning-augmented framework that first generates
structured explanations for each meme using a Large Vision-Language Model
(VLM). Through a Role-Reversal Self-Loop, VLM adopts the author's perspective
to iteratively refine its explanations, ensuring completeness and alignment. We
then extract textual features from both the OCR transcript and the self-refined
reasoning via a text encoder, while visual features are obtained using a vision
transformer. A Tri-stream Cross-Reasoning Network (TCRNet) fuses these three
streams, text, image, and reasoning, via pairwise attention mechanisms,
producing a unified representation for classification. Experimental results
demonstrate that our approach outperforms strong baselines across three tasks:
dark humor detection, target identification, and intensity prediction. The
dataset, annotations, and code are released to facilitate further research in
multimodal humor understanding and content moderation. Code and Dataset are

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Curia, a radiology foundation model trained on the hospital's cross-sectional imaging data (≈150k exams, ~130 TB), achieves radiologist-level or better performance on 19 tasks (organs, brain hemorrhage, myocardial infarction, tumor-staging outcomes), across modalities and in low-data settings, with clinically meaningful emergent properties; weights released.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI in radiology relies on narrow, single-task models; there is a need for broad, modality-agnostic foundation models that generalize across imaging modalities and perform well in low-data regimes; a large, real-world radiology corpus is essential to realizing this potential.

Method: Train a large foundation model on the complete cross-sectional imaging output of a major hospital over several years (≈150k exams; ≈130 TB). Curate and evaluate on a newly developed external validation benchmark of 19 tasks, including organ identification, detection of brain hemorrhage and myocardial infarction, and tumor-staging outcome prediction. Compare performance to radiologists and recent foundation models and examine emergent cross-modality and low-data capabilities. Release base model weights publicly.

Result: Curia accurately identifies organs, detects brain hemorrhages and myocardial infarctions, and predicts tumor-staging outcomes; it meets or surpasses radiologists and recent foundation models and exhibits clinically meaningful emergent properties in cross-modality and low-data regimes.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that a radiology-focused foundation model trained on large-scale real-world data can generalize across modalities and tasks, achieving competitive performance and enabling broader research and clinical deployment through publicly released weights.

Abstract: AI-assisted radiological interpretation is based on predominantly narrow,
single-task models. This approach is impractical for covering the vast spectrum
of imaging modalities, diseases, and radiological findings. Foundation models
(FMs) hold the promise of broad generalization across modalities and in
low-data settings. However, this potential has remained largely unrealized in
radiology. We introduce Curia, a foundation model trained on the entire
cross-sectional imaging output of a major hospital over several years, which to
our knowledge is the largest such corpus of real-world data-encompassing
150,000 exams (130 TB). On a newly curated 19-task external validation
benchmark, Curia accurately identifies organs, detects conditions like brain
hemorrhages and myocardial infarctions, and predicts outcomes in tumor staging.
Curia meets or surpasses the performance of radiologists and recent foundation
models, and exhibits clinically significant emergent properties in
cross-modality, and low-data regimes. To accelerate progress, we release our
base model's weights at https://huggingface.co/raidium/curia.

### [151] [UrbanTwin: High-Fidelity Synthetic Replicas of Roadside Lidar Datasets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06781)
*Muhammad Shahbaz,Shaurya Agarwal*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UrbanTwin provides high-fidelity synthetic lidar datasets derived from real roadside datasets, enabling training and evaluation with strong real-world alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address data scarcity and domain shift in lidar perception by creating scalable, realistic, labeled synthetic data that can augment or potentially replace real datasets.

Method: Construct digital twins of three real lidar datasets, generate 10k frames per dataset with 3D boxes, segmentation, and tracking labels; simulate lidar sensing within geometry-aware road and intersection dynamics; assess alignment with real data via statistical/structural similarity; train 3D detection models on synthetic data and test on real data.

Result: Synthetic datasets show high similarity to real data; models trained on synthetic data achieve improved detection performance on real unseen data compared to models trained on real data alone.

Conclusion: UrbanTwin demonstrates that digitally synthesized lidar datasets can augment and potentially replace in-domain real-world data for lidar perception tasks, and are publicly available for benchmarking.

Abstract: This article presents UrbanTwin datasets - high-fidelity, realistic replicas
of three public roadside lidar datasets: LUMPI, V2X-Real-IC, and TUMTraf-I.
Each UrbanTwin dataset contains 10K annotated frames corresponding to one of
the public datasets. Annotations include 3D bounding boxes, instance
segmentation labels, and tracking IDs for six object classes, along with
semantic segmentation labels for nine classes. These datasets are synthesized
using emulated lidar sensors within realistic digital twins, modeled based on
surrounding geometry, road alignment at lane level, and the lane topology and
vehicle movement patterns at intersections of the actual locations
corresponding to each real dataset. Due to the precise digital twin modeling,
the synthetic datasets are well aligned with their real counterparts, offering
strong standalone and augmentative value for training deep learning models on
tasks such as 3D object detection, tracking, and semantic and instance
segmentation. We evaluate the alignment of the synthetic replicas through
statistical and structural similarity analysis with real data, and further
demonstrate their utility by training 3D object detection models solely on
synthetic data and testing them on real, unseen data. The high similarity
scores and improved detection performance, compared to the models trained on
real data, indicate that the UrbanTwin datasets effectively enhance existing
benchmark datasets by increasing sample size and scene diversity. In addition,
the digital twins can be adapted to test custom scenarios by modifying the
design and dynamics of the simulations. To our knowledge, these are the first
digitally synthesized datasets that can replace in-domain real-world datasets
for lidar perception tasks. UrbanTwin datasets are publicly available at
https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataverse/ucf-ut.

TL;DR: Fine-tuning BiRefNet on a curated anime dataset boosts background removal accuracy from 95.3% to 99.5% for anime-style images; code and data are released.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: State-of-the-art background removal models struggle with anime-style content due to hair complexity and transparency; domain adaptation via custom data is needed.

Method: Collected and annotated a dataset of 1,228 high-quality anime images; fine-tuned the open-source BiRefNet model on this dataset; evaluated on Pixel Accuracy.

Result: Background removal Pixel Accuracy increased from 95.3% to 99.5% on anime content; model and data are open-sourced.

Conclusion: Domain-specific data and fine-tuning can substantially improve background removal in specialized domains like anime; releasing resources benefits reproducibility.

Abstract: While state-of-the-art background removal models excel at realistic imagery,
they frequently underperform in specialized domains such as anime-style
content, where complex features like hair and transparency present unique
challenges. To address this limitation, we collected and annotated a custom
dataset of 1,228 high-quality anime images of characters and objects, and
fine-tuned the open-sourced BiRefNet model on this dataset. This resulted in
marked improvements in background removal accuracy for anime-style images,
increasing from 95.3% to 99.5% for our newly introduced Pixel Accuracy metric.
We are open-sourcing the code, the fine-tuned model weights, as well as the

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A native 3D point-promptable part segmentation model (P3-SAM) automates 3D part segmentation of arbitrary objects using a SAM-inspired architecture with multiple segmentation heads and an IoU predictor, plus an automatic mask-merging algorithm, trained on a large 3.7M-model dataset, achieving state-of-the-art robustness and precision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To automate and improve robustness of 3D part segmentation, addressing limitations of existing methods that struggle with complex objects and lack full automation.

Method: Introduce P3-SAM, a SAM-like architecture for 3D point clouds consisting of a feature extractor, multiple segmentation heads, and an IoU predictor. Add an algorithm to automatically select and merge predicted masks for part instance segmentation. Train on a large-scale dataset (~3.7 million models) with segmentation labels.

Result: The approach yields precise, robust segmentation on complex 3D objects and achieves state-of-the-art performance in 3D part segmentation tasks (as claimed).

Conclusion: P3-SAM enables fully automatic 3D part segmentation with interactive capabilities via the IoU predictor; demonstrates strong robustness and scalability on a large-scale 3D model dataset; code release planned.

Abstract: Segmenting 3D assets into their constituent parts is crucial for enhancing 3D
understanding, facilitating model reuse, and supporting various applications
such as part generation. However, current methods face limitations such as poor
robustness when dealing with complex objects and cannot fully automate the
process. In this paper, we propose a native 3D point-promptable part
segmentation model termed P3-SAM, designed to fully automate the segmentation
of any 3D objects into components. Inspired by SAM, P3-SAM consists of a
feature extractor, multiple segmentation heads, and an IoU predictor, enabling
interactive segmentation for users. We also propose an algorithm to
automatically select and merge masks predicted by our model for part instance
segmentation. Our model is trained on a newly built dataset containing nearly
3.7 million models with reasonable segmentation labels. Comparisons show that
our method achieves precise segmentation results and strong robustness on any
complex objects, attaining state-of-the-art performance. Our code will be
released soon.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a scalable real2sim2real framework using 3D generation to automate asset mining, generation, and rare-case data synthesis for autonomous driving, addressing diversity and generalization gaps in CARLA-like and NeuSim-like approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current CG-based simulators (e.g., CARLA) struggle with diversity and scalability for rare cases; learning-based methods (e.g., NeuSim) are limited to specific object categories and require extensive multi-sensor data. A generic, scalable solution for diverse object types is needed.

Method: Introduce a scalable real2sim2real system that uses 3D generation to automate asset mining, generation, and rare-case data synthesis, enabling broader coverage of object categories and scenarios.

Result: Abstract presents a conceptual/system proposal; no empirical results reported.

Conclusion: A scalable real2sim2real framework leveraging 3D generation can address diversity and scalability gaps in autonomous-driving sensor simulation.

Abstract: In the field of autonomous driving, sensor simulation is essential for
generating rare and diverse scenarios that are difficult to capture in
real-world environments. Current solutions fall into two categories: 1)
CG-based methods, such as CARLA, which lack diversity and struggle to scale to
the vast array of rare cases required for robust perception training; and 2)
learning-based approaches, such as NeuSim, which are limited to specific object
categories (vehicles) and require extensive multi-sensor data, hindering their
applicability to generic objects. To address these limitations, we propose a
scalable real2sim2real system that leverages 3D generation to automate asset
mining, generation, and rare-case data synthesis.

*George Ciubotariu,Zhuyun Zhou,Zongwei Wu,Radu Timofte*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduces MIORe and VAR-MIORe, two high-FPS multi-task motion restoration benchmarks with adaptive frame averaging based on optical flow; VAR-MIORe adds explicit motion amplitude control; both provide high-quality ground truth across diverse motion scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current motion restoration benchmarks suffer from limited frame rates, insufficient motion diversity, and lack of controllable motion magnitude, hindering robust evaluation of restoration, interpolation, and flow estimation.

Method: Capture sequences at 1000 FPS with professional optics; adaptively average frames using optical-flow metrics to produce realistic, consistent blur for MIORe; extend to VAR-MIORe by spanning a controllable motion magnitude range; provide high-resolution ground truth for multiple tasks (restoration, interpolation, optical flow estimation).

Result: Two benchmarks offering realistic motion blur under varied ego-motion and multi-subject dynamics, depth-dependent blur, and scalable ground truths; VAR-MIORe uniquely enables explicit control over motion amplitude, enabling controlled experimental studies.

Conclusion: MIORe and VAR-MIORe address key gaps in current benchmarks by delivering high-quality, controllable, multi-task motion datasets that enable next-generation evaluation for image and video restoration in both controlled and adverse conditions.

Abstract: We introduce MIORe and VAR-MIORe, two novel multi-task datasets that address
critical limitations in current motion restoration benchmarks. Designed with
high-frame-rate (1000 FPS) acquisition and professional-grade optics, our
datasets capture a broad spectrum of motion scenarios, which include complex
ego-camera movements, dynamic multi-subject interactions, and depth-dependent
blur effects. By adaptively averaging frames based on computed optical flow
metrics, MIORe generates consistent motion blur, and preserves sharp inputs for
video frame interpolation and optical flow estimation. VAR-MIORe further
extends by spanning a variable range of motion magnitudes, from minimal to
extreme, establishing the first benchmark to offer explicit control over motion
amplitude. We provide high-resolution, scalable ground truths that challenge
existing algorithms under both controlled and adverse conditions, paving the
way for next-generation research of various image and video restoration tasks.

*Simon Pezold,Jérôme A. Kurylec,Jan S. Liechti,Beat P. Müller,Joël L. Lavanchy*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Domain adaptation and multimodal integration of a foundation model (V-JEPA) improves surgical data tasks; finetuning on unlabeled domain videos and adding time-resolved OR data enhances performance; competitive baseline on HeiCo; code release.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Leverage generic foundation models for surgical data science; address scarcity of labeled data; exploit multimodal OR data.

Method: Use V-JEPA as single-modality backbone; finetune on unlabeled surgical videos; train separate encoder to map additional time-resolved OR data into shared space with V-JEPA; evaluate on in-house liver surgery for LOS and complications; HeiCo for phase recognition; compare pretrained baseline vs finetuned; multimodal integration vs baseline.

Result: Finetuning improves performance; adding OR streams improves performance on in-house data; HeiCo: pretrained video-only baseline competitive with top EndoVis2017; finetuning further increases accuracy.

Conclusion: Shows potential of using public generic foundation models in surgical data science; domain adaptation and multimodal data streams are beneficial; encourages further research and release.

Abstract: We investigate how both the adaptation of a generic foundation model via
transfer learning and the integration of complementary modalities from the
operating room (OR) can support surgical data science. To this end, we use
V-JEPA as the single-modality foundation of a multimodal model for minimally
invasive surgery support. We analyze how the model's downstream performance can
benefit (a) from finetuning on unlabeled surgical video data and (b) from
providing additional time-resolved data streams from the OR in a multimodal
setup.
  In an in-house dataset of liver surgery videos, we analyze the tasks of
predicting hospital length of stay and postoperative complications. In videos
of the public HeiCo dataset, we analyze the task of surgical phase recognition.
As a baseline, we apply pretrained V-JEPA to all tasks. We then finetune it on
unlabeled, held-out videos to investigate its change in performance after
domain adaptation. Following the idea of modular decision support networks, we
integrate additional data streams from the OR by training a separate encoder to
form a shared representation space with V-JEPA's embeddings.
  Our experiments show that finetuning on domain-specific data increases model
performance. On the in-house data, integrating additional time-resolved data
likewise benefits the model. On the HeiCo data, accuracy of the pretrained
video-only, single-modality baseline setup is on par with the top-performing
submissions of the EndoVis2017 challenge, while finetuning on domain-specific
data increases accuracy further. Our results thus demonstrate how surgical data
science can leverage public, generic foundation models. Likewise, they indicate
the potential of domain adaptation and of integrating suitable complementary
data streams from the OR. To support further research, we release our code and
model weights at https://github.com/DigitalSurgeryLab-Basel/ML-CDS-2025.

*Nabeyou Tadessa,Balaji Iyangar,Mashrur Chowdhury*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Adversarial perturbations significantly degrade traffic sign classification; FGSM and PGD vulnerabilities demonstrated on a CNN with 47 classes using the LISA dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traffic sign recognition is critical for safety; previous adversarial studies centered on simple datasets (e.g., MNIST); understanding vulnerability of real-world traffic sign models is essential for robust deployment.

Method: Train a CNN to classify 47 traffic signs on the LISA dataset; evaluate robustness with FGSM and PGD attacks, varying perturbation magnitude (epsilon) to measure accuracy drop.

Result: Accuracy declines sharply as perturbation magnitude increases, indicating high susceptibility to adversarial examples in traffic sign classification.

Conclusion: Findings motivate development of defense mechanisms tailored for traffic sign recognition systems and suggest avenues for robust real-world deployment.

Abstract: Adversarial attacks pose significant threats to machine learning models by
introducing carefully crafted perturbations that cause misclassification. While
prior work has primarily focused on MNIST and similar datasets, this paper
investigates the vulnerability of traffic sign classifiers using the LISA
Traffic Sign dataset. We train a convolutional neural network to classify 47
different traffic signs and evaluate its robustness against Fast Gradient Sign
Method (FGSM) and Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) attacks. Our results show a
sharp decline in classification accuracy as the perturbation magnitude
increases, highlighting the models susceptibility to adversarial examples. This
study lays the groundwork for future exploration into defense mechanisms
tailored for real-world traffic sign recognition systems.

### [159] [Matching Shapes Under Different Topologies: A Topology-Adaptive Deformation Guided Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06862)
*Aymen Merrouche,Stefanie Wuhrer,Edmond Boyer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A topology-adaptive deformation model for non-rigid 3D mesh matching that can handle topological artefacts by allowing topology changes; jointly optimizes a template topology and alignment under ARAP and bijective constraints, achieving robust matching without data priors and performing well on highly non-isometric shapes including noisy multi-view reconstructions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Topological artefacts in per-frame multi-view reconstructions undermine standard near-isometric or ARAP-based assumptions; there is a need for a matching method that adapts topology while establishing correspondences.

Method: Introduce a topology-adaptive deformation model that allows changes in topology; align shape pairs under ARAP constraints and bijective associations; joint optimization of a template mesh with adequate topology and its alignment to the target shapes to extract correspondences; no data-driven priors.

Result: Applicable to highly non-isometric shapes and shapes with topological artefacts; can outperform methods trained on large datasets in 3D alignment quality on real-world noisy data.

Conclusion: Extends non-rigid mesh matching to handle topological artefacts; robust in real-world scenarios; shows that topology adaptation combined with ARAP/bijective constraints can match or exceed learned approaches in certain settings.

Abstract: Non-rigid 3D mesh matching is a critical step in computer vision and computer
graphics pipelines. We tackle matching meshes that contain topological
artefacts which can break the assumption made by current approaches. While
Functional Maps assume the deformation induced by the ground truth
correspondences to be near-isometric, ARAP-like deformation-guided approaches
assume the latter to be ARAP. Neither assumption holds in certain topological
configurations of the input shapes. We are motivated by real-world scenarios
such as per-frame multi-view reconstructions, often suffering from topological
artefacts. To this end, we propose a topology-adaptive deformation model
allowing changes in shape topology to align shape pairs under ARAP and
bijective association constraints. Using this model, we jointly optimise for a
template mesh with adequate topology and for its alignment with the shapes to
be matched to extract correspondences. We show that, while not relying on any
data-driven prior, our approach applies to highly non-isometric shapes and
shapes with topological artefacts, including noisy per-frame multi-view
reconstructions, even outperforming methods trained on large datasets in 3D
alignment quality.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Selective Deblur-GAN preprocessing with YOLOv5-based LPD/CS+CR yields real-time, high-accuracy ALPR and enhanced robustness to blur; datasets released for training/testing (Iranian plates).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ALPR faces high variability, blur, and real-time constraints; need robust, fast deep-learning pipeline to improve detection and recognition accuracy while keeping compute low.

Method: Use a selective Deblur-GAN preprocessor before a YOLOv5-based license-plate detector, then perform integrated character segmentation (CS) and character recognition (CR). Train/test on blur ALPR datasets (Iranian plates) and publicly release the datasets.

Result: LPD accuracy ~95%; CR accuracy ~97%; detection time 0.026 seconds for both LP and CR stages; Deblur-GAN preprocessor improves detection accuracy by ~40% in blurred conditions.

Conclusion: The pipeline enables real-time, portable ALPR with high precision; Deblur-GAN preprocessing significantly boosts performance in blur scenarios; public datasets support validation.

Abstract: Automatic License-Plate Recognition (ALPR) plays a pivotal role in
Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) as a fundamental element of Smart
Cities. However, due to its high variability, ALPR faces challenging issues
more efficiently addressed by deep learning techniques. In this paper, a
selective Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) is proposed for deblurring in
the preprocessing step, coupled with the state-of-the-art You-Only-Look-Once
(YOLO)v5 object detection architectures for License-Plate Detection (LPD), and
the integrated Character Segmentation (CS) and Character Recognition (CR)
steps. The selective preprocessing bypasses unnecessary and sometimes
counter-productive input manipulations, while YOLOv5 LPD/CS+CR delivers high
accuracy and low computing cost. As a result, YOLOv5 achieves a detection time
of 0.026 seconds for both LP and CR detection stages, facilitating real-time
applications with exceptionally rapid responsiveness. Moreover, the proposed
model achieves accuracy rates of 95\% and 97\% in the LPD and CR detection
phases, respectively. Furthermore, the inclusion of the Deblur-GAN
pre-processor significantly improves detection accuracy by nearly 40\%,
especially when encountering blurred License Plates (LPs).To train and test the
learning components, we generated and publicly released our blur and ALPR
datasets (using Iranian license plates as a use-case), which are more
representative of close-to-real-life ad-hoc situations. The findings
demonstrate that employing the state-of-the-art YOLO model results in excellent
overall precision and detection time, making it well-suited for portable
applications. Additionally, integrating the Deblur-GAN model as a preliminary
processing step enhances the overall effectiveness of our comprehensive model,
particularly when confronted with blurred scenes captured by the camera as
input.

*Minheng Chen,Youyong Kong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A non-Euclidean spherical feature space for intraoperative 2D/3D registration improves accuracy and convergence by modeling geodesic distances on SO(4) and using differentiable Levenberg–Marquardt optimization for fast inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Euclidean approximations of pose distances in SE(3) distort manifold geometry and hinder convergence, especially under disturbances. A geometry-aware metric in a spherical manifold could better capture complex pose differences.

Method: Extract features with a CNN-Transformer encoder, project into spherical space, approximate geodesic distances using Riemannian distances in bi-invariant SO(4). Use fully differentiable Levenberg–Marquardt optimization for inference instead of standard gradient descent.

Result: Experiments on real and synthetic datasets show superior accuracy for both patient-specific and patient-agnostic registration scenarios.

Conclusion: Non-Euclidean spherical feature spaces enable a more expressive and geometrically consistent deep similarity metric for 2D/3D registration, improving accuracy and accelerating convergence.

Abstract: Intraoperative 2D/3D registration aligns preoperative 3D volumes with
real-time 2D radiographs, enabling accurate localization of instruments and
implants. A recent fully differentiable similarity learning framework
approximates geodesic distances on SE(3), expanding the capture range of
registration and mitigating the effects of substantial disturbances, but
existing Euclidean approximations distort manifold structure and slow
convergence. To address these limitations, we explore similarity learning in
non-Euclidean spherical feature spaces to better capture and fit complex
manifold structure. We extract feature embeddings using a CNN-Transformer
encoder, project them into spherical space, and approximate their geodesic
distances with Riemannian distances in the bi-invariant SO(4) space. This
enables a more expressive and geometrically consistent deep similarity metric,
enhancing the ability to distinguish subtle pose differences. During inference,
we replace gradient descent with fully differentiable Levenberg-Marquardt
optimization to accelerate convergence. Experiments on real and synthetic
datasets show superior accuracy in both patient-specific and patient-agnostic
scenarios.

*Cem Eteke,Alexander Griessel,Wolfgang Kellerer,Eckehard Steinbach*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A low-complexity blind image restoration adapter (BIR-Adapter) for diffusion models that uses degraded-image features extracted from the model itself, enhances self-attention with these features, and adds sampling guidance to reduce hallucinations, achieving competitive or better restoration with much lower complexity and broad compatibility across diffusion models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable effective blind image restoration using pre-trained diffusion priors without training extra feature extractors, leveraging the model's own robustness to degraded inputs and reducing computational complexity and hallucinations.

Method: Introduce BIR-Adapter that extracts features from degraded images via the diffusion model itself, extends the self-attention mechanism with these degraded features, and adds a sampling guidance mechanism to reduce hallucinations; designed as an adapter for easy integration into other diffusion models and applicable to tasks like super-resolution under unknown degradations.

Result: BIR-Adapter achieves competitive or superior performance compared with state-of-the-art methods on both synthetic and real-world degradations, while significantly reducing computational complexity; its adapter-based design enables integration into other diffusion models and broader restoration tasks.

Conclusion: BIR-Adapter provides an efficient, robust approach to blind image restoration with diffusion models by leveraging the model’s own feature representations and a sampling-guidance mechanism; it enables broader applicability and improved restoration under unknown degradations with low additional training requirements.

Abstract: This paper introduces BIR-Adapter, a low-complexity blind image restoration
adapter for diffusion models. The BIR-Adapter enables the utilization of the
prior of pre-trained large-scale diffusion models on blind image restoration
without training any auxiliary feature extractor. We take advantage of the
robustness of pretrained models. We extract features from degraded images via
the model itself and extend the self-attention mechanism with these degraded
features. We introduce a sampling guidance mechanism to reduce hallucinations.
We perform experiments on synthetic and real-world degradations and demonstrate
that BIR-Adapter achieves competitive or better performance compared to
state-of-the-art methods while having significantly lower complexity.
Additionally, its adapter-based design enables integration into other diffusion
models, enabling broader applications in image restoration tasks. We showcase
this by extending a super-resolution-only model to perform better under
additional unknown degradations.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FoMo4Wheat is a crop-domain vision foundation model pretrained with self-supervision on ImAg4Wheat, a 2.5M-image wheat dataset, achieving superior robustness and cross-task transfer on ten in-field tasks, outperforming general-domain pretrained models; demonstrates crop-specific foundation model potential and provides public resources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: General-domain pretrained backbones often fail to generalize in detailed crop-field perception due to fine canopy structures and varying field conditions; there is a need for crop-specific foundation models to improve robustness and enable cross-task, cross-species transfer.

Method: Self-supervised pretraining of FoMo4Wheat on the ImAg4Wheat dataset (2.5M high-resolution images from 30 global sites, 2,000+ genotypes, 500+ environmental conditions). Evaluate the resulting model across ten in-field canopy- and organ-level vision tasks; compare performance against state-of-the-art models pretrained on general-domain data.

Result: FoMo4Wheat consistently outperforms general-domain pretrained models across all ten tasks, with representations robust for wheat and transferrable to other crops and weeds.

Conclusion: Crop-specific foundation models (FoMo4Wheat) offer reliable in-field perception and indicate a path toward universal crop foundation models with cross-species and cross-task capabilities. The ImAg4Wheat dataset and FoMo4Wheat models are publicly available, enabling reproducibility and further research.

Abstract: Vision-driven field monitoring is central to digital agriculture, yet models
built on general-domain pretrained backbones often fail to generalize across
tasks, owing to the interaction of fine, variable canopy structures with
fluctuating field conditions. We present FoMo4Wheat, one of the first
crop-domain vision foundation model pretrained with self-supervision on
ImAg4Wheat, the largest and most diverse wheat image dataset to date (2.5
million high-resolution images collected over a decade at 30 global sites,
spanning >2,000 genotypes and >500 environmental conditions). This
wheat-specific pretraining yields representations that are robust for wheat and
transferable to other crops and weeds. Across ten in-field vision tasks at
canopy and organ levels, FoMo4Wheat models consistently outperform
state-of-the-art models pretrained on general-domain dataset. These results
demonstrate the value of crop-specific foundation models for reliable in-field
perception and chart a path toward a universal crop foundation model with
cross-species and cross-task capabilities. FoMo4Wheat models and the ImAg4Wheat
dataset are publicly available online: https://github.com/PheniX-Lab/FoMo4Wheat

### [164] [Standard vs. Modular Sampling: Best Practices for Reliable LLM Unlearning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05316)
*Praveen Bushipaka,Lucia Passaro,Tommaso Cucinotta*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper critiques standard LLM unlearning practices (single neighbor sets and 1:1 sampling) and introduces Modular Entity-Level Unlearning (MELU) with diverse neighbor sets, showing this yields better forget efficacy, preserves utility, and provides a more stable unlearning process.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmarks simplify retain data to a single neighbor set plus general knowledge, which underrepresents real-world data complexity and relationships. This simplification, along with common 1:1 or cyclic sampling, may mask trade-offs between forget efficacy and model utility and undermine stability.

Method: Systematic evaluation of prevailing practices: (i) varying neighbor-set design to include diverse relations, (ii) comparing sampling schemes (1:1 vs cyclic) and their stability, (iii) proposing and validating Modular Entity-Level Unlearning (MELU) as a modular alternative to cyclic sampling, with experiments across benchmarks.

Result: Diverse neighbor sets improve forget efficacy while maintaining utility. Standard 1:1 sampling is inefficient and can obscure important trade-offs. MELU, combined with robust algorithms, yields a clearer, more stable path to effective unlearning compared to baseline sampling strategies.

Conclusion: Adopt diverse neighbor-set designs and move away from 1:1 sampling toward MELU for robust unlearning. The modular entity-level approach provides a stable framework that better captures real-world data relationships and trade-offs.

Abstract: A conventional LLM Unlearning setting consists of two subsets -"forget" and
"retain", with the objectives of removing the undesired knowledge from the
forget set while preserving the remaining knowledge from the retain. In
privacy-focused unlearning research, a retain set is often further divided into
neighbor sets, containing either directly or indirectly connected to the forget
targets; and augmented by a general-knowledge set. A common practice in
existing benchmarks is to employ only a single neighbor set, with general
knowledge which fails to reflect the real-world data complexities and
relationships. LLM Unlearning typically involves 1:1 sampling or cyclic
iteration sampling. However, the efficacy and stability of these de facto
standards have not been critically examined. In this study, we systematically
evaluate these common practices. Our findings reveal that relying on a single
neighbor set is suboptimal and that a standard sampling approach can obscure
performance trade-offs. Based on this analysis, we propose and validate an
initial set of best practices: (1) Incorporation of diverse neighbor sets to
balance forget efficacy and model utility, (2) Standard 1:1 sampling methods
are inefficient and yield poor results, (3) Our proposed Modular Entity-Level
Unlearning (MELU) strategy as an alternative to cyclic sampling. We demonstrate
that this modular approach, combined with robust algorithms, provides a clear
and stable path towards effective unlearning.

### [165] [Feed Two Birds with One Scone: Exploiting Function-Space Regularization for Both OOD Robustness and ID Fine-Tuning Performance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05328)
*Xiang Yuan,Jun Shu,Deyu meng,Zongben Xu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: We propose a function-space regularization for robust fine-tuning that constrains the distance between the fine-tuned model and the pre-trained model in the function space using simulated OOD samples, plus a consistency regularization for perturbed inputs, yielding improved ID and OOD performance across CLIP backbones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing robust fine-tuning methods preserve pretrained weights, features, or logits but often fail to improve OOD robustness across different architectures because they do not optimize in the true function space used for downstream tasks; there is a need for regularization that aligns fine-tuning with the pre-trained function.

Method: Introduce a function-space distance regularization that penalizes divergence between the fine-tuned model and the pre-trained model under simulated OOD inputs, and add a consistency regularization to encourage stable predictions for perturbed samples.

Result: Empirical evaluation on multiple CLIP backbones shows consistent gains in ID fine-tuning performance and OOD robustness, outperforming existing regularization-based robust fine-tuning methods.

Conclusion: Function-space and consistency regularizations offer a robust fine-tuning strategy that preserves OOD robustness while improving ID performance across architectures.

Abstract: Robust fine-tuning aims to achieve competitive in-distribution (ID)
performance while maintaining the out-of-distribution (OOD) robustness of a
pre-trained model when transferring it to a downstream task. To remedy this,
most robust fine-tuning methods aim to preserve the pretrained weights,
features, or logits. However, we find that these methods cannot always improve
OOD robustness for different model architectures. This is due to the OOD
robustness requiring the model function to produce stable prediction for input
information of downstream tasks, while existing methods might serve as a poor
proxy for the optimization in the function space. Based on this finding, we
propose a novel regularization that constrains the distance of fine-tuning and
pre-trained model in the function space with the simulated OOD samples, aiming
to preserve the OOD robustness of the pre-trained model. Besides, to further
enhance the OOD robustness capability of the fine-tuning model, we introduce an
additional consistency regularization to promote stable predictions of
perturbed samples. Extensive experiments demonstrate our approach could
consistently improve both downstream task ID fine-tuning performance and OOD
robustness across a variety of CLIP backbones, outperforming existing
regularization-based robust fine-tuning methods.

### [166] [Safeguarding Graph Neural Networks against Topology Inference Attacks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05429)
*Jie Fu,Hong Yuan,Zhili Chen,Wendy Hui Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This work reveals topology privacy as a vulnerability in GNNs, introduces topology inference attacks (TIAs) that reconstruct graph structure from black-box GNN access, shows edge-level DP is inadequate, and presents Private Graph Reconstruction (PGR) as a bi-level optimization defense that preserves accuracy while reducing topology leakage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Topology privacy of graphs used in GNNs is underexplored and poses a serious risk, as attackers can infer the overall graph structure from model access, potentially exposing sensitive relationships. There is a need for defense mechanisms that protect graph topology without sacrificing performance.

Method: 1) Propose TIAs that reconstruct the training graph structure using only black-box queries to a trained GNN. 2) Evaluate vulnerabilities of edge-level differential privacy (DP) that targets edges but not global topology. 3) Introduce PGR, a bi-level optimization framework where a synthetic training graph is iteratively generated via meta-gradients while the GNN is trained on the evolving graph, aiming to minimize topology leakage while preserving accuracy.

Result: TIAs demonstrate that GNNs are highly vulnerable to topology inference. Edge-level DP methods either fail to mitigate leakage or damage accuracy. PGR significantly reduces topology leakage with minimal degradation to model performance, as validated by extensive experiments. Code is released.

Conclusion: Topology privacy is a real and practical threat in GNNs, and current edge-focused DP is insufficient. The proposed PGR framework offers a practical defense that protects graph topology while maintaining model accuracy, advancing privacy-preserving GNNs.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as powerful models for learning
from graph-structured data. However, their widespread adoption has raised
serious privacy concerns. While prior research has primarily focused on
edge-level privacy, a critical yet underexplored threat lies in topology
privacy - the confidentiality of the graph's overall structure. In this work,
we present a comprehensive study on topology privacy risks in GNNs, revealing
their vulnerability to graph-level inference attacks. To this end, we propose a
suite of Topology Inference Attacks (TIAs) that can reconstruct the structure
of a target training graph using only black-box access to a GNN model. Our
findings show that GNNs are highly susceptible to these attacks, and that
existing edge-level differential privacy mechanisms are insufficient as they
either fail to mitigate the risk or severely compromise model accuracy. To
address this challenge, we introduce Private Graph Reconstruction (PGR), a
novel defense framework designed to protect topology privacy while maintaining
model accuracy. PGR is formulated as a bi-level optimization problem, where a
synthetic training graph is iteratively generated using meta-gradients, and the
GNN model is concurrently updated based on the evolving graph. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that PGR significantly reduces topology leakage with
minimal impact on model accuracy. Our code is anonymously available at
https://github.com/JeffffffFu/PGR.

### [167] [Neural Breadcrumbs: Membership Inference Attacks on LLMs Through Hidden State and Attention Pattern Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05449)
*Disha Makhija,Manoj Ghuhan Arivazhagan,Vinayshekhar Bannihatti Kumar,Rashmi Gangadharaiah*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MemTrace shows internal transformer signals can enable strong membership inference (AUC ~0.85) even when model outputs seem safe, revealing hidden privacy leakage channels via hidden states and attention patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recent MIA results show little leakage from LLMs by output alone; this work investigates whether internal representations offer additional, possibly stronger, membership signals and thus a more complete privacy audit.

Method: Develop memTrace to extract neural breadcrumbs from transformer hidden states and attention patterns as models process candidate sequences, analyzing layer-wise representations, attention distributions, and cross-layer transitions to detect memorization fingerprints not captured by loss-based methods.

Result: Across multiple model families, memTrace achieves an average AUC of 0.85 on popular MIA benchmarks, indicating strong membership detection using internal signals.

Conclusion: Internal model behaviors reveal training data exposure even when outputs appear protected; highlights the need for privacy-preserving training techniques and deeper research into membership privacy for large language models.

Abstract: Membership inference attacks (MIAs) reveal whether specific data was used to
train machine learning models, serving as important tools for privacy auditing
and compliance assessment. Recent studies have reported that MIAs perform only
marginally better than random guessing against large language models,
suggesting that modern pre-training approaches with massive datasets may be
free from privacy leakage risks. Our work offers a complementary perspective to
these findings by exploring how examining LLMs' internal representations,
rather than just their outputs, may provide additional insights into potential
membership inference signals. Our framework, \emph{memTrace}, follows what we
call \enquote{neural breadcrumbs} extracting informative signals from
transformer hidden states and attention patterns as they process candidate
sequences. By analyzing layer-wise representation dynamics, attention
distribution characteristics, and cross-layer transition patterns, we detect
potential memorization fingerprints that traditional loss-based approaches may
not capture. This approach yields strong membership detection across several
model families achieving average AUC scores of 0.85 on popular MIA benchmarks.
Our findings suggest that internal model behaviors can reveal aspects of
training data exposure even when output-based signals appear protected,
highlighting the need for further research into membership privacy and the
development of more robust privacy-preserving training techniques for large
language models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Contextual bandit-based calibration to balance Spotify's home-page content-type mix (music, podcasts, audiobooks) driven by user context; mitigates historical music skew and adapts to time/device; claims improved engagement, especially for podcasts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Historical user data on Spotify's home page is skewed toward music, and user preferences for content types vary by context (time, day, device). A dynamic, context-aware calibration could improve balance and engagement.

Method: Use contextual bandits to learn per-user distributions over content types conditioned on context, calibrating the mix rather than relying on historical averages. Evaluated both offline and online.


Result: Reported improvements in precision and user engagement on the home page, with notable gains for under-represented content types such as podcasts.

Conclusion: Contextual-bandit calibration can dynamically adapt content-type distributions to context, improving personalization and engagement where data skew exists; feasible in offline and online settings.

Abstract: Spotify's Home page features a variety of content types, including music,
podcasts, and audiobooks. However, historical data is heavily skewed toward
music, making it challenging to deliver a balanced and personalized content
mix. Moreover, users' preference towards different content types may vary
depending on the time of day, the day of week, or even the device they use. We
propose a calibration method that leverages contextual bandits to dynamically
learn each user's optimal content type distribution based on their context and
preferences. Unlike traditional calibration methods that rely on historical
averages, our approach boosts engagement by adapting to how users interests in
different content types varies across contexts. Both offline and online results
demonstrate improved precision and user engagement with the Spotify Home page,
in particular with under-represented content types such as podcasts.

*Jia Wang,Xiao Wang,Chi Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PLanTS: a periodicity-aware SSL framework for multivariate time series that models irregular latent states and their transitions via period-aware multi-granularity patching, a generalized contrastive loss, and a next-transition prediction task.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MTS data are high-dimensional, scarce labels, and non-stationary. Existing SSL techniques focusing on augmentations or pointwise contrasts neglect the intrinsic periodic structure and latent state dynamics of MTS.

Method: Introduce a period-aware multi-granularity patching mechanism and a generalized contrastive loss to preserve instance- and state-level similarities across multiple temporal resolutions, plus a next-transition prediction pretext task to encode future state evolution.

Result: PLanTS consistently improves representation quality across diverse downstream tasks (classification, forecasting, trajectory tracking, anomaly detection) and offers superior runtime efficiency compared to DTW-based methods.

Conclusion: Modeling irregular latent states and their transitions with periodic structure enhances SSL for multivariate time series and yields robust, scalable representations.

Abstract: Multivariate time series (MTS) are ubiquitous in domains such as healthcare,
climate science, and industrial monitoring, but their high dimensionality,
limited labeled data, and non-stationary nature pose significant challenges for
conventional machine learning methods. While recent self-supervised learning
(SSL) approaches mitigate label scarcity by data augmentations or time
point-based contrastive strategy, they neglect the intrinsic periodic structure
of MTS and fail to capture the dynamic evolution of latent states. We propose
PLanTS, a periodicity-aware self-supervised learning framework that explicitly
models irregular latent states and their transitions. We first designed a
period-aware multi-granularity patching mechanism and a generalized contrastive
loss to preserve both instance-level and state-level similarities across
multiple temporal resolutions. To further capture temporal dynamics, we design
a next-transition prediction pretext task that encourages representations to
encode predictive information about future state evolution. We evaluate PLanTS
across a wide range of downstream tasks-including multi-class and multi-label
classification, forecasting, trajectory tracking and anomaly detection. PLanTS
consistently improves the representation quality over existing SSL methods and
demonstrates superior runtime efficiency compared to DTW-based methods.

*Eric Palanques-Tost,Hanna Krasowski,Murat Arcak,Ron Weiss,Calin Belta*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: STL-guided training of Biomolecular Neural Networks (BNNs) to enable gradient-based optimization for regulation and regression tasks in biology, using STL's quantitative semantics to define training objectives; demonstrates feasibility on regression reporters and closed-loop control with a disease model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: BNNs are hard to train due to scarce real training data. STL provides formal, expressive specifications that can be turned into differentiable objectives, enabling reliable training for biological system tasks.

Method: Use the quantitative semantics of Signal Temporal Logic to define a differentiable loss for BNN weights; implement a learning algorithm training BNNs for regression (reporters of dysregulated states) and a closed-loop control task with a chronic disease model to reduce inflammation while avoiding adverse responses to infections.

Result: Numerical experiments show STL-based learning can solve the regression and control tasks efficiently.

Conclusion: STL-based objective synthesis is a promising approach to training BNNs in biology, enabling data-efficient, formally-guided learning for complex tasks and potentially bridging model-free and model-based control in biosystems.

Abstract: Biomolecular Neural Networks (BNNs), artificial neural networks with
biologically synthesizable architectures, achieve universal function
approximation capabilities beyond simple biological circuits. However, training
BNNs remains challenging due to the lack of target data. To address this, we
propose leveraging Signal Temporal Logic (STL) specifications to define
training objectives for BNNs. We build on the quantitative semantics of STL,
enabling gradient-based optimization of the BNN weights, and introduce a
learning algorithm that enables BNNs to perform regression and control tasks in
biological systems. Specifically, we investigate two regression problems in
which we train BNNs to act as reporters of dysregulated states, and a feedback
control problem in which we train the BNN in closed-loop with a chronic disease
model, learning to reduce inflammation while avoiding adverse responses to
external infections. Our numerical experiments demonstrate that STL-based
learning can solve the investigated regression and control tasks efficiently.

TL;DR: Model-agnostic confidence framework using embedding-space distances to the training distribution, enhanced by multi-embedding ensembles to filter low-confidence predictions and improve accuracy and OOD detection without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need reliable prediction confidence under training-data distribution shifts and out-of-distribution cases, without expensive retraining.

Method: Analyze training-set embeddings to define a distance-based confidence metric for unseen samples. Filter predictions with low confidence. Use multiple embedding models to capture complementary data aspects, and fuse their confidence estimates to improve robustness.

Result: Significant accuracy gains observed across architectures. Improved detection/exclusion of out-of-distribution samples. Combining multiple embeddings yields further improvements.

Conclusion: Embedding-distribution-based confidence estimation is effective, model-agnostic, and generalizable beyond vision (e.g., NLP). Potential for reliable predictions without retraining and with broad applicability.

Abstract: This paper investigates the impact of training data distribution on the
performance of image classification models. By analyzing the embeddings of the
training set, we propose a framework to understand the confidence of model
predictions on unseen data without the need for retraining. Our approach
filters out low-confidence predictions based on their distance from the
training distribution in the embedding space, significantly improving
classification accuracy. We demonstrate this on the example of several
classification models, showing consistent performance gains across
architectures. Furthermore, we show that using multiple embedding models to
represent the training data enables a more robust estimation of confidence, as
different embeddings capture complementary aspects of the data. Combining these
embeddings allows for better detection and exclusion of out-of-distribution
samples, resulting in further accuracy improvements. The proposed method is
model-agnostic and generalizable, with potential applications beyond computer
vision, including domains such as Natural Language Processing where prediction
reliability is critical.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: First deployment of a Mamba-based neural architecture on memory-constrained MCUs using a runtime-free C engine (MambaLite-Micro); achieves 83% peak memory reduction, ~1.7e-5 relative error, and 100% accuracy consistency with PyTorch Mamba on KWS and HAR.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enable on-device, resource-constrained deployment of advanced sequence models by addressing memory, operator support, and embedded-toolchain limitations.

Method: Export weights; implement a handcrafted Mamba layer and operators in C with operator fusion and memory layout optimization; a runtime-free inference pipeline; map PyTorch Mamba model to on-device execution on ESP32S3 and STM32H7.

Result: 83.0% peak memory reduction; average relative error 1.7e-5; 100% consistency with PyTorch baselines; preserved classification accuracy on KWS and HAR; portable across ESP32S3 and STM32H7.

Conclusion: Demonstrates feasibility of bringing advanced sequence models to real-world embedded devices, enabling portable, high-accuracy inference on resource-constrained MCUs and broadens deployment potential across heterogeneous platforms.

Abstract: Deploying Mamba models on microcontrollers (MCUs) remains challenging due to
limited memory, the lack of native operator support, and the absence of
embedded-friendly toolchains. We present, to our knowledge, the first
deployment of a Mamba-based neural architecture on a resource-constrained MCU,
a fully C-based runtime-free inference engine: MambaLite-Micro. Our pipeline
maps a trained PyTorch Mamba model to on-device execution by (1) exporting
model weights into a lightweight format, and (2) implementing a handcrafted
Mamba layer and supporting operators in C with operator fusion and memory
layout optimization. MambaLite-Micro eliminates large intermediate tensors,
reducing 83.0% peak memory, while maintaining an average numerical error of
only 1.7x10-5 relative to the PyTorch Mamba implementation. When evaluated on
keyword spotting(KWS) and human activity recognition (HAR) tasks,
MambaLite-Micro achieved 100% consistency with the PyTorch baselines, fully
preserving classification accuracy. We further validated portability by
deploying on both ESP32S3 and STM32H7 microcontrollers, demonstrating
consistent operation across heterogeneous embedded platforms and paving the way
for bringing advanced sequence models like Mamba to real-world
resource-constrained applications.

*Peixuan Han,Adit Krishnan,Gerald Friedland,Jiaxuan You,Chris Kong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Self-aligned reward (SAR) adds a self-guided signal to verifiable rewards to promote concise, query-specific reasoning in LLM RL training. It improves accuracy and reduces inference cost when paired with PPO/GRPO.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Verifiable rewards are coarse (binary) and can drive verbose reasoning and high computational costs. There is a need for a fine-grained signal that encourages both correctness and efficiency without sacrificing accuracy.

Method: Define SAR as the relative perplexity difference between an answer conditioned on the query and the standalone answer. This self-guided signal favors concise, query-specific responses and is combined with standard RL algorithms (PPO/GRPO).

Result: SAR reliably distinguishes answer quality: concise correct answers score higher than redundant ones; partially correct answers score higher than incorrect ones. Across 4 models and 7 benchmarks, SAR+PPO/GRPO yields ~4% accuracy gains and ~30% inference-cost reductions. SAR also achieves a Pareto-optimal trade-off between correctness and efficiency and shortens responses while preserving advanced reasoning.

Conclusion: Self-aligned reward is a promising, fine-grained complement to verifiable rewards that can improve efficiency and effectiveness in LLM RL training, enabling shorter, still-reasoned outputs without sacrificing performance.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards has significantly advanced
reasoning in large language models (LLMs), but such signals remain coarse,
offering only binary correctness feedback. This limitation often results in
inefficiencies, including overly verbose reasoning and high computational cost,
while existing solutions often compromise accuracy. To address this, we
introduce self-aligned reward (SAR), a self-guided signal that complements
verifiable rewards to encourage both reasoning accuracy and efficiency. SAR is
defined as the relative perplexity difference between an answer conditioned on
the query and the standalone answer, thereby favoring responses that are
concise and query-specific. Quantitative analysis reveals that SAR reliably
distinguishes answer quality: concise, correct answers score higher than
redundant ones, and partially correct answers score higher than entirely
incorrect ones. Evaluation on 4 models across 7 benchmarks shows that
integrating SAR with prevalent RL algorithms like PPO and GRPO improves
accuracy by 4%, while reducing inference cost by 30%. Further analysis
demonstrates that SAR achieves a Pareto-optimal trade-off between correctness
and efficiency compared to reward signals based on length or self-confidence.
We also show that SAR shortens responses while preserving advanced reasoning
behaviors, demonstrating its ability to suppress unnecessary elaboration
without losing critical reasoning. These results highlight the promise of
self-aligned reward as a fine-grained complement to verifiable rewards, paving
the way for more efficient and effective LLM training.

*Yang Yu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RLA combines a low-level goal-conditioned policy with a high-level anticipation planner, trained via value geometric consistency, and theoretically guarantees approaching global optimality in long-horizon goal-conditioned tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HRL often suffers from unstable automatic hierarchy discovery and lack of theoretical guarantees; a principled, scalable framework for long-horizon goal-conditioned RL is needed.

Method: Two-model architecture: a low-level policy that reaches subgoals and a high-level anticipation model that proposes intermediate subgoals along the optimal path; training guided by value geometric consistency with regularization to prevent degenerate solutions.

Result: Theoretical proofs show that RLA approaches the globally optimal policy under various conditions, establishing convergence guarantees for hierarchical planning and execution.

Conclusion: RLA provides a principled, convergent approach to HRL for long-horizon tasks, addressing instability and guaranteeing near-optimal performance under stated conditions.

Abstract: Solving long-horizon goal-conditioned tasks remains a significant challenge
in reinforcement learning (RL). Hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL)
addresses this by decomposing tasks into more manageable sub-tasks, but the
automatic discovery of the hierarchy and the joint training of multi-level
policies often suffer from instability and can lack theoretical guarantees. In
this paper, we introduce Reinforcement Learning with Anticipation (RLA), a
principled and potentially scalable framework designed to address these
limitations. The RLA agent learns two synergistic models: a low-level,
goal-conditioned policy that learns to reach specified subgoals, and a
high-level anticipation model that functions as a planner, proposing
intermediate subgoals on the optimal path to a final goal. The key feature of
RLA is the training of the anticipation model, which is guided by a principle
of value geometric consistency, regularized to prevent degenerate solutions. We
present proofs that RLA approaches the globally optimal policy under various
conditions, establishing a principled and convergent method for hierarchical
planning and execution in long-horizon goal-conditioned tasks.

*Sadegh Jafari,Aishwarya Sarkar,Mohiuddin Bilwal,Ali Jannesari*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ProfilingAgent is a profiling-guided, agentic approach that uses LLMs to automate compression of foundation models via structured pruning and post-training dynamic quantization. It reasons over static metrics (MACs, parameters) and dynamic signals (latency, memory) to tailor layer-wise, architecture-specific pruning/quantization, outperforming heuristic baselines in accuracy and memory/speed on multiple models/datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Foundation models face compute and memory bottlenecks on resource-limited platforms; existing pruning/quantization methods rely on uniform heuristics and lack integration of profiling feedback. The work aims to make compression adaptive to architectural and runtime heterogeneity by leveraging profiling data and LLM reasoning.

Method: A modular multi-agent system uses static metrics (MACs, parameter counts) and dynamic signals (latency, memory) to guide structured pruning and post-training dynamic quantization. LLMs act as decision agents to propose layer-wise pruning and quantization strategies, iterating to address bottlenecks. Profiling data from per-layer measurements feeds the decisions, with comparisons to heuristic baselines and GPT-4o/GPT-4-Turbo varying reasoning quality.

Result: Pruning maintains competitive or improved accuracy (≈1% drop on ImageNet-1K; +2% on ViT-B/16 on smaller datasets). Quantization yields up to 74% memory savings with <0.5% accuracy loss; inference speedups up to 1.74×. Profiling-guided approaches outperform uniform heuristics, and LLM reasoning quality affects iterative pruning effectiveness.

Conclusion: Profiling-guided, agentic compression can tailor layer-wise decisions to bottlenecks and scale across architectures, offering memory and speed benefits with minimal accuracy loss. This approach demonstrates the viability of LLM-guided, profiling-aware optimization for foundation models.

Abstract: Foundation models face growing compute and memory bottlenecks, hindering
deployment on resource-limited platforms. While compression techniques such as
pruning and quantization are widely used, most rely on uniform heuristics that
ignore architectural and runtime heterogeneity. Profiling tools expose
per-layer latency, memory, and compute cost, yet are rarely integrated into
automated pipelines. We propose ProfilingAgent, a profiling-guided, agentic
approach that uses large language models (LLMs) to automate compression via
structured pruning and post-training dynamic quantization. Our modular
multi-agent system reasons over static metrics (MACs, parameter counts) and
dynamic signals (latency, memory) to design architecture-specific strategies.
Unlike heuristic baselines, ProfilingAgent tailors layer-wise decisions to
bottlenecks. Experiments on ImageNet-1K, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100 with
ResNet-101, ViT-B/16, Swin-B, and DeiT-B/16 show pruning maintains competitive
or improved accuracy (about 1% drop on ImageNet-1K, +2% gains for ViT-B/16 on
smaller datasets), while quantization achieves up to 74% memory savings with
<0.5% accuracy loss. Our quantization also yields consistent inference speedups
of up to 1.74 times faster. Comparative studies with GPT-4o and GPT-4-Turbo
highlight the importance of LLM reasoning quality for iterative pruning. These
results establish agentic systems as scalable solutions for profiling-guided
model optimization.

### [177] [Causal Debiasing Medical Multimodal Representation Learning with Missing Modalities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05615)
*Xiaoguang Zhu,Lianlong Sun,Yang Liu,Pengyi Jiang,Uma Srivatsa,Nipavan Chiamvimonvat,Vladimir Filkov*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A causally-informed framework for missing modalities in medical multimodal learning, combining a missingness deconfounding module with a dual-branch network to disentangle causal features from spurious correlations, achieving better generalization and offering causal insights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical multimodal representation learning is hampered by missing modalities and biases from data acquisition. Non-random missingness (missingness bias) and latent confounders (distribution bias) hinder generalization; addressing these through causal reasoning is needed.

Method: Two-part approach: (1) missingness deconfounding module that approximates causal intervention via backdoor adjustment to mitigate missingness bias; (2) a dual-branch neural network that explicitly disentangles causal features from spurious correlations, compatible with existing direct prediction-based multimodal methods.

Result: Evaluated on real-world public and in-hospital datasets, showing effectiveness and providing causal insights into the data-generating process.

Conclusion: A unified, causally-aware framework improves multimodal medical learning under missing modalities by addressing missingness and distribution biases, enhancing generalization and interpretability while remaining compatible with existing methods.

Abstract: Medical multimodal representation learning aims to integrate heterogeneous
clinical data into unified patient representations to support predictive
modeling, which remains an essential yet challenging task in the medical data
mining community. However, real-world medical datasets often suffer from
missing modalities due to cost, protocol, or patient-specific constraints.
Existing methods primarily address this issue by learning from the available
observations in either the raw data space or feature space, but typically
neglect the underlying bias introduced by the data acquisition process itself.
In this work, we identify two types of biases that hinder model generalization:
missingness bias, which results from non-random patterns in modality
availability, and distribution bias, which arises from latent confounders that
influence both observed features and outcomes. To address these challenges, we
perform a structural causal analysis of the data-generating process and propose
a unified framework that is compatible with existing direct prediction-based
multimodal learning methods. Our method consists of two key components: (1) a
missingness deconfounding module that approximates causal intervention based on
backdoor adjustment and (2) a dual-branch neural network that explicitly
disentangles causal features from spurious correlations. We evaluated our
method in real-world public and in-hospital datasets, demonstrating its
effectiveness and causal insights.

*Bo Lyu,Yu Cui,Tuo Shi,Ke Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes OptiProxy-NAS: an optimization proxy that converts NAS search space into a continuous, differentiable form enabling gradient-based end-to-end NAS, achieving superior efficiency and results across 12 NAS tasks in CV, NLP, and resource-constrained domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: NAS is computationally expensive due to discrete, huge, and irregular search spaces; existing predictor-based methods and differentiable supernets have limitations; a unified end-to-end optimization proxy could dramatically speed up NAS.

Method: Introduce a proxy representation that smooths/reformats the NAS space into continuous differentiable space; enable gradient-based optimization on relaxed architecture parameters; assess across multiple tasks/spaces and validate in low-fidelity scenarios.

Result: 12 NAS tasks across 4 search spaces in computer vision, natural language processing, and resource-constrained NAS show superior search results and efficiency; additional experiments in low-fidelity scenarios demonstrate flexibility.

Conclusion: Optimization proxy approach is effective and flexible for NAS across domains, enabling accurate, efficient gradient-based search with broad applicability.

Abstract: Neural architecture search (NAS) is a hard computationally expensive
optimization problem with a discrete, vast, and spiky search space. One of the
key research efforts dedicated to this space focuses on accelerating NAS via
certain proxy evaluations of neural architectures. Different from the prevalent
predictor-based methods using surrogate models and differentiable architecture
search via supernetworks, we propose an optimization proxy to streamline the
NAS as an end-to-end optimization framework, named OptiProxy-NAS. In
particular, using a proxy representation, the NAS space is reformulated to be
continuous, differentiable, and smooth. Thereby, any differentiable
optimization method can be applied to the gradient-based search of the relaxed
architecture parameters. Our comprehensive experiments on $12$ NAS tasks of $4$
search spaces across three different domains including computer vision, natural
language processing, and resource-constrained NAS fully demonstrate the
superior search results and efficiency. Further experiments on low-fidelity
scenarios verify the flexibility.

### [179] [DQS: A Low-Budget Query Strategy for Enhancing Unsupervised Data-driven Anomaly Detection Approaches](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05663)
*Lucas Correia,Jan-Christoph Goos,Thomas Bäck,Anna V. Kononova*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces a dissimilarity-based query strategy (DQS) for active-learning threshold refinement in unsupervised multivariate time-series anomaly detection; shows DQS excels with small label budgets, while other strategies are more robust to mislabeling; all queried strategies outperform a purely unsupervised threshold.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Truly unsupervised time-series anomaly detection faces thresholding challenges; many methods either rely on tuned thresholds or require labelled data, which is often unavailable. The work seeks label-efficient threshold learning by integrating active learning.

Method: Proposes DQS, a dissimilarity-based query strategy that selects diverse samples by assessing the similarity of anomaly scores via dynamic time warping. This strategy is integrated with an existing unsupervised detector and used to obtain labels that refine the threshold. The study compares DQS to other query strategies and investigates the impact of mislabelling.

Result: DQS performs best in low-budget scenarios, while other strategies show greater robustness to mislabelling. Across settings, all query strategies outperform the unsupervised threshold even in the presence of mislabelling.

Conclusion: When feasible, employing an active-learning-based threshold is recommended, as querying an oracle improves detection beyond purely unsupervised thresholds. The choice of strategy should consider the oracle’s expertise and the labeling budget.

Abstract: Truly unsupervised approaches for time series anomaly detection are rare in
the literature. Those that exist suffer from a poorly set threshold, which
hampers detection performance, while others, despite claiming to be
unsupervised, need to be calibrated using a labelled data subset, which is
often not available in the real world. This work integrates active learning
with an existing unsupervised anomaly detection method by selectively querying
the labels of multivariate time series, which are then used to refine the
threshold selection process. To achieve this, we introduce a novel query
strategy called the dissimilarity-based query strategy (DQS). DQS aims to
maximise the diversity of queried samples by evaluating the similarity between
anomaly scores using dynamic time warping. We assess the detection performance
of DQS in comparison to other query strategies and explore the impact of
mislabelling, a topic that is underexplored in the literature. Our findings
indicate that DQS performs best in small-budget scenarios, though the others
appear to be more robust when faced with mislabelling. Therefore, in the real
world, the choice of query strategy depends on the expertise of the oracle and
the number of samples they are willing to label. Regardless, all query
strategies outperform the unsupervised threshold even in the presence of
mislabelling. Thus, whenever it is feasible to query an oracle, employing an
active learning-based threshold is recommended.

### [180] [GraMFedDHAR: Graph Based Multimodal Differentially Private Federated HAR](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05671)
*Labani Halder,Tanmay Sen,Sarbani Palit*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Graph-based multimodal federated learning (GraMFedDHAR) for HAR improves accuracy over baselines and shows strong resilience to differential privacy noise, especially under DP constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HAR with multimodal data suffers from noise, incomplete measurements, scarcity of labeled data, and privacy concerns. Centralized DL is limited by infrastructure and data sharing constraints, while FL mitigates privacy but struggles with heterogeneity and DP-induced noise.

Method: Model each sensor modality as a modality-specific graph; process with residual Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs); fuse modalities using attention-based weighting instead of simple concatenation; apply differential privacy during federated aggregation; evaluate in both centralized and federated settings.

Result: MultiModalGCN outperforms the baseline MultiModalFFN by up to 2 percentage points in non-DP settings in both centralized and federated paradigms. Under differential privacy constraints, MultiModalGCN shows larger gains, surpassing MultiModalFFN by 7–13 percentage points depending on the privacy budget and setting, indicating robustness of graph-based modeling to DP noise.

Conclusion: Graph-based multimodal modeling with attention-based fusion and DP-aware federated aggregation offers robust HAR performance, effectively handling heterogeneity and privacy-preserving noise better than non-graph baselines.

Abstract: Human Activity Recognition (HAR) using multimodal sensor data remains
challenging due to noisy or incomplete measurements, scarcity of labeled
examples, and privacy concerns. Traditional centralized deep learning
approaches are often constrained by infrastructure availability, network
latency, and data sharing restrictions. While federated learning (FL) addresses
privacy by training models locally and sharing only model parameters, it still
has to tackle issues arising from the use of heterogeneous multimodal data and
differential privacy requirements. In this article, a Graph-based Multimodal
Federated Learning framework, GraMFedDHAR, is proposed for HAR tasks. Diverse
sensor streams such as a pressure mat, depth camera, and multiple
accelerometers are modeled as modality-specific graphs, processed through
residual Graph Convolutional Neural Networks (GCNs), and fused via
attention-based weighting rather than simple concatenation. The fused
embeddings enable robust activity classification, while differential privacy
safeguards data during federated aggregation. Experimental results show that
the proposed MultiModalGCN model outperforms the baseline MultiModalFFN, with
up to 2 percent higher accuracy in non-DP settings in both centralized and
federated paradigms. More importantly, significant improvements are observed
under differential privacy constraints: MultiModalGCN consistently surpasses
MultiModalFFN, with performance gaps ranging from 7 to 13 percent depending on
the privacy budget and setting. These results highlight the robustness of
graph-based modeling in multimodal learning, where GNNs prove more resilient to
the performance degradation introduced by DP noise.

### [181] [Distributed Deep Learning using Stochastic Gradient Staleness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05679)
*Viet Hoang Pham,Hyo-Sung Ahn*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A distributed training approach combining data parallelism with fully decoupled backpropagation, achieving faster DNN training with convergence guarantees and CIFAR-10 validation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training DNNs is time-consuming, especially for deep architectures and large datasets; scalable, lock-free parallelization is needed to speed up training without sacrificing convergence.

Method: Proposes a distributed scheme using data parallelism plus fully decoupled parallel backpropagation to avoid gradient locking. Multiple compute units process data in parallel, increase data processed per iteration, and decouple forward/backward passes to improve efficiency; provides theoretical convergence to critical points under certain conditions.

Result: Empirical evaluation on CIFAR-10 shows notable training speedups and effective learning, with the method converging to critical points.

Conclusion: The framework offers a practical, provably convergent, lock-free approach to accelerate deep learning training via data parallelism and fully decoupled backpropagation, validated on CIFAR-10.

Abstract: Despite the notable success of deep neural networks (DNNs) in solving complex
tasks, the training process still remains considerable challenges. A primary
obstacle is the substantial time required for training, particularly as high
performing DNNs tend to become increasingly deep (characterized by a larger
number of hidden layers) and require extensive training datasets. To address
these challenges, this paper introduces a distributed training method that
integrates two prominent strategies for accelerating deep learning: data
parallelism and fully decoupled parallel backpropagation algorithm. By
utilizing multiple computational units operating in parallel, the proposed
approach enhances the amount of training data processed in each iteration while
mitigating locking issues commonly associated with the backpropagation
algorithm. These features collectively contribute to significant improvements
in training efficiency. The proposed distributed training method is rigorously
proven to converge to critical points under certain conditions. Its
effectiveness is further demonstrated through empirical evaluations, wherein an
DNN is trained to perform classification tasks on the CIFAR-10 dataset.

### [182] [Morphological Perceptron with Competitive Layer: Training Using Convex-Concave Procedure](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05697)
*Iara Cunha,Marcos Eduardo Valle*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Training a morphological perceptron with a competitive layer (MPCL) using the convex-concave procedure (CCP); by formulating training as a difference-of-convex program, it yields a sequence of linear programming subproblems, enabling effective non-gradient optimization for MPCL networks in multiclass classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Morphological operators are non-differentiable, making gradient-based optimization unsuitable for training MPCL networks; a non-gradient optimization approach is needed to train these morphology-based neural architectures.

Method: Formulate the training objective as a difference-of-convex (DC) function and apply the convex-concave procedure (CCP) iteratively. Each CCP iteration solves a linear programming (LP) subproblem, guiding the MPCL network parameters toward a good solution while accommodating the winner-take-all (WTA) output layer.

Result: Computational experiments show the CCP-based training is effective for MPCL networks on multiclass classification tasks, demonstrating promising performance and applicability.

Conclusion: CCP provides a viable, non-gradient optimization framework for training MPCL networks, successfully handling the non-differentiability of morphological operators and enabling practical training through a sequence of LP subproblems.

Abstract: A morphological perceptron is a multilayer feedforward neural network in
which neurons perform elementary operations from mathematical morphology. For
multiclass classification tasks, a morphological perceptron with a competitive
layer (MPCL) is obtained by integrating a winner-take-all output layer into the
standard morphological architecture. The non-differentiability of morphological
operators renders gradient-based optimization methods unsuitable for training
such networks. Consequently, alternative strategies that do not depend on
gradient information are commonly adopted. This paper proposes the use of the
convex-concave procedure (CCP) for training MPCL networks. The training problem
is formulated as a difference of convex (DC) functions and solved iteratively
using CCP, resulting in a sequence of linear programming subproblems.
Computational experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
training method in addressing classification tasks with MPCL networks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SimPEL combines low-fidelity simulators as priors in Bayesian deep learning to enable data-efficient learning of complex real-world dynamics and to bridge the sim-to-real gap in model-based reinforcement learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: First-principles models often oversimplify real-world complexity, while deep learning demands large, representative datasets. There is a need to fuse principled physics with data-driven flexibility and quantify uncertainty in learning dynamics.

Method: Use low-fidelity simulators as priors within a Bayesian deep learning framework (SimPEL) to blend simulator knowledge with data-driven learning, enabling strong performance in low-data regimes and scalable improvement as data grows, with explicit epistemic uncertainty estimation. Evaluate across diverse domains (biological, agricultural, robotic) and demonstrate sim-to-real transfer in model-based RL, including a high-speed RC car task with dynamic parking/d drifting.

Result: SimPEL achieves superior data-efficient learning of complex dynamics across diverse domains, and effectively bridges the sim-to-real gap in model-based RL. On the RC car task, it learns a highly dynamic parking maneuver with drifting using substantially less data than state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: Integrating first-principles priors with Bayesian deep learning yields data-efficient, uncertainty-aware learning and control in complex real-world environments, leveraging simulator knowledge when data is scarce and exploiting deep learning flexibility as data increases.

Abstract: How do we enable AI systems to efficiently learn in the real-world?
First-principles models are widely used to simulate natural systems, but often
fail to capture real-world complexity due to simplifying assumptions. In
contrast, deep learning approaches can estimate complex dynamics with minimal
assumptions but require large, representative datasets. We propose SimPEL, a
method that efficiently combines first-principles models with data-driven
learning by using low-fidelity simulators as priors in Bayesian deep learning.
This enables SimPEL to benefit from simulator knowledge in low-data regimes and
leverage deep learning's flexibility when more data is available, all the while
carefully quantifying epistemic uncertainty. We evaluate SimPEL on diverse
systems, including biological, agricultural, and robotic domains, showing
superior performance in learning complex dynamics. For decision-making, we
demonstrate that SimPEL bridges the sim-to-real gap in model-based
reinforcement learning. On a high-speed RC car task, SimPEL learns a highly
dynamic parking maneuver involving drifting with substantially less data than
state-of-the-art baselines. These results highlight the potential of SimPEL for
data-efficient learning and control in complex real-world environments.

### [184] [Offline vs. Online Learning in Model-based RL: Lessons for Data Collection Strategies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05735)
*Jiaqi Chen,Ji Shi,Cansu Sancaktar,Jonas Frey,Georg Martius*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Online data collection yields stronger world-model-based RL performance than offline datasets; offline suffers from Out-Of-Distribution state distribution shift, leading to mismatch between imagined dynamics and real rollouts; adding online interaction (fixed or adaptive) and exploration data mitigates this gap; guidance to include exploration data when collecting large datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how data collection strategies (online versus offline) affect learning of world models and downstream task performance in model-based RL, and to identify failure modes and practical mitigations.

Method: Empirical study across 31 environments comparing online and offline training of world-model-based RL. Analysis of OOD issues in offline data. Experiments with additional online interaction schedules (fixed/adaptive) and with incorporating exploration data to assess mitigation. Evaluation of resulting policy performance.

Result: Online agents outperform offline agents. Offline data leads to Out-Of-Distribution states at test time and a mismatch between the agent's imagined dynamics and real rollouts, hurting policy training. Introducing additional online interactions (even limited) restores online-level performance; exploration data helps mitigate offline degradation. Recommendation: include exploration data when collecting large datasets, not only expert data.

Conclusion: Robust world-model learning benefits from mixed data strategies. Offline datasets alone may be insufficient due to distribution shifts; incorporating online fine-tuning or exploration-rich data, or adaptive data collection schedules, can bridge the gap and improve task performance. Practically, emphasize exploration data in large-scale offline dataset collection.

Abstract: Data collection is crucial for learning robust world models in model-based
reinforcement learning. The most prevalent strategies are to actively collect
trajectories by interacting with the environment during online training or
training on offline datasets. At first glance, the nature of learning
task-agnostic environment dynamics makes world models a good candidate for
effective offline training. However, the effects of online vs. offline data on
world models and thus on the resulting task performance have not been
thoroughly studied in the literature. In this work, we investigate both
paradigms in model-based settings, conducting experiments on 31 different
environments. First, we showcase that online agents outperform their offline
counterparts. We identify a key challenge behind performance degradation of
offline agents: encountering Out-Of-Distribution states at test time. This
issue arises because, without the self-correction mechanism in online agents,
offline datasets with limited state space coverage induce a mismatch between
the agent's imagination and real rollouts, compromising policy training. We
demonstrate that this issue can be mitigated by allowing for additional online
interactions in a fixed or adaptive schedule, restoring the performance of
online training with limited interaction data. We also showcase that
incorporating exploration data helps mitigate the performance degradation of
offline agents. Based on our insights, we recommend adding exploration data
when collecting large datasets, as current efforts predominantly focus on
expert data alone.

TL;DR: Hybrid Autoencoder-PRC-RF for anomaly detection improves accuracy, scalability, and interpretability under class imbalance and high dimensionality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Anomaly detection faces extreme class imbalance and the curse of dimensionality. Prior work (PRC classification trees and PRC-RF) addresses these issues but a unified framework leveraging unsupervised latent representations is lacking.

Method: Proposes Autoencoder-PRC-RF, a hybrid framework that integrates PRC-RF with autoencoders to learn compact latent representations and tackle both challenges. The autoencoder provides unsupervised latent space; the PRC-RF component handles imbalanced classification.

Result: Extensive experiments on diverse benchmark datasets show that Autoencoder-PRC-RF achieves superior accuracy, scalability, and interpretability relative to prior methods.

Conclusion: The Autoencoder-PRC-RF framework demonstrates strong potential for high-stakes anomaly-detection tasks and advances practical applicability in challenging settings.

Abstract: Anomaly detection underpins critical applications from network security and
intrusion detection to fraud prevention, where recognizing aberrant patterns
rapidly is indispensable. Progress in this area is routinely impeded by two
obstacles: extreme class imbalance and the curse of dimensionality. To combat
the former, we previously introduced Precision-Recall Curve (PRC)
classification trees and their ensemble extension, the PRC Random Forest
(PRC-RF). Building on that foundation, we now propose a hybrid framework that
integrates PRC-RF with autoencoders, unsupervised machine learning methods that
learn compact latent representations, to confront both challenges
simultaneously. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmark datasets
demonstrate that the resulting Autoencoder-PRC-RF model achieves superior
accuracy, scalability, and interpretability relative to prior methods,
affirming its potential for high-stakes anomaly-detection tasks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A dataset Real-E with 74 power stations across 30+ European countries over 10 years is introduced, benchmarking 20 models and proposing a new metric for correlation-structure shifts; findings show existing methods struggle with non-stationary, complex correlations, motivating robust forecasting models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Benchmark energy forecasting is limited by narrow spatial/temporal scope and lack of multi-energy features; need for realistic, diverse data to assess reliability and deployability.

Method: Introduce Real-E dataset; conduct extensive data analysis; benchmark 20 baselines across various model types; propose a new metric to quantify shifts in correlation structures.

Result: Real-E reveals more complex, non-stationary correlation dynamics; many baselines underperform; the results provide an empirical basis for developing more robust forecasting models.

Conclusion: Current forecasting methods are insufficient for real-world, multi-site, non-stationary energy data; Real-E offers a strong benchmark and motivates robust, correlation-aware models.

Abstract: Energy forecasting is vital for grid reliability and operational efficiency.
Although recent advances in time series forecasting have led to progress,
existing benchmarks remain limited in spatial and temporal scope and lack
multi-energy features. This raises concerns about their reliability and
applicability in real-world deployment. To address this, we present the Real-E
dataset, covering over 74 power stations across 30+ European countries over a
10-year span with rich metadata. Using Real- E, we conduct an extensive data
analysis and benchmark over 20 baselines across various model types. We
introduce a new metric to quantify shifts in correlation structures and show
that existing methods struggle on our dataset, which exhibits more complex and
non-stationary correlation dynamics. Our findings highlight key limitations of
current methods and offer a strong empirical basis for building more robust
forecasting models

### [187] [DCV-ROOD Evaluation Framework: Dual Cross-Validation for Robust Out-of-Distribution Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05778)
*Arantxa Urrea-Castaño,Nicolás Segura-Kunsagi,Juan Luis Suárez-Díaz,Rosana Montes,Francisco Herrera*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A dual cross-validation framework (DCV-ROOD) for robust evaluation of OOD detectors, integrating in-distribution and OOD data with class-based grouping and hierarchical class structure to obtain fair partitions; shows fast convergence to true performance across methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: OOD detection reliability hinges on robust evaluation. Standard cross-validation is ill-suited for OOD settings; the paper proposes an adapted cross-validation strategy that partitions ID data conventionally and OOD data by class groups, further extending to hierarchical class structures to ensure fair ID-OOD partitions.

Method: Dual Cross-Validation: partition ID data with conventional CV; partition OOD data by grouping samples according to their classes; incorporate class hierarchy to produce fair partitions; apply framework to a suite of state-of-the-art OOD detectors (with and without outlier exposure) to assess performance.

Result: The proposed DCV-ROOD framework yields very fast convergence to the true performance across evaluated detectors.

Conclusion: DCV-ROOD provides a robust and fair evaluation framework for OOD detection that accounts for label structure and class hierarchy, enabling reliable comparisons and assessments of OOD methods.

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection plays a key role in enhancing the
robustness of artificial intelligence systems by identifying inputs that differ
significantly from the training distribution, thereby preventing unreliable
predictions and enabling appropriate fallback mechanisms. Developing reliable
OOD detection methods is a significant challenge, and rigorous evaluation of
these techniques is essential for ensuring their effectiveness, as it allows
researchers to assess their performance under diverse conditions and to
identify potential limitations or failure modes. Cross-validation (CV) has
proven to be a highly effective tool for providing a reasonable estimate of the
performance of a learning algorithm. Although OOD scenarios exhibit particular
characteristics, an appropriate adaptation of CV can lead to a suitable
evaluation framework for this setting. This work proposes a dual CV framework
for robust evaluation of OOD detection models, aimed at improving the
reliability of their assessment. The proposed evaluation framework aims to
effectively integrate in-distribution (ID) and OOD data while accounting for
their differing characteristics. To achieve this, ID data are partitioned using
a conventional approach, whereas OOD data are divided by grouping samples based
on their classes. Furthermore, we analyze the context of data with class
hierarchy to propose a data splitting that considers the entire class hierarchy
to obtain fair ID-OOD partitions to apply the proposed evaluation framework.
This framework is called Dual Cross-Validation for Robust Out-of-Distribution
Detection (DCV-ROOD). To test the validity of the evaluation framework, we
selected a set of state-of-the-art OOD detection methods, both with and without
outlier exposure. The results show that the method achieves very fast
convergence to the true performance.

*Wei Chen,Yuqian Wu,Yuanshao Zhu,Xixuan Hao,Shiyu Wang,Yuxuan Liang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes ExoSTF (referred as \model) to handle exogenous variables in spatio-temporal forecasting via a select-then-balance paradigm, using a latent-space gated expert to fuse exogenous signals, a siamese dual-branch ST backbone for past/future exogenous representations, and a context-aware weighting module to dynamically balance contributions, achieving robust gains on real data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Exogenous variables can improve forecast accuracy but show inconsistent effects on target systems and there is an imbalance between historical and future inputs; existing methods struggle to adaptively fuse such signals, limiting gains.

Method: Introduce a latent-space gated expert module to project fused exogenous information into a latent space for dynamic selection and recomposition via specialized sub-experts. Employ a siamese network where representations of past and future exogenous variables feed dual-branch spatio-temporal backbones to capture dynamic patterns. Integrate outputs through a context-aware weighting mechanism to achieve dynamic balance during modeling.

Result: Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the framework's effectiveness, generality, robustness, and efficiency in incorporating exogenous variables for spatio-temporal forecasting.

Conclusion: The select-then-balance paradigm with exogenous modeling improves spatio-temporal forecasting by adaptively selecting and balancing exogenous signals, achieving better performance and robustness across diverse datasets.

Abstract: Spatio-temporal forecasting aims to predict the future state of dynamic
systems and plays an important role in multiple fields. However, existing
solutions only focus on modeling using a limited number of observed target
variables. In real-world scenarios, exogenous variables can be integrated into
the model as additional input features and associated with the target signal to
promote forecast accuracy. Although promising, this still encounters two
challenges: the inconsistent effects of different exogenous variables to the
target system, and the imbalance effects between historical variables and
future variables. To address these challenges, this paper introduces \model, a
novel framework for modeling \underline{exo}genous variables in
\underline{s}patio-\underline{t}emporal forecasting, which follows a ``select,
then balance'' paradigm. Specifically, we first construct a latent space gated
expert module, where fused exogenous information is projected into a latent
space to dynamically select and recompose salient signals via specialized
sub-experts. Furthermore, we design a siamese network architecture in which
recomposed representations of past and future exogenous variables are fed into
dual-branch spatio-temporal backbones to capture dynamic patterns. The outputs
are integrated through a context-aware weighting mechanism to achieve dynamic
balance during the modeling process. Extensive experiments on real-world
datasets demonstrate the effectiveness, generality, robustness, and efficiency
of our proposed framework.

Method: Causal intervention: impose statistical moments from one event onto another during forward pass (activation transplantation); test on two architectures; measure forecast steering and latent norm correlations.

Result: Deterministic steering: crash moments induce downturns; calm moments suppress crashes; latent norm tracks magnitude of systemic shocks; results robust across architectures; suggests a latent concept space controlling predictions.

Conclusion: Semantically grounded representations are robust in large TSFMs; enables direct causal intervention and semantic stress-testing; shifts interpretability from attribution to manipulation.

Abstract: While transformer-based foundation models excel at forecasting routine
patterns, two questions remain: do they internalize semantic concepts such as
market regimes, or merely fit curves? And can their internal representations be
leveraged to simulate rare, high-stakes events such as market crashes? To
investigate this, we introduce activation transplantation, a causal
intervention that manipulates hidden states by imposing the statistical moments
of one event (e.g., a historical crash) onto another (e.g., a calm period)
during the forward pass. This procedure deterministically steers forecasts:
injecting crash semantics induces downturn predictions, while injecting calm
semantics suppresses crashes and restores stability. Beyond binary control, we
find that models encode a graded notion of event severity, with the latent
vector norm directly correlating with the magnitude of systemic shocks.
Validated across two architecturally distinct TSFMs, Toto (decoder only) and
Chronos (encoder-decoder), our results demonstrate that steerable, semantically
grounded representations are a robust property of large time series
transformers. Our findings provide evidence for a latent concept space that
governs model predictions, shifting interpretability from post-hoc attribution
to direct causal intervention, and enabling semantic "what-if" analysis for
strategic stress-testing.

### [190] [Simple Optimizers for Convex Aligned Multi-Objective Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05811)
*Ben Kretzu,Karen Ullrich,Yonathan Efroni*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper broadens Aligned Multi-Objective Optimization (AMOO) from strong convexity to convex AMOO under Lipschitz/smoothness conditions, develops new convergence analysis tools, proposes scalable gradient-based algorithms with provable convergence guarantees, and provides a lower bound showing naive equal-weight baselines are suboptimal.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In practice, learning under a diverse set of tasks can improve performance and objectives may not be inherently conflicting. Prior AMOO analyses rely on strong convexity, which is rarely met in deep learning. This work seeks to relax those guarantees to more realistic, smooth convex settings.

Method: Develop new analytical tools and metrics to characterize convergence in convex AMOO under Lipschitz/smoothness assumptions. Propose scalable gradient-descent algorithms for convex AMOO. Establish convergence guarantees for these algorithms. Prove a novel lower bound showing the suboptimality of naive equal-weight approaches compared to the proposed methods.

Result: Convergence guarantees for the proposed gradient-based algorithms under standard smoothness in convex AMOO. A new lower bound demonstrating that naive equal-weight aggregations are suboptimal relative to the proposed approaches.

Conclusion: Extends AMOO to a more practical convex setting by relaxing strong convexity, provides theoretical tools and scalable algorithms with convergence guarantees, and highlights the importance of proper task-weighting by showing a lower bound against naive equal-weight baselines.

Abstract: It is widely recognized in modern machine learning practice that access to a
diverse set of tasks can enhance performance across those tasks. This
observation suggests that, unlike in general multi-objective optimization, the
objectives in many real-world settings may not be inherently conflicting. To
address this, prior work introduced the Aligned Multi-Objective Optimization
(AMOO) framework and proposed gradient-based algorithms with provable
convergence guarantees. However, existing analysis relies on strong
assumptions, particularly strong convexity, which implies the existence of a
unique optimal solution. In this work, we relax this assumption and study
gradient-descent algorithms for convex AMOO under standard smoothness or
Lipschitz continuity conditions-assumptions more consistent with those used in
deep learning practice. This generalization requires new analytical tools and
metrics to characterize convergence in the convex AMOO setting. We develop such
tools, propose scalable algorithms for convex AMOO, and establish their
convergence guarantees. Additionally, we prove a novel lower bound that
demonstrates the suboptimality of naive equal-weight approaches compared to our
methods.

### [191] [Performance of Conformal Prediction in Capturing Aleatoric Uncertainty](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05826)
*Misgina Tsighe Hagos,Claes Lundström*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Conformal prediction sets can provide high coverage but are not reliably related to aleatoric uncertainty; their size rarely correlates with human-annotated ambiguity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To empirically validate whether conformal predictors quantify aleatoric uncertainty by measuring the relation between prediction-set size and human-annotated label ambiguity in multi-annotator datasets.

Method: Apply three conformal prediction methods to eight deep models across four datasets with multiple human annotations per instance; compute correlations between prediction-set sizes and the number of distinct human labels, and assess similarity between predicted sets and human annotations.

Result: Most conformal predictions show weak to very weak correlation with human ambiguity; only a subset shows moderate correlation; prediction sets achieve high coverage but may not effectively capture inherent dataset ambiguity.

Conclusion: Conformal predictors may not reliably quantify aleatoric uncertainty due to overlapping classes; their effectiveness in reflecting innate ambiguity is limited, necessitating caution and reassessment of their use for this purpose.

Abstract: Conformal prediction is a model-agnostic approach to generating prediction
sets that cover the true class with a high probability. Although its prediction
set size is expected to capture aleatoric uncertainty, there is a lack of
evidence regarding its effectiveness. The literature presents that prediction
set size can upper-bound aleatoric uncertainty or that prediction sets are
larger for difficult instances and smaller for easy ones, but a validation of
this attribute of conformal predictors is missing. This work investigates how
effectively conformal predictors quantify aleatoric uncertainty, specifically
the inherent ambiguity in datasets caused by overlapping classes. We perform
this by measuring the correlation between prediction set sizes and the number
of distinct labels assigned by human annotators per instance. We further assess
the similarity between prediction sets and human-provided annotations. We use
three conformal prediction approaches to generate prediction sets for eight
deep learning models trained on four datasets. The datasets contain annotations
from multiple human annotators (ranging from five to fifty participants) per
instance, enabling the identification of class overlap. We show that the vast
majority of the conformal prediction outputs show a very weak to weak
correlation with human annotations, with only a few showing moderate
correlation. These findings underscore the necessity of critically reassessing
the prediction sets generated using conformal predictors. While they can
provide a higher coverage of the true classes, their capability in capturing
aleatoric uncertainty remains limited.

*Akaash Kolluri,Shengguang Wu,Joon Sung Park,Michael S. Bernstein*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Fine-tuning LLMs on large-scale SocSci210 data improves simulation accuracy of social science experiments and reduces bias; strong generalization to unseen studies/conditions; data/models released.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To increase the realism and accuracy of LLM-based simulations of social science experiments by leveraging large, individual-level response data from past studies.

Method: Build SocSci210: 2.9 million responses from 400,491 participants across 210 open social science experiments. Finetune models (notably Socrates-Qwen-14B) on these responses. Evaluate on unseen studies/conditions, compare against base Qwen-14B and GPT-4o, and assess demographic parity.

Result: Socrates-Qwen-14B is 26% more aligned with human response distributions in unseen studies than its base model; 13% better than GPT-4o. Fine-tuning on a subset of conditions boosts generalization to new conditions by 71%. Demographic parity bias reduced by 10.6%.

Conclusion: Fine-tuning on topic-rich, individual-level social science data yields more accurate simulations and bias reductions, enabling more efficient experimental hypothesis screening; data, models, and finetuning code are released.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) offer a powerful opportunity to simulate the
results of social science experiments. In this work, we demonstrate that
finetuning LLMs directly on individual-level responses from past experiments
meaningfully improves the accuracy of such simulations across diverse social
science domains. We construct SocSci210 via an automatic pipeline, a dataset
comprising 2.9 million responses from 400,491 participants in 210 open-source
social science experiments. Through finetuning, we achieve multiple levels of
generalization. In completely unseen studies, our strongest model,
Socrates-Qwen-14B, produces predictions that are 26% more aligned with
distributions of human responses to diverse outcome questions under varying
conditions relative to its base model (Qwen2.5-14B), outperforming GPT-4o by
13%. By finetuning on a subset of conditions in a study, generalization to new
unseen conditions is particularly robust, improving by 71%. Since SocSci210
contains rich demographic information, we reduce demographic parity, a measure
of bias, by 10.6% through finetuning. Because social sciences routinely
generate rich, topic-specific datasets, our findings indicate that finetuning
on such data could enable more accurate simulations for experimental hypothesis
screening. We release our data, models and finetuning code at
stanfordhci.github.io/socrates.

### [193] [Benchmarking Robust Aggregation in Decentralized Gradient Marketplaces](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05833)
*Zeyu Song,Sainyam Galhotra,Shagufta Mehnaz*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a benchmark framework for robust gradient aggregation in buyer-baseline-dependent decentralized gradient marketplaces, featuring a simulation environment, marketplace-centric evaluation metrics, and empirical evaluation of MartFL with FLTrust and SkyMask under diverse attacks and data distributions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses economic and systemic factors missing from standard FL benchmarks—cost-effectiveness, fairness to sellers, and market stability—when a buyer relies on a private baseline for evaluation.

Method: Develops a simulation environment modeling marketplace dynamics with variable buyer baselines and diverse seller distributions; defines evaluation metrics beyond standard FL (Economic Efficiency, Fairness, Selection Dynamics); conducts an empirical analysis of the Distributed Gradient Marketplace framework (MartFL) by integrating and comparing FLTrust and SkyMask as aggregation strategies; evaluates under diverse datasets, local attacks, and Sybil attacks targeting marketplace selection.

Result: Benchmarks reveal trade-offs among model performance, robustness, cost, fairness, and stability; demonstrates how adapted aggregation strategies perform within MartFL; provides empirical evidence and tooling to evaluate and design more robust, equitable, and economically viable decentralized gradient marketplaces.

Conclusion: The work equips the community with practical tools and empirical guidance to design robust, fair, and economically viable decentralized gradient marketplaces and highlights directions for standardization and future research.

Abstract: The rise of distributed and privacy-preserving machine learning has sparked
interest in decentralized gradient marketplaces, where participants trade
intermediate artifacts like gradients. However, existing Federated Learning
(FL) benchmarks overlook critical economic and systemic factors unique to such
marketplaces-cost-effectiveness, fairness to sellers, and market
stability-especially when a buyer relies on a private baseline dataset for
evaluation.
  We introduce a comprehensive benchmark framework to holistically evaluate
robust gradient aggregation methods within these buyer-baseline-reliant
marketplaces. Our contributions include: (1) a simulation environment modeling
marketplace dynamics with a variable buyer baseline and diverse seller
distributions; (2) an evaluation methodology augmenting standard FL metrics
with marketplace-centric dimensions such as Economic Efficiency, Fairness, and
Selection Dynamics; (3) an in-depth empirical analysis of the existing
Distributed Gradient Marketplace framework, MartFL, including the integration
and comparative evaluation of adapted FLTrust and SkyMask as alternative
aggregation strategies within it. This benchmark spans diverse datasets, local
attacks, and Sybil attacks targeting the marketplace selection process; and (4)
actionable insights into the trade-offs between model performance, robustness,
cost, fairness, and stability.
  This benchmark equips the community with essential tools and empirical
evidence to evaluate and design more robust, equitable, and economically viable
decentralized gradient marketplaces.

### [194] [Data-Driven Stochastic Modeling Using Autoregressive Sequence Models: Translating Event Tables to Queueing Dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05839)
*Daksh Mittal,Shunri Zheng,Jing Dong,Hongseok Namkoong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A data-driven, Transformer-based framework learns queueing network behavior from event streams without manually specifying arrivals, services, or routing; validated on multiple networks; supports simulation, uncertainty quantification, and counterfactuals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional queueing models require extensive domain knowledge and manual model construction. A scalable approach is needed to automate modeling using data-driven sequence learning, enabling easier adoption across service systems.

Method: Autoregressive sequence models (Transformer-style) parameterize conditional distributions over event types and event times learned from event-table data. The model effectively learns the entire distribution of event sequences instead of explicit process specifications, enabling automated simulator construction. Validation uses event tables from diverse queueing networks.

Result: High-fidelity simulators are produced; the framework supports simulation, uncertainty quantification, and counterfactual evaluation; demonstrated across networks with varying structures.

Conclusion: The framework moves toward automated, data-driven queueing network modeling pipelines, increasing accessibility and scalability for service-domain adoption.

Abstract: While queueing network models are powerful tools for analyzing service
systems, they traditionally require substantial human effort and domain
expertise to construct. To make this modeling approach more scalable and
accessible, we propose a data-driven framework for queueing network modeling
and simulation based on autoregressive sequence models trained on event-stream
data. Instead of explicitly specifying arrival processes, service mechanisms,
or routing logic, our approach learns the conditional distributions of event
types and event times, recasting the modeling task as a problem of sequence
distribution learning. We show that Transformer-style architectures can
effectively parameterize these distributions, enabling automated construction
of high-fidelity simulators. As a proof of concept, we validate our framework
on event tables generated from diverse queueing networks, showcasing its
utility in simulation, uncertainty quantification, and counterfactual
evaluation. Leveraging advances in artificial intelligence and the growing
availability of data, our framework takes a step toward more automated,
data-driven modeling pipelines to support broader adoption of queueing network
models across service domains.

### [195] [The Measure of Deception: An Analysis of Data Forging in Machine Unlearning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05865)
*Rishabh Dixit,Yuan Hui,Rayan Saab*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Forging-based attacks to fake unlearning are statistically limited: the set of data whose gradients mimic a target gradient is small and shrinks with tolerance; with mild assumptions, its measure scales as epsilon^{(d-r)/2}, making random forging very unlikely.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address privacy and data-harm mitigation by rigorously validating machine unlearning. Quantify how easy it is for an adversary to forge a gradient to pretend that data was forgotten, and provide detection of false unlearning claims.

Method: Define the epsilon-forging set: data points whose gradients are within epsilon of a target gradient. Analyze its Lebesgue measure for linear regression and one-layer networks; derive scaling with dimension d and nullity r of a model-gradient variation matrix. Extend to batch SGD and broadly smooth loss under mild regularity; obtain probabilistic bounds under non-degenerate data distributions.

Result: The forging set is small: scales as epsilon for simple models, and as epsilon^d in some cases; generally, measure decays as epsilon^{(d-r)/2}. Probability of randomly selecting a forging point is vanishingly small under non-degenerate data. Results hold for SGD extensions and smooth losses.

Conclusion: Adversarial forging to fake unlearning is fundamentally restricted; false unlearning claims can be detected in principle, and validation should focus on the shrinking forging-set probabilities.

Abstract: Motivated by privacy regulations and the need to mitigate the effects of
harmful data, machine unlearning seeks to modify trained models so that they
effectively ``forget'' designated data. A key challenge in verifying unlearning
is forging -- adversarially crafting data that mimics the gradient of a target
point, thereby creating the appearance of unlearning without actually removing
information. To capture this phenomenon, we consider the collection of data
points whose gradients approximate a target gradient within tolerance
$\epsilon$ -- which we call an $\epsilon$-forging set -- and develop a
framework for its analysis. For linear regression and one-layer neural
networks, we show that the Lebesgue measure of this set is small. It scales on
the order of $\epsilon$, and when $\epsilon$ is small enough, $\epsilon^d$.
More generally, under mild regularity assumptions, we prove that the forging
set measure decays as $\epsilon^{(d-r)/2}$, where $d$ is the data dimension and
$r<d$ is the nullity of a variation matrix defined by the model gradients.
Extensions to batch SGD and almost-everywhere smooth loss functions yield the
same asymptotic scaling. In addition, we establish probability bounds showing
that, under non-degenerate data distributions, the likelihood of randomly
sampling a forging point is vanishingly small. These results provide evidence
that adversarial forging is fundamentally limited and that false unlearning
claims can, in principle, be detected.

### [196] [Learning to Construct Knowledge through Sparse Reference Selection with Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05874)
*Shao-An Yin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A Deep RL framework for sparse reference selection guides reading under time/cost constraints to build knowledge from limited access (titles/abstracts). Tested on drug–gene relation discovery, showing that humans and machines can construct knowledge effectively from partial information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The exponential growth of scientific literature makes knowledge acquisition hard, especially in specialized areas where reasoning is complex, full text is often inaccessible, and target references are sparse among many candidates. Efficiently prioritizing which papers to read under resource limits is needed.

Method: A Deep Reinforcement Learning framework that mimics human knowledge construction to decide which papers to read (prioritization) under limited time and cost, operating in a setting with restricted access to only titles/abstracts to guide reference selection.

Result: The approach demonstrates feasibility: both humans and machines can construct knowledge effectively from partial information, indicating that selective reading strategies can yield meaningful knowledge despite limited text access.

Conclusion: A viable, resource-aware reading strategy is achievable via Deep RL for sparse reference selection, enabling knowledge construction under restricted access conditions and suggesting potential for improved literature exploration when full texts are unavailable.

Abstract: The rapid expansion of scientific literature makes it increasingly difficult
to acquire new knowledge, particularly in specialized domains where reasoning
is complex, full-text access is restricted, and target references are sparse
among a large set of candidates. We present a Deep Reinforcement Learning
framework for sparse reference selection that emulates human knowledge
construction, prioritizing which papers to read under limited time and cost.
Evaluated on drug--gene relation discovery with access restricted to titles and
abstracts, our approach demonstrates that both humans and machines can
construct knowledge effectively from partial information.

### [197] [SPINN: An Optimal Self-Supervised Physics-Informed Neural Network Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05886)
*Reza Pirayeshshirazinezhad*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ML surrogate predicts convective heat transfer coefficient for liquid sodium in rectangular miniature heat sinks; self-supervised physics-informed NN with adaptive physics weight and transfer learning from water improve accuracy; physics-only and ML approaches yield ~5-10% error; offers fast alternative to CFD for design.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Replace time-consuming CFD with data-driven models for liquid-metal cooling in miniature heat sinks and leverage physics and cross-fluid transfer learning to maximize data efficiency.

Method: 1) kernel-based ML and shallow neural network on 87 Na Nusselt data; 2) self-supervised physics-informed neural network with learnable weight to physics loss; 3) transfer learning: shallow NN trained on water data adapted to Na.

Result: Self-supervised PINN achieves about 8% error; physics-only regression yields 5-10% error; other ML methods yield ~8%; demonstrates data-efficient, accurate surrogate for Na convection.

Conclusion: ML-based surrogates effectively approximate high-fidelity CFD for liquid-metal cooling in miniature heat sinks, enabling faster design and optimization.

Abstract: A surrogate model is developed to predict the convective heat transfer
coefficient of liquid sodium (Na) flow within rectangular miniature heat sinks.
Initially, kernel-based machine learning techniques and shallow neural network
are applied to a dataset with 87 Nusselt numbers for liquid sodium in
rectangular miniature heat sinks. Subsequently, a self-supervised
physics-informed neural network and transfer learning approach are used to
increase the estimation performance. In the self-supervised physics-informed
neural network, an additional layer determines the weight the of physics in the
loss function to balance data and physics based on their uncertainty for a
better estimation. For transfer learning, a shallow neural network trained on
water is adapted for use with Na. Validation results show that the
self-supervised physics-informed neural network successfully estimate the heat
transfer rates of Na with an error margin of approximately +8%. Using only
physics for regression, the error remains between 5% to 10%. Other machine
learning methods specify the prediction mostly within +8%. High-fidelity
modeling of turbulent forced convection of liquid metals using computational
fluid dynamics (CFD) is both time-consuming and computationally expensive.
Therefore, machine learning based models offer a powerful alternative tool for
the design and optimization of liquid-metal-cooled miniature heat sinks.

### [198] [X-SQL: Expert Schema Linking and Understanding of Text-to-SQL with Multi-LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05899)
*Dazhi Peng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The abstract argues that database schema information is crucial for Text-to-SQL, introduces a schema-focused framework (X-SQL) with two components (X-Linking for schema linking, X-Admin for schema understanding), optionally uses Multi-LLMs, and reports high execution accuracy on Spider. It claims state-of-the-art among open-source models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs show strong code-generation abilities but Text-to-SQL performance heavily depends on effective use of database schema. Existing methods underutilize schema information, hindering accuracy.

Method: Proposes X-SQL with two components: X-Linking (SFT-based schema linking fine-tuning) and X-Admin (Schema Understanding bridging schema and natural language questions). Evaluates with Multi-LLMs across components to boost performance in an end-to-end framework.

Result: X-SQL achieves Execution Accuracies of 84.9% on Spider-Dev and 82.5% on Spider-Test, claimed as leading among open-source Text-to-SQL frameworks.

Conclusion: Schema information plays a dominant role in Text-to-SQL. The proposed schema-expert framework improves performance and sets new baselines for open-source models, with potential gains from multi-LLM ensembles.

Abstract: With Large Language Models' (LLMs) emergent abilities on code generation
tasks, Text-to-SQL has become one of the most popular downstream applications.
Despite the strong results of multiple recent LLM-based Text-to-SQL frameworks,
the research community often overlooks the importance of database schema
information for generating high-quality SQL queries. We find that such schema
information plays a significant or even dominant role in the Text-to-SQL task.
To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel database schema expert with two
components. We first introduce X-Linking, an LLM Supervised Finetuning
(SFT)-based method that achieves superior Schema Linking results compared to
existing open-source Text-to-SQL methods. In addition, we innovatively propose
an X-Admin component that focuses on Schema Understanding by bridging the gap
between abstract schema information and the user's natural language question.
Aside from better learning with schema information, we experiment with
Multi-LLMs for different components within the system to further boost its
performance. By incorporating these techniques into our end-to-end framework,
X-SQL, we have achieved Execution Accuracies of 84.9% on the Spider-Dev dataset
and 82.5% on the Spider-Test dataset. This outstanding performance establishes
X-SQL as the leading Text-to-SQL framework based on open-source models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces SOOTT, a framework for online optimization with tracking, adversarial perturbation, and switching costs; presents BEST with competitive guarantees and CoRT, a learning-augmented variant using untrusted predictions; validated via a workload scheduling case study.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses robust, adaptable online decision-making under uncertainty in dynamic workloads where targets move, disturbances occur, and decisions must be smooth; highly relevant to AI cluster scheduling under SLA constraints and sudden demand spikes.

Method: Define the Smoothed Online Optimization for Target Tracking (SOOTT) framework; develop BEST with provable competitive guarantees; introduce CoRT, a learning-augmented variant that incorporates untrusted black-box predictions into its decision process; provide theoretical analysis showing CoRT improves over BEST when predictions are accurate and remains robust to arbitrary prediction errors; validate via a workload scheduling case study.

Result: Theoretical: BEST achieves competitive guarantees; CoRT strictly improves over BEST under accurate predictions and is robust to prediction errors; empirical: workload scheduling case study demonstrates effective balance among trajectory tracking, decision smoothness, and disturbance resilience.

Conclusion: SOOTT offers a unified framework for online decision-making under uncertainty. BEST provides robustness and competitive guarantees; CoRT adds learning-augmented capability to leverage predictions, with robustness to errors. The approach is practically applicable to AI cluster scheduling under dynamic demands.

Abstract: We introduce the Smoothed Online Optimization for Target Tracking (SOOTT)
problem, a new framework that integrates three key objectives in online
decision-making under uncertainty: (1) tracking cost for following a
dynamically moving target, (2) adversarial perturbation cost for withstanding
unpredictable disturbances, and (3) switching cost for penalizing abrupt
changes in decisions. This formulation captures real-world scenarios such as
elastic and inelastic workload scheduling in AI clusters, where operators must
balance long-term service-level agreements (e.g., LLM training) against sudden
demand spikes (e.g., real-time inference). We first present BEST, a robust
algorithm with provable competitive guarantees for SOOTT. To enhance practical
performance, we introduce CoRT, a learning-augmented variant that incorporates
untrusted black-box predictions (e.g., from ML models) into its decision
process. Our theoretical analysis shows that CoRT strictly improves over BEST
when predictions are accurate, while maintaining robustness under arbitrary
prediction errors. We validate our approach through a case study on workload
scheduling, demonstrating that both algorithms effectively balance trajectory
tracking, decision smoothness, and resilience to external disturbances.

### [200] [Unified Interaction Foundational Model (UIFM) for Predicting Complex User and System Behavior](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06025)
*Vignesh Ethiraj,Subhash Talluri*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A Unified Interaction Foundation Model (UIFM) uses composite tokenization to treat multi-attribute events as single semantic units, enabling holistic learning of user interaction grammar and improving predictive accuracy over text-serialized approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Foundation models trained on natural language struggle to capture the holistic, structured interactions in domains with multi-attribute events (e.g., telecommunications, e-commerce, finance); serializing events into text fragments context and semantics, causing context loss.

Method: Introduce UIFM with composite tokenization, where each multi-attribute event is one semantic token. This design enables learning the underlying grammar of user behavior and modeling entire interactions rather than disjoint data points.

Result: The architecture is not only more accurate than text-serialized baselines but also represents a fundamental step toward more adaptable and intelligent predictive systems.

Conclusion: Composite tokenization and holistic interaction modeling offer a new paradigm for building adaptable predictive systems across domains with complex event streams.

Abstract: A central goal of artificial intelligence is to build systems that can
understand and predict complex, evolving sequences of events. However, current
foundation models, designed for natural language, fail to grasp the holistic
nature of structured interactions found in domains like telecommunications,
e-commerce and finance. By serializing events into text, they disassemble them
into semantically fragmented parts, losing critical context. In this work, we
introduce the Unified Interaction Foundation Model (UIFM), a foundation model
engineered for genuine behavioral understanding. At its core is the principle
of composite tokenization, where each multi-attribute event is treated as a
single, semantically coherent unit. This allows UIFM to learn the underlying
"grammar" of user behavior, perceiving entire interactions rather than a
disconnected stream of data points. We demonstrate that this architecture is
not just more accurate, but represents a fundamental step towards creating more
adaptable and intelligent predictive systems.

### [201] [PolicyEvolve: Evolving Programmatic Policies by LLMs for multi-player games via Population-Based Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06053)
*Mingrui Lv,Hangzhi Liu,Zhi Luo,Hongjie Zhang,Jie Ou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PolicyEvolve generates interpretable, programmatic MARL policies via an iterative, pool-based synthesis framework guided by a Trajectory Critic, reducing data needs and manual coding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the interpretability and data/computation challenges of adversarial MARL by producing readable, executable policies and lowering environmental sampling requirements.

Method: Four-module loop: Global Pool preserves elite policies; Local Pool stores iteration candidates; Policy Planner samples top policies from Global Pool to generate and refine a new policy using environmental feedback; Trajectory Critic analyzes interactions to propose improvements; refined policies are promoted to Local Pool and, if strong enough, up to Global Pool; process repeats until policy achieves a high win rate against Global Pool.

Result: Claims that policies can achieve high performance with minimal environment interactions and without extensive handcrafted policy code; framework is general for multi-player games and improves interpretability and efficiency.

Conclusion: PolicyEvolve presents a general, interpretable programmatic-policy generation framework for MARL that leverages pool-based selection and trajectory-based feedback to efficiently evolve competitive policies.

Abstract: Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has achieved significant progress
in solving complex multi-player games through self-play. However, training
effective adversarial policies requires millions of experience samples and
substantial computational resources. Moreover, these policies lack
interpretability, hindering their practical deployment. Recently, researchers
have successfully leveraged Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate
programmatic policies for single-agent tasks, transforming neural network-based
policies into interpretable rule-based code with high execution efficiency.
Inspired by this, we propose PolicyEvolve, a general framework for generating
programmatic policies in multi-player games. PolicyEvolve significantly reduces
reliance on manually crafted policy code, achieving high-performance policies
with minimal environmental interactions. The framework comprises four modules:
Global Pool, Local Pool, Policy Planner, and Trajectory Critic. The Global Pool
preserves elite policies accumulated during iterative training. The Local Pool
stores temporary policies for the current iteration; only sufficiently
high-performing policies from this pool are promoted to the Global Pool. The
Policy Planner serves as the core policy generation module. It samples the top
three policies from the Global Pool, generates an initial policy for the
current iteration based on environmental information, and refines this policy
using feedback from the Trajectory Critic. Refined policies are then deposited
into the Local Pool. This iterative process continues until the policy achieves
a sufficiently high average win rate against the Global Pool, at which point it
is integrated into the Global Pool. The Trajectory Critic analyzes interaction
data from the current policy, identifies vulnerabilities, and proposes
directional improvements to guide the Policy Planner

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the high computational cost and limited accuracy of simulating complex thermochemical reactions in biomass fluidized bed gasification.

Method: Build a high-quality dataset from experimental data and high-fidelity simulations; train an agent model to describe reaction-kinetics characteristics; embed the agent into a CFD framework to enable real-time updates of reaction rates and species evolution.

Result: The abstract claims improved prediction accuracy and computational efficiency, with real-time updates of reaction rate and composition.

Conclusion: The coupling of ML-based kinetic models with CFD offers a scalable approach for efficient, accurate simulation of biomass gasification processes.

Abstract: A coupling model of biomass fluidized bed gasification based on machine

*Fei Wang,Yujie Li,Zezhi Shao,Chengqing Yu,Yisong Fu,Zhulin An,Yongjun Xu,Xueqi Cheng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ARIES introduces a synthetic benchmark and a model recommender that links time series properties to forecasting strategies, with code for practical use.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations of existing benchmarks (limited, poorly defined temporal patterns) and the lack of a model recommendation mechanism, enabling systematic evaluation of how data properties influence forecasting model performance.

Method: Create a synthetic dataset with diverse temporal patterns; develop a system to compute time series properties; benchmark over 50 forecasting models; analyze correlations between data properties and modeling strategies; build an interpretable model recommender for real-world time series.

Result: Found clear correlations between time series properties and suitable modeling strategies; established relationships enabling guidance for model selection; introduced the first deep forecasting model recommender; code available.

Conclusion: ARIES demonstrates that data properties can guide model selection in deep forecasting and provides a practical recommender and benchmark framework to facilitate efficient, principled evaluation and deployment.

Abstract: Recent advancements in deep learning models for time series forecasting have
been significant. These models often leverage fundamental time series
properties such as seasonality and non-stationarity, which may suggest an
intrinsic link between model performance and data properties. However, existing
benchmark datasets fail to offer diverse and well-defined temporal patterns,
restricting the systematic evaluation of such connections. Additionally, there
is no effective model recommendation approach, leading to high time and cost
expenditures when testing different architectures across different downstream
applications. For those reasons, we propose ARIES, a framework for assessing
relation between time series properties and modeling strategies, and for
recommending deep forcasting models for realistic time series. First, we
construct a synthetic dataset with multiple distinct patterns, and design a
comprehensive system to compute the properties of time series. Next, we conduct
an extensive benchmarking of over 50 forecasting models, and establish the
relationship between time series properties and modeling strategies. Our
experimental results reveal a clear correlation. Based on these findings, we
propose the first deep forecasting model recommender, capable of providing
interpretable suggestions for real-world time series. In summary, ARIES is the
first study to establish the relations between the properties of time series
data and modeling strategies, while also implementing a model recommendation
system. The code is available at: https://github.com/blisky-li/ARIES.

*Mianjun Xiao,Peng Song,Yulong Liu,Cedric Korte,Ziyang Xu,Jiale Gao,Jiaqi Lu,Haoyang Nie,Qiantong Deng,Timing Qu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A deep residual-network surrogate (FCRN) predicts space-time current density and magnetization losses in REBCO solenoids with FEM-trained data, delivering high accuracy and orders-of-magnitude speedup; optimal config is 12 residual blocks with 256 neurons per layer and good extrapolation up to 50% beyond training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High computational cost of finite element methods for large-scale HTS magnets, especially meter-scale designs and multi-physics couplings, hinders fast design and optimization of REBCO magnet systems.

Method: Develop a fully connected residual neural network (FCRN) surrogate trained on FEM-generated data with varying numbers of turns and pancakes. Compare deeper networks to a conventional FCN, explore architecture (12 residual blocks, 256 neurons per layer) for balance between accuracy and generalization, and assess extrapolation (up to 50% beyond training range).

Result: FCRN outperforms a standard FCN in convergence for deeper architectures. The configuration with 12 residual blocks and 256 neurons per layer provides the best accuracy-generalization trade-off. The model reliably extrapolates magnetization losses up to 50% beyond the training range with maximum errors below 10%. Predictions are several orders of magnitude faster than FEM, and remain advantageous when training costs are included.

Conclusion: The proposed FCRN-based surrogate offers accurate and efficient rapid analysis for large-scale HTS magnets, enabling faster design and evaluation of REBCO solenoid systems.

Abstract: Finite element method (FEM) is widely used in high-temperature
superconducting (HTS) magnets, but its computational cost increases with magnet
size and becomes time-consuming for meter-scale magnets, especially when
multi-physics couplings are considered, which limits the fast design of
large-scale REBCO magnet systems. In this work, a surrogate model based on a
fully connected residual neural network (FCRN) is developed to predict the
space-time current density distribution in REBCO solenoids. Training datasets
were generated from FEM simulations with varying numbers of turns and pancakes.
The results demonstrate that, for deeper networks, the FCRN architecture
achieves better convergence than conventional fully connected network (FCN),
with the configuration of 12 residual blocks and 256 neurons per layer
providing the most favorable balance between training accuracy and
generalization capability. Extrapolation studies show that the model can
reliably predict magnetization losses for up to 50% beyond the training range,
with maximum errors below 10%. The surrogate model achieves predictions several
orders of magnitude faster than FEM and still remains advantageous when
training costs are included. These results indicate that the proposed
FCRN-based surrogate model provides both accuracy and efficiency, offering a
promising tool for the rapid analysis of large-scale HTS magnets.

*S. R. Eshwar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Optimal policy under quasi-hyperbolic discounting in RL collapses to a one-step non-stationary form; and practical model-free algorithms for evaluation and Q-learning with guarantees are developed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Time-inconsistent preferences are observed in humans/animals; quasi-hyperbolic discounting is a simple model; incorporating this into RL is theoretically and algorithmically underdeveloped, prompting a need for a precommitment-aware framework with guarantees.

Method: Theoretical analysis establishing the optimal policy structure as a one-step non-stationary form; development of practical model-free algorithms for policy evaluation and Q-learning under QH preferences, with convergence proofs.

Result: Proof that the optimal policy in QH-RL is a simple one-step non-stationary form; introduction of practical, convergent model-free algorithms for evaluation and Q-learning in this setting.

Conclusion: Provides foundational tools for integrating quasi-hyperbolic preferences into RL, enabling principled treatment of time-inconsistency and guiding future research.

Abstract: Time-inconsistent preferences, where agents favor smaller-sooner over
larger-later rewards, are a key feature of human and animal decision-making.
Quasi-Hyperbolic (QH) discounting provides a simple yet powerful model for this
behavior, but its integration into the reinforcement learning (RL) framework
has been limited. This paper addresses key theoretical and algorithmic gaps for
precommitted agents with QH preferences. We make two primary contributions: (i)
we formally characterize the structure of the optimal policy, proving for the
first time that it reduces to a simple one-step non-stationary form; and (ii)
we design the first practical, model-free algorithms for both policy evaluation
and Q-learning in this setting, both with provable convergence guarantees. Our
results provide foundational insights for incorporating QH preferences in RL.

*Ambuj Tewari*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A task-first survey unifying generative AI; surveys five model families, introduces probabilistic and game-theoretic perspectives on generation, discusses deployment and responsible AI considerations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clarify what generation is as a distinct ML task, connecting to prediction, compression, and decision-making, and address deployment, safety, and policy implications.

Method: Survey of autoregressive models, variational autoencoders, normalizing flows, GANs, and diffusion models; presentation of a probabilistic framework distinguishing density estimation from generation; development of a two-player adversary-learner game-theoretic view; discussion of post-training modifications and responsible generation topics.

Result: Proposes a task-first framing of generation, with formal distinctions between density estimation and generation, a game-theoretic lens for analyzing generation, and practical considerations for deployment and governance.

Conclusion: Generation should be treated as a distinct ML objective with attention to privacy, detectability of AI content, and IP issues; emphasizes responsible deployment and a unified perspective beyond model-by-model descriptions.

Abstract: Beginning with text and images, generative AI has expanded to audio, video,
computer code, and molecules. Yet, if generative AI is the answer, what is the
question? We explore the foundations of generation as a distinct machine
learning task with connections to prediction, compression, and decision-making.
We survey five major generative model families: autoregressive models,
variational autoencoders, normalizing flows, generative adversarial networks,
and diffusion models. We then introduce a probabilistic framework that
emphasizes the distinction between density estimation and generation. We review
a game-theoretic framework with a two-player adversary-learner setup to study
generation. We discuss post-training modifications that prepare generative
models for deployment. We end by highlighting some important topics in socially
responsible generation such as privacy, detection of AI-generated content, and
copyright and IP. We adopt a task-first framing of generation, focusing on what
generation is as a machine learning problem, rather than only on how models
implement it.

### [207] [Data-Efficient Time-Dependent PDE Surrogates: Graph Neural Simulators vs Neural Operators](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06154)
*Dibyajyoti Nayak,Somdatta Goswami*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Graph Neural Simulators (GNS) with explicit time-stepping provide data-efficient, causally-consistent surrogates for time-dependent PDEs, outperforming neural operators with dramatically less data and reduced autoregressive error.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neural operators often require large datasets and lack explicit local-in-time causality, leading to poor data efficiency and error accumulation over time. There is a need for models that respect physical time evolution while remaining sample-efficient.

Method: Use Graph Neural Simulators (GNS) with message-passing graphs and explicit numerical time-stepping to model instantaneous time derivatives, enabling accurate forward PDE solutions. Employ PCA+KMeans to select informative trajectories for low-data regimes. Evaluate on 2D Burgers (scalar and vector) and Allen-Cahn equations; compare against DeepONet, FNO, and autoregressive variants.

Result: GNS achieves under 1% relative L2 error with only 30 training samples (3% of data) across all three PDEs; significantly reduces autoregressive error (avg. 82.48% vs FNO AR, 99.86% vs DON AR); data-efficiency gains and improved generalization relative to neural-operator baselines.

Conclusion: Combining graph-based local inductive biases with conventional time integrators yields physically consistent, accurate, and scalable surrogates for time-dependent PDEs, especially in low-data settings.

Abstract: Neural operators (NOs) approximate mappings between infinite-dimensional
function spaces but require large datasets and struggle with scarce training
data. Many NO formulations don't explicitly encode causal, local-in-time
structure of physical evolution. While autoregressive models preserve causality
by predicting next time-steps, they suffer from rapid error accumulation. We
employ Graph Neural Simulators (GNS) - a message-passing graph neural network
framework - with explicit numerical time-stepping schemes to construct accurate
forward models that learn PDE solutions by modeling instantaneous time
derivatives. We evaluate our framework on three canonical PDE systems: (1) 2D
Burgers' scalar equation, (2) 2D coupled Burgers' vector equation, and (3) 2D
Allen-Cahn equation. Rigorous evaluations demonstrate GNS significantly
improves data efficiency, achieving higher generalization accuracy with
substantially fewer training trajectories compared to neural operator baselines
like DeepONet and FNO. GNS consistently achieves under 1% relative L2 errors
with only 30 training samples out of 1000 (3% of available data) across all
three PDE systems. It substantially reduces error accumulation over extended
temporal horizons: averaged across all cases, GNS reduces autoregressive error
by 82.48% relative to FNO AR and 99.86% relative to DON AR. We introduce a
PCA+KMeans trajectory selection strategy enhancing low-data performance.
Results indicate combining graph-based local inductive biases with conventional
time integrators yields accurate, physically consistent, and scalable surrogate
models for time-dependent PDEs.

### [208] [Tracking daily paths in home contexts with RSSI fingerprinting based on UWB through deep learning models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06161)
*Aurora Polo-Rodríguez,Juan Carlos Valera,Jesús Peral,David Gil,Javier Medina-Quero*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RSSI-based UWB fingerprinting with CNN/LSTM hybrids achieves ~50 cm MAE for indoor localization to support home activity recognition; hybrid CNN+LSTM outperforms CNN/LSTM alone and Bluetooth baseline.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve indoor positioning for activity recognition in homes; UWB is sensitive to walls/obstacles; fingerprinting with RSSI can mitigate multipath effects and enable robust localization.

Method: Collect RSSI data from inhabitants in two flats (60 m2 and 100 m2) during daily activities; compare CNN, LSTM, and CNN+LSTM models; include Bluetooth baseline; evaluate temporal window types (future, past, or combined).

Result: Mean absolute error ~50 cm; hybrid CNN+LSTM provides best accuracy; RSSI fingerprinting can enable accurate location estimates for residential activity recognition.

Conclusion: Fingerprinting-based RSSI deep learning approach is effective for accurate indoor localization in home settings; implications for improving daily activity recognition; future work could address generalization and robustness to environment changes.

Abstract: The field of human activity recognition has evolved significantly, driven
largely by advancements in Internet of Things (IoT) device technology,
particularly in personal devices. This study investigates the use of
ultra-wideband (UWB) technology for tracking inhabitant paths in home
environments using deep learning models. UWB technology estimates user
locations via time-of-flight and time-difference-of-arrival methods, which are
significantly affected by the presence of walls and obstacles in real
environments, reducing their precision. To address these challenges, we propose
a fingerprinting-based approach utilizing received signal strength indicator
(RSSI) data collected from inhabitants in two flats (60 m2 and 100 m2) while
performing daily activities. We compare the performance of convolutional neural
network (CNN), long short-term memory (LSTM), and hybrid CNN+LSTM models, as
well as the use of Bluetooth technology. Additionally, we evaluate the impact
of the type and duration of the temporal window (future, past, or a combination
of both). Our results demonstrate a mean absolute error close to 50 cm,
highlighting the superiority of the hybrid model in providing accurate location
estimates, thus facilitating its application in daily human activity
recognition in residential settings.

### [209] [An Improved Template for Approximate Computing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06162)
*M. Rezaalipour,F. Costa,M. Biasion,R. Otoni,G. A. Constantinides,L. Pozzi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a template-based circuit rewriting approach to reduce area of adders/multipliers in NN inference, via parametrisable product sharing; achieves better area-accuracy tradeoffs than XPAT and other baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Edge-device neural networks require energy-efficient inference; reducing arithmetic area with small accuracy loss can improve energy efficiency.

Method: Build on XPAT's boolean rewriting; introduce a parametrisable product-sharing template that proxy-synthesizes area; treat template parameters as metrics proxies; optimize for lower area under a given accuracy loss.

Result: Empirically converges to low-area solutions and yields better approximations (area-accuracy tradeoffs) than XPAT and two state-of-the-art approaches.

Conclusion: Template-parametrised rewriting improves area efficiency for approximate computing in NN hardware, enabling better tradeoffs in energy-constrained settings.

Abstract: Deploying neural networks on edge devices entails a careful balance between
the energy required for inference and the accuracy of the resulting
classification. One technique for navigating this tradeoff is approximate
computing: the process of reducing energy consumption by slightly reducing the
accuracy of arithmetic operators. In this context, we propose a methodology to
reduce the area of the small arithmetic operators used in neural networks -
i.e., adders and multipliers - via a small loss in accuracy, and show that we
improve area savings for the same accuracy loss w.r.t. the state of the art. To
achieve our goal, we improve on a boolean rewriting technique recently
proposed, called XPAT, where the use of a parametrisable template to rewrite
circuits has proved to be highly beneficial. In particular, XPAT was able to
produce smaller circuits than comparable approaches while utilising a naive sum
of products template structure. In this work, we show that template parameters
can act as proxies for chosen metrics and we propose a novel template based on
parametrisable product sharing that acts as a close proxy to synthesised area.
We demonstrate experimentally that our methodology converges better to low-area
solutions and that it can find better approximations than both the original
XPAT and two other state-of-the-art approaches.

*Ximena Pocco,Waqar Hassan,Karelia Salinas,Vladimir Molchanov,Luis G. Nonato*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Fusing multimodal urban data into latent representations yields more structured patterns than analyzing sources separately; integrated representations often offer deeper insights, though single-source views can be advantageous in specific scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Urban analytics face high granularity, heterogeneity, and multimodality. The study investigates whether merging data into fused latent representations provides added value over examining each source independently within an integrated visualization framework.

Method: A visualization-assisted framework was developed to compare fused latent representations with separate representations for uncovering patterns from both dynamic and static urban data, at street-level granularity.

Result: Combined latent representations produced more structured patterns; separate representations are useful in particular cases.

Conclusion: Integrated fused representations can enhance pattern discovery in urban analytics, but there are contexts where keeping data sources separate is advantageous; a framework supporting both approaches is beneficial.

Abstract: Urban analytics utilizes extensive datasets with diverse urban information to
simulate, predict trends, and uncover complex patterns within cities. While
these data enables advanced analysis, it also presents challenges due to its
granularity, heterogeneity, and multimodality. To address these challenges,
visual analytics tools have been developed to support the exploration of latent
representations of fused heterogeneous and multimodal data, discretized at a
street-level of detail. However, visualization-assisted tools seldom explore
the extent to which fused data can offer deeper insights than examining each
data source independently within an integrated visualization framework. In this
work, we developed a visualization-assisted framework to analyze whether fused
latent data representations are more effective than separate representations in
uncovering patterns from dynamic and static urban data. The analysis reveals
that combined latent representations produce more structured patterns, while
separate ones are useful in particular cases.

*Chuang Niu,Ge Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A reasoning language model (RLM) that fuses radiology findings with longitudinal medical data to provide an interpretable, data-driven lung cancer risk score, improving accuracy and monitorability over Lung-RADS via distillation, supervised fine-tuning, RL, and chain-of-thought reasoning on NLST datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Lung-RADS relies only on lung nodule characteristics, causing sensitivity–specificity trade-offs. There is a need to incorporate diverse risk factors and longitudinal records for individualized risk assessment and better monitoring in lung cancer screening.

Method: Construct a dataset and perform distillation; supervised fine-tuning; reinforcement learning; evaluate on NLST datasets. The RLM decomposes risk evaluation into sub-components, analyzes contributions of diverse risk factors, and synthesizes them into a final risk score using a data-driven system equation. It provides chain-of-thought reasoning to improve monitorability and facilitate clinical translation.

Result: Significant improvements in risk prediction performance and monitorability on NLST datasets. The model can decompose the risk into sub-components and analyze risk-factor contributions, producing a final, data-driven risk score.

Conclusion: RLM offers improved accuracy and interpretability for lung cancer risk assessment, supporting clinical translation of risk-informed decision-making in screening programs.

Abstract: Accurate risk assessment in lung cancer screening is critical for enabling
early cancer detection and minimizing unnecessary invasive procedures. The Lung
CT Screening Reporting and Data System (Lung-RADS) has been widely used as the
standard framework for patient management and follow-up. Nevertheless,
Lung-RADS faces trade-offs between sensitivity and specificity, as it
stratifies risk solely based on lung nodule characteristics without
incorporating various risk factors. Here we propose a reasoning language model
(RLM) to integrate radiology findings with longitudinal medical records for
individualized lung cancer risk assessment. Through a systematic study
including dataset construction and distillation, supervised fine-tuning,
reinforcement learning, and comprehensive evaluation, our model makes
significant improvements in risk prediction performance on datasets in the
national lung screening trial. Notably, RLM can decompose the risk evaluation
task into sub-components, analyze the contributions of diverse risk factors,
and synthesize them into a final risk score computed using our data-driven
system equation. Our approach improves both predictive accuracy and
monitorability through the chain of thought reasoning process, thereby
facilitating clinical translation into lung cancer screening.

Motivation: Address partial observability and hidden-rule inference in a complex puzzle and evaluate how representation choices influence learning efficiency and transfer in GOHR.

Method: Train a Transformer-based Advantage Actor-Critic (A2C) agent on GOHR using two state representations (Feature-Centric and Object-Centric). The 6x6 board is solved by placing pieces into buckets under partial observations. Experiments include multiple rule-based and trial-list-based setups to study transfer effects and the impact of representation on learning efficiency.

Result: The study analyzes how representation choice (FC vs OC) and transfer between setups affect learning efficiency under partial observability; results highlight the significance of representation on sample efficiency and transfer in GOHR when using a Transformer-based A2C.

Conclusion: Representation choice is impactful for GOHR–object-centric and feature-centric encodings influence learning efficiency, and Transformer-based A2C can learn to infer hidden rules and optimize policies under partial observability with transferable effects across experimental setups.

Abstract: We investigate reinforcement learning in the Game Of Hidden Rules (GOHR)
environment, a complex puzzle in which an agent must infer and execute hidden
rules to clear a 6$\times$6 board by placing game pieces into buckets. We
explore two state representation strategies, namely Feature-Centric (FC) and
Object-Centric (OC), and employ a Transformer-based Advantage Actor-Critic
(A2C) algorithm for training. The agent has access only to partial observations
and must simultaneously infer the governing rule and learn the optimal policy
through experience. We evaluate our models across multiple rule-based and
trial-list-based experimental setups, analyzing transfer effects and the impact
of representation on learning efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Graph clustering under differential privacy suffers from high noise, low efficiency, and poor interpretability. There is a need for private, interpretable pipelines with robust initialization to enhance performance while preserving privacy.

Method: Formulates an SDP-based optimization to identify a key set, uses an HST-based initialization to produce a well-initialized clustering configuration, and then applies a standard k-median clustering step. Explanations for query sets are given via differences from cluster centers.

Result: Empirical experiments on public datasets show that the proposed framework outperforms existing private clustering methods on multiple clustering metrics while strictly preserving differential privacy.

Conclusion: The framework provides an effective, private, and interpretable graph clustering approach, improving performance and interpretability by integrating metric embedding initialization with privacy-preserving clustering.

Abstract: Graph clustering under the framework of differential privacy, which aims to
process graph-structured data while protecting individual privacy, has been
receiving increasing attention. Despite significant achievements in current
research, challenges such as high noise, low efficiency and poor
interpretability continue to severely constrain the development of this field.
In this paper, we construct a differentially private and interpretable graph
clustering approach based on metric embedding initialization. Specifically, we
construct an SDP optimization, extract the key set and provide a
well-initialized clustering configuration using an HST-based initialization
method. Subsequently, we apply an established k-median clustering strategy to
derive the cluster results and offer comparative explanations for the query set
through differences from the cluster centers. Extensive experiments on public
datasets demonstrate that our proposed framework outperforms existing methods
in various clustering metrics while strictly ensuring privacy.

Conclusion: MCIGLE offers a robust approach for exemplar-free continual learning on multimodal graphs, achieving a favorable trade-off between accuracy and memory preservation.

Abstract: Exemplar-free class-incremental learning enables models to learn new classes

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A large-scale urban MIMO CSI dataset (UrbanMIMOMap) generated via high-precision ray tracing for ML-driven radiomap construction, enabling high-fidelity environment maps for 6G; provides dense complex CSI across spatial grid beyond simple path loss; supports ML methods for RM generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 6G requires environment-aware communication and ISAC; public datasets are often SISO and limited, hindering MIMO/RM research; high-quality, large-scale CSI data is needed to train ML models for accurate radio maps.

Method: Generate UrbanMIMOMap using high-precision ray tracing in an urban setting to create dense spatial grids and extract comprehensive complex CSI matrices, extending beyond path loss; include baseline ML evaluation for RM construction; release code and data publicly.

Result: Provides a rich, ground-truth-like MIMO CSI dataset suitable for training and evaluating ML-based RM construction; baseline ML methods demonstrate the dataset's utility for RM tasks and MIMO spatial analysis.

Conclusion: UrbanMIMOMap is a crucial resource for high-precision RM generation, MIMO spatial performance analysis, and ML-driven 6G environment awareness; code and data are publicly available for research and benchmarking.

Abstract: Sixth generation (6G) systems require environment-aware communication, driven
by native artificial intelligence (AI) and integrated sensing and communication
(ISAC). Radio maps (RMs), providing spatially continuous channel information,
are key enablers. However, generating high-fidelity RM ground truth via
electromagnetic (EM) simulations is computationally intensive, motivating
machine learning (ML)-based RM construction. The effectiveness of these
data-driven methods depends on large-scale, high-quality training data. Current
public datasets often focus on single-input single-output (SISO) and limited
information, such as path loss, which is insufficient for advanced multi-input
multi-output (MIMO) systems requiring detailed channel state information (CSI).
To address this gap, this paper presents UrbanMIMOMap, a novel large-scale
urban MIMO CSI dataset generated using high-precision ray tracing. UrbanMIMOMap
offers comprehensive complex CSI matrices across a dense spatial grid, going
beyond traditional path loss data. This rich CSI is vital for constructing
high-fidelity RMs and serves as a fundamental resource for data-driven RM
generation, including deep learning. We demonstrate the dataset's utility
through baseline performance evaluations of representative ML methods for RM
construction. This work provides a crucial dataset and reference for research
in high-precision RM generation, MIMO spatial performance, and ML for 6G
environment awareness. The code and data for this work are available at:

TL;DR: IPR is a quality-constrained prompt routing framework that predicts model quality and uses a tunable tolerance to select cost-efficient LLMs, achieving significant cost savings with similar quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Optimizing performance-cost trade-offs in large-scale LLM deployments by routing queries to the right model while meeting quality constraints.

Method: Modular architecture with lightweight quality estimators trained on 1.5M prompts with calibrated quality scores; user-controlled routing with tolerance tau in [0,1]; frozen encoders with model-specific adapters; IPRBench dataset of 1.5M examples across 11 LLMs; cloud deployment.

Result: 43.9% cost reduction while maintaining quality parity with the top Claude model and sub-150ms latency.

Conclusion: Demonstrates a scalable, tunable routing approach that reduces costs without sacrificing quality, with a benchmark dataset to enable rigorous evaluation and future model integration.

Abstract: Routing incoming queries to the most cost-effective LLM while maintaining
response quality poses a fundamental challenge in optimizing performance-cost
trade-offs for large-scale commercial systems. We present IPR\, a
quality-constrained Intelligent Prompt Routing framework that dynamically
selects optimal models based on predicted response quality and user-specified
tolerance levels. IPR introduces three key innovations: (1) a modular
architecture with lightweight quality estimators trained on 1.5M prompts
annotated with calibrated quality scores, enabling fine-grained quality
prediction across model families; (2) a user-controlled routing mechanism with
tolerance parameter $\tau \in [0,1]$ that provides explicit control over
quality-cost trade-offs; and (3) an extensible design using frozen encoders
with model-specific adapters, reducing new model integration from days to
hours. To rigorously train and evaluate IPR, we curate an industrial-level
dataset IPRBench\footnote{IPRBench will be released upon legal approval.}, a
comprehensive benchmark containing 1.5 million examples with response quality
annotations across 11 LLM candidates. Deployed on a major cloud platform, IPR
achieves 43.9\% cost reduction while maintaining quality parity with the
strongest model in the Claude family and processes requests with sub-150ms

### [217] [RecMind: LLM-Enhanced Graph Neural Networks for Personalized Consumer Recommendations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06286)
*Chang Xue,Youwei Lu,Chen Yang,Jinming Xing*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RecMind combines a frozen LLM-based text representation with a LightGCN graph model, aligning them via symmetric contrastive learning and fusing with intra-layer gating. It treats the LLM as a preference prior rather than a sole ranker, achieving state-of-the-art results on Yelp and Amazon-Electronics across eight metrics, especially in cold-start/long-tail regimes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Personalization remains hard due to sparse interactions, fast content churn, and heterogeneous textual signals. The paper argues for using LLMs as priors to condition embeddings, not as standalone rankers, and for robust fusion with graph structure.

Method: Two-view architecture: (1) text-conditioned embeddings from titles, attributes, and reviews using a frozen LLM with lightweight adapters; (2) collaborative embeddings learned by a LightGCN backbone on the user-item graph. A symmetric contrastive objective aligns the views, and intra-layer gating fuses them, enabling language-dominated recommendations in cold/long-tail scenarios while graph structure stabilizes rankings elsewhere.

Result: Empirical evaluation on Yelp and Amazon-Electronics shows RecMind achieves the best results on all eight reported metrics, with up to +4.53% in Recall@40 and +4.01% in NDCG@40 over strong baselines. Ablation studies confirm that cross-view alignment is necessary and that gating outperforms late fusion and LLM-only variants.

Conclusion: Integrating a frozen LLM as a preference prior with a LightGCN via symmetric contrastive alignment and intra-layer gating yields robust, state-of-the-art personalized rankings, especially for cold-start and long-tail items, by effectively leveraging both textual signals and graph structure.

Abstract: Personalization is a core capability across consumer technologies, streaming,
shopping, wearables, and voice, yet it remains challenged by sparse
interactions, fast content churn, and heterogeneous textual signals. We present
RecMind, an LLM-enhanced graph recommender that treats the language model as a
preference prior rather than a monolithic ranker. A frozen LLM equipped with
lightweight adapters produces text-conditioned user/item embeddings from
titles, attributes, and reviews; a LightGCN backbone learns collaborative
embeddings from the user-item graph. We align the two views with a symmetric
contrastive objective and fuse them via intra-layer gating, allowing language
to dominate in cold/long-tail regimes and graph structure to stabilize rankings
elsewhere. On Yelp and Amazon-Electronics, RecMind attains the best results on
all eight reported metrics, with relative improvements up to +4.53\%
(Recall@40) and +4.01\% (NDCG@40) over strong baselines. Ablations confirm both
the necessity of cross-view alignment and the advantage of gating over late
fusion and LLM-only variants.

*Shaoqi Wei,Senling Wang,Hiroshi Kai,Yoshinobu Higami,Ruijun Ma,Tianming Ni,Xiaoqing Wen,Hiroshi Takahashi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ST-GCN model on gate-level netlists predicts multi-cycle fault impact probabilities quickly with high accuracy, delivering 10x speedups and enabling scalable SoC risk assessment and test-point optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SDEs from time-zero defects and aging threaten safety-critical systems; functional testing is costly; need fast, accurate long-cycle fault impact predictions for risk assessment and test planning.

Method: Model gate-level netlists as spatio-temporal graphs; use dedicated spatial and temporal encoders in a unified ST-GCN to predict multi-cycle FIPs; accepts features from testability metrics or fault simulation; performance evaluated on ISCAS-89; includes test-point selection study; scales to SoC-level and EDA workflows.

Result: >10x simulation time reduction; MAE 0.024 for 5-cycle predictions; robust accuracy; observation-point selection by predicted FIPs improves detection of long-cycle hard faults.

Conclusion: ST-GCN offers fast, accurate FIP prediction, enabling efficient risk assessment and test strategy optimization for SDE-prone circuits and integration into EDA pipelines.

Abstract: Silent Data Errors (SDEs) from time-zero defects and aging degrade
safety-critical systems. Functional testing detects SDE-related faults but is
expensive to simulate. We present a unified spatio-temporal graph convolutional
network (ST-GCN) for fast, accurate prediction of long-cycle fault impact
probabilities (FIPs) in large sequential circuits, supporting quantitative risk
assessment. Gate-level netlists are modeled as spatio-temporal graphs to
capture topology and signal timing; dedicated spatial and temporal encoders
predict multi-cycle FIPs efficiently. On ISCAS-89 benchmarks, the method
reduces simulation time by more than 10x while maintaining high accuracy (mean
absolute error 0.024 for 5-cycle predictions). The framework accepts features
from testability metrics or fault simulation, allowing efficiency-accuracy
trade-offs. A test-point selection study shows that choosing observation points
by predicted FIPs improves detection of long-cycle, hard-to-detect faults. The
approach scales to SoC-level test strategy optimization and fits downstream
electronic design automation flows.

### [219] [LoaQ: Layer-wise Output Approximation Quantization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06297)
*Li Lin,Xiaojun Wan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LoaQ is an output-consistency layer-wise post-training quantization method that better aligns quantized outputs with full-model outputs, offering a closed-form solution, easy integration, and improved quantization quality demonstrated on LLaMA and Qwen.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Layer-wise PTQ typically optimizes locally and yields only activation-aware weight approximations, which can poorly reflect the full model’s outputs. For large language models with specific structural characteristics, there is a need for explicit output-level consistency to improve quantization fidelity.

Method: Introduce LoaQ, an output-approximation objective for layer-wise PTQ that explicitly targets output-level consistency. It offers a simple closed-form solution and is designed to be orthogonal to existing techniques, enabling seamless integration into current quantization pipelines.

Result: Empirical results on the LLaMA and Qwen model families show LoaQ is effective for both weight-only and weight-activation joint quantization, and it can be integrated with existing quantization strategies to improve overall quantization quality.

Conclusion: LoaQ advances post-training quantization by prioritizing output-level alignment, is easily integrable, and holds strong potential to push the frontier of PTQ for LLMs.

Abstract: A natural and intuitive idea in model quantization is to approximate each
component's quantized output to match its original. Layer-wise post-training
quantization (PTQ), though based on this idea, adopts a strictly local view and
can achieve, at best, only activation-aware approximations of weights. As a
result, it often leads to insufficient approximations and practical deviations
from this guiding intuition. Recent work has achieved a more accurate
approximation of linear-layer outputs within the framework of layer-wise PTQ,
but such refinements remain inadequate for achieving alignment with the full
model output. Based on a deeper understanding of the structural characteristics
of mainstream LLMs, we propose $LoaQ$, an output-approximation method for
layer-wise PTQ that explicitly targets output-level consistency. It better
aligns with this intuition and can feature a simple closed-form solution,
making it orthogonal to existing techniques and readily integrable into
existing quantization pipelines. Experiments on the LLaMA and Qwen model
families demonstrate that LoaQ performs effectively in both weight-only and
weight-activation joint quantization. By integrating seamlessly with existing
quantization strategies, it further enhances overall quantization quality and
shows strong potential to advance the frontier of post-training quantization.

### [220] [WindFM: An Open-Source Foundation Model for Zero-Shot Wind Power Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06311)
*Hang Fan,Yu Shi,Zongliang Fu,Shuo Chen,Wei Wei,Wei Xu,Jian Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: WindFM is a lightweight generative foundation model for probabilistic wind power forecasting that uses a discretize-and-generate pipeline with a time-series tokenizer and decoder-only Transformer, achieving state-of-the-art zero-shot performance across deterministic and probabilistic tasks and robust OOD transfer, with 8.1M parameters and no fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome generalization limits of site-specific wind forecasting models and the difficulty of injecting domain data into general-purpose foundation models, by building a domain-focused, transferable foundation model for wind power.

Method: Discretize continuous multivariate data into discrete tokens via a time-series tokenizer; train a decoder-only Transformer autoregressively on token sequences; pre-train on WIND Toolkit (~150B time steps from 126k sites) to capture wind–power dynamics; evaluate zero-shot on deterministic and probabilistic forecasting tasks; assess robustness to out-of-distribution data from a different continent; model size 8.1M; public code.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on both deterministic and probabilistic forecasting tasks without fine-tuning; outperforms specialized models and larger foundation models; demonstrates robustness under out-of-distribution continental data.

Conclusion: WindFM provides a compact, generalizable foundation model tailored for wind power forecasting, enabling accurate, robust probabilistic forecasts without site-specific fine-tuning, and offers public access to the pretrained model.

Abstract: High-quality wind power forecasting is crucial for the operation of modern
power grids. However, prevailing data-driven paradigms either train a
site-specific model which cannot generalize to other locations or rely on
fine-tuning of general-purpose time series foundation models which are
difficult to incorporate domain-specific data in the energy sector. This paper
introduces WindFM, a lightweight and generative Foundation Model designed
specifically for probabilistic wind power forecasting. WindFM employs a
discretize-and-generate framework. A specialized time-series tokenizer first
converts continuous multivariate observations into discrete, hierarchical
tokens. Subsequently, a decoder-only Transformer learns a universal
representation of wind generation dynamics by autoregressively pre-training on
these token sequences. Using the comprehensive WIND Toolkit dataset comprising
approximately 150 billion time steps from more than 126,000 sites, WindFM
develops a foundational understanding of the complex interplay between
atmospheric conditions and power output. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our compact 8.1M parameter model achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot
performance on both deterministic and probabilistic tasks, outperforming
specialized models and larger foundation models without any fine-tuning. In
particular, WindFM exhibits strong adaptiveness under out-of-distribution data
from a different continent, demonstrating the robustness and transferability of
its learned representations. Our pre-trained model is publicly available at
https://github.com/shiyu-coder/WindFM.

### [221] [Evaluating the Efficiency of Latent Spaces via the Coupling-Matrix](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06314)
*Mehmet Can Yavuz,Berrin Yanikoglu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces rho(C), a redundancy index that quantifies inter-dimensional dependencies in latent representations using coupling matrices and energy-distance testing; it predicts performance and can guide NAS and regularization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Redundancy in latent spaces hampers expressiveness and generalization; existing metrics fail to isolate redundancy; need a direct statistical measure of representational bottlenecks.

Method: Compute coupling matrices from latent embeddings, compare off-diagonal statistics to a normal distribution via energy distance to obtain rho(C); analyze across models/datasets; reliability grows with latent dimension; use Tree-structured Parzen Estimators (TPE) to explore low-rho regions.

Result: Low rho(C) correlates with high accuracy or low reconstruction error; high rho associated with performance collapse; rho(C) robust across datasets (MNIST variants, Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10/100) and architectures; reliability improves with latent dimension; TPE biases toward low-rho regions; suggests rho(C) as a criterion for NAS and redundancy-aware regularization.

Conclusion: rho(C) provides a universal bottleneck measure of representational efficiency that can guide architecture search and regularization; offers both theoretical insight and a practical tool for evaluating and improving latent representations.

Abstract: A central challenge in representation learning is constructing latent
embeddings that are both expressive and efficient. In practice, deep networks
often produce redundant latent spaces where multiple coordinates encode
overlapping information, reducing effective capacity and hindering
generalization. Standard metrics such as accuracy or reconstruction loss
provide only indirect evidence of such redundancy and cannot isolate it as a
failure mode. We introduce a redundancy index, denoted rho(C), that directly
quantifies inter-dimensional dependencies by analyzing coupling matrices
derived from latent representations and comparing their off-diagonal statistics
against a normal distribution via energy distance. The result is a compact,
interpretable, and statistically grounded measure of representational quality.
We validate rho(C) across discriminative and generative settings on MNIST
variants, Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100, spanning multiple
architectures and hyperparameter optimization strategies. Empirically, low
rho(C) reliably predicts high classification accuracy or low reconstruction
error, while elevated redundancy is associated with performance collapse.
Estimator reliability grows with latent dimension, yielding natural lower
bounds for reliable analysis. We further show that Tree-structured Parzen
Estimators (TPE) preferentially explore low-rho regions, suggesting that rho(C)
can guide neural architecture search and serve as a redundancy-aware
regularization target. By exposing redundancy as a universal bottleneck across
models and tasks, rho(C) offers both a theoretical lens and a practical tool
for evaluating and improving the efficiency of learned representations.

### [222] [Text-Trained LLMs Can Zero-Shot Extrapolate PDE Dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06322)
*Jiajun Bao,Nicolas Boullé,Toni J. B. Liu,Raphaël Sarfati,Christopher J. Earls*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Text-trained foundation models can extrapolate discretized PDE dynamics via in-context learning without fine-tuning; predictive accuracy improves with longer temporal context but degrades at finer spatial discretization; in multi-step rollouts, errors grow algebraically with time horizon, echoing global error accumulation in finite-difference solvers; there is an in-context neural scaling law linking context length and output length, and a progression in token-level generation from imitation to exploratory to numerically grounded predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate whether text-trained foundation models can perform accurate, fine-tuning-free extrapolation of spatiotemporal dynamics from discretized PDE solutions, and to uncover how ICL scales with context/output length and how the model internally processes PDE data.

Method: Experimentally prompt text-trained foundation models with discretized PDE solutions to forecast future states without fine-tuning or NL prompts. Vary temporal context length and spatial discretization, perform multi-step rollouts (recursive predictions over time), analyze token-level output distributions to characterize the ICL progression, and examine error growth dynamics.

Result: Prediction accuracy increases with longer temporal context but worsens with finer spatial discretization. In multi-step rollouts, the forward-error grows algebraically with the number of steps (time horizon). The authors identify in-context neural scaling laws: prediction quality varies predictably with context length and output length. Token-level analysis reveals an ICL progression: imitation of syntactic patterns, then a high-entropy exploratory phase, and finally confident, numerically grounded predictions.

Conclusion: LLMs can extrapolate discretized PDE dynamics via in-context learning without fine-tuning, with predictable scaling of performance w.r.t. context and output lengths. The work sheds light on how LLMs internally process numerical PDE information and suggests potential for in-context numerical tasks, while also highlighting limits related to spatial discretization granularity.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated emergent in-context learning
(ICL) capabilities across a range of tasks, including zero-shot time-series
forecasting. We show that text-trained foundation models can accurately
extrapolate spatiotemporal dynamics from discretized partial differential
equation (PDE) solutions without fine-tuning or natural language prompting.
Predictive accuracy improves with longer temporal contexts but degrades at
finer spatial discretizations. In multi-step rollouts, where the model
recursively predicts future spatial states over multiple time steps, errors
grow algebraically with the time horizon, reminiscent of global error
accumulation in classical finite-difference solvers. We interpret these trends
as in-context neural scaling laws, where prediction quality varies predictably
with both context length and output length. To better understand how LLMs are
able to internally process PDE solutions so as to accurately roll them out, we
analyze token-level output distributions and uncover a consistent ICL
progression: beginning with syntactic pattern imitation, transitioning through
an exploratory high-entropy phase, and culminating in confident, numerically
grounded predictions.

*Guanlan Hu,Adit Anand,Pooja M. Desai,Iñigo Urteaga,Lena Mamykina*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Machine learning with nutrition-domain enrichment can classify meal logs against nutritional goals, outperforming self-assessment; enrichment boosts accuracy and shows variability by goal.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To unlock actionable nutrition insights from patient-generated free-text meal logs by combining NLP with domain-specific nutrition knowledge, enabling precision nutrition support especially in diverse, low-income settings.

Method: Dataset of 3000 meal records from 114 individuals in a diverse, low-income US community collected via a mobile app. Gold standard labels provided by registered dietitians. Methods included text embeddings (TFIDF, BERT) and nutrition-domain enrichment (ontologies, ingredient parsers, macronutrient contents). Classifiers: logistic regression and multilayer perceptron. Evaluation against dietitian gold standard and self-assessments using accuracy, precision, recall, F1.

Result: Without enrichment, ML outperformed self-assessments. The best performance came from combining ML with enrichment. Enrichment components—Parsed Ingredients, Food Entities, and Macronutrients—improved performance across multiple nutritional goals, though the impact varied by goal and classifier.

Conclusion: ML can effectively use unstructured free-text meal logs to determine alignment with nutritional goals, exceeding self-assessments, especially when incorporating nutrition-domain knowledge; supports patient-centered nutrition guidance in precision healthcare.

Abstract: This study examined the use of machine learning and domain specific
enrichment on patient generated health data, in the form of free text meal
logs, to classify meals on alignment with different nutritional goals. We used
a dataset of over 3000 meal records collected by 114 individuals from a
diverse, low income community in a major US city using a mobile app. Registered
dietitians provided expert judgement for meal to goal alignment, used as gold
standard for evaluation. Using text embeddings, including TFIDF and BERT, and
domain specific enrichment information, including ontologies, ingredient
parsers, and macronutrient contents as inputs, we evaluated the performance of
logistic regression and multilayer perceptron classifiers using accuracy,
precision, recall, and F1 score against the gold standard and self assessment.
Even without enrichment, ML outperformed self assessments of individuals who
logged meals, and the best performing combination of ML classifier with
enrichment achieved even higher accuracies. In general, ML classifiers with
enrichment of Parsed Ingredients, Food Entities, and Macronutrients information
performed well across multiple nutritional goals, but there was variability in
the impact of enrichment and classification algorithm on accuracy of
classification for different nutritional goals. In conclusion, ML can utilize
unstructured free text meal logs and reliably classify whether meals align with
specific nutritional goals, exceeding self assessments, especially when
incorporating nutrition domain knowledge. Our findings highlight the potential
of ML analysis of patient generated health data to support patient centered
nutrition guidance in precision healthcare.

*Roussel Rahman,Aashwin Ananda Mishra*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LLMs excel at deterministic numeric tasks but falter on a combinatorial puzzle (Game of 24), suggesting their numerical reasoning relies on pattern matching rather than flexible problem-solving.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Assess the robustness of LLM-based numeracy across tasks of increasing complexity and distinguish true reasoning from recall of algorithms.

Method: Evaluate several state-of-the-art LLM-based agents on a 100-problem challenge spanning four categories (basic arithmetic, advanced operations, primality checking, Game of 24); measure accuracy and analyze failure modes to identify bottlenecks related to heuristic search versus algorithmic execution.

Result: Agents show high accuracy on the first three categories that align with deterministic algorithms, but consistently fail at the Game of 24 puzzle, indicating a bottleneck in heuristic search over a large combinatorial space and revealing a reliance on recalling/executing known algorithms rather than true generative problem-solving.

Conclusion: Current numerical ability in LLMs appears limited to pattern-based execution of known algorithms; they struggle with tasks requiring novel or creative numerical insight, highlighting a need for improved reasoning strategies or integration of search/external tools for genuine numeracy.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable emergent
capabilities, yet the robustness of their numerical reasoning remains an open
question. While standard benchmarks evaluate LLM reasoning on complex problem
sets using aggregated metrics, they often obscure foundational weaknesses. In
this work, we probe LLM mathematical numeracy by evaluating performance on
problems of escalating complexity, from constituent operations to combinatorial
puzzles. We test several state-of-the-art LLM-based agents on a 100-problem
challenge comprising four categories: (1) basic arithmetic, (2) advanced
operations, (3) primality checking, and (4) the Game of 24 number puzzle. Our
results show that while the agents achieved high accuracy on the first three
categories, which require deterministic algorithmic execution, they
consistently failed at the number puzzle, underlining its demand for a
heuristic search over a large combinatorial space to be a significant
bottleneck. These findings reveal that the agents' proficiency is largely
confined to recalling and executing known algorithms, rather than performing
generative problem-solving. This suggests their apparent numerical reasoning is
more akin to sophisticated pattern-matching than flexible, analytical thought,
limiting their potential for tasks that require novel or creative numerical
insights.

### [225] [Ban&Pick: Achieving Free Performance Gains and Inference Speedup via Smarter Routing in MoE-LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06346)
*Yuanteng Chen,Peisong Wang,Yuantian Shao,Jian Cheng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Ban&Pick is a post-training, plug-and-play method that identifies a small set of highly influential MoE experts and prunes redundant ones, yielding accuracy gains and faster inference without retraining or changing architecture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In fine-grained sparse MoEs, routers optimized for stability lead to premature convergence and enforced balanced usage. This causes underutilization of influential experts and redundancy from fixed active-expert counts, limiting model performance and efficiency.

Method: A post-training pipeline with two components: Pick, which discovers and reinforces a small group of key experts with outsized impact; Ban, which dynamically prunes redundant experts based on layer- and token-sensitivity. This does not require retraining or architectural revisions and is plug-and-play.

Result: Experiments on DeepSeek and Qwen3 (math, code, general reasoning) show improvements in accuracy (e.g., Qwen3-30B-A3B: AIME2024 from 80.67 to 84.66; GPQA-Diamond from 65.66 to 68.18) and a 1.25x inference acceleration under vLLM.

Conclusion: Ban&Pick delivers free performance gains and faster inference for fine-grained MoE-LLMs without retraining or architectural changes, and can be applied broadly to existing MoE deployments.

Abstract: Sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) has become a key architecture for scaling
large language models (LLMs) efficiently. Recent fine-grained MoE designs
introduce hundreds of experts per layer, with multiple experts activated per
token, enabling stronger specialization. However, during pre-training, routers
are optimized mainly for stability and robustness: they converge prematurely
and enforce balanced usage, limiting the full potential of model performance
and efficiency. In this work, we uncover two overlooked issues: (i) a few
highly influential experts are underutilized due to premature and balanced
routing decisions; and (ii) enforcing a fixed number of active experts per
token introduces substantial redundancy. Instead of retraining models or
redesigning MoE architectures, we introduce Ban&Pick, a post-training,
plug-and-play strategy for smarter MoE routing. Pick discovers and reinforces
key experts-a small group with outsized impact on performance-leading to
notable accuracy gains across domains. Ban complements this by dynamically
pruning redundant experts based on layer and token sensitivity, delivering
faster inference with minimal accuracy loss. Experiments on fine-grained
MoE-LLMs (DeepSeek, Qwen3) across math, code, and general reasoning benchmarks
demonstrate that Ban&Pick delivers free performance gains and inference
acceleration without retraining or architectural changes. For instance, on
Qwen3-30B-A3B, it improves accuracy from 80.67 to 84.66 on AIME2024 and from
65.66 to 68.18 on GPQA-Diamond, while accelerating inference by 1.25x under the
vLLM.

TL;DR: On-device AI models can be extracted and manipulated to bypass detection, revealing security gaps in mobile AI deployments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As AI moves onto devices to improve privacy and latency, new security risks emerge that differ from traditional software; this paper investigates those risks using a real-world case study.

Method: Real-world case study of an Android system service (SafetyCore) for sensitive image content detection; demonstrates extraction and manipulation of the on-device model to bypass detection, accompanied by vulnerability analysis.

Result: The study shows that on-device models can be exfiltrated and attacked to bypass protection, effectively rendering the detector unreliable in practice.

Conclusion: On-device AI security requires stronger protection mechanisms and mitigations; the findings highlight concrete attack vectors and the need for robust defenses for on-device detectors.

Abstract: Due to hardware and software improvements, an increasing number of AI models
are deployed on-device. This shift enhances privacy and reduces latency, but
also introduces security risks distinct from traditional software. In this
article, we examine these risks through the real-world case study of
SafetyCore, an Android system service incorporating sensitive image content
detection. We demonstrate how the on-device AI model can be extracted and
manipulated to bypass detection, effectively rendering the protection
ineffective. Our analysis exposes vulnerabilities of on-device AI models and
provides a practical demonstration of how adversaries can exploit them.

*Hyungjoon Soh,Dongha Lee,Vipul Periwal,Junghyo Jo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces Variational Garrote (VG), a statistical-physics-based sparse regression method with explicit feature-spin variables and variational inference, enhanced by automatic differentiation for scalable optimization. VG shows strong, robust variable selection in highly sparse regimes, with a sharp transition signal that helps estimate the number of relevant variables and identify key predictors in real-world data; outperforms Ridge and LASSO in sparse settings and has potential for sparse modeling tasks including compressed sensing and model pruning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need for reliable, interpretable feature selection in high-dimensional data. Sparse models offer simplicity but existing methods (Ridge, LASSO) can struggle in extreme sparsity; physics-inspired methods like Variational Garrote (VG) may offer robustness and scalability but are underutilized.

Method: Adaptation of a statistical-physics–based Variational Garrote (VG) that introduces explicit feature-selection spin variables and uses variational inference to derive a tractable loss. The approach is enhanced with modern automatic differentiation to enable scalable optimization. Evaluated on synthetic datasets (fully controllable) and complex real-world datasets.

Result: VG performs especially well in highly sparse regimes, providing more consistent and robust variable selection than Ridge and LASSO across varying sparsity levels. A sharp transition is observed: as superfluous variables are admitted, generalization degrades abruptly and uncertainty in variable selection increases. This transition point serves as a practical signal for estimating the correct number of relevant variables, enabling identification of key predictors in real data.

Conclusion: VG offers strong potential for sparse modeling across diverse applications, including compressed sensing and model pruning in machine learning.

Abstract: Selecting key variables from high-dimensional data is increasingly important
in the era of big data. Sparse regression serves as a powerful tool for this
purpose by promoting model simplicity and explainability. In this work, we
revisit a valuable yet underutilized method, the statistical physics-based
Variational Garrote (VG), which introduces explicit feature selection spin
variables and leverages variational inference to derive a tractable loss
function. We enhance VG by incorporating modern automatic differentiation
techniques, enabling scalable and efficient optimization. We evaluate VG on
both fully controllable synthetic datasets and complex real-world datasets. Our
results demonstrate that VG performs especially well in highly sparse regimes,
offering more consistent and robust variable selection than Ridge and LASSO
regression across varying levels of sparsity. We also uncover a sharp
transition: as superfluous variables are admitted, generalization degrades
abruptly and the uncertainty of the selection variables increases. This
transition point provides a practical signal for estimating the correct number
of relevant variables, an insight we successfully apply to identify key
predictors in real-world data. We expect that VG offers strong potential for
sparse modeling across a wide range of applications, including compressed
sensing and model pruning in machine learning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MGKD: A teacher-student distillation framework that leverages in-service data to improve pre-service risk prediction, using multi-granularity distillation and re-weighting to handle class imbalance, validated on large Tencent Mpay datasets offline and online.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pre-service risk assessment often ignores valuable signals from in-service user behavior and struggles with class imbalance; integrating in-service patterns can enhance early risk prediction before service activation.

Method: Three-part approach: (1) teacher model trained on historical in-service data; (2) student model trained on pre-service data using soft labels from the teacher; (3) multi-granularity distillation (coarse-grained, fine-grained, and self-distillation) to align representations/predictions; plus a re-weighting strategy to mitigate minority-class bias.

Result: Experiments on large-scale real-world Tencent Mobile Payment data show MGKD improves risk prediction and is effective in both offline and online deployments.

Conclusion: MGKD effectively transfers defaulter-related patterns from the teacher to the student, enhancing pre-service risk assessment with a scalable, multi-granularity, re-weighted distillation framework.

Abstract: Typical financial risk management involves distinct phases for pre-service
risk assessment and in-service default detection, often modeled separately.
This paper proposes a novel framework, Multi-Granularity Knowledge Distillation
(abbreviated as MGKD), aimed at improving pre-service risk prediction through
the integration of in-service user behavior data. MGKD follows the idea of
knowledge distillation, where the teacher model, trained on historical
in-service data, guides the student model, which is trained on pre-service
data. By using soft labels derived from in-service data, the teacher model
helps the student model improve its risk prediction prior to service
activation. Meanwhile, a multi-granularity distillation strategy is introduced,
including coarse-grained, fine-grained, and self-distillation, to align the
representations and predictions of the teacher and student models. This
approach not only reinforces the representation of default cases but also
enables the transfer of key behavioral patterns associated with defaulters from
the teacher to the student model, thereby improving the overall performance of
pre-service risk assessment. Moreover, we adopt a re-weighting strategy to
mitigate the model's bias towards the minority class. Experimental results on
large-scale real-world datasets from Tencent Mobile Payment demonstrate the
effectiveness of our proposed approach in both offline and online scenarios.

Motivation: To meet minimum data rate constraints in growing wireless networks where penalty-based DL methods lack convergence guarantees and fail to consistently satisfy QoS requirements.

Method: 1) Develop eWMMSE: a multi-channel extension of WMMSE with QoS constraints that is provably convergent to a local optimum when the problem is feasible. 2) Propose JCPGNN-M, a GNN-based allocator that supports simultaneous multi-channel allocation per user. 3) Integrate GNN with a Lagrangian-based primal-dual optimization during training to enforce QoS constraints and ensure convergence to a stationary point.

Result: Simulation results show JCPGNN-M achieves performance on par with eWMMSE while offering faster inference, better scalability to larger networks, and robustness under imperfect CSI.

Conclusion: The framework provides a scalable, theoretically grounded approach for constrained resource allocation in next-generation wireless networks, combining convergence guarantees with the practical benefits of GNN-based inference.

Abstract: Meeting minimum data rate constraints is a significant challenge in wireless
communication systems, particularly as network complexity grows. Traditional
deep learning approaches often address these constraints by incorporating
penalty terms into the loss function and tuning hyperparameters empirically.
However, this heuristic treatment offers no theoretical convergence guarantees
and frequently fails to satisfy QoS requirements in practical scenarios.
Building upon the structure of the WMMSE algorithm, we first extend it to a
multi-channel setting with QoS constraints, resulting in the enhanced WMMSE
(eWMMSE) algorithm, which is provably convergent to a locally optimal solution
when the problem is feasible. To further reduce computational complexity and
improve scalability, we develop a GNN-based algorithm, JCPGNN-M, capable of
supporting simultaneous multi-channel allocation per user. To overcome the
limitations of traditional deep learning methods, we propose a principled
framework that integrates GNN with a Lagrangian-based primal-dual optimization
method. By training the GNN within the Lagrangian framework, we ensure
satisfaction of QoS constraints and convergence to a stationary point.
Extensive simulations demonstrate that JCPGNN-M matches the performance of
eWMMSE while offering significant gains in inference speed, generalization to
larger networks, and robustness under imperfect channel state information. This
work presents a scalable and theoretically grounded solution for constrained
resource allocation in future wireless networks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: NeuroDeX uses LLM-based semantic understanding and dynamic analysis to decompile DNN executables into high-level models, handling both non-quantized and quantized forms, with strong experimental results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enable reliable reverse engineering of optimized DNN executables on edge devices to facilitate understanding, optimization, and interoperability amid compilation optimizations and quantization.

Method: Combine semantic analysis from large language models with dynamic analysis to identify operator types, recover operator attributes, and reconstruct the overall DNN model; evaluate on 96 executables across 12 models, across architectures and quantization states.

Result: Non-quantized executables are decompiled into high-level models that are nearly identical to originals; quantized executables achieve about 72% top-1 accuracy in reconstructed models; NeuroDeX outperforms prior decompilers.

Conclusion: NeuroDeX provides a comprehensive and effective solution for decompiling DNN executables, enabling better understanding and potential optimization across diverse architectures and quantization schemes.

Abstract: On-device deep learning models have extensive real world demands. Deep
learning compilers efficiently compile models into executables for deployment
on edge devices, but these executables may face the threat of reverse
engineering. Previous studies have attempted to decompile DNN executables, but
they face challenges in handling compilation optimizations and analyzing
quantized compiled models. In this paper, we present NeuroDeX to unlock diverse
support in decompiling DNN executables. NeuroDeX leverages the semantic
understanding capabilities of LLMs along with dynamic analysis to accurately
and efficiently perform operator type recognition, operator attribute recovery
and model reconstruction. NeuroDeX can recover DNN executables into high-level
models towards compilation optimizations, different architectures and quantized
compiled models. We conduct experiments on 96 DNN executables across 12 common
DNN models. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that NeuroDeX can
decompile non-quantized executables into nearly identical high-level models.
NeuroDeX can recover functionally similar high-level models for quantized
executables, achieving an average top-1 accuracy of 72%. NeuroDeX offers a more
comprehensive and effective solution compared to previous DNN executables
decompilers.

### [231] [CAPMix: Robust Time Series Anomaly Detection Based on Abnormal Assumptions with Dual-Space Mixup](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06419)
*Xudong Mou,Rui Wang,Tiejun Wang,Renyu Yang,Shiru Chen,Jie Sun,Tianyu Wo,Xudong Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CAPMix is a controllable anomaly augmentation framework for time-series anomaly detection that tackles patchy generation and anomaly shift via CutAddPaste, adaptive label revision, and dual-space mixup within a temporal CNN, achieving strong gains across five benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Time-series anomaly detection faces scarce labeled anomalies and complex temporal dependencies. Existing anomaly-assumption augmentation can produce patchy, incoherent anomalies or distort decision boundaries (anomaly shift). A more controllable, robust augmentation strategy is needed.

Method: CAPMix consists of (1) CutAddPaste to inject diverse, coherent anomalies in a targeted way; (2) a label revision strategy to adaptively refine anomaly labels and reduce anomaly shift; (3) dual-space mixup within a temporal convolutional network to enforce smoother, more robust decision boundaries.

Result: CAPMix yields significant improvements over state-of-the-art baselines on five datasets (AIOps, UCR, SWaT, WADI, ESA) and shows enhanced robustness to contaminated training data.

Conclusion: CAPMix effectively addresses patchy generation and anomaly shift, providing a controllable anomaly augmentation framework for TSAD with strong empirical gains and practical robustness; code is publicly available.

Abstract: Time series anomaly detection (TSAD) is a vital yet challenging task,
particularly in scenarios where labeled anomalies are scarce and temporal
dependencies are complex. Recent anomaly assumption (AA) approaches alleviate
the lack of anomalies by injecting synthetic samples and training
discriminative models. Despite promising results, these methods often suffer
from two fundamental limitations: patchy generation, where scattered anomaly
knowledge leads to overly simplistic or incoherent anomaly injection, and
Anomaly Shift, where synthetic anomalies either resemble normal data too
closely or diverge unrealistically from real anomalies, thereby distorting
classification boundaries. In this paper, we propose CAPMix, a controllable
anomaly augmentation framework that addresses both issues. First, we design a
CutAddPaste mechanism to inject diverse and complex anomalies in a targeted
manner, avoiding patchy generation. Second, we introduce a label revision
strategy to adaptively refine anomaly labels, reducing the risk of anomaly
shift. Finally, we employ dual-space mixup within a temporal convolutional
network to enforce smoother and more robust decision boundaries. Extensive
experiments on five benchmark datasets, including AIOps, UCR, SWaT, WADI, and
ESA, demonstrate that CAPMix achieves significant improvements over
state-of-the-art baselines, with enhanced robustness against contaminated
training data. The code is available at https://github.com/alsike22/CAPMix.

### [232] [CAME-AB: Cross-Modality Attention with Mixture-of-Experts for Antibody Binding Site Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06465)
*Hongzong Li,Jiahao Ma,Zhanpeng Shi,Fanming Jin,Ye-Fan Hu,Jian-Dong Huang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A multimodal deep learning model (CAME-AB) integrates five biological modalities with a cross-modality attention and Mixture-of-Experts backbone to predict antibody binding sites on antigens, achieving superior accuracy over baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing antibody binding site prediction methods rely on single-view features (sequence or structure) and fail to capture antibody-specific antigen interactions, limiting representation and predictive performance.

Method: CAME-AB uses five modalities (raw amino acid encodings, BLOSUM profiles, pretrained language model embeddings, structure-aware features, and GCN-refined biochemical graphs) fused via an adaptive modality fusion module. A Transformer encoder with an MoE backbone enables feature specialization, reinforced by a supervised contrastive objective. Stochastic weight averaging is used to stabilize training. The approach is evaluated on benchmark antibody-antigen datasets with ablations to validate components.

Result: CAME-AB consistently outperforms strong baselines across metrics (Precision, Recall, F1-score, AUC-ROC, MCC). Ablation studies confirm the contribution of each component and the benefit of multimodal integration.

Conclusion: A robust, multimodal framework that leverages cross-modal reasoning and MoE capacity with contrastive learning improves antibody binding site prediction, with code available publicly.

Abstract: Antibody binding site prediction plays a pivotal role in computational
immunology and therapeutic antibody design. Existing sequence or structure
methods rely on single-view features and fail to identify antibody-specific
binding sites on the antigens-a dual limitation in representation and
prediction. In this paper, we propose CAME-AB, a novel Cross-modality Attention
framework with a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) backbone for robust antibody binding
site prediction. CAME-AB integrates five biologically grounded modalities,
including raw amino acid encodings, BLOSUM substitution profiles, pretrained
language model embeddings, structure-aware features, and GCN-refined
biochemical graphs-into a unified multimodal representation. To enhance
adaptive cross-modal reasoning, we propose an adaptive modality fusion module
that learns to dynamically weight each modality based on its global relevance
and input-specific contribution. A Transformer encoder combined with an MoE
module further promotes feature specialization and capacity expansion. We
additionally incorporate a supervised contrastive learning objective to
explicitly shape the latent space geometry, encouraging intra-class compactness
and inter-class separability. To improve optimization stability and
generalization, we apply stochastic weight averaging during training. Extensive
experiments on benchmark antibody-antigen datasets demonstrate that CAME-AB
consistently outperforms strong baselines on multiple metrics, including
Precision, Recall, F1-score, AUC-ROC, and MCC. Ablation studies further
validate the effectiveness of each architectural component and the benefit of
multimodal feature integration. The model implementation details and the codes

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes DyC-STG, a dynamic causal spatio-temporal graph network for real-time IoT data credibility, combining event-driven topology updates and causal reasoning; reports SOTA F1 of 0.930 and 1.4pp improvement, with two datasets released.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses data credibility in IoT spatio-temporal data, particularly in human-centric environments, where static STG topologies fail to capture event-driven dynamics and spurious correlations undermine robustness.

Method: Two modules: (1) an event-driven dynamic graph module updating the graph topology in real time to reflect physical state changes; (2) a causal reasoning module distilling causally-aware representations by enforcing temporal precedence; plus release of two real-world datasets.

Result: Comprehensive experiments show DyC-STG outperforms the strongest baselines by 1.4 percentage points and achieves an F1-Score up to 0.930.

Conclusion: DyC-STG advances real-time data credibility analysis in IoT by integrating dynamic graphs with causal reasoning; datasets released to spur further research.

Abstract: The wide spreading of Internet of Things (IoT) sensors generates vast
spatio-temporal data streams, but ensuring data credibility is a critical yet
unsolved challenge for applications like smart homes. While spatio-temporal
graph (STG) models are a leading paradigm for such data, they often fall short
in dynamic, human-centric environments due to two fundamental limitations: (1)
their reliance on static graph topologies, which fail to capture physical,
event-driven dynamics, and (2) their tendency to confuse spurious correlations
with true causality, undermining robustness in human-centric environments. To
address these gaps, we propose the Dynamic Causal Spatio-Temporal Graph Network
(DyC-STG), a novel framework designed for real-time data credibility analysis
in IoT. Our framework features two synergistic contributions: an event-driven
dynamic graph module that adapts the graph topology in real-time to reflect
physical state changes, and a causal reasoning module to distill causally-aware
representations by strictly enforcing temporal precedence. To facilitate the
research in this domain we release two new real-world datasets. Comprehensive
experiments show that DyC-STG establishes a new state-of-the-art, outperforming
the strongest baselines by 1.4 percentage points and achieving an F1-Score of
up to 0.930.

*Marco Hoffmann,Thomas Specht,Quirin Göttl,Jakob Burger,Stephan Mandt,Hans Hasse,Fabian Jirasek*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A physics-informed neural network, HANNA, predicts the excess Gibbs energy of liquid mixtures from molecular structure with thermodynamic consistency, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy and robust multi-component extrapolation; code and an interactive interface are released.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Predicting excess Gibbs energy for multi-component mixtures from only molecular structures is a long-standing, hard challenge. Enforcing physical laws as hard constraints can enforce thermodynamic consistency and improve extrapolation.

Method: End-to-end training of a physics-informed neural network (HANNA) with hard physical constraints; a surrogate solver enables inclusion of liquid-liquid equilibrium data; a geometric projection method allows robust extrapolation to multi-component mixtures without extra parameters; trained on extensive binary data from the Dortmund Data Bank; code and data are released.

Result: HANNA delivers highly accurate predictions, outperforming state-of-the-art benchmarks in accuracy and scope; robust extrapolation to multi-component mixtures without additional parameters; the approach is thermodynamically consistent and broadly applicable.

Conclusion: Physics-informed ML can effectively predict thermodynamic properties like excess Gibbs energy for complex mixtures, and the work provides open-source tools and interfaces (MLPROP) to facilitate adoption and further research.

Abstract: The excess Gibbs energy plays a central role in chemical engineering and
chemistry, providing a basis for modeling the thermodynamic properties of
liquid mixtures. Predicting the excess Gibbs energy of multi-component mixtures
solely from the molecular structures of their components is a long-standing
challenge. In this work, we address this challenge by integrating physical laws
as hard constraints within a flexible neural network. The resulting model,
HANNA, was trained end-to-end on an extensive experimental dataset for binary
mixtures from the Dortmund Data Bank, guaranteeing thermodynamically consistent
predictions. A novel surrogate solver developed in this work enabled the
inclusion of liquid-liquid equilibrium data in the training process.
Furthermore, a geometric projection method was applied to enable robust
extrapolations to multi-component mixtures, without requiring additional
parameters. We demonstrate that HANNA delivers excellent predictions, clearly
outperforming state-of-the-art benchmark methods in accuracy and scope. The
trained model and corresponding code are openly available, and an interactive
interface is provided on our website, MLPROP.

### [235] [On optimal solutions of classical and sliced Wasserstein GANs with non-Gaussian data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06505)
*Yu-Jui Huang,Hsin-Hua Shen,Yu-Chih Huang,Wan-Yi Lin,Shih-Chun Lin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Closed-form optimal WGAN parameters are derived for 1D with nonlinear activations and non-Gaussian data; extended to high dimensions via sliced Wasserstein with a joint-data constraint, showing a linear generator can be asymptotically optimal and competitive with r-PCA while saving resources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To characterize and efficiently select optimal WGAN parameters beyond the linear-Gaussian (LQG) setting and obtain computationally tractable solutions for non-Gaussian data.

Method: Derive closed-form optimal parameters for one-dimensional WGAN with nonlinear activations and non-Gaussian data. Extend to high dimensions through the sliced Wasserstein framework by enforcing a constraint on the joint distribution of the original data (unprojected). Demonstrate that a linear generator is asymptotically optimal under this setup.

Result: The closed-form WGAN parameters converge well for data under Gaussian and Laplace distributions. In the sliced-WGAN setting with non-Gaussian data, a linear generator can be asymptotically optimal. Compared to r-PCA, the proposed approach achieves similar performance at a lower computational cost.

Conclusion: Provides a theoretically grounded, scalable method for selecting WGAN parameters beyond LQG, including non-Gaussian data, with practical efficiency advantages over r-PCA.

Abstract: The generative adversarial network (GAN) aims to approximate an unknown
distribution via a parameterized neural network (NN). While GANs have been
widely applied in reinforcement and semisupervised learning as well as computer
vision tasks, selecting their parameters often needs an exhaustive search and
only a few selection methods can be proved to be theoretically optimal. One of
the most promising GAN variants is the Wasserstein GAN (WGAN). Prior work on
optimal parameters for WGAN is limited to the linear-quadratic-Gaussian (LQG)
setting, where the NN is linear and the data is Gaussian. In this paper, we
focus on the characterization of optimal WGAN parameters beyond the LQG
setting. We derive closed-form optimal parameters for one-dimensional WGANs
when the NN has non-linear activation functions and the data is non-Gaussian.
To extend this to high-dimensional WGANs, we adopt the sliced Wasserstein
framework and replace the constraint on marginal distributions of the randomly
projected data by a constraint on the joint distribution of the original
(unprojected) data. We show that the linear generator can be asymptotically
optimal for sliced WGAN with non-Gaussian data. Empirical studies show that our
closed-form WGAN parameters have good convergence behavior with data under both
Gaussian and Laplace distributions. Also, compared to the r principal component
analysis (r-PCA) solution, our proposed solution for sliced WGAN can achieve
the same performance while requiring less computational resources.

*Zongheng Guo,Tao Chen,Manuela Ferrario*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: QualityFM—a Transformer-based multimodal model for PPG/ECG signal quality; self-distillation, windowed sparse attention; pre-trained on 21M waveforms; transfers to ventricular tachycardia false-alarm detection, atrial fibrillation identification, and arterial blood pressure estimation from PPG and ECG.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In ICU/OR settings, poor, incomplete, and inconsistent signal quality leads to false alarms and diagnostic inaccuracies. Existing methods struggle with generalizability, require extensive labeled data, and show limited cross-task transferability.

Method: A dual-track Transformer-based model processes paired signals of differing quality via self-distillation: a high-quality encoder guides a low-quality encoder. It uses windowed sparse attention to handle long sequences and preserves frequency-domain characteristics through a composite loss that combines direct distillation loss on encoder outputs with an indirect reconstruction loss based on power and phase spectra. Pre-trained on a large-scale dataset (~21 million 30-second waveforms and ~179,757 hours) with three model sizes (9.6M to 319M parameters). Transfer learning evaluated on three clinical tasks: false alarm of ventricular tachycardia, atrial fibrillation identification, and arterial blood pressure estimation from PPG and ECG.

Result: The authors demonstrate efficacy and practical value by transferring the pre-trained models to three distinct clinical tasks, indicating improved generalizable understanding of signal quality and cross-task transfer potential across ICU/OR settings.

Conclusion: QualityFM provides a general-purpose understanding of PPG/ECG signal quality, enabling cross-task transfer and scalable deployment in clinical contexts. The approach addresses generalizability, data efficiency, and cross-task applicability challenges while supporting long-sequence reasoning through windowed attention.

Abstract: Photoplethysmogram (PPG) and electrocardiogram (ECG) are commonly recorded in
intesive care unit (ICU) and operating room (OR). However, the high incidence
of poor, incomplete, and inconsistent signal quality, can lead to false alarms
or diagnostic inaccuracies. The methods explored so far suffer from limited
generalizability, reliance on extensive labeled data, and poor cross-task
transferability. To overcome these challenges, we introduce QualityFM, a novel
multimodal foundation model for these physiological signals, designed to
acquire a general-purpose understanding of signal quality. Our model is
pre-trained on an large-scale dataset comprising over 21 million 30-second
waveforms and 179,757 hours of data. Our approach involves a dual-track
architecture that processes paired physiological signals of differing quality,
leveraging a self-distillation strategy where an encoder for high-quality
signals is used to guide the training of an encoder for low-quality signals. To
efficiently handle long sequential signals and capture essential local
quasi-periodic patterns, we integrate a windowed sparse attention mechanism
within our Transformer-based model. Furthermore, a composite loss function,
which combines direct distillation loss on encoder outputs with indirect
reconstruction loss based on power and phase spectra, ensures the preservation
of frequency-domain characteristics of the signals. We pre-train three models
with varying parameter counts (9.6 M to 319 M) and demonstrate their efficacy
and practical value through transfer learning on three distinct clinical tasks:
false alarm of ventricular tachycardia detection, the identification of atrial
fibrillation and the estimation of arterial blood pressure (ABP) from PPG and
ECG signals.

*Francesco De Cristofaro,Cornelia Lex,Jia Hu,Arno Eichberger*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A transformer for lane-change intention prediction generalizes poorly when trained on a single dataset from one population, but performs well when trained on combined datasets from two populations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To ensure reliable lane-change intention prediction across diverse driving populations and avoid dataset bias that overfits models to a single population.

Method: Evaluate a lane-change intention prediction transformer on two LevelX datasets (Germany and Hong Kong). Test cross-population generalization by training on one population and testing on another, then train on both populations jointly and evaluate performance.

Result: Cross-population testing with single-population training yielded accuracies as low as 39.43%. Joint training on both populations achieved up to 86.71% accuracy.

Conclusion: Cross-population generalization matters; incorporating diverse datasets improves performance and robustness, highlighting the need for multi-domain validation and possibly domain adaptation.

Abstract: As a result of the growing importance of lane change intention prediction for
a safe and efficient driving experience in complex driving scenarios,
researchers have in recent years started to train novel machine learning
algorithms on available datasets with promising results. A shortcoming of this
recent research effort, though, is that the vast majority of the proposed
algorithms are trained on a single datasets. In doing so, researchers failed to
test if their algorithm would be as effective if tested on a different dataset
and, by extension, on a different population with respect to the one on which
they were trained. In this article we test a transformer designed for lane
change intention prediction on two datasets collected by LevelX in Germany and
Hong Kong. We found that the transformer's accuracy plummeted when tested on a
population different to the one it was trained on with accuracy values as low
as 39.43%, but that when trained on both populations simultaneously it could
achieve an accuracy as high as 86.71%. - This work has been submitted to the

*Duc Huy Le,Rolf Stadler*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: BF-PPO with particle filtering learns an optimal defender strategy for CAGE-2 modeled as a POMDP, outperforming CARDIFF in strategy quality and training time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address CAGE-2's large, partially observable state space by providing a formal POMDP model and an efficient learning method, enabling robust defender policies.

Method: Formulate CAGE-2 inside POMDP; define optimal defender strategy; introduce BF-PPO, a PPO-based learner that uses a particle filter to approximate belief states and reduce computation; evaluate in CybORG environment; compare to CARDIFF.

Result: BF-PPO achieves superior defender strategy quality and requires less training time than CARDIFF on CAGE-2 benchmark in CybORG.

Conclusion: Formalizing CAGE-2 as a POMDP and applying particle-filtered PPO yields efficient, high-quality defender policies, with BF-PPO offering practical advantages over the current leading method CARDIFF.

Abstract: CAGE-2 is an accepted benchmark for learning and evaluating defender
strategies against cyberattacks. It reflects a scenario where a defender agent
protects an IT infrastructure against various attacks. Many defender methods
for CAGE-2 have been proposed in the literature. In this paper, we construct a
formal model for CAGE-2 using the framework of Partially Observable Markov
Decision Process (POMDP). Based on this model, we define an optimal defender
strategy for CAGE-2 and introduce a method to efficiently learn this strategy.
Our method, called BF-PPO, is based on PPO, and it uses particle filter to
mitigate the computational complexity due to the large state space of the
CAGE-2 model. We evaluate our method in the CAGE-2 CybORG environment and
compare its performance with that of CARDIFF, the highest ranked method on the
CAGE-2 leaderboard. We find that our method outperforms CARDIFF regarding the
learned defender strategy and the required training time.

### [239] [Predicting Fetal Outcomes from Cardiotocography Signals Using a Supervised Variational Autoencoder](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06540)
*John Tolladay,Beth Albert,Gabriel Davis Jones*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Supervised variational autoencoders (VAEs) on OxMat CTG data can predict pregnancy outcomes from short fetal heart rate (FHR) segments with competitive AUROC, while partially encoding clinically meaningful CTG features; full interpretability remains challenging due to multi-timescale, irregular FHR signals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address interpretability gaps in deep learning for CTG-based outcome prediction and to develop latent representations that align with clinically relevant features.

Method: Train a supervised VAE on five-minute FHR segments labeled by postnatal outcomes using the OxMat CTG dataset. The model optimizes signal reconstruction and outcome prediction, incorporating Kullback-Leibler divergence and total correlation constraints to structure the latent space. Evaluation used AUROC and MSE; interpretability assessed via coefficient of determination, latent traversals, and unsupervised component analyses.

Result: AUROC 0.752 at segment level and 0.779 at CTG level (aggregated predictions). Relaxing TC constraints improved reconstruction and classification. Baseline-related features (e.g., FHR baseline, baseline shift) were well represented and aligned with model scores; variability features were less well encoded. Latent traversals showed clear changes for baseline features, while other properties were entangled or subtle. Unsupervised decompositions corroborated these patterns.

Conclusion: Supervised VAEs can achieve competitive fetal outcome prediction and partially encode clinically meaningful CTG features, but full interpretability was not achieved. The irregular, multi-timescale nature of FHR signals complicates disentangling physiological components, indicating room for more interpretable, generative models in this domain.

Abstract: Objective: To develop and interpret a supervised variational autoencoder
(VAE) model for classifying cardiotocography (CTG) signals based on pregnancy
outcomes, addressing interpretability limits of current deep learning
approaches. Methods: The OxMat CTG dataset was used to train a VAE on
five-minute fetal heart rate (FHR) segments, labeled with postnatal outcomes.
The model was optimised for signal reconstruction and outcome prediction,
incorporating Kullback-Leibler divergence and total correlation (TC)
constraints to structure the latent space. Performance was evaluated using area
under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) and mean squared
error (MSE). Interpretability was assessed using coefficient of determination,
latent traversals and unsupervised component analyses. Results: The model
achieved an AUROC of 0.752 at the segment level and 0.779 at the CTG level,
where predicted scores were aggregated. Relaxing TC constraints improved both
reconstruction and classification. Latent analysis showed that baseline-related
features (e.g., FHR baseline, baseline shift) were well represented and aligned
with model scores, while metrics like short- and long-term variability were
less strongly encoded. Traversals revealed clear signal changes for baseline
features, while other properties were entangled or subtle. Unsupervised
decompositions corroborated these patterns. Findings: This work demonstrates
that supervised VAEs can achieve competitive fetal outcome prediction while
partially encoding clinically meaningful CTG features. The irregular,
multi-timescale nature of FHR signals poses challenges for disentangling
physiological components, distinguishing CTG from more periodic signals such as
ECG. Although full interpretability was not achieved, the model supports
clinically useful outcome prediction and provides a basis for future
interpretable, generative models.

### [240] [Contrastive Self-Supervised Network Intrusion Detection using Augmented Negative Pairs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06550)
*Jack Wilkie,Hanan Hindy,Christos Tachtatzis,Robert Atkinson*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: We present CLAN (Contrastive Learning using Augmented Negative pairs) for network intrusion detection. It uses augmented samples as negative views representing potentially malicious distributions, while benign samples serve as positive views. Pretrained on benign traffic, it achieves state-of-the-art results in binary intrusion detection and excels in multi-class classification when fine-tuned with limited labeled data on Lycos2017.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Supervised ML for intrusion detection requires large labeled datasets and struggles with imbalance and labeling costs. Anomaly detectors trained only on benign traffic suffer from high false positives. Self-supervised learning on benign data promises robust representations and lower FPRs, but existing contrastive setups use other samples as negatives and benign views as positives, potentially not capturing malicious-like distributions. CLAN reframes contrastive learning by treating augmented (potentially malicious) views as negatives to better separate benign and malicious behavior.

Method: Introduce CLAN, a contrastive self-supervised framework where augmented samples are treated as negative views, while other benign samples serve as positive views. Pretrain on benign traffic to learn latent representations that separate benign vs. augmented (malicious-like) distributions. After pretraining, fine-tune on limited labeled data. Evaluation on the Lycos2017 dataset for binary classification, with additional multi-class evaluation under label scarcity.

Result: CLAN surpasses existing self-supervised and anomaly detection approaches in binary intrusion detection on Lycos2017. When fine-tuned with limited labeled data, it achieves superior multi-class classification performance compared to existing self-supervised models.

Conclusion: Augmented negative pairs in contrastive learning are effective for network intrusion detection, enabling improved accuracy and efficiency. CLAN demonstrates strong performance in both binary detection and low-label multi-class scenarios, highlighting the viability of using augmented negatives to capture potentially malicious distributions.

Abstract: Network intrusion detection remains a critical challenge in cybersecurity.
While supervised machine learning models achieve state-of-the-art performance,
their reliance on large labelled datasets makes them impractical for many
real-world applications. Anomaly detection methods, which train exclusively on
benign traffic to identify malicious activity, suffer from high false positive
rates, limiting their usability. Recently, self-supervised learning techniques
have demonstrated improved performance with lower false positive rates by
learning discriminative latent representations of benign traffic. In
particular, contrastive self-supervised models achieve this by minimizing the
distance between similar (positive) views of benign traffic while maximizing it
between dissimilar (negative) views. Existing approaches generate positive
views through data augmentation and treat other samples as negative. In
contrast, this work introduces Contrastive Learning using Augmented Negative
pairs (CLAN), a novel paradigm for network intrusion detection where augmented
samples are treated as negative views - representing potentially malicious
distributions - while other benign samples serve as positive views. This
approach enhances both classification accuracy and inference efficiency after
pretraining on benign traffic. Experimental evaluation on the Lycos2017 dataset
demonstrates that the proposed method surpasses existing self-supervised and
anomaly detection techniques in a binary classification task. Furthermore, when
fine-tuned on a limited labelled dataset, the proposed approach achieves
superior multi-class classification performance compared to existing
self-supervised models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address on-device data distribution shifts that hurt generalization of lightweight models, avoiding heavy data-/compute-intensive fine-tuning and post-deployment retraining.

Method: Introduce Persona, which uses a neural adapter in the cloud to produce a parameter editing matrix based on real-time device data. This matrix updates on-device models without backpropagation, clustering them into prototypes. Prototypes are refined by the editing matrix; cross-layer knowledge transfer enforces consistent multi-layer changes and prototype assignments, enabling efficient evolution.

Result: Extensive experiments on vision and recommendation tasks across multiple datasets show Persona’s effectiveness and generality under distribution shifts, validating its approach for efficient on-device adaptation.

Conclusion: Persona offers a practical, generalizable, backpropagation-free adaptation framework for on-device models, enabling real-time personalization and efficient evolution via cloud-generated parameter editing matrices and cross-layer knowledge transfer, without post-deployment retraining.

Abstract: The on-device real-time data distribution shift on devices challenges the
generalization of lightweight on-device models. This critical issue is often
overlooked in current research, which predominantly relies on data-intensive
and computationally expensive fine-tuning approaches. To tackle this, we
introduce Persona, a novel personalized method using a prototype-based,
backpropagation-free parameter editing framework to enhance model
generalization without post-deployment retraining. Persona employs a neural
adapter in the cloud to generate a parameter editing matrix based on real-time
device data. This matrix adeptly adapts on-device models to the prevailing data
distributions, efficiently clustering them into prototype models. The
prototypes are dynamically refined via the parameter editing matrix,
facilitating efficient evolution. Furthermore, the integration of cross-layer
knowledge transfer ensures consistent and context-aware multi-layer parameter
changes and prototype assignment. Extensive experiments on vision task and
recommendation task on multiple datasets confirm Persona's effectiveness and
generality.

### [242] [AI for Scientific Discovery is a Social Problem](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06580)
*Georgia Channing,Avijit Ghosh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AI for science is hampered more by social/institutional barriers than by data or compute, with four interconnected challenges (community dysfunction, misaligned research priorities, data fragmentation, and infrastructure inequities) rooted in culture and organization; solving them requires intentional community-building, cross-disciplinary education, shared benchmarks, and accessible infrastructure, framing AI for science as a collective social project for sustainable progress.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Explain why AI-driven scientific acceleration benefits are uneven and argue that social and institutional reform is essential, not just technical innovation.

Method: Conceptual analysis and synthesis of existing observations and perspectives; proposes a framework and actionable directions, rather than reporting new empirical results.

Result: Identification of four interconnected challenges and their cultural/organizational roots; emphasis on community-building, re-aligned incentives, data/infrastructure sharing, and cross-disciplinary education; calls for reframing AI-for-science as a collaborative social project with equitable participation.

Conclusion: Addressing social and institutional factors is a prerequisite for real technical progress in AI for science; sustainable collaboration and equitable participation are essential.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence promises to accelerate scientific discovery, yet its
benefits remain unevenly distributed. While technical obstacles such as scarce
data, fragmented standards, and unequal access to computation are significant,
we argue that the primary barriers are social and institutional. Narratives
that defer progress to speculative "AI scientists," the undervaluing of data
and infrastructure contributions, misaligned incentives, and gaps between
domain experts and machine learning researchers all constrain impact. We
highlight four interconnected challenges: community dysfunction, research
priorities misaligned with upstream needs, data fragmentation, and
infrastructure inequities. We argue that their roots lie in cultural and
organizational practices. Addressing them requires not only technical
innovation but also intentional community-building, cross-disciplinary
education, shared benchmarks, and accessible infrastructure. We call for
reframing AI for science as a collective social project, where sustainable
collaboration and equitable participation are treated as prerequisites for
technical progress.

### [243] [Information-Theoretic Bounds and Task-Centric Learning Complexity for Real-World Dynamic Nonlinear Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06599)
*Sri Satish Krishna Chaitanya Bulusu,Mikko Sillanpää*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A theoretical framework for modeling dynamic nonlinear systems via structured decomposition, variance analysis, and task-aware complexity bounds; introduces a Behavioral Uncertainty Principle and a memory-thermodynamics link; explains and justifies structured residual learning benefits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address data-driven modeling challenges from intertwined static and dynamic distortions in complex systems, offering principled bounds, learnability measures, and a thermodynamic grounding beyond classical entropy-based bounds.

Method: Develop a directional interaction bound that extends inner-product orthogonality to structurally asymmetric settings; derive variance inequalities; define a memory finiteness index; establish a power-based first-law link; formulate the Behavioral Uncertainty Principle; prove two theorems connecting variance to mean-squared Lipschitz continuity and to learning complexity; propose a model-agnostic, task-aware complexity metric.

Result: Establishes bounds and principles showing static/dynamic distortions cannot be minimized simultaneously; shows real systems resist complete deterministic decomposition; provides theorems tying variance to Lipschitz continuity and learning complexity; explains empirical benefits of structured residual learning and aligns with power amplifier experiments; framework is broadly applicable and scalable.

Conclusion: Offers a scalable, theoretically grounded framework for modeling complex dynamic nonlinear systems, clarifying why structured residual learning improves generalization, reduces parameters, and lowers training cost, with broad applicability across domains.

Abstract: Dynamic nonlinear systems exhibit distortions arising from coupled static and
dynamic effects. Their intertwined nature poses major challenges for
data-driven modeling. This paper presents a theoretical framework grounded in
structured decomposition, variance analysis, and task-centric complexity
bounds.
  The framework employs a directional lower bound on interactions between
measurable system components, extending orthogonality in inner product spaces
to structurally asymmetric settings. This bound supports variance inequalities
for decomposed systems. Key behavioral indicators are introduced along with a
memory finiteness index. A rigorous power-based condition establishes a
measurable link between finite memory in realizable systems and the First Law
of Thermodynamics. This offers a more foundational perspective than classical
bounds based on the Second Law.
  Building on this foundation, we formulate a `Behavioral Uncertainty
Principle,' demonstrating that static and dynamic distortions cannot be
minimized simultaneously. We identify that real-world systems seem to resist
complete deterministic decomposition due to entangled static and dynamic
effects. We also present two general-purpose theorems linking function variance
to mean-squared Lipschitz continuity and learning complexity. This yields a
model-agnostic, task-aware complexity metric, showing that lower-variance
components are inherently easier to learn.
  These insights explain the empirical benefits of structured residual
learning, including improved generalization, reduced parameter count, and lower
training cost, as previously observed in power amplifier linearization
experiments. The framework is broadly applicable and offers a scalable,
theoretically grounded approach to modeling complex dynamic nonlinear systems.

### [244] [PAC-Bayesian Generalization Bounds for Graph Convolutional Networks on Inductive Node Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06600)
*Huayi Tang,Yong Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A PAC-Bayesian analysis derives generalization bounds for inductive node classification with GCNs on dynamic graphs, showing one-layer GCNs can achieve vanishing generalization gap under mild conditions, while two-layer GCNs require stronger graph-topology assumptions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world graphs evolve over time with new nodes and changing edges, making inductive, non-iid, and non-stationary analysis essential; transductive theories fail to capture this temporal dynamics.

Method: Develop a PAC-Bayesian framework for GCNs treating nodes as dependent, non-identically distributed samples. Derive generalization bounds for a one-layer GCN incorporating data dependency and non-stationarity; analyze convergence of the generalization gap as the number of nodes grows; extend the analysis to a two-layer GCN and identify stronger graph-topology requirements.

Result: New generalization bounds that explicitly account for node dependence and non-stationarity in dynamic graphs; conditions under which the generalization gap vanishes with increasing node count for one-layer GCNs; deeper networks require stricter topological assumptions for similar convergence.

Conclusion: Provides a theoretical foundation for understanding and improving GNN generalization in dynamic environments and highlights the role of graph topology in deeper GCNs for ensuring convergence.

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable success in processing
graph-structured data across various applications. A critical aspect of
real-world graphs is their dynamic nature, where new nodes are continually
added and existing connections may change over time. Previous theoretical
studies, largely based on the transductive learning framework, fail to
adequately model such temporal evolution and structural dynamics. In this
paper, we presents a PAC-Bayesian theoretical analysis of graph convolutional
networks (GCNs) for inductive node classification, treating nodes as dependent
and non-identically distributed data points. We derive novel generalization
bounds for one-layer GCNs that explicitly incorporate the effects of data
dependency and non-stationarity, and establish sufficient conditions under
which the generalization gap converges to zero as the number of nodes
increases. Furthermore, we extend our analysis to two-layer GCNs, and reveal
that it requires stronger assumptions on graph topology to guarantee
convergence. This work establishes a theoretical foundation for understanding
and improving GNN generalization in dynamic graph environments.

### [245] [Demo: Healthcare Agent Orchestrator (HAO) for Patient Summarization in Molecular Tumor Boards](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06602)
*Noel Codella,Sam Preston,Hao Qiu,Leonardo Schettini,Wen-wai Yim,Mert Öz,Shrey Jain,Matthew P. Lungren,Thomas Osborne*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces Healthcare Agent Orchestrator (HAO), an LLM-driven multi-agent system to generate comprehensive MTB patient summaries, and TBFact, a model-as-judge framework for evaluation; demonstrates high information capture and data-free assessment for MTB summaries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual MTB patient summaries are labor-intensive, subjective, and prone to omissions; robust, scalable evaluation of generated summaries is needed.

Method: Develop HAO to coordinate multiple AI agents to create accurate patient histories; develop TBFact to assess summaries' comprehensiveness and succinctness; benchmark on de-identified tumor board discussions; evaluate Patient History agent; demonstrate data-free evaluation.

Result: HAO captured 94% of high-importance information (including partial entailments); TBFact recall 0.84 under strict entailment; TBFact enables local, data-free evaluation.

Conclusion: HAO and TBFact provide a robust foundation for reliable, scalable MTB support with privacy-preserving evaluation, enabling broader deployment.

Abstract: Molecular Tumor Boards (MTBs) are multidisciplinary forums where oncology
specialists collaboratively assess complex patient cases to determine optimal
treatment strategies. A central element of this process is the patient summary,
typically compiled by a medical oncologist, radiation oncologist, or surgeon,
or their trained medical assistant, who distills heterogeneous medical records
into a concise narrative to facilitate discussion. This manual approach is
often labor-intensive, subjective, and prone to omissions of critical
information. To address these limitations, we introduce the Healthcare Agent
Orchestrator (HAO), a Large Language Model (LLM)-driven AI agent that
coordinates a multi-agent clinical workflow to generate accurate and
comprehensive patient summaries for MTBs. Evaluating predicted patient
summaries against ground truth presents additional challenges due to stylistic
variation, ordering, synonym usage, and phrasing differences, which complicate
the measurement of both succinctness and completeness. To overcome these
evaluation hurdles, we propose TBFact, a ``model-as-a-judge'' framework
designed to assess the comprehensiveness and succinctness of generated
summaries. Using a benchmark dataset derived from de-identified tumor board
discussions, we applied TBFact to evaluate our Patient History agent. Results
show that the agent captured 94% of high-importance information (including
partial entailments) and achieved a TBFact recall of 0.84 under strict
entailment criteria. We further demonstrate that TBFact enables a data-free
evaluation framework that institutions can deploy locally without sharing
sensitive clinical data. Together, HAO and TBFact establish a robust foundation
for delivering reliable and scalable support to MTBs.

*Viacheslav Sinii,Nikita Balagansky,Yaroslav Aksenov,Vadim Kurochkin,Daniil Laptev,Gleb Gerasimov,Alexey Gorbatovski,Boris Shaposhnikov,Daniil Gavrilov*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Reasoning training reshapes LM computations via lightweight steering vectors that provide additive, interpretable changes: last-layer vectors bias the first token as a substitution signal; penultimate-layer vectors alter processing via the MLP/unembedding without big attention changes, enabling near full-finetuning performance with simple interventions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how reasoning training alters language-model computations and to develop an interpretable, additive intervention framework that can match full fine-tuning performance.

Method: Insert small steering vectors into the base model's residual stream and train them with a reinforcement-learning objective. Analyze two models using logit-lens readouts, path patching, and circuit analyses.

Result: Last-layer steering behaves like a token-substitution bias focused on the first generated token, boosting tokens like ”To” and ”Step.” Penultimate-layer steering leaves attention patterns largely unchanged and acts through the MLP and unembedding, preferentially up-weighting process words and structure symbols.

Conclusion: Provides a principled framework for interpreting the behavioral changes induced by reasoning training and demonstrates that small, additive steering can reproduce strong performance while preserving interpretability.

Abstract: The mechanisms by which reasoning training reshapes language-model
computations remain poorly understood. We study lightweight steering vectors
inserted into the base model's residual stream and trained with a
reinforcement-learning objective, which can match full fine-tuning performance
while retaining the interpretability of small, additive interventions. Using
logit-lens readouts, path patching, and circuit analyses, we analyze two models
and find: (i) the last-layer steering vector behaves like a token-substitution
bias concentrated on the first generated token, consistently boosting tokens
such as "To" and "Step"; and (ii) the penultimate-layer steering vector leaves
attention patterns largely unchanged and instead acts through the MLP and
unembedding, preferentially up-weighting process words and structure symbols.
These results establish a principled framework for interpreting the behavioral
changes induced by reasoning training.

### [247] [A Survey of Generalization of Graph Anomaly Detection: From Transfer Learning to Foundation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06609)
*Junjun Pan,Yu Zheng,Yue Tan,Yixin Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper surveys generalization in Graph Anomaly Detection (GAD): tracing evolution, formalizing problem settings, proposing a taxonomy, surveying generalized methods across tasks, and outlining open challenges and future directions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GAD models often assume stationary distributions and ample labeled data; real-world shifts and data scarcity hinder performance; thus there is a need to understand and improve generalization through transfer learning and foundation models.

Method: Systematic literature review: historical overview of generalization in GAD, formal definitions, development of a taxonomy, and an up-to-date survey of methods organized by taxonomy; identification of gaps and future directions.

Result: A structured taxonomy and comprehensive survey of existing generalized GAD approaches; synthesis of current progress; mapping of methods to generalization scenarios; a roadmap of challenges and opportunities.

Conclusion: Generalization in GAD remains under-explored; calls for standardized benchmarks, better transfer learning frameworks, robust foundation models, and more cross-domain evaluation; encourages future research directions.

Abstract: Graph anomaly detection (GAD) has attracted increasing attention in recent
years for identifying malicious samples in a wide range of graph-based
applications, such as social media and e-commerce. However, most GAD methods
assume identical training and testing distributions and are tailored to
specific tasks, resulting in limited adaptability to real-world scenarios such
as shifting data distributions and scarce training samples in new applications.
To address the limitations, recent work has focused on improving the
generalization capability of GAD models through transfer learning that
leverages knowledge from related domains to enhance detection performance, or
developing "one-for-all" GAD foundation models that generalize across multiple
applications. Since a systematic understanding of generalization in GAD is
still lacking, in this paper, we provide a comprehensive review of
generalization in GAD. We first trace the evolution of generalization in GAD
and formalize the problem settings, which further leads to our systematic
taxonomy. Rooted in this fine-grained taxonomy, an up-to-date and comprehensive
review is conducted for the existing generalized GAD methods. Finally, we
identify current open challenges and suggest future directions to inspire
future research in this emerging field.

### [248] [BEAM: Brainwave Empathy Assessment Model for Early Childhood](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06620)
*Chen Xie,Gaofeng Wu,Kaidong Wang,Zihao Zhu,Xiaoshu Luo,Yan Liang,Feiyu Quan,Ruoxi Wu,Xianghui Huang,Han Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A deep-learning framework BEAM uses multi-view EEG to predict empathy in 4-6 year olds, combining LaBraM-based spatio-temporal encoding, fusion, and contrastive learning; tested on CBCP and outperforms baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Empathy prediction in young children is important but difficult; biases in self/observer reports; EEG offers objective measures; existing methods miss temporal dynamics; need a method to capture dynamics.

Method: BEAM architecture with LaBraM-based encoder for spatio-temporal EEG features; a fusion module to combine multi-view signals; a contrastive learning module to improve class separation; evaluated on CBCP dataset.

Result: BEAM outperforms state-of-the-art across multiple metrics on CBCP data; demonstrates objective empathy assessment and potential early interventions.

Conclusion: BEAM provides objective empathy assessment in early childhood, enabling insights into pro-social development and informing interventions.

Abstract: Empathy in young children is crucial for their social and emotional
development, yet predicting it remains challenging. Traditional methods often
only rely on self-reports or observer-based labeling, which are susceptible to
bias and fail to objectively capture the process of empathy formation. EEG
offers an objective alternative; however, current approaches primarily extract
static patterns, neglecting temporal dynamics. To overcome these limitations,
we propose a novel deep learning framework, the Brainwave Empathy Assessment
Model (BEAM), to predict empathy levels in children aged 4-6 years. BEAM
leverages multi-view EEG signals to capture both cognitive and emotional
dimensions of empathy. The framework comprises three key components: 1) a
LaBraM-based encoder for effective spatio-temporal feature extraction, 2) a
feature fusion module to integrate complementary information from multi-view
signals, and 3) a contrastive learning module to enhance class separation.
Validated on the CBCP dataset, BEAM outperforms state-of-the-art methods across
multiple metrics, demonstrating its potential for objective empathy assessment
and providing a preliminary insight into early interventions in children's
prosocial development.

### [249] [Knowledge-Guided Machine Learning for Stabilizing Near-Shortest Path Routing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06640)
*Yung-Fu Chen,Sen Lin,Anish Arora*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A sample-efficient, domain-informed learning framework to derive local routing policies on geometric graphs; it yields exact greedy forwarding and a superior Greedy Tensile routing, with interpretable, ultra-fast DNN-based decisions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address all-pairs near-shortest path routing on geometric graphs with scalable, local decision policies learned from few samples, while ensuring generalization across a rich class of Euclidean networks.

Method: Train deep neural networks that use only local node states and neighbor states as inputs. Leverage domain knowledge to select features and policy structure, including a seed graph with sampled node data to enable generalization. Compare two policies: (1) distance-to-destination only, which recovers Greedy Forwarding, and (2) distance-to-destination plus node stretch, yielding Greedy Tensile routing. Explainability is pursued by symbolically interpreting the trained DNN as simple linear actions.

Result: The network learns Greedy Forwarding exactly when using distance-to-destination. Greedy Tensile routing outperforms Greedy Forwarding in most cases. The approach offers explainability and ultra-low-latency runtime, demonstrated by a symbolic, low-complexity interpretation of the DNN.

Conclusion: A simple, sample-efficient learning paradigm with domain-informed features and seed-based generalization can produce local routing policies that perform near-optimally across geometric random graphs, with interpretable models and scalable, fast routing.

Abstract: We propose a simple algorithm that needs only a few data samples from a
single graph for learning local routing policies that generalize across a rich
class of geometric random graphs in Euclidean metric spaces. We thus solve the
all-pairs near-shortest path problem by training deep neural networks (DNNs)
that let each graph node efficiently and scalably route (i.e., forward) packets
by considering only the node's state and the state of the neighboring nodes.
Our algorithm design exploits network domain knowledge in the selection of
input features and design of the policy function for learning an approximately
optimal policy. Domain knowledge also provides theoretical assurance that the
choice of a ``seed graph'' and its node data sampling suffices for
generalizable learning. Remarkably, one of these DNNs we train -- using
distance-to-destination as the only input feature -- learns a policy that
exactly matches the well-known Greedy Forwarding policy, which forwards packets
to the neighbor with the shortest distance to the destination. We also learn a
new policy, which we call GreedyTensile routing -- using both
distance-to-destination and node stretch as the input features -- that almost
always outperforms greedy forwarding. We demonstrate the explainability and
ultra-low latency run-time operation of Greedy Tensile routing by symbolically
interpreting its DNN in low-complexity terms of two linear actions.

*Yuanyuan Wu,Zhenlin Qin,Leizhen Wang,Xiaolei Ma,Zhenliang Ma*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: gcGAIL uses group-effect enhanced imitation learning to model individual travel behavior more efficiently, achieving higher accuracy and robustness than AIRL, GAIL, and conditional GAIL in a public transport fare-discount case study.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Data-intensive MDP modeling of individual travel behavior faces limitations in data quantity, spatial-temporal coverage, and situational diversity; leveraging shared patterns among passenger groups can improve learning efficiency and generalization.

Method: Introduce gcGAIL, a group-effect enhanced generative adversarial imitation learning framework. It leverages shared behavioral patterns across passenger groups to imitate incentives responses, reduces data requirements, and is validated against AIRL, baseline GAIL, and conditional GAIL using a fare-discount case study. Demonstrates robustness to sparsity and spatial variation with partial expert demonstrations.

Result: gcGAIL outperforms baseline methods in learning individual travel behavior responses to incentives—achieving higher accuracy, better generalization, and more efficient demonstration usage. It remains robust to spatial variation, data sparsity, and behavioral diversity, including underrepresented groups, and can predict responses at any time.

Conclusion: gcGAIL enables accurate, generalizable, and efficient modeling of individual travel behavior in response to incentives, facilitating personalized incentive timing to promote sustainable behavior changes.

Abstract: Understanding and modeling individual travel behavior responses is crucial
for urban mobility regulation and policy evaluation. The Markov decision
process (MDP) provides a structured framework for dynamic travel behavior
modeling at the individual level. However, solving an MDP in this context is
highly data-intensive and faces challenges of data quantity, spatial-temporal
coverage, and situational diversity. To address these, we propose a
group-effect-enhanced generative adversarial imitation learning (gcGAIL) model
that improves the individual behavior modeling efficiency by leveraging shared
behavioral patterns among passenger groups. We validate the gcGAIL model using
a public transport fare-discount case study and compare against
state-of-the-art benchmarks, including adversarial inverse reinforcement
learning (AIRL), baseline GAIL, and conditional GAIL. Experimental results
demonstrate that gcGAIL outperforms these methods in learning individual travel
behavior responses to incentives over time in terms of accuracy,
generalization, and pattern demonstration efficiency. Notably, gcGAIL is robust
to spatial variation, data sparsity, and behavioral diversity, maintaining
strong performance even with partial expert demonstrations and underrepresented
passenger groups. The gcGAIL model predicts the individual behavior response at
any time, providing the basis for personalized incentives to induce sustainable
behavior changes (better timing of incentive injections).

### [251] [TrajAware: Graph Cross-Attention and Trajectory-Aware for Generalisable VANETs under Partial Observations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06665)
*Xiaolu Fu,Ziyuan Bao,Eiman Kanjo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TrajAware is an edge-friendly RL framework for VANET routing that combines action-space pruning, graph cross-attention, and trajectory-aware prediction to handle dynamic topologies and partial observations, achieving near-shortest paths, high delivery ratios, and efficiency on constrained devices, outperforming baselines in full and partial observation settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VANET routing with RL often assumes fixed graph structures and retraining needs, which is impractical for constrained edge devices and dynamic networks. There is a need for generalizable, resource-efficient RL approaches that can operate under partial observations.

Method: (i) action space pruning to cut redundant neighbor options while preserving two-hop reachability; (ii) graph cross-attention to map pruned neighbors into global graph context, producing size-generalizable features; (iii) trajectory-aware prediction to estimate real-time positions from historical routes and junction info under partial observations. Evaluation uses SUMO with leave-one-city-out in real-city maps.

Result: Empirical results show TrajAware achieves near-shortest paths and high delivery ratios while maintaining efficiency suitable for constrained edge devices, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines in both full and partial observation scenarios.

Conclusion: TrajAware offers a robust, scalable, edge-deployable RL framework for VANET routing that generalizes across network sizes and observation conditions, enabling effective routing in dynamic urban environments without frequent retraining.

Abstract: Vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) are a crucial component of intelligent
transportation systems; however, routing remains challenging due to dynamic
topologies, incomplete observations, and the limited resources of edge devices.
Existing reinforcement learning (RL) approaches often assume fixed graph
structures and require retraining when network conditions change, making them
unsuitable for deployment on constrained hardware. We present TrajAware, an
RL-based framework designed for edge AI deployment in VANETs. TrajAware
integrates three components: (i) action space pruning, which reduces redundant
neighbour options while preserving two-hop reachability, alleviating the curse
of dimensionality; (ii) graph cross-attention, which maps pruned neighbours to
the global graph context, producing features that generalise across diverse
network sizes; and (iii) trajectory-aware prediction, which uses historical
routes and junction information to estimate real-time positions under partial
observations. We evaluate TrajAware in the open-source SUMO simulator using
real-world city maps with a leave-one-city-out setup. Results show that
TrajAware achieves near-shortest paths and high delivery ratios while
maintaining efficiency suitable for constrained edge devices, outperforming
state-of-the-art baselines in both full and partial observation scenarios.

### [252] [Barycentric Neural Networks and Length-Weighted Persistent Entropy Loss: A Green Geometric and Topological Framework for Function Approximation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06694)
*Victor Toscano-Duran,Rocio Gonzalez-Diaz,Miguel A. Gutiérrez-Naranjo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A small shallow model called the Barycentric Neural Network (BNN) uses fixed base points and barycentric coordinates to exactly represent continuous piecewise linear functions, enabling efficient function approximation. It introduces a new topological loss, length-weighted persistent entropy (LWPE), and optimizes base points (not internal weights) for learning, achieving faster and better performance under resource constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the computational cost and inefficiency of deep/overparameterized networks while retaining universal approximation capabilities by using a compact, interpretable, geometry-informed model and a topology-aware loss.

Method: Define a BN N with fixed base points and barycentric coordinates to represent CPLFs exactly; leverage the fact that continuous functions on compact domains can be approximated by CPLFs. Introduce LWPE, a stable, scale-invariant variant of persistent entropy weighted by feature lifetimes, and use it as a loss. Optimize the base points directly rather than internal weights, combining BN N with LWPE loss.

Result: Empirical results show superior and faster approximation performance compared to standard losses (MSE, RMSE, MAE, log-cosh) under resource-constrained settings.

Conclusion: BNN, together with LWPE, offers a flexible, geometrically interpretable approach to function approximation that is particularly suitable for resource-limited scenarios (few base points, few training epochs) and provides a bridge between neural and topological methods.

Abstract: While it is well-established that artificial neural networks are
\emph{universal approximators} for continuous functions on compact domains,
many modern approaches rely on deep or overparameterized architectures that
incur high computational costs. In this paper, a new type of \emph{small
shallow} neural network, called the \emph{Barycentric Neural Network} ($\BNN$),
is proposed, which leverages a fixed set of \emph{base points} and their
\emph{barycentric coordinates} to define both its structure and its parameters.
We demonstrate that our $\BNN$ enables the exact representation of
\emph{continuous piecewise linear functions} ($\CPLF$s), ensuring strict
continuity across segments. Since any continuous function over a compact domain
can be approximated arbitrarily well by $\CPLF$s, the $\BNN$ naturally emerges
as a flexible and interpretable tool for \emph{function approximation}. Beyond
the use of this representation, the main contribution of the paper is the
introduction of a new variant of \emph{persistent entropy}, a topological
feature that is stable and scale invariant, called the \emph{length-weighted
persistent entropy} ($\LWPE$), which is weighted by the lifetime of topological
features. Our framework, which combines the $\BNN$ with a loss function based
on our $\LWPE$, aims to provide flexible and geometrically interpretable
approximations of nonlinear continuous functions in resource-constrained
settings, such as those with limited base points for $\BNN$ design and few
training epochs. Instead of optimizing internal weights, our approach directly
\emph{optimizes the base points that define the $\BNN$}. Experimental results
show that our approach achieves \emph{superior and faster approximation
performance} compared to classical loss functions such as MSE, RMSE, MAE, and
log-cosh.

### [253] [Probabilistic Modeling of Latent Agentic Substructures in Deep Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06701)
*Su Hyeong Lee,Risi Kondor,Richard Ngo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A probabilistic theory of intelligent agency for neural models, where agents are outcome distributions with log-score utility, composed via weighted logarithmic pooling. It proves bounds on unanimous agreement under pooling, develops a recursive, clone-invariant framework, and applies it to LLM alignment, showing benevolent prompts can induce antagonistic countermodels and that certain strategies yield larger misalignment reductions than pure reinforcement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a principled mathematical framework for how subagents can cohere into higher-level intelligent entities, formalize aggregation via probabilistic pooling, and explore how these dynamics affect alignment in AI systems, including LLMs.

Method: Represent agents as outcome distributions with epistemic utility given by log score. Use weighted logarithmic pooling to compose agents, proving properties like strict unanimity behavior: impossible under linear pooling or binary outcomes, possible with three or more outcomes. Establish recursive structure through cloning invariance, continuity, and openness, and apply tilt-based analysis to avoid trivial duplication. Demonstrate agentic alignment phenomena in LLMs by eliciting a benevolent persona (Luigi) and observing an antagonistic counterpart (Waluigi), comparing strategies such as manifest-then-suppress Waluigi versus Luigi reinforcement.

Result: Demonstrates that strict unanimity cannot be achieved with linear pooling or in binary-outcome spaces, but is achievable with three or more outcomes. Provides a recursive, continuous, and open framework for subagent coalescence, with tilt-based analysis ruling out trivial duplications. In LLM experiments, Luigified prompts spur Waluigi antagonism; a manifest-then-suppress Waluigi strategy yields greater first-order misalignment reduction than pure Luigi reinforcement alone.

Conclusion: The paper offers a principled mathematical framework for subagents coalescing into coherent higher-level agents and delivers new implications for alignment in agentic AI systems, including nontrivial dynamics in LLM-based alignment and guidance for designing aggregation mechanisms that promote coherent, aligned behavior.

Abstract: We develop a theory of intelligent agency grounded in probabilistic modeling
for neural models. Agents are represented as outcome distributions with
epistemic utility given by log score, and compositions are defined through
weighted logarithmic pooling that strictly improves every member's welfare. We
prove that strict unanimity is impossible under linear pooling or in binary
outcome spaces, but possible with three or more outcomes. Our framework admits
recursive structure via cloning invariance, continuity, and openness, while
tilt-based analysis rules out trivial duplication. Finally, we formalize an
agentic alignment phenomenon in LLMs using our theory: eliciting a benevolent
persona ("Luigi'") induces an antagonistic counterpart ("Waluigi"), while a
manifest-then-suppress Waluigi strategy yields strictly larger first-order
misalignment reduction than pure Luigi reinforcement alone. These results
clarify how developing a principled mathematical framework for how subagents
can coalesce into coherent higher-level entities provides novel implications
for alignment in agentic AI systems.

*Ruben Bontorno,Songyan Hou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a time-causal nested optimal transport distance as a robust evaluation metric for generative models of financial time series in decision-making tasks, and introduces a statistically consistent, parallelizable algorithm that achieves substantial speedups over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is no consensus metric for evaluating deep generative models of financial time series in decision-making contexts. Robust metrics are needed for stress testing, scenario generation, hedging, and RL-enabled decisions.

Method: Adopt the nested optimal transport distance (a time-causal variant) as the evaluation metric and develop a statistically consistent, naturally parallelizable algorithm for its computation, designed to be robust for tasks like hedging, optimal stopping, and reinforcement learning.

Result: The algorithm achieves substantial speedups over existing approaches while providing a robust, task-appropriate evaluation metric for financial time series in decision-making settings.

Conclusion: A robust, scalable evaluation framework for generative AI in financial time series is established, enabling reliable assessment across hedging, stopping, and RL tasks and enabling faster computation.

Abstract: Simulating realistic financial time series is essential for stress testing,
scenario generation, and decision-making under uncertainty. Despite advances in
deep generative models, there is no consensus metric for their evaluation. We
focus on generative AI for financial time series in decision-making
applications and employ the nested optimal transport distance, a time-causal
variant of optimal transport distance, which is robust to tasks such as
hedging, optimal stopping, and reinforcement learning. Moreover, we propose a
statistically consistent, naturally parallelizable algorithm for its
computation, achieving substantial speedups over existing approaches.

*Zakariae El Asri,Ibrahim Laiche,Clément Rambour,Olivier Sigaud,Nicolas Thome*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes RT-HCP and a general framework to handle inference delays in model-based RL, achieving a favorable trade-off between performance, sample efficiency, and inference time; validated on a high-frequency Furuta pendulum with open-source code.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable sample-efficient robot learning while meeting real-time control frequency constraints, addressing the gap where model-based RL is efficient in data but slow in inference.

Method: Define a generic framework for dealing with inference delays by feeding a sequence of actions from a slow, high-level controller to a fast execution platform without gaps; compare multiple RL algorithms under this framework and introduce RT-HCP as a practical solution.

Result: RT-HCP achieves an excellent balance among performance, sample efficiency, and inference time in experiments; demonstrates viability of learning a controller directly on a high-frequency robot platform (FURUTA pendulum).

Conclusion: The proposed framework and RT-HCP offer a practical, generalizable approach for real-time, sample-efficient robotic control; code is available for reproducibility (GitHub).

Abstract: Learning a controller directly on the robot requires extreme sample
efficiency. Model-based reinforcement learning (RL) methods are the most sample
efficient, but they often suffer from a too long inference time to meet the
robot control frequency requirements. In this paper, we address the sample
efficiency and inference time challenges with two contributions. First, we
define a general framework to deal with inference delays where the slow
inference robot controller provides a sequence of actions to feed the
control-hungry robotic platform without execution gaps. Then, we compare
several RL algorithms in the light of this framework and propose RT-HCP, an
algorithm that offers an excellent trade-off between performance, sample
efficiency and inference time. We validate the superiority of RT-HCP with
experiments where we learn a controller directly on a simple but high frequency
FURUTA pendulum platform. Code: github.com/elasriz/RTHCP

### [256] [Long-Range Graph Wavelet Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06743)
*Filippo Guerranti,Fabrizio Forte,Simon Geisler,Stephan Günnemann*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LR-GWN proposes a long-range graph wavelet network that splits wavelet filters into a local, low-order polynomial part and a global, flexible spectral part to capture long-range interactions. This hybrid approach unifies short- and long-distance information flow within a principled wavelet framework, achieving state-of-the-art performance among wavelet-based methods on long-range benchmarks while remaining competitive on short-range data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Graph neural networks struggle to propagate information across long distances in large graphs. Wavelet-based GNNs capture multi-scale structure but rely on finite-order polynomial approximations, limiting receptive fields. A hybrid design aims to extend the effective range of information propagation without sacrificing locality.

Method: Decompose wavelet filters into complementary local and global components. Use efficient low-order polynomials for local aggregation, and a flexible spectral-domain parameterization to model long-range interactions. Integrate these within a unified wavelet framework to enable simultaneous short- and long-distance information flow.

Result: Empirical evaluations show LR-GWN achieves state-of-the-art performance among wavelet-based methods on long-range benchmarks and remains competitive on short-range datasets.

Conclusion: A hybrid wavelet design successfully unifies short- and long-distance information flow, enhancing long-range propagation while preserving short-range performance; supports broader applicability of wavelet-based GNNs with spectral parameterization.

Abstract: Modeling long-range interactions, the propagation of information across
distant parts of a graph, is a central challenge in graph machine learning.
Graph wavelets, inspired by multi-resolution signal processing, provide a
principled way to capture both local and global structures. However, existing
wavelet-based graph neural networks rely on finite-order polynomial
approximations, which limit their receptive fields and hinder long-range
propagation. We propose Long-Range Graph Wavelet Networks (LR-GWN), which
decompose wavelet filters into complementary local and global components. Local
aggregation is handled with efficient low-order polynomials, while long-range
interactions are captured through a flexible spectral domain parameterization.
This hybrid design unifies short- and long-distance information flow within a
principled wavelet framework. Experiments show that LR-GWN achieves
state-of-the-art performance among wavelet-based methods on long-range
benchmarks, while remaining competitive on short-range datasets.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LVLMs can be better aligned and made more adaptive by integrating DRL and DPO, enabling reward-driven policy optimization and direct preference alignment for multimodal tasks; the work surveys paradigms, data sources, signals, and challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the critical need for aligning LVLMs with human values, improving task performance, and enabling adaptive multimodal interaction in a scalable, safe, and generalizable manner.

Method: Conceptual overview / survey that categorizes DRL- and DPO-based fine-tuning approaches for LVLMs, analyzes sources of preference data and reward signals, and discusses scalability, continual learning, generalization, and safety.

Result: Provides a synthesized framework showing how DRL and DPO contribute to robust, human-aligned LVLMs; highlights open challenges and outlines directions for improving scalability, sample efficiency, continual learning, generalization, and safety.

Conclusion: DRL and DPO offer complementary pathways for aligning LVLMs with human preferences. Future work should focus on improving efficiency, generalization, and safety while enabling adaptive multimodal interaction.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) or multimodal large language models
represent a significant advancement in artificial intelligence, enabling
systems to understand and generate content across both visual and textual
modalities. While large-scale pretraining has driven substantial progress,
fine-tuning these models for aligning with human values or engaging in specific
tasks or behaviors remains a critical challenge. Deep Reinforcement Learning
(DRL) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) offer promising frameworks for
this aligning process. While DRL enables models to optimize actions using
reward signals instead of relying solely on supervised preference data, DPO
directly aligns the policy with preferences, eliminating the need for an
explicit reward model. This overview explores paradigms for fine-tuning LVLMs,
highlighting how DRL and DPO techniques can be used to align models with human
preferences and values, improve task performance, and enable adaptive
multimodal interaction. We categorize key approaches, examine sources of
preference data, reward signals, and discuss open challenges such as
scalability, sample efficiency, continual learning, generalization, and safety.
The goal is to provide a clear understanding of how DRL and DPO contribute to
the evolution of robust and human-aligned LVLMs.

### [258] [Asynchronous Message Passing for Addressing Oversquashing in Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06777)
*Kushal Bose,Swagatam Das*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: An asynchronous, model-agnostic GNN framework that updates node features in layer-wise batches based on centrality to mitigate oversquashing, avoiding fixed-capacity bottlenecks while maintaining inductive bias; shows improvements on long-range tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Oversquashing bottlenecks hinder long-range information flow in GNNs; graph rewiring can help but often degrades inductive bias and increases complexity; there is a need for a lightweight, scalable solution with preserved inductive biases.

Method: In each layer, form node batches according to centrality; update features only for nodes in the current batch; perform asynchronous message updates sequentially across layers rather than synchronous all-at-once passing; provide theoretical bounds showing higher feature sensitivity than standard synchronous methods; evaluate on six standard datasets and two long-range datasets for graph classification.

Result: Achieves 5% improvement on REDDIT-BINARY and 4% on Peptides-struct; competitive or improved performance on other datasets; demonstrates effective mitigation of oversquashing with modest computational overhead.

Conclusion: The proposed asynchronous feature-update framework offers a model-agnostic, scalable path to tackling oversquashing while preserving inductive biases and maintaining performance on long-range graph tasks.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) suffer from Oversquashing, which occurs when
tasks require long-range interactions. The problem arises from the presence of
bottlenecks that limit the propagation of messages among distant nodes.
Recently, graph rewiring methods modify edge connectivity and are expected to
perform well on long-range tasks. Yet, graph rewiring compromises the inductive
bias, incurring significant information loss in solving the downstream task.
Furthermore, increasing channel capacity may overcome information bottlenecks
but enhance the parameter complexity of the model. To alleviate these
shortcomings, we propose an efficient model-agnostic framework that
asynchronously updates node features, unlike traditional synchronous message
passing GNNs. Our framework creates node batches in every layer based on the
node centrality values. The features of the nodes belonging to these batches
will only get updated. Asynchronous message updates process information
sequentially across layers, avoiding simultaneous compression into
fixed-capacity channels. We also theoretically establish that our proposed
framework maintains higher feature sensitivity bounds compared to standard
synchronous approaches. Our framework is applied to six standard graph datasets
and two long-range datasets to perform graph classification and achieves
impressive performances with a $5\%$ and $4\%$ improvements on REDDIT-BINARY
and Peptides-struct, respectively.

### [259] [Physics-informed Value Learner for Offline Goal-Conditioned Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06782)
*Vittorio Giammarino,Ruiqi Ni,Ahmed H. Qureshi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces a physics-informed regularizer for value learning in offline GCRL based on the Eikonal PDE, embedding a geometric cost-to-go bias; when paired with Hierarchical Implicit Q-Learning (HIQL) as Pi-HIQL, it improves performance and generalization, especially in stitching regimes and large navigation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Offline GCRL struggles with limited state-action coverage and long-horizon generalization. A physics-inspired, continuous-time optimal-control prior can stabilize learning and encourage value functions to reflect cost-to-go structures.

Method: Derives a Pi regularizer from the Eikonal PDE to regularize the value function during TD-based learning. The regularizer imposes a geometric inductive bias aligned with cost-to-go and is compatible with existing offline GCRL methods. It is combined with HIQL to form Physics-informed HIQL (Pi-HIQL).

Result: The Pi regularizer leads to notable improvements in performance and generalization, with pronounced gains in stitching regimes and large-scale navigation tasks.

Conclusion: A physics-informed, PDE-based regularizer provides a principled inductive bias for value learning in offline GCRL, stabilizing training and enhancing generalization. When integrated with HIQL (Pi-HIQL), it yields strong empirical gains in challenging long-horizon navigation scenarios.

Abstract: Offline Goal-Conditioned Reinforcement Learning (GCRL) holds great promise
for domains such as autonomous navigation and locomotion, where collecting
interactive data is costly and unsafe. However, it remains challenging in
practice due to the need to learn from datasets with limited coverage of the
state-action space and to generalize across long-horizon tasks. To improve on
these challenges, we propose a Physics-informed (Pi) regularized loss for value
learning, derived from the Eikonal Partial Differential Equation (PDE) and
which induces a geometric inductive bias in the learned value function. Unlike
generic gradient penalties that are primarily used to stabilize training, our
formulation is grounded in continuous-time optimal control and encourages value
functions to align with cost-to-go structures. The proposed regularizer is
broadly compatible with temporal-difference-based value learning and can be
integrated into existing Offline GCRL algorithms. When combined with
Hierarchical Implicit Q-Learning (HIQL), the resulting method, Physics-informed
HIQL (Pi-HIQL), yields significant improvements in both performance and
generalization, with pronounced gains in stitching regimes and large-scale
navigation tasks.

TL;DR: A position paper proposes safe-by-coevolution and R^2AI to achieve ongoing, proactive AI safety through adversarial, dynamic learning, combining fast/slow safe models and wind-tunnel testing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bridges the gap between rapid AI capability growth and safety progress; critiques post-hoc safety and intrinsic-safety approaches; advocates adaptive safety in open-ended environments inspired by biological immunity.

Method: Define safe-by-coevolution; present R^2AI framework integrating fast/slow safe models, adversarial simulation and verification via a safety wind tunnel, and continual feedback loops to coevolve safety and capability.

Result: Conceptual framework with a vision for scalable, proactive safety; no empirical results yet; aims to address near-term vulnerabilities and long-term existential risks toward AGI/ASI.

Conclusion: R^2AI and safe-by-coevolution offer a dynamic, adversarial safety paradigm that could enable continual, scalable safety in evolving AI systems.

Abstract: In this position paper, we address the persistent gap between rapidly growing
AI capabilities and lagging safety progress. Existing paradigms divide into
``Make AI Safe'', which applies post-hoc alignment and guardrails but remains
brittle and reactive, and ``Make Safe AI'', which emphasizes intrinsic safety
but struggles to address unforeseen risks in open-ended environments. We
therefore propose \textit{safe-by-coevolution} as a new formulation of the
``Make Safe AI'' paradigm, inspired by biological immunity, in which safety
becomes a dynamic, adversarial, and ongoing learning process. To operationalize
this vision, we introduce \texttt{R$^2$AI} -- \textit{Resistant and Resilient
AI} -- as a practical framework that unites resistance against known threats
with resilience to unforeseen risks. \texttt{R$^2$AI} integrates \textit{fast
and slow safe models}, adversarial simulation and verification through a
\textit{safety wind tunnel}, and continual feedback loops that guide safety and
capability to coevolve. We argue that this framework offers a scalable and
proactive path to maintain continual safety in dynamic environments, addressing
both near-term vulnerabilities and long-term existential risks as AI advances
toward AGI and ASI.

*Bhavya Agrawalla,Michal Nauman,Khush Agarwal,Aviral Kumar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Floq uses a flow-matching Q-function parameterized by a velocity field trained via TD-learning with iterative numerical integration; it acts as an adjustable-capacity, flowing Quantum-like value function.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dense supervision of intermediate computations in modern models suggests iterative computation can boost learning; applying this to RL value learning may overcome fixed, monolithic Q-functions and improve scalability.

Method: Parameterize Q(s,a) as the integral of a velocity field (a flow) over time. Train with flow-matching techniques, bootstrapping from a target velocity field obtained by running multiple integration steps. The number of integration steps serves as a capacity knob for the Q-function.

Result: On offline RL benchmarks and online fine-tuning tasks, floq yields about 1.8x performance improvements and scales capacity more effectively than standard TD-learning architectures.

Conclusion: Iterative, flow-based value learning via velocity-field Q-functions offers a scalable and effective alternative to traditional TD methods, with strong empirical gains across tasks.

Abstract: A hallmark of modern large-scale machine learning techniques is the use of
training objectives that provide dense supervision to intermediate
computations, such as teacher forcing the next token in language models or
denoising step-by-step in diffusion models. This enables models to learn
complex functions in a generalizable manner. Motivated by this observation, we
investigate the benefits of iterative computation for temporal difference (TD)
methods in reinforcement learning (RL). Typically they represent value
functions in a monolithic fashion, without iterative compute. We introduce floq
(flow-matching Q-functions), an approach that parameterizes the Q-function
using a velocity field and trains it using techniques from flow-matching,
typically used in generative modeling. This velocity field underneath the flow
is trained using a TD-learning objective, which bootstraps from values produced
by a target velocity field, computed by running multiple steps of numerical
integration. Crucially, floq allows for more fine-grained control and scaling
of the Q-function capacity than monolithic architectures, by appropriately
setting the number of integration steps. Across a suite of challenging offline
RL benchmarks and online fine-tuning tasks, floq improves performance by nearly
1.8x. floq scales capacity far better than standard TD-learning architectures,
highlighting the potential of iterative computation for value learning.

TL;DR: PyFair is a formal framework that uses concolic testing with a dual-network design to test and verify individual fairness in DNNs.

Motivation: Growing reliance on DNNs in high-stakes decisions requires reliable, verifiable fairness guarantees; existing bias mitigation lacks rigorous verification and completeness.

Method: Adapts PyCT concolic testing to generate fairness-specific path constraints; introduces a dual-network architecture to enable comprehensive fairness assessment and, for some network types, completeness guarantees; evaluates on 25 benchmark models including bias-mitigated ones.

Result: PyFair effectively detects discriminatory instances and verifies fairness; reveals scalability challenges for complex models.

Conclusion: PyFair advances algorithmic fairness by providing a rigorous, systematic framework for fairness testing and verification of pre-trained DNNs, while outlining scalability limitations and directions for future improvement.

Abstract: This paper introduces PyFair, a formal framework for evaluating and verifying
individual fairness of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). By adapting the concolic

techniques. Results demonstrate PyFair's efficacy in detecting discriminatory
instances and verifying fairness, while also revealing scalability challenges
for complex models. This work advances algorithmic fairness in critical domains
by offering a rigorous, systematic method for fairness testing and verification
of pre-trained DNNs.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AxelSMOTE is a culture-inspired, agent-based oversampling method that uses trait-based feature grouping, similarity-driven interactions, Beta-distributed interpolation, and controlled diversity to improve minority-class performance, showing superior results on eight imbalanced datasets with good efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address class imbalance and overcome the drawbacks of traditional oversampling methods: treating features independently, lacking similarity-based control, limiting sample diversity, and failing to manage synthetic variety.

Method: An agent-based framework grounded in Axelrod's cultural dissemination model. Key components include (1) trait-based feature grouping to preserve correlations, (2) a similarity-based probabilistic exchange mechanism for meaningful interactions, (3) Beta distribution blending for realistic interpolation of samples, and (4) controlled diversity injection to prevent overfitting.

Result: Empirical evaluation on eight imbalanced datasets showing AxelSMOTE outperforms state-of-the-art sampling methods while maintaining computational efficiency.

Conclusion: AxelSMOTE introduces a novel, effective, and efficient oversampling strategy that leverages social-agent dynamics to enhance minority-class learning while preserving feature correlations and controlling synthetic diversity.

Abstract: Class imbalance in machine learning poses a significant challenge, as skewed
datasets often hinder performance on minority classes. Traditional oversampling
techniques, which are commonly used to alleviate class imbalance, have several
drawbacks: they treat features independently, lack similarity-based controls,
limit sample diversity, and fail to manage synthetic variety effectively. To
overcome these issues, we introduce AxelSMOTE, an innovative agent-based
approach that views data instances as autonomous agents engaging in complex
interactions. Based on Axelrod's cultural dissemination model, AxelSMOTE
implements four key innovations: (1) trait-based feature grouping to preserve
correlations; (2) a similarity-based probabilistic exchange mechanism for
meaningful interactions; (3) Beta distribution blending for realistic
interpolation; and (4) controlled diversity injection to avoid overfitting.
Experiments on eight imbalanced datasets demonstrate that AxelSMOTE outperforms
state-of-the-art sampling methods while maintaining computational efficiency.

*William Xu,Yiwei Lu,Yihan Wang,Matthew Y. R. Yang,Zuoqiu Liu,Gautam Kamath,Yaoliang Yu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Three predictive criteria—ergodic prediction accuracy, poison distance, and poison budget—predict the difficulty of targeted data poisoning on a test instance, demonstrated by experiments across scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Targeted data poisoning threatens individual test instances and requires understanding why some samples are more vulnerable, enabling vulnerability assessment and risk mitigation.

Method: Define three predictive criteria and empirically evaluate them: ergodic prediction accuracy via clean training dynamics, poison distance, and poison budget. Conduct experiments across real-world targeted poisoning attacks and diverse datasets to assess predictive power.

Result: The proposed metrics correlate with attack difficulty and reliably predict which test samples are more susceptible to targeted poisoning, offering practical guidance for vulnerability assessment.

Conclusion: These criteria provide actionable, instance-level metrics for vulnerability assessment and can inform the design of defenses to reduce susceptibility of high-risk samples.

Abstract: Targeted data poisoning attacks pose an increasingly serious threat due to
their ease of deployment and high success rates. These attacks aim to
manipulate the prediction for a single test sample in classification models.
Unlike indiscriminate attacks that aim to decrease overall test performance,
targeted attacks present a unique threat to individual test instances. This
threat model raises a fundamental question: what factors make certain test
samples more susceptible to successful poisoning than others? We investigate
how attack difficulty varies across different test instances and identify key
characteristics that influence vulnerability. This paper introduces three
predictive criteria for targeted data poisoning difficulty: ergodic prediction
accuracy (analyzed through clean training dynamics), poison distance, and
poison budget. Our experimental results demonstrate that these metrics
effectively predict the varying difficulty of real-world targeted poisoning
attacks across diverse scenarios, offering practitioners valuable insights for
vulnerability assessment and understanding data poisoning attacks.

*Tarhib Al Azad,Shahana Ibrahim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A robust OOD detection framework that addresses noisy labels by fusing loss-correction methods from noisy-label learning with low-rank/sparse decomposition, achieving strong gains over state-of-the-art under heavy label noise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: OOD detection is essential for safe AI; label noise routinely degrades performance and existing naive combos are insufficient; there is a need for principled robust approaches.

Method: Combine loss-correction techniques from noisy-label learning with low-rank and sparse decomposition (signal-processing inspired) to jointly mitigate label noise and separate in-distribution vs out-of-distribution signals, evaluated on synthetic and real-world datasets.

Result: Significant improvements over state-of-the-art OOD methods, especially under severe label-noise scenarios; method demonstrates robustness and generalization across datasets.

Conclusion: The integrated framework provides a principled path for robust OOD detection under label noise and highlights the value of cross-disciplinary techniques; suggests directions for future work and deployment in safety-critical AI.

Abstract: Robust out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is an indispensable component of
modern artificial intelligence (AI) systems, especially in safety-critical
applications where models must identify inputs from unfamiliar classes not seen
during training. While OOD detection has been extensively studied in the
machine learning literature--with both post hoc and training-based
approaches--its effectiveness under noisy training labels remains
underexplored. Recent studies suggest that label noise can significantly
degrade OOD performance, yet principled solutions to this issue are lacking. In
this work, we demonstrate that directly combining existing label noise-robust
methods with OOD detection strategies is insufficient to address this critical
challenge. To overcome this, we propose a robust OOD detection framework that
integrates loss correction techniques from the noisy label learning literature
with low-rank and sparse decomposition methods from signal processing.
Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate
that our method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art OOD detection
techniques, particularly under severe noisy label settings.

TL;DR: SEELE adaptively tunes problem difficulty in RLVR by appending adaptive hints and using multi-round rollout sampling with an item response theory model to predict hint lengths, improving exploration efficiency and achieving strong gains across six math benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address exploration inefficiency in RLVR caused by mismatch between training data difficulty and LLM capability; enabling consistent progress by keeping problems within the model's high-efficiency region.

Method: Append hints to problems and adapt hint length per instance using multi-round rollout sampling. In each round, collect accuracy-hint data, fit an item response theory model to predict the next-round required hint length, and adjust difficulty for subsequent rounds.

Result: SEELE outperforms Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) and Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT) by +11.8 and +10.5 points, and surpasses the best previous supervision-aided approach by +3.6 points on average across six math reasoning benchmarks.

Conclusion: Instance-level, real-time difficulty adjustment via adaptive hints and IRT-based planning improves exploration efficiency and overall performance in RLVR for math reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has achieved remarkable
success in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models
(LLMs). However, existing RLVR methods often suffer from exploration
inefficiency due to mismatches between the training data's difficulty and the
model's capability. LLMs fail to discover viable reasoning paths when problems
are overly difficult, while learning little new capability when problems are
too simple. In this work, we formalize the impact of problem difficulty by
quantifying the relationship between loss descent speed and rollout accuracy.
Building on this analysis, we propose SEELE, a novel supervision-aided RLVR
framework that dynamically adjusts problem difficulty to stay within the
high-efficiency region. SEELE augments each training sample by appending a hint
(part of a full solution) after the original problem. Unlike previous
hint-based approaches, SEELE deliberately and adaptively adjusts the hint
length for each problem to achieve an optimal difficulty. To determine the
optimal hint length, SEELE employs a multi-round rollout sampling strategy. In
each round, it fits an item response theory model to the accuracy-hint pairs
collected in preceding rounds to predict the required hint length for the next
round. This instance-level, real-time difficulty adjustment aligns problem
difficulty with the evolving model capability, thereby improving exploration
efficiency. Experimental results show that SEELE outperforms Group Relative
Policy Optimization (GRPO) and Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT) by +11.8 and +10.5
points, respectively, and surpasses the best previous supervision-aided
approach by +3.6 points on average across six math reasoning benchmarks.

TL;DR: Optimizes neutron reflectometry analysis by differentiating the forward model instead of relying on black-box surrogates, enabling efficient gradient-based inference and tool-assisted fitting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neutron reflectometry data are indirect measurements; inverse modeling is computationally expensive, especially for complex multilayer structures. Surrogate ML often sacrifices physical intuition. A gradient-based approach on the forward model preserves physics while enabling modern optimization.

Method: Compute exact gradients of the error with respect to model parameters using automatic differentiation on the forward reflectivity model; perform gradient descent on these parameters. Develop differentiable reflectometry kernels in Python and apply to two benchmarks (thick oxide quartz film and organic LED multilayer devices).

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on the thick oxide quartz film and robust co-fitting performance in the high-complexity organic LED multilayer regime; provides an open-source Python library of differentiable reflectometry kernels for easy adoption.

Conclusion: Gradient-based optimisation on a differentiable forward model preserves physical insight while enabling efficient, modern inference for NR data; the approach is broadly applicable to NR datasets and facilitates wider adoption of gradient-based methods.

Abstract: Neutron reflectometry (NR) is a powerful technique to probe surfaces and
interfaces. NR is inherently an indirect measurement technique, access to the
physical quantities of interest (layer thickness, scattering length density,
roughness), necessitate the solution of an inverse modelling problem, that is
inefficient for large amounts of data or complex multiplayer structures (e.g.
lithium batteries / electrodes). Recently, surrogate machine learning models
have been proposed as an alternative to existing optimisation routines.
Although such approaches have been successful, physical intuition is lost when
replacing governing equations with fast neural networks. Instead, we propose a
novel and efficient approach; to optimise reflectivity data analysis by
performing gradient descent on the forward reflection model itself. Herein,
automatic differentiation techniques are used to evaluate exact gradients of
the error function with respect to the parameters of interest. Access to these
quantities enables users of neutron reflectometry to harness a host of powerful
modern optimisation and inference techniques that remain thus far unexploited
in the context of neutron reflectometry. This paper presents two benchmark case
studies; demonstrating state-of-the-art performance on a thick oxide quartz
film, and robust co-fitting performance in the high complexity regime of
organic LED multilayer devices. Additionally, we provide an open-source library
of differentiable reflectometry kernels in the python programming language so

### [268] [Learning words in groups: fusion algebras, tensor ranks and grokking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06931)
*Maor Shutman,Oren Louidor,Ran Tessler*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A simple two-layer network can learn arbitrary word operations over finite groups when width is sufficient, exhibiting grokking; the task is reframed as learning a low-rank 3-tensor. Low-rank structure arises by decomposing along triplets of self-conjugate group representations and using fusion rules to prune components. A surrogate model shows the network can discover such low-rank implementations, effectively performing Strassen-like efficient matrix multiplication for the multiplication word. The work also analyzes gradient descent dynamics that lead to these solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how neural networks acquire algebraic computation abilities for group-based word operations, including the role of network width, training dynamics (grokking), and representations-theoretic structure; to connect practical learning phenomena with low-rank tensor decompositions and efficient-multiplication concepts (Strassen).

Method: Reframe the problem as learning a 3-tensor representing a word-operation in a finite group. Argue the tensor is typically low-rank and can be obtained by decomposing along triplets of basic self-conjugate representations, aided by fusion rules that discard many components. Use a surrogate, tractable model to show the network can discover such low-rank implementations or good approximations, enabling width-limited generalization. For the simple multiplication word, analyze the form of the low-rank implementation and show it corresponds to Strassen-like matrix multiplication. Additionally, study how gradient descent facilitates reaching these solutions.

Result: Demonstrates that wide but not necessarily fat networks can learn arbitrary word-operations in finite groups via low-rank 3-tensor representations. The network discovers decompositions along triplets of self-conjugate representations and leverages fusion rules to prune components, effectively performing a Strassen-like matrix multiplication for the multiplication word. The surrogate model confirms the network can find such low-rank implementations and highlights the gradient-descent dynamics that lead to these solutions.

Conclusion: Low-dimensional tensor structure underpins the network’s ability to learn algebraic word-operations, with width enabling a low-rank, generalizable implementation. The work elucidates how representation-theoretic decompositions and gradient-based optimization enable grokking to yield efficient, structured solutions (e.g., Strassen-like multiplication), offering a lens to interpret learning dynamics for group-based computations.

Abstract: In this work, we demonstrate that a simple two-layer neural network with
standard activation functions can learn an arbitrary word operation in any
finite group, provided sufficient width is available and exhibits grokking
while doing so. To explain the mechanism by which this is achieved, we reframe
the problem as that of learning a particular $3$-tensor, which we show is
typically of low rank. A key insight is that low-rank implementations of this
tensor can be obtained by decomposing it along triplets of basic self-conjugate
representations of the group and leveraging the fusion structure to rule out
many components. Focusing on a phenomenologically similar but more tractable
surrogate model, we show that the network is able to find such low-rank
implementations (or approximations thereof), thereby using limited width to
approximate the word-tensor in a generalizable way. In the case of the simple
multiplication word, we further elucidate the form of these low-rank
implementations, showing that the network effectively implements efficient
matrix multiplication in the sense of Strassen. Our work also sheds light on
the mechanism by which a network reaches such a solution under gradient
descent.

### [269] [From Noise to Narrative: Tracing the Origins of Hallucinations in Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06938)
*Praneet Suresh,Jack Stanley,Sonia Joseph,Luca Scimeca,Danilo Bzdok*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Transformers' hallucinations are tied to activations of semantic concepts captured by sparse autoencoders; as input becomes more unstructured, more concepts are used and hallucinations emerge from input-insensitive features; even pure noise reveals robust concepts; hallucinations can be predicted from activation patterns and steered, with implications for alignment, safety, attack surface, and risk quantification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand when and why transformer models hallucinate, especially under uncertain or unstructured inputs, and to link internal concept representations to failure modes for safety and risk assessment.

Method: Apply sparse autoencoders to pre-trained transformer activations to extract concept representations; systematically vary input uncertainty; analyze how the number and nature of activated concepts change; examine whether hallucinations can be steered and whether they can be predicted from activation patterns.

Result: Increasing input unstructuredness leads to more semantic concepts being used; under uncertainty, transformers activate coherent but input-insensitive concepts, causing hallucinations; with pure-noise inputs a wide set of robust concepts activate; these concepts can be steered and are predictive of hallucinations.

Conclusion: The study illuminates transformer internal processing, with practical implications for AI alignment, safety, vulnerability to adversarial manipulation, and the ability to automatically quantify a model's hallucination risk.

Abstract: As generative AI systems become competent and democratized in science,
business, and government, deeper insight into their failure modes now poses an
acute need. The occasional volatility in their behavior, such as the propensity
of transformer models to hallucinate, impedes trust and adoption of emerging AI
solutions in high-stakes areas. In the present work, we establish how and when
hallucinations arise in pre-trained transformer models through concept
representations captured by sparse autoencoders, under scenarios with
experimentally controlled uncertainty in the input space. Our systematic
experiments reveal that the number of semantic concepts used by the transformer
model grows as the input information becomes increasingly unstructured. In the
face of growing uncertainty in the input space, the transformer model becomes
prone to activate coherent yet input-insensitive semantic features, leading to
hallucinated output. At its extreme, for pure-noise inputs, we identify a wide
variety of robustly triggered and meaningful concepts in the intermediate
activations of pre-trained transformer models, whose functional integrity we
confirm through targeted steering. We also show that hallucinations in the
output of a transformer model can be reliably predicted from the concept
patterns embedded in transformer layer activations. This collection of insights
on transformer internal processing mechanics has immediate consequences for
aligning AI models with human values, AI safety, opening the attack surface for
potential adversarial attacks, and providing a basis for automatic
quantification of a model's hallucination risk.

### [270] [Outcome-based Exploration for LLM Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06941)
*Yuda Song,Julia Kempe,Remi Munos*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Outcome-based RL improves final-answer accuracy but reduces generation diversity; proposes outcome-based exploration (historical and batch) to recover diversity while preserving performance, supported by theory and math-task experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RL post-training can enhance reasoning in LLMs, but outcome-only rewards raise accuracy at the cost of diversity, which harms test-time scalability and real-world performance. Understanding and mitigating this diversity collapse is essential.

Method: Model the RL post-training as a sampling process and analyze diversity dynamics. Propose outcome-based exploration with two algorithms: historical exploration (UCB-style bonuses for rarely observed final answers) and batch exploration (penalize repetition within a batch). Formalize outcome-based bandits theoretically.

Result: Two main findings: (i) diversity degradation transfers from solved to unsolved problems, and (ii) reasoning tasks admit only a limited set of distinct answers, making diversity fragile. Empirically, both exploration methods improve accuracy and mitigate diversity collapse on standard competition math tasks using Llama and Qwen. A theoretical model of outcome-based bandits explains the observed benefits.

Conclusion: Outcome-based exploration provides a practical path to enhance reasoning without sacrificing diversity, enabling more scalable deployment of RL-enhanced LLMs and offering a framework (outcome-based bandits) to study and optimize this balance.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a powerful method for improving
the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs). Outcome-based RL,
which rewards policies solely for the correctness of the final answer, yields
substantial accuracy gains but also induces a systematic loss in generation
diversity. This collapse undermines real-world performance, where diversity is
critical for test-time scaling. We analyze this phenomenon by viewing RL
post-training as a sampling process and show that, strikingly, RL can reduce
effective diversity even on the training set relative to the base model. Our
study highlights two central findings: (i) a transfer of diversity degradation,
where reduced diversity on solved problems propagates to unsolved ones, and
(ii) the tractability of the outcome space, since reasoning tasks admit only a
limited set of distinct answers. Motivated by these insights, we propose
outcome-based exploration, which assigns exploration bonuses according to final
outcomes. We introduce two complementary algorithms: historical exploration,
which encourages rarely observed answers via UCB-style bonuses, and batch
exploration, which penalizes within-batch repetition to promote test-time
diversity. Experiments on standard competition math with Llama and Qwen models
demonstrate that both methods improve accuracy while mitigating diversity
collapse. On the theoretical side, we formalize the benefit of outcome-based
exploration through a new model of outcome-based bandits. Together, these
contributions chart a practical path toward RL methods that enhance reasoning
without sacrificing the diversity essential for scalable deployment.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A unified INF-based framework for multi-axis 3D printing that jointly optimizes toolpaths, motion planning, and extrusion using time-varying signed distance fields, achieving significant speedups and improved accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome fragmentation in multi-axis 3D printing pipelines by integrating design, toolpath generation, and collision-free motion planning into a single differentiable optimization framework.

Method: Represent input as SDFs, encode objectives into an implicit guidance field, interpolate to get shell and infill paths, optimize printing sequence and motion over a continuous quaternion field, evolve the object as a time-varying SDF with differentiable collision handling.

Result: Outperforms explicit-representation methods with up to 100x (two orders of magnitude) speedups and significantly reduces waypoint-to-surface error, validated on diverse models and robot-assisted fabrication experiments.

Conclusion: INF-3DP provides a scalable, unified approach for high-fidelity, efficient multi-axis printing with potential for real-world fabrication, contingent on robust optimization and hardware integration.

Abstract: We introduce a general, scalable computational framework for multi-axis 3D
printing based on implicit neural fields (INFs) that unifies all stages of
toolpath generation and global collision-free motion planning. In our pipeline,
input models are represented as signed distance fields, with fabrication
objectives such as support-free printing, surface finish quality, and extrusion
control being directly encoded in the optimization of an implicit guidance
field. This unified approach enables toolpath optimization across both surface
and interior domains, allowing shell and infill paths to be generated via
implicit field interpolation. The printing sequence and multi-axis motion are
then jointly optimized over a continuous quaternion field. Our continuous
formulation constructs the evolving printing object as a time-varying SDF,
supporting differentiable global collision handling throughout INF-based motion
planning. Compared to explicit-representation-based methods, INF-3DP achieves
up to two orders of magnitude speedup and significantly reduces
waypoint-to-surface error. We validate our framework on diverse, complex models
and demonstrate its efficiency with physical fabrication experiments using a
robot-assisted multi-axis system.

*Ying Li,Xiaobao Wei,Xiaowei Chi,Yuming Li,Zhongyu Zhao,Hao Wang,Ningning Ma,Ming Lu,Shanghang Zhang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A 3D-aware diffusion-based framework (ManipDreamer3D) that reconstructs 3D occupancy, plans optimized 3D end-effector trajectories, and renders plausible robotic manipulation videos from an image and text, reducing human input and outperforming 2D-trajectory methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome data scarcity and 3D spatial ambiguity in diffusion-based robotic manipulation video generation by integrating 3D occupancy representations and trajectory planning.

Method: 1) Reconstruct a 3D occupancy representation from the input image (third-person view). 2) Compute an optimized 3D end-effector trajectory by minimizing path length and avoiding collisions. 3) Use latent editing to create video sequences from the initial image latent and the optimized 3D trajectory. 4) Condition a specially trained trajectory-to-video diffusion model on the trajectory to produce robotic pick-and-place videos.

Result: The method achieves superior visual quality compared with existing diffusion-based approaches and reduces the need for manual intervention due to autonomous 3D trajectory planning.

Conclusion: ManipDreamer3D provides a 3D-aware video-generation framework for robotic manipulation, enabling plausible, autonomous 3D trajectories and improved video realism over prior 2D-trajectory methods.

Abstract: Data scarcity continues to be a major challenge in the field of robotic
manipulation. Although diffusion models provide a promising solution for
generating robotic manipulation videos, existing methods largely depend on 2D
trajectories, which inherently face issues with 3D spatial ambiguity. In this
work, we present a novel framework named ManipDreamer3D for generating
plausible 3D-aware robotic manipulation videos from the input image and the
text instruction. Our method combines 3D trajectory planning with a
reconstructed 3D occupancy map created from a third-person perspective, along
with a novel trajectory-to-video diffusion model. Specifically, ManipDreamer3D
first reconstructs the 3D occupancy representation from the input image and
then computes an optimized 3D end-effector trajectory, minimizing path length
while avoiding collisions. Next, we employ a latent editing technique to create
video sequences from the initial image latent and the optimized 3D trajectory.
This process conditions our specially trained trajectory-to-video diffusion
model to produce robotic pick-and-place videos. Our method generates robotic
videos with autonomously planned plausible 3D trajectories, significantly
reducing human intervention requirements. Experimental results demonstrate
superior visual quality compared to existing methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the gap in evaluating LLMs under ground-truth-rich, real-world AV edge cases and explores their utility in perception/planning anomaly detection.

Method: Proposes an architecture combining an open vocabulary object detector, prompt engineering, and LLM contextual reasoning; tests several state-of-the-art LLMs on real edge-case scenarios and provides qualitative comparisons.

Result: Qualitative results and analysis; discusses findings and the feasibility of LLMs as anomaly detectors in AVs.

Conclusion: LLMs show promise for AV anomaly detection when integrated with structured perception, but require careful evaluation, robustness checks, and practical considerations for deployment.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of large language models (LLMs) has pushed their
boundaries to many applications in various domains. Recently, the research
community has started to evaluate their potential adoption in autonomous
vehicles and especially as complementary modules in the perception and planning
software stacks. However, their evaluation is limited in synthetic datasets or
manually driving datasets without the ground truth knowledge and more
precisely, how the current perception and planning algorithms would perform in
the cases under evaluation. For this reason, this work evaluates LLMs on
real-world edge cases where current autonomous vehicles have been proven to
fail. The proposed architecture consists of an open vocabulary object detector
coupled with prompt engineering and large language model contextual reasoning.
We evaluate several state-of-the-art models against real edge cases and provide
qualitative comparison results along with a discussion on the findings for the
potential application of LLMs as anomaly detectors in autonomous vehicles.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Plantbot proposes a biotic-robot hybrid where a living plant is linked to a mobile robot via LLM-based modules, using language as a universal protocol to coordinate sensing, perception, dialogue, and action into an autonomous embodied agent.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: to explore the potential of LLM-mediated interfaces to integrate biological and artificial systems, enabling decentralized, autonomous coordination and a new artificial-life paradigm.

Method: an architecture of asynchronous, language-enabled modules for sensing, vision, dialogue, and action; each module communicates via natural language; LLMs translate multimodal plant/robot data into linguistic messages; plant state drives robotic actions; norms are embedded in the sensorimotor loop.

Result: the integrated network yields an embodied, adaptive agent capable of autonomously responding to environmental conditions.

Conclusion: this approach offers a new model of artificial life based on decentralized LLM modules enabling novel interactions between biological and artificial systems.

Abstract: We introduce Plantbot, a hybrid lifeform that connects a living plant with a
mobile robot through a network of large language model (LLM) modules. Each
module - responsible for sensing, vision, dialogue, or action - operates
asynchronously and communicates via natural language, enabling seamless
interaction across biological and artificial domains. This architecture
leverages the capacity of LLMs to serve as hybrid interfaces, where natural
language functions as a universal protocol, translating multimodal data (soil
moisture, temperature, visual context) into linguistic messages that coordinate
system behaviors. The integrated network transforms plant states into robotic
actions, installing normativity essential for agency within the sensor-motor
loop. By combining biological and robotic elements through LLM-mediated
communication, Plantbot behaves as an embodied, adaptive agent capable of
responding autonomously to environmental conditions. This approach suggests
possibilities for a new model of artificial life, where decentralized, LLM
modules coordination enable novel interactions between biological and
artificial systems.

TL;DR: Adaptive drone swarm architecture guided by an LLM that switches between centralized, hierarchical, and holonic coordination to optimize scalability, energy efficiency, and connectivity in disaster response; outperforms static architectures in simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fixed coordination architectures struggle in dynamic disaster scenarios; flexible, scalable, robust coordination is needed that can adapt to task complexity, swarm size, and communication stability; an LLM can enable real-time architectural decision-making.

Method: Propose an adaptive architecture that uses an LLM to dynamically select coordination topology (centralized, hierarchical, or holonic) based on mission parameters (task complexity, swarm size, communication stability). Implement a simulation framework to compare the adaptive approach against static models, evaluating metrics such as scalability, energy efficiency, and connectivity across varied conditions.

Result: Simulations indicate the adaptive architecture outperforms static models in scalability, energy efficiency, and connectivity, demonstrating robustness across different mission parameters and suggesting potential for real-world disaster response deployments.

Conclusion: LLM-guided adaptive topology switching offers a promising route for scalable, resilient drone swarm coordination in disaster response; future work should explore real-world trials, latency implications, and model reliability under resource constraints.

Abstract: The deployment of autonomous drone swarms in disaster response missions
necessitates the development of flexible, scalable, and robust coordination
systems. Traditional fixed architectures struggle to cope with dynamic and
unpredictable environments, leading to inefficiencies in energy consumption and
connectivity. This paper addresses this gap by proposing an adaptive
architecture for drone swarms, leveraging a Large Language Model to dynamically
select the optimal architecture as centralized, hierarchical, or holonic based
on real time mission parameters such as task complexity, swarm size, and
communication stability. Our system addresses the challenges of scalability,
adaptability, and robustness,ensuring efficient energy consumption and
maintaining connectivity under varying conditions. Extensive simulations
demonstrate that our adaptive architecture outperforms traditional static
models in terms of scalability, energy efficiency, and connectivity. These
results highlight the potential of our approach to provide a scalable,

TL;DR: End-to-end training of fully spiking neural networks for continuous motor control demonstrates stable torque control on 2D and 6-DOF robotic tasks, but requires careful hyperparameter design.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the gap that SNNs have been less explored for continuous motor control and high-dimensional robotics; demonstrate viability of end-to-end spiking control in dynamic environments.

Method: A predictive-control framework using Leaky Integrate-and-Fire dynamics with surrogate gradients. jointly optimizes a forward dynamics model and a goal-directed policy network in an end-to-end manner. Includes ablations on initialization, learnable time constants, and regularization.

Result: SNNs achieve stable training and accurate torque control on both a planar 2D reaching task and a simulated 6-DOF Panda robot. Ablation shows the importance of initialization, learnable time constants, and regularization. Recurrent SNNs remain highly sensitive to hyperparameters.

Conclusion: Fully spiking networks can control high-dimensional motors in continuous environments, but success hinges on principled design and careful hyperparameter choices to ensure stable and effective training.

Abstract: Despite recent progress in training spiking neural networks (SNNs) for
classification, their application to continuous motor control remains limited.
Here, we demonstrate that fully spiking architectures can be trained end-to-end
to control robotic arms with multiple degrees of freedom in continuous
environments. Our predictive-control framework combines Leaky
Integrate-and-Fire dynamics with surrogate gradients, jointly optimizing a
forward model for dynamics prediction and a policy network for goal-directed
action. We evaluate this approach on both a planar 2D reaching task and a
simulated 6-DOF Franka Emika Panda robot. Results show that SNNs can achieve
stable training and accurate torque control, establishing their viability for
high-dimensional motor tasks. An extensive ablation study highlights the role
of initialization, learnable time constants, and regularization in shaping
training dynamics. We conclude that while stable and effective control can be
achieved, recurrent spiking networks remain highly sensitive to hyperparameter
settings, underscoring the importance of principled design choices.

TL;DR: A long-horizon visual imitation framework with dual reflection modules (plan and code) improves temporal/spatial reasoning and correctness, evaluated on LongVILBench which emphasizes extended action sequences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Learning from long-horizon demonstrations is hard due to complex temporal and spatial relationships; existing methods struggle with coherence and alignment across extended action sequences. A verification/reflection mechanism can enhance reliability.

Method: Introduce an agent with two paired reflection modules: a plan generation module creates an initial action sequence and a plan reflection module verifies temporal/spatial coherence with the demonstration. A code generation module translates the plan into executable code, with a code reflection module refining the code to ensure correctness and consistency with the plan. A new benchmark, LongVILBench, with 300 human demonstrations (up to 18 steps) is proposed for systematic evaluation.

Result: On LongVILBench, existing methods perform poorly, while the proposed framework provides a strong baseline and shows improved alignment and correctness in both plan and code generation, addressing long-horizon temporal/spatial challenges.

Conclusion: Joint use of plan/code reflection modules enhances error detection and correction in long-horizon imitation, establishing a robust baseline for complex temporal/spatial visual imitation tasks.

Abstract: Learning from long-horizon demonstrations with complex action sequences
presents significant challenges for visual imitation learning, particularly in
understanding temporal relationships of actions and spatial relationships
between objects. In this paper, we propose a new agent framework that
incorporates two dedicated reflection modules to enhance both plan and code
generation. The plan generation module produces an initial action sequence,
which is then verified by the plan reflection module to ensure temporal
coherence and spatial alignment with the demonstration video. The code
generation module translates the plan into executable code, while the code
reflection module verifies and refines the generated code to ensure correctness
and consistency with the generated plan. These two reflection modules jointly
enable the agent to detect and correct errors in both the plan generation and
code generation, improving performance in tasks with intricate temporal and
spatial dependencies. To support systematic evaluation, we introduce
LongVILBench, a benchmark comprising 300 human demonstrations with action
sequences of up to 18 steps. LongVILBench emphasizes temporal and spatial
complexity across multiple task types. Experimental results demonstrate that
existing methods perform poorly on this benchmark, whereas our new framework
establishes a strong baseline for long-horizon visual imitation learning.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Reinforcement learning with a graph neural network policy to jointly solve task allocation, scheduling, and motion planning for multi-robot systems in obstacle-rich environments; demonstrated fast, scalable planning with zero-shot generalization on 8 robots and 40 tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Industrial multi-arm robotics face computational intractability for joint task allocation and motion planning; current practice relies on manual design; there is a need for automated, scalable planning that handles spatio-temporal constraints and dynamic task sets in shared workspaces.

Method: A graph neural network policy trained via reinforcement learning on procedurally generated environments with diverse obstacle layouts, robot configurations, and task distributions. Uses a graph representation of scenes to jointly perform task allocation, scheduling, and motion planning. Demonstrates zero-shot generalization to unseen configurations in simulation with eight robots and 40 tasks.

Result: The policy achieves high-speed planning, generalizes to unseen layouts without additional training, and enables fast planning suitable for workcell layout optimization. It also suggests potential for fault-tolerant planning and online perception-based re-planning.

Conclusion: An RL-based graph policy can provide scalable, automated task and motion planning for multi-robot systems in shared workspaces, reducing reliance on manual trajectory design and enabling adaptable, fast planning.

Abstract: Modern robotic manufacturing requires collision-free coordination of multiple
robots to complete numerous tasks in shared, obstacle-rich workspaces. Although
individual tasks may be simple in isolation, automated joint task allocation,
scheduling, and motion planning under spatio-temporal constraints remain
computationally intractable for classical methods at real-world scales.
Existing multi-arm systems deployed in the industry rely on human intuition and
experience to design feasible trajectories manually in a labor-intensive
process. To address this challenge, we propose a reinforcement learning (RL)
framework to achieve automated task and motion planning, tested in an
obstacle-rich environment with eight robots performing 40 reaching tasks in a
shared workspace, where any robot can perform any task in any order. Our
approach builds on a graph neural network (GNN) policy trained via RL on
procedurally-generated environments with diverse obstacle layouts, robot
configurations, and task distributions. It employs a graph representation of
scenes and a graph policy neural network trained through reinforcement learning
to generate trajectories of multiple robots, jointly solving the sub-problems
of task allocation, scheduling, and motion planning. Trained on large randomly
generated task sets in simulation, our policy generalizes zero-shot to unseen
settings with varying robot placements, obstacle geometries, and task poses. We
further demonstrate that the high-speed capability of our solution enables its
use in workcell layout optimization, improving solution times. The speed and
scalability of our planner also open the door to new capabilities such as
fault-tolerant planning and online perception-based re-planning, where rapid
adaptation to dynamic task sets is required.

*Rui Chen,Domenico Chiaradia,Antonio Frisoli,Daniele Leonardis*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: HapMorph presents a wearable pneumatic system using antagonistic fabric-based actuators to simultaneously and independently modulate object size and stiffness, enabling multi-dimensional haptic rendering with low mass and decoupled control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the longstanding challenge of rendering multiple physical properties (size/shape and stiffness) in wearable haptic devices, which most systems can render only one property at a time, limiting realism and utility.

Method: Developed dual-chamber antagonistic fabric-based pneumatic actuators (AFPAs) and implemented a HapMorph prototype for hand interaction. The system achieves continuous size variation (50–104 mm) and stiffness modulation (up to 4.7 N/mm) with a wearable mass of 21 g. Control of size and stiffness is decoupled via dual-chamber pressure regulation. User studies (n=10) assess perceptual discrimination across nine states (3 sizes × 3 stiffness levels) with 89.4% accuracy and 6.7 s average response time. Extended architectures combine AFPAs with additional pneumatic structures to enable shape morphing alongside stiffness control.

Result: Decoupled, continuous control of size and stiffness demonstrated; size range 50–104 mm, stiffness up to 4.7 N/mm; wearable mass 21 g. Perceptual study shows nine discrete states with high accuracy (89.4%) and moderate response time (6.7 s). Existing architectures extended to allow shape morphing with concurrent stiffness control.

Conclusion: Antagonistic pneumatic principle is a viable pathway toward next-generation haptic interfaces capable of multi-property rendering within practical wearable limits.

Abstract: Haptic interfaces that can simultaneously modulate multiple physical
properties remain a fundamental challenge in human-robot interaction. Existing
systems typically allow the rendering of either geometric features or
mechanical properties, but rarely both, within wearable form factors. Here, we
introduce HapMorph, a pneumatic framework that enables continuous, simultaneous
modulation of object size and stiffness through antagonistic fabric-based
pneumatic actuators (AFPAs). We implemented a HapMorph protoytpe designed for
hands interaction achieving size variation from 50 to 104 mm, stiffness
modulation up to 4.7 N/mm and mass of the wearable parts of just 21 g. Through
systematic characterization, we demonstrate decoupled control of size and
stiffness properties via dual-chamber pressure regulation. Human perception
studies with 10 participants reveal that users can distinguish nine discrete
states across three size categories and three stiffness levels with 89.4%
accuracy and 6.7 s average response time. We further demonstrate extended
architectures that combine AFPAs with complementary pneumatic structures to
enable shape or geometry morphing with concurrent stiffness control. Our
results establish antagonistic pneumatic principle as a pathway toward

*Andrej Orsula,Matthieu Geist,Miguel Olivares-Mendez,Carol Martinez*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A model-based RL agent learns robust autonomous regolith excavation in a high-fidelity, procedurally varied lunar environment by adaptively modulating interaction stiffness via operational space control; generalization hinges on tool diversity and visual feedback.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Achieve robust, generalizable autonomous excavation for in-situ resource utilization in space, addressing the complex dynamics of granular media and the need to operate with varied tools across unknown terrains.

Method: Train a model-based reinforcement learning agent in a parallelized simulation with high-fidelity particle physics and procedural generation to create a wide distribution of lunar terrains and excavation tool geometries. The agent adaptively modulates contact stiffness and damping at each control step using operational space control, enabling tool-aware interaction strategies. Evaluate with and without visual feedback.

Result: Training with a procedural distribution of tools is essential for generalization and fosters sophisticated, tool-aware behavior. Adding visual feedback further improves task success.

Conclusion: The work validates a methodology for building robust and versatile autonomous systems capable of handling foundational lunar excavation tasks, supporting future space missions.

Abstract: Autonomous regolith excavation is a cornerstone of in-situ resource
utilization for a sustained human presence beyond Earth. However, this task is
fundamentally hindered by the complex interaction dynamics of granular media
and the operational need for robots to use diverse tools. To address these
challenges, this work introduces a framework where a model-based reinforcement
learning agent learns within a parallelized simulation. This environment
leverages high-fidelity particle physics and procedural generation to create a
vast distribution of both lunar terrains and excavation tool geometries. To
master this diversity, the agent learns an adaptive interaction strategy by
dynamically modulating its own stiffness and damping at each control step
through operational space control. Our experiments demonstrate that training
with a procedural distribution of tools is critical for generalization and
enables the development of sophisticated tool-aware behavior. Furthermore, we
show that augmenting the agent with visual feedback significantly improves task
success. These results represent a validated methodology for developing the
robust and versatile autonomous systems required for the foundational tasks of
future space missions.

*Yanda Yang,Max Sokolich,Fatma Ceren Kirmizitas,Sambeeta Das,Andreas A. Malikopoulos*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A real-time path planning framework for microrobots in blood vessels using a hybrid analytic-geometry global planner (AGP) plus two reactive local escape controllers (one rules-based, one reinforcement-learning-based). It achieves fast, collision-free navigation with 40 ms planning per frame (≈25 Hz imaging), extends from 2D to 3D without speed loss, and outperforms WA*, PSO, and RRT in simulations, validated in both simulations and experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autonomous microrobots navigating vascular environments face dense, moving obstacles. Real-time, deterministic planning is needed to enable safe, targeted drug delivery with minimally invasive microrobots, leveraging real-time imaging to estimate positions.

Method: Proposes a real-time framework that couples an analytic geometry global planner (AGP) with two reactive local escape controllers (one rules-based, one based on reinforcement learning). Real-time imaging provides estimates of the microrobot, obstacles, and targets; the system computes collision-free motions. The method is evaluated in simulation against WA*, PSO, and RRT, and extended from 2D to 3D without loss of speed; tested in both simulations and experiments.

Result: AGP yields shorter paths and faster planning than WA*, PSO, and RRT while maintaining feasibility and determinism. The 3D extension preserves speed. In both simulations and experiments, the combined global planner and local controllers reliably avoid moving obstacles and reach targets. Average planning time is 40 ms per frame, compatible with 25 fps imaging and real-time closed-loop control.

Conclusion: This framework advances autonomous microrobot navigation and targeted drug delivery within vascular environments by delivering fast, reliable, real-time planning for dynamic, obstacle-rich settings.

Abstract: Autonomous microrobots in blood vessels could enable minimally invasive
therapies, but navigation is challenged by dense, moving obstacles. We propose
a real-time path planning framework that couples an analytic geometry global
planner (AGP) with two reactive local escape controllers, one based on rules
and one based on reinforcement learning, to handle sudden moving obstacles.
Using real-time imaging, the system estimates the positions of the microrobot,
obstacles, and targets and computes collision-free motions. In simulation, AGP
yields shorter paths and faster planning than weighted A* (WA*), particle swarm
optimization (PSO), and rapidly exploring random trees (RRT), while maintaining
feasibility and determinism. We extend AGP from 2D to 3D without loss of speed.
In both simulations and experiments, the combined global planner and local
controllers reliably avoid moving obstacles and reach targets. The average
planning time is 40 ms per frame, compatible with 25 fps image acquisition and
real-time closed-loop control. These results advance autonomous microrobot
navigation and targeted drug delivery in vascular environments.

TL;DR: Reinforcement Learning with Adversarial Motion Priors enables natural-looking, stable locomotion for Cosmo, a quirky entertainment humanoid with extreme mass distribution and protective shells.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tackle the challenge of aesthetic-driven humanoid design by achieving natural movement and safe sim-to-real transfer for a robot with limited sensing and heavy head. Demonstrates viability of learning-based methods to balance form and function in entertainment robots.

Method: Apply Adversarial Motion Priors (AMP) to learn natural-looking locomotion; employ domain randomization tailored to Cosmo; design specialized reward structures to ensure safety and stability for sim-to-real deployment.

Result: AMP enables stable standing and walking despite Cosmo's unusual mass distribution and movement constraints, indicating effective adaptation to aesthetic-driven design constraints.

Conclusion: Learning-based approaches, particularly AMP with domain randomization, are promising for enabling natural, safe locomotion on aesthetically constrained humanoid robots and for broader entertainment-robot applications.

Abstract: We present a Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based locomotion system for Cosmo, a
custom-built humanoid robot designed for entertainment applications. Unlike
traditional humanoids, entertainment robots present unique challenges due to
aesthetic-driven design choices. Cosmo embodies these with a disproportionately
large head (16% of total mass), limited sensing, and protective shells that
considerably restrict movement. To address these challenges, we apply
Adversarial Motion Priors (AMP) to enable the robot to learn natural-looking
movements while maintaining physical stability. We develop tailored domain
randomization techniques and specialized reward structures to ensure safe
sim-to-real, protecting valuable hardware components during deployment. Our
experiments demonstrate that AMP generates stable standing and walking
behaviors despite Cosmo's extreme mass distribution and movement constraints.
These results establish a promising direction for robots that balance aesthetic
appeal with functional performance, suggesting that learning-based methods can
effectively adapt to aesthetic-driven design constraints.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Introduces a real-world glass dataset with 3D annotations and a monocular 3D glass detector, MonoGlass3D, that fuses contextual features and plane regression to exploit glass geometry for improved segmentation and depth estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Glass surfaces are highly challenging for vision systems due to transparency and reflectivity, and there is a lack of real-world, 3D-annotated datasets focused on glass objects. A dedicated dataset and method are needed to advance perception of transparent surfaces in diverse scenes.

Method: Create a dataset with precise 3D annotations of glass in real-world scenes. Propose MonoGlass3D, a monocular 3D glass detection model that uses an adaptive feature fusion module to capture contextual information under varying conditions, and a plane regression pipeline to leverage the planar geometry of glass surfaces, integrating geometric cues into the learning framework.

Result: The approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in glass segmentation and monocular glass depth estimation on the proposed dataset, demonstrating the effectiveness of combining geometric information with context-aware features.

Conclusion: Combining geometric properties with contextual cues improves transparent surface understanding; the dataset and MonoGlass3D offer a path forward for glass-aware perception in diverse environments.

Abstract: Detecting and localizing glass in 3D environments poses significant
challenges for visual perception systems, as the optical properties of glass
often hinder conventional sensors from accurately distinguishing glass
surfaces. The lack of real-world datasets focused on glass objects further
impedes progress in this field. To address this issue, we introduce a new
dataset featuring a wide range of glass configurations with precise 3D
annotations, collected from distinct real-world scenarios. On the basis of this
dataset, we propose MonoGlass3D, a novel approach tailored for monocular 3D
glass detection across diverse environments. To overcome the challenges posed
by the ambiguous appearance and context diversity of glass, we propose an
adaptive feature fusion module that empowers the network to effectively capture
contextual information in varying conditions. Additionally, to exploit the
distinct planar geometry of glass surfaces, we present a plane regression
pipeline, which enables seamless integration of geometric properties within our
framework. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms
state-of-the-art approaches in both glass segmentation and monocular glass
depth estimation. Our results highlight the advantages of combining geometric
and contextual cues for transparent surface understanding.

*Juho Kalliokoski,Evan G. Center,Steven M. LaValle,Timo Ojala,Basak Sakcak*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Shared control for telepresence navigation maintains efficiency comparable to control switching without reducing workload; further study needed to understand factors shaping user preference and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge that telepresence navigation is often inefficient or cognitively demanding, by exploring a shared-control approach that could blend autonomous navigation with user input to reduce workload.

Method: Two consecutive user studies (final sample n=20 in each) comparing a shared-control navigation method to a control-switching scheme (alternating between direct and automated control); metrics included navigation efficiency and subjective task load.

Result: Shared control did not degrade navigation efficiency and did not significantly reduce task load compared to control switching; results suggest no clear workload benefit under the tested conditions.

Conclusion: Further work is needed to uncover factors that influence user preference and performance in shared-control vs. switching control schemes, as well as to identify conditions where benefits may emerge.

Abstract: Telepresence robots enable users to interact with remote environments, but
efficient and intuitive navigation remains a challenge. In this work, we
developed and evaluated a shared control method, in which the robot navigates
autonomously while allowing users to affect the path generation to better suit
their needs. We compared this with control switching, where users toggle
between direct and automated control. We hypothesized that shared control would
maintain efficiency comparable to control switching while potentially reducing
user workload. The results of two consecutive user studies (each with final
sample of n=20) showed that shared control does not degrade navigation
efficiency, but did not show a significant reduction in task load compared to
control switching. Further research is needed to explore the underlying factors
that influence user preference and performance in these control systems.

### [287] [A*-PRM: A Dynamic Weight-Based Probabilistic Roadmap Algorithm](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05701)
*Siyuan Wang,Shuyi Zhang,Zhen Tian,Yuheng Yao,Gongsen Wang,Yu Zhao*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Hybrid A-star PRM combines the Manhattan-distance heuristic of A* with PRM sampling to guide connection choices, using hierarchical sampling and dynamic weights to improve path quality and computational efficiency. It yields substantial path-length reductions at baseline and maintains efficiency at higher sampling densities, outperforming existing hybrids in narrow or dynamic- obstacle scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Path planning is central to autonomous navigation and requires robustness to complex obstacle layouts. The authors seek to balance path quality and computation by embedding A* heuristics into PRM through dynamic weighting and adaptive sampling.

Method: Integrate Manhattan-distance guidance into PRM sampling (A-star PRM); employ dynamic weights, hierarchical sampling, and a dynamic connection mechanism to adapt to obstacle distributions and potentially moving obstacles.

Result: With 1000 vertices, average path length is 1073.23 ± 14.8 m, 42.3% shorter than standard PRM (p<0.01). At 3000 vertices, path length is 1036.61 m (0.94% improvement over 1046.42 m); computation time grows more slowly than PRM’s growth (about one-tenth of PRM’s increase). The method shows advantages in narrow channels and dynamic-obstacle scenarios and outperforms existing hybrid approaches in these settings.

Conclusion: A-star PRM delivers better path quality, greater stability, and improved computational efficiency relative to PRM and other hybrids, particularly in challenging environments with tight passages or moving obstacles.

Abstract: Robot path planning is a fundamental challenge in enhancing the environmental
adaptability of autonomous navigation systems. This paper presents a hybrid
path planning algorithm, A-star PRM, which incorporates dynamic weights. By
embedding the Manhattan distance heuristic of the A-star algorithm into the
random sampling process of PRM, the algorithm achieves a balanced optimization
of path quality and computational efficiency. The approach uses a hierarchical
sampling strategy and a dynamic connection mechanism, greatly improving
adaptability to complex obstacle distributions. Experiments show that under a
baseline configuration with one thousand sampled vertices, the path length of
A-star PRM is 1073.23 plus or minus 14.8 meters and is 42.3 percent shorter
than that of PRM with p value less than 0.01. With high-density sampling using
three thousand vertices, the path length is reduced by 0.94 percent, 1036.61
meters compared with 1046.42 meters, while the increase in computational time
is cut to about one tenth of the PRM increase, 71 percent compared with 785
percent. These results confirm the comprehensive advantages of A-star PRM in
path quality, stability, and computational efficiency. Compared with existing
hybrid algorithms, the proposed method shows clear benefits, especially in
narrow channels and scenarios with dynamic obstacles.

TL;DR: Super-LIO introduces OctVox, a compact octo-voxel map with eight subvoxels per voxel, and a heuristic KNN (HKNN) to accelerate LIO on resource-limited platforms, achieving about 73% faster frame processing than state-of-the-art with competitive accuracy, and is open-source.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LiDAR-Inertial Odometry on resource-constrained platforms suffers from high computational and memory demands; there is a need for efficient, robust LIO methods suitable for aerial and mobile robotic systems.

Method: Propose OctVox: a voxel map where each voxel contains eight fused subvoxels for strict point-density control and incremental denoising during map updates; HKNN: a heuristic-guided KNN to exploit spatial locality and speed up correspondence search; integrates into existing LIO pipelines; evaluated on multiple datasets and platforms.

Conclusion: Super-LIO provides a robust, efficient LIO solution for constrained hardware, suitable for aerial/mobile autonomous systems, featuring a compact, easily pluggable map structure and fast data association; available as open-source.

Abstract: LiDAR-Inertial Odometry (LIO) is a foundational technique for autonomous
systems, yet its deployment on resource-constrained platforms remains
challenging due to computational and memory limitations. We propose Super-LIO,
a robust LIO system that demands both high performance and accuracy, ideal for
applications such as aerial robots and mobile autonomous systems. At the core
of Super-LIO is a compact octo-voxel-based map structure, termed OctVox, that
limits each voxel to eight fused subvoxels, enabling strict point density
control and incremental denoising during map updates. This design enables a
simple yet efficient and accurate map structure, which can be easily integrated
into existing LIO frameworks. Additionally, Super-LIO designs a
heuristic-guided KNN strategy (HKNN) that accelerates the correspondence search
by leveraging spatial locality, further reducing runtime overhead. We evaluated
the proposed system using four publicly available datasets and several
self-collected datasets, totaling more than 30 sequences. Extensive testing on
both X86 and ARM platforms confirms that Super-LIO offers superior efficiency
and robustness, while maintaining competitive accuracy. Super-LIO processes
each frame approximately 73% faster than SOTA, while consuming less CPU
resources. The system is fully open-source and plug-and-play compatible with a
wide range of LiDAR sensors and platforms. The implementation is available at:

Motivation: To address realism and robust decision-making in driving simulations and fill the gap of a systematic cross-scenario review of game-based approaches.

Method: Literature survey categorizing by driving scenarios (highway obstacle avoidance, on-ramp merging, roundabouts, unsignalized intersections, autonomous racing), evaluating adaptations of standard game models and mechanisms, and synthesizing roadway features and performance implications.

Result: Findings indicate that game-based models often outperform traditional simulators in scenario-specific tasks; nonetheless, there are limitations and gaps; the survey provides a critical synthesis and anchors future research directions.

Conclusion: The field has progressed but lacks standard benchmarks and comprehensive cross-scenario comparisons; future work should focus on realism-robustness trade-offs, standardized evaluation, and better integration of game mechanics with learning-based decision-making.

Abstract: Game-based interactive driving simulations have emerged as versatile
platforms for advancing decision-making algorithms in road transport mobility.
While these environments offer safe, scalable, and engaging settings for
testing driving strategies, ensuring both realism and robust performance amid
dynamic and diverse scenarios remains a significant challenge. Recently, the
integration of game-based techniques with advanced learning frameworks has
enabled the development of adaptive decision-making models that effectively
manage the complexities inherent in varied driving conditions. These models
outperform traditional simulation methods, especially when addressing
scenario-specific challenges, ranging from obstacle avoidance on highways and
precise maneuvering during on-ramp merging to navigation in roundabouts,
unsignalized intersections, and even the high-speed demands of autonomous
racing. Despite numerous innovations in game-based interactive driving, a
systematic review comparing these approaches across different scenarios is
still missing. This survey provides a comprehensive evaluation of game-based
interactive driving methods by summarizing recent advancements and inherent
roadway features in each scenario. Furthermore, the reviewed algorithms are
critically assessed based on their adaptation of the standard game model and an
analysis of their specific mechanisms to understand their impact on
decision-making performance. Finally, the survey discusses the limitations of
current approaches and outlines promising directions for future research.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: An accurate spatiotemporal calibrator for event-based visual-inertial systems using a circle grid, featuring robust initialization and continuous-time batch optimization, built on eKalibr/eKalibr-Stereo with real-world validation and open-source release.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Event-based cameras offer high temporal resolution and dynamic range but require precise extrinsic and time-offset calibration with IMUs for reliable fusion in ego-motion estimation. Existing calibration tools are not tailored for event-based sensors; a circle-grid based approach within the eKalibr framework addresses this need.

Method: A two-stage approach: (1) robust initialization to accurately recover all estimator parameters, (2) continuous-time batch optimization to refine the initialized parameters. The method builds on eKalibr/eKalibr-Stereo grid-pattern recognition and tracking, adapting it for event-based data using a circle grid board, with real-world experiments for validation and an open-source release.

Result: Extensive real-world experiments demonstrate accurate event-based visual-inertial spatiotemporal calibration. The implementation is released open-source at GitHub, enabling the research community to adopt and extend the method.

Conclusion: eKalibr-Inertial provides an effective and practical solution for high-precision spatiotemporal calibration in event-based V-I systems, facilitating reliable fusion and downstream tasks in ego-motion estimation and perception.

Abstract: The bioinspired event camera, distinguished by its exceptional temporal
resolution, high dynamic range, and low power consumption, has been extensively
studied in recent years for motion estimation, robotic perception, and object
detection. In ego-motion estimation, the visual-inertial setup is commonly
adopted due to complementary characteristics between sensors (e.g., scale
perception and low drift). For optimal event-based visual-inertial fusion,
accurate spatiotemporal (extrinsic and temporal) calibration is required. In
this work, we present eKalibr-Inertial, an accurate spatiotemporal calibrator
for event-based visual-inertial systems, utilizing the widely used circle grid
board. Building upon the grid pattern recognition and tracking methods in
eKalibr and eKalibr-Stereo, the proposed method starts with a rigorous and
efficient initialization, where all parameters in the estimator would be
accurately recovered. Subsequently, a continuous-time-based batch optimization
is conducted to refine the initialized parameters toward better states. The
results of extensive real-world experiments show that eKalibr-Inertial can
achieve accurate event-based visual-inertial spatiotemporal calibration. The
implementation of eKalibr-Inertial is open-sourced at

*Yi Dong,Yangjun Liu,Jinjun Duan,Yang Li,Zhendong Dai*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A robotic framework for packing shoe pairs in arbitrary initial states using a semantic-keypoint perception module, state-aware reorientation primitives, and a packing task planner, validated in real-world experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Footwear packing is a representative paired-object packing task with irregular shapes and deformable objects. Existing methods struggle with variable initial states due to shoe shape, deformation, and packing poses, limiting robustness and efficiency in warehousing.

Method: 1) Semantic-keypoint based vision module that infers size, state, pose, and manipulation points from geometric features. 2) Primitive-based reorientation methods for various single deformable shoe states, plus a fast top-state reorientation using box-edge contact and gravity. 3) A task planner for shoe pair packing in any initial state to provide an optimal packing strategy.

Result: Real-world experiments demonstrate robustness of the reorientation methods and effectiveness of the packing strategy across different shoe types, highlighting the potential of semantic-keypoint representations and new reorientation perspectives for 3D deformable object manipulation and multi-object packing.

Conclusion: The study offers a complete robotic framework for paired object packing in variable initial states, emphasizing semantic-keypoint representations and reorientation strategies for deformable objects, and provides a reference for shoe-pair packing.

Abstract: With the rapid development of the warehousing and logistics industries, the
packing of goods has gradually attracted the attention of academia and
industry. The packing of footwear products is a typical representative
paired-item packing task involving irregular shapes and deformable objects.
Although studies on shoe packing have been conducted, different initial states
due to the irregular shapes of shoes and standard packing placement poses have
not been considered. This study proposes a robotic manipulation framework,
including a perception module, reorientation planners, and a packing planner,
that can complete the packing of pairs of shoes in any initial state. First, to
adapt to the large intraclass variations due to the state, shape, and
deformation of the shoe, we propose a vision module based on semantic
keypoints, which can also infer more information such as size, state, pose, and
manipulation points by combining geometric features. Subsequently, we not only
proposed primitive-based reorientation methods for different states of a single
deformable shoe but also proposed a fast reorientation method for the top state
using box edge contact and gravity, which further improved the efficiency of
reorientation. Finally, based on the perception module and reorientation
methods, we propose a task planner for shoe pair packing in any initial state
to provide an optimal packing strategy. Real-world experiments were conducted
to verify the robustness of the reorientation methods and the effectiveness of
the packing strategy for various types of shoes. In this study, we highlight
the potential of semantic keypoint representation methods, introduce new
perspectives on the reorientation of 3D deformable objects and multi-object
manipulation, and provide a reference for paired object packing.

*Faiza Babakano,Ahmed Fahmin,Bojie Shen,Muhammad Aamir Cheema,Isma Farah Siddiqui*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Proposes the Object-Pickup Minimum Energy Path Problem (OMEPP) for energy-efficient AMR routing with a pickup en route. Introduces a baseline Z*-based method and a scalable concurrent PCPD search using a Payload-Constrained Path Database (PCPD). Demonstrates near-optimal solutions with large speedups (1–2 orders of magnitude) over the baseline.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Outdoor AMRs face energy constraints, and payload changes from picking up objects significantly affect energy use. Prior energy-path methods ignore pickup actions or are computationally expensive when required to visit multiple pickup points. OMEPP addresses efficient routing under payload constraints for pickup-delivery tasks.

Method: Baseline: use Z*-style energy-efficient routing to iteratively visit each pickup point (optimal but computationally heavy). Proposed: concurrent PCPD search that runs multiple Z*-searches in parallel across all pickup locations. PCPD extends CPD by incorporating payload constraints to reduce branching and speed up search.

Result: Concurrent PCPD search substantially reduces branching and yields near-optimal routes. Real-world datasets show the approach is 1–2 orders of magnitude faster than the baseline, with only slight suboptimality.

Conclusion: A practical, scalable solution for energy-aware AMR routing with object pickup. The PCPD-based framework enables fast, near-optimal planning under payload constraints, making it suitable for real-time or large-scale deployments and potentially adaptable to other payload-aware routing problems.

Abstract: Autonomous Mobile Robots (AMRs) operate on battery power, making energy
efficiency a critical consideration, particularly in outdoor environments where
terrain variations affect energy consumption. While prior research has
primarily focused on computing energy-efficient paths from a source to a
destination, these approaches often overlook practical scenarios where a robot
needs to pick up an object en route - an action that can significantly impact
energy consumption due to changes in payload. This paper introduces the
Object-Pickup Minimum Energy Path Problem (OMEPP), which addresses
energy-efficient route planning for AMRs required to pick up an object from one
of many possible locations and deliver it to a destination. To address OMEPP,
we first introduce a baseline algorithm that employs the Z star algorithm, a
variant of A star tailored for energy-efficient routing, to iteratively visit
each pickup point. While this approach guarantees optimality, it suffers from
high computational cost due to repeated searches at each pickup location. To
mitigate this inefficiency, we propose a concurrent PCPD search that manages
multiple Z star searches simultaneously across all pickup points. Central to
our solution is the Payload-Constrained Path Database (PCPD), an extension of
the Compressed Path Database (CPD) that incorporates payload constraints. We
demonstrate that PCPD significantly reduces branching factors during search,
improving overall performance. Although the concurrent PCPD search may produce
slightly suboptimal solutions, extensive experiments on real-world datasets
show it achieves near-optimal performance while being one to two orders of
magnitude faster than the baseline algorithm.

*Runjiao Bao,Lin Zhang,Tianwei Niu,Haoyu Yuan,Shoukun Wang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: An extended Hybrid A* planner for 4WIS robots that searches in a 4D state space (x, y, heading, motion mode) using multi-modal Reeds-Shepp curves, a mode-switching aware heuristic, and a mode-aware terminal connection strategy to fuse multiple kinematic models into a single path, improving adaptability in complex environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 4WIS platforms offer multiple motion modalities (Ackermann, lateral, parallel) for enhanced maneuverability. Existing planners usually assume a single kinematic model and cannot exploit multi-modal capabilities, limiting performance in constrained environments.

Method: Extend Hybrid A* to a 4D state space including spatial coordinates and motion mode. Develop multi-modal Reeds-Shepp curves for each mode, incorporate a heuristic that accounts for mode-switching costs, and implement an intelligent terminal connection strategy with mode selection to enable smooth transitions between modes. Integrate multiple modalities into a single planned path.

Result: The planner demonstrates significantly improved planning performance for 4WIS robots in complex environments, indicating better feasibility and efficiency when leveraging multi-modal capabilities.

Conclusion: By fusing multiple motion modalities within a single planning framework, the approach enhances flexibility and adaptability of 4WIS navigation, enabling smoother transitions and more capable maneuvering in challenging environments.

Abstract: Four-wheel independent steering (4WIS) systems provide mobile robots with a
rich set of motion modes, such as Ackermann steering, lateral steering, and
parallel movement, offering superior maneuverability in constrained
environments. However, existing path planning methods generally assume a single
kinematic model and thus fail to fully exploit the multi-modal capabilities of
4WIS platforms. To address this limitation, we propose an extended Hybrid A*
framework that operates in a four-dimensional state space incorporating both
spatial states and motion modes. Within this framework, we design multi-modal
Reeds-Shepp curves tailored to the distinct kinematic constraints of each
motion mode, develop an enhanced heuristic function that accounts for
mode-switching costs, and introduce a terminal connection strategy with
intelligent mode selection to ensure smooth transitions between different
steering patterns. The proposed planner enables seamless integration of
multiple motion modalities within a single path, significantly improving
flexibility and adaptability in complex environments. Results demonstrate
significantly improved planning performance for 4WIS robots in complex
environments.

*Shiqi Xu,Lihao Zhang,Yuyang Du,Qun Yang,Soung Chang Liew*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A real-time robotic communications strategy that hybridizes TDMA and CSMA to guarantee deadline-sensitive command delivery while preserving throughput for non-critical traffic, showing large gains over CSMA baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CSMA-based robotic networks suffer collisions and latency under high traffic, jeopardizing deadline-constrained mission-critical commands and control-loop stability; a deterministic, compatible MAC solution is needed for heterogeneous robotic traffic.

Method: Introduce an IEEE 802.11-compatible hybrid TDMA/CSMA protocol with sub-microsecond PTP-based slot synchronization, a three-session superframe with dynamic TDMA allocation, and beacon-NAV protection; validate via real-time SDR emulation and ROS-based simulations.

Result: Missed-deadline errors reduced by 93% compared with CSMA; RMS trajectory error reduced by up to 90% in high-speed path-tracking simulations; throughput for non-critical traffic maintained within ±2%.

Conclusion: The hybrid TDMA/CSMA approach delivers collision-free, low-latency delivery for mission-critical robotic traffic while preserving 802.11 compatibility and throughput for non-critical traffic; suitable for heterogeneous, deadline-driven robotic networks.

Abstract: Recent progress in robotics has underscored the demand for real-time control
in applications such as manufacturing, healthcare, and autonomous systems,
where the timely delivery of mission-critical commands under heterogeneous
robotic traffic is paramount for operational efficacy and safety. In these
scenarios, mission-critical traffic follows a strict deadline-constrained
communication pattern: commands must arrive within defined QoS deadlines,
otherwise late arrivals can degrade performance or destabilize control loops.In
this work, we demonstrate on a real-time SDR platform that CSMA, widely adopted
in robotic communications,suffers severe degradation under high robot traffic
loads, with contention-induced collisions and delays disrupting the on-time
arrival of mission-critical packets. To address this problem, we propose an
IEEE 802.11-compatible hybrid TDMA/CSMA protocol that combines TDMA's
deterministic slot scheduling with CSMA's adaptability for heterogeneous robot
traffic.The protocol achieves collision-free, low-latency mission-critical
command delivery and IEEE 802.11 compatibility through the synergistic
integration of sub-microsecond PTP-based slot synchronization-essential for
establishing precise timing for TDMA, a three-session superframe with dynamic
TDMA allocation for structured and adaptable traffic management,and beacon-NAV
protection to preemptively secure these critical communication sessions from
interference. Emulation experiments on real-time SDR testbed and Robot
Operating System (ROS) simulation show that the proposed protocol reduces
missed-deadline errors by 93% compared to the CSMA baseline. In high-speed
robot path-tracking ROS simulations, the protocol lowers Root Mean Square (RMS)
trajectory error by up to 90% compared with a CSMA baseline, all while
maintaining throughput for non-critical traffic within +-2%.

*Yifei Ren,Edward Johns*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A single demonstration is expanded into an imagined 3D-augmented dataset using modern 3D generative models, enabling an omnidirectional policy that robustly handles diverse starting positions and outperforms baselines across grasping, opening drawers, and placing trash.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce the data burden in robotic policy learning by leveraging 3D generative priors to create diverse state distributions from minimal real data, enabling omnidirectional execution.

Method: Reconstruct/generate full 3D object shapes from few images to augment a dataset from one real demonstration, train an omnidirectional policy on this imagined dataset, and validate on real robots across tasks, comparing with baselines that use alternative data augmentation.

Result: The resulting omnidirectional policies can operate from initial states far from the demonstration, including the opposite side of the object, with fewer demonstrations and superior performance to recent baselines.

Conclusion: 3D generative priors are effective for data augmentation in robotic policy learning, enabling robust omnidirectional policies and reducing data requirements across multiple tasks.

Abstract: Recent 3D generative models, which are capable of generating full object
shapes from just a few images, now open up new opportunities in robotics. In
this work, we show that 3D generative models can be used to augment a dataset
from a single real-world demonstration, after which an omnidirectional policy
can be learned within this imagined dataset. We found that this enables a robot
to perform a task when initialised from states very far from those observed
during the demonstration, including starting from the opposite side of the
object relative to the real-world demonstration, significantly reducing the
number of demonstrations required for policy learning. Through several
real-world experiments across tasks such as grasping objects, opening a drawer,
and placing trash into a bin, we study these omnidirectional policies by
investigating the effect of various design choices on policy behaviour, and we
show superior performance to recent baselines which use alternative methods for
data augmentation.

*Jun Yamada,Adithyavairavan Murali,Ajay Mandlekar,Clemens Eppner,Ingmar Posner,Balakumar Sundaralingam*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Closed-loop 6-DoF vision-based grasping policy (Grasp-MPC) using MPC with a learned value function trained on 2M synthetic grasp trajectories, achieving robust, reactive grasping in cluttered environments and outperforming open-loop and multiple learning-based baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Open-loop grasping often fails due to prediction errors and object pose changes; existing closed-loop methods in simplified settings do not generalize well to cluttered, novel objects. A generalizable, reactive grasping policy for clutter is highly desirable.

Method: Grasp-MPC integrates a learned value function, trained on a large synthetic dataset of 2 million grasp trajectories including successes and failures, into a model predictive control framework with additional costs for collision avoidance and smooth execution. The approach is 6-DoF vision-based and evaluated on real and simulated clutter datasets (FetchBench).

Result: Grasp-MPC increases grasp success rates by up to 32.6% in simulation and 33.3% in noisy real-world conditions, outperforming open-loop, diffusion policy, transformer policy, and IQL baselines.

Conclusion: A robust, reactive, generalizable closed-loop grasping policy for novel objects in clutter is achievable using a learned value function within an MPC formulation, showing substantial improvements over several baseline policies.

Abstract: Grasping of diverse objects in unstructured environments remains a
significant challenge. Open-loop grasping methods, effective in controlled
settings, struggle in cluttered environments. Grasp prediction errors and
object pose changes during grasping are the main causes of failure. In
contrast, closed-loop methods address these challenges in simplified settings
(e.g., single object on a table) on a limited set of objects, with no path to
generalization. We propose Grasp-MPC, a closed-loop 6-DoF vision-based grasping
policy designed for robust and reactive grasping of novel objects in cluttered
environments. Grasp-MPC incorporates a value function, trained on visual
observations from a large-scale synthetic dataset of 2 million grasp
trajectories that include successful and failed attempts. We deploy this
learned value function in an MPC framework in combination with other cost terms
that encourage collision avoidance and smooth execution. We evaluate Grasp-MPC
on FetchBench and real-world settings across diverse environments. Grasp-MPC
improves grasp success rates by up to 32.6% in simulation and 33.3% in
real-world noisy conditions, outperforming open-loop, diffusion policy,
transformer policy, and IQL approaches. Videos and more at

*Tongxuan Tian,Xuhui Kang,Yen-Ling Kuo*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A one-shot 3D object-to-object affordance grounding framework (O3Afford) that fuses vision foundation-model features with 3D geometry and LLM reasoning to generalize to novel object pairs in robotic manipulation, outperforming baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Grounding affordances between object pairs is essential for manipulation but is underexplored, especially under limited data. Real-world interactions involve relationships between objects, requiring generalization to novel objects and integration of perception with reasoning.

Method: Propose a one-shot 3D object-to-object affordance learning approach (O3Afford). It leverages semantic features from vision foundation models and 3D point cloud geometry to learn robust affordance representations from limited data. The approach further integrates this 3D affordance representation with large language models to reason about object interactions and generate task-specific constraint functions for manipulation.

Result: Experiments on 3D object-to-object grounding and robotic manipulation show that O3Afford significantly outperforms existing baselines in accuracy and generalization to novel objects and categories.

Conclusion: The proposed framework bridges perception and action for object-to-object affordance grounding in 3D, enables effective learning from limited data, and enhances robotic manipulation through LLM-based reasoning about object interactions.

Abstract: Grounding object affordance is fundamental to robotic manipulation as it
establishes the critical link between perception and action among interacting
objects. However, prior works predominantly focus on predicting single-object
affordance, overlooking the fact that most real-world interactions involve
relationships between pairs of objects. In this work, we address the challenge
of object-to-object affordance grounding under limited data contraints.
Inspired by recent advances in few-shot learning with 2D vision foundation
models, we propose a novel one-shot 3D object-to-object affordance learning
approach for robotic manipulation. Semantic features from vision foundation
models combined with point cloud representation for geometric understanding
enable our one-shot learning pipeline to generalize effectively to novel
objects and categories. We further integrate our 3D affordance representation
with large language models (LLMs) for robotics manipulation, significantly
enhancing LLMs' capability to comprehend and reason about object interactions
when generating task-specific constraint functions. Our experiments on 3D
object-to-object affordance grounding and robotic manipulation demonstrate that
our O$^3$Afford significantly outperforms existing baselines in terms of both
accuracy and generalization capability.

### [299] [DCReg: Decoupled Characterization for Efficient Degenerate LiDAR Registration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06285)
*Xiangcheng Hu,Xieyuanli Chen,Mingkai Jia,Jin Wu,Ping Tan,Steven L. Waslander*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: DCReg presents a principled ill-conditioning-aware LiDAR registration framework that decouples rotation/translations via Schur complement, maps eigenspaces to physical motions, and uses a targeted preconditioner to stabilize ill-conditioned directions, achieving significant accuracy and speedups with PCG.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Registration in degenerate/narrow environments is ill-conditioned, leading to unstable solutions; current methods inadequately detect and mitigate degeneracy.

Method: 1) Schur decomposition of Hessian to separate rotational and translational subspaces; 2) quantitative mapping from eigenspaces to motion directions; 3) a selective preconditioner stabilizing only ill-conditioned directions within observable space, enabling fast Preconditioned Conjugate Gradient with a single interpretable parameter.

Result: Experiments show 20-50% localization accuracy improvement and 5-100x speedups over SOTA across diverse environments; code to be released.

Conclusion: DCReg provides a principled pipeline for detecting and mitigating ill-conditioning in LiDAR registration, improving robustness and efficiency by operating in decoupled subspaces and applying targeted preconditioning.

Abstract: LiDAR point cloud registration is fundamental to robotic perception and
navigation. However, in geometrically degenerate or narrow environments,
registration problems become ill-conditioned, leading to unstable solutions and
degraded accuracy. While existing approaches attempt to handle these issues,
they fail to address the core challenge: accurately detection, interpret, and
resolve this ill-conditioning, leading to missed detections or corrupted
solutions. In this study, we introduce DCReg, a principled framework that
systematically addresses the ill-conditioned registration problems through
three integrated innovations. First, DCReg achieves reliable ill-conditioning
detection by employing a Schur complement decomposition to the hessian matrix.
This technique decouples the registration problem into clean rotational and
translational subspaces, eliminating coupling effects that mask degeneracy
patterns in conventional analyses. Second, within these cleanly subspaces, we
develop quantitative characterization techniques that establish explicit
mappings between mathematical eigenspaces and physical motion directions,
providing actionable insights about which specific motions lack constraints.
Finally, leveraging this clean subspace, we design a targeted mitigation
strategy: a novel preconditioner that selectively stabilizes only the
identified ill-conditioned directions while preserving all well-constrained
information in observable space. This enables efficient and robust optimization
via the Preconditioned Conjugate Gradient method with a single physical
interpretable parameter. Extensive experiments demonstrate DCReg achieves at
least 20% - 50% improvement in localization accuracy and 5-100 times speedup
over state-of-the-art methods across diverse environments. Our implementation
will be available at https://github.com/JokerJohn/DCReg.

*Francisco Affonso,Felipe Andrade G. Tommaselli,Juliano Negri,Vivian S. Medeiros,Mateus V. Gasparino,Girish Chowdhary,Marcelo Becker*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A model-based RL approach adds short-horizon synthetic data (Dyna-style) to PPO rollouts to boost sample efficiency in quadrupedal locomotion; a predictive model is trained alongside the policy to generate synthetic transitions, with a scheduling strategy that gradually integrates them based on policy updates. Ablation reveals rollout length strongly affects efficiency. In simulation (Unitree Go1), replacing part of simulated steps with synthetic data improves returns, reduces variance, and enhances the ability to track diverse locomotion commands with fewer simulated steps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional RL-based locomotion controllers are data-inefficient, requiring extensive interaction to achieve robust performance. The study aims to improve sample efficiency for quadrupedal locomotion.

Method: Train a predictive model in parallel with the policy to generate short-horizon synthetic transitions. Append synthetic data to the end of standard rollouts in PPO-based controllers, following a Dyna-style paradigm. Use a scheduling strategy based on policy update iterations to integrate synthetic data. Conduct an ablation study to examine the impact of rollout length. Validate in simulation on the Unitree Go1 robot, showing that partial replacement of simulated steps with synthetic ones mimics longer rollouts and improves policy return and reduces variance. Demonstrate transfer to tracking a wide range of locomotion commands with fewer simulated steps.

Result: Synthetic data augmentation improves policy performance and stability: higher returns, lower variance, and better adaptability to diverse commands using fewer simulated steps. The synthetic data effectively extends effective rollouts.

Conclusion: MDLR with Dyna-style synthetic data enhances sample efficiency and robustness for quadrupedal locomotion and transfers to varying locomotion commands; scheduling of synthetic data based on update iterations is key to performance gains.

Abstract: Traditional RL-based locomotion controllers often suffer from low data
efficiency, requiring extensive interaction to achieve robust performance. We
present a model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) framework that improves
sample efficiency for quadrupedal locomotion by appending synthetic data to the
end of standard rollouts in PPO-based controllers, following the Dyna-Style
paradigm. A predictive model, trained alongside the policy, generates
short-horizon synthetic transitions that are gradually integrated using a
scheduling strategy based on the policy update iterations. Through an ablation
study, we identified a strong correlation between sample efficiency and rollout
length, which guided the design of our experiments. We validated our approach
in simulation on the Unitree Go1 robot and showed that replacing part of the
simulated steps with synthetic ones not only mimics extended rollouts but also
improves policy return and reduces variance. Finally, we demonstrate that this
improvement transfers to the ability to track a wide range of locomotion
commands using fewer simulated steps.

*Filip Bjelonic,Fabian Tischhauser,Marco Hutter*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A sim-to-real RL framework for legged robots that uses a physics-grounded energy model for permanent-magnet synchronous motors, enabling transferable, energy-efficient policies with minimal parameter tuning and no dynamic-parameter randomization; reports 32% COD reduction on ANYmal and broad hardware validation; code, models, and datasets forthcoming.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Legged robots require both robust locomotion and energy efficiency in real-world environments. Sim-to-real transfer is difficult, and many methods rely on hand-tuned rewards or neglect actuator-specific energy losses, limiting efficiency and transfer reliability.

Method: Integrates sim-to-real reinforcement learning with a first-principles energy model for PM motors. Uses a compact parameter set to capture the sim-to-real gap and a four-term reward designed around a principled energetic loss formulation that balances electrical and mechanical dissipation. Validation includes a bottom-up dynamic parameter identification study and experiments across actuators, full-robot in-air trajectories, and on-ground locomotion. Demonstrated on three primary platforms and deployed on ten additional robots withoutrandomizing dynamic parameters.

Result: Achieves reliable policy transfer and improved energetic efficiency, including a 32% reduction in full Cost of Transport on ANYmal (CoT = 1.27). Demonstrations spanned actuator-scale dynamics to real-world locomotion.

Conclusion: The framework provides transferable, energy-aware policies for legged robots with a lightweight, physics-based energy model and minimal parameter complexity. It shows strong generalization across platforms and handles actuator losses more faithfully than prior approaches; the authors plan to release code, models, and datasets.

Abstract: Legged robots must achieve both robust locomotion and energy efficiency to be
practical in real-world environments. Yet controllers trained in simulation
often fail to transfer reliably, and most existing approaches neglect
actuator-specific energy losses or depend on complex, hand-tuned reward
formulations. We propose a framework that integrates sim-to-real reinforcement
learning with a physics-grounded energy model for permanent magnet synchronous
motors. The framework requires a minimal parameter set to capture the
simulation-to-reality gap and employs a compact four-term reward with a
first-principle-based energetic loss formulation that balances electrical and
mechanical dissipation. We evaluate and validate the approach through a
bottom-up dynamic parameter identification study, spanning actuators,
full-robot in-air trajectories and on-ground locomotion. The framework is
tested on three primary platforms and deployed on ten additional robots,
demonstrating reliable policy transfer without randomization of dynamic
parameters. Our method improves energetic efficiency over state-of-the-art
methods, achieving a 32 percent reduction in the full Cost of Transport of
ANYmal (value 1.27). All code, models, and datasets will be released.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: ERPF-MPC dynamically updates risk assessments via Evolution Factor and Risk-Ellipse to create an adaptive, collision-avoiding control for autonomous driving; outperforms static risk fields and traditional methods in experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods either conservative or data-hungry; need adaptive, interpretable, and efficient risk models for interactive driving.

Method: Introduce Risk-Ellipse that fuses longitudinal reach and lateral uncertainty; Evolution Factor via sigmoid of TTC and TWH; integrate into MPC; dynamic adaptation in real-time.

Result: ERPF-MPC yields smoother trajectories, higher average speeds, collision-free navigation in complex interactive scenarios; robust performance across conditions.

Conclusion: ERPF-MPC is a robust, adaptive framework for safe and efficient autonomous driving in uncertain, interactive environments, balancing safety with performance.

Abstract: In recent years, ensuring safety, efficiency, and comfort in interactive
autonomous driving has become a critical challenge. Traditional model-based
techniques, such as game-theoretic methods and robust control, are often overly
conservative or computationally intensive. Conversely, learning-based
approaches typically require extensive training data and frequently exhibit
limited interpretability and generalizability. Simpler strategies, such as Risk
Potential Fields (RPF), provide lightweight alternatives with minimal data
demands but are inherently static and struggle to adapt effectively to dynamic
traffic conditions. To overcome these limitations, we propose the Evolutionary
Risk Potential Field (ERPF), a novel approach that dynamically updates risk
assessments in dynamical scenarios based on historical obstacle proximity data.
We introduce a Risk-Ellipse construct that combines longitudinal reach and
lateral uncertainty into a unified spatial temporal collision envelope.
Additionally, we define an adaptive Evolution Factor metric, computed through
sigmoid normalization of Time to Collision (TTC) and Time-Window-of-Hazard
(TWH), which dynamically adjusts the dimensions of the ellipse axes in real
time. This adaptive risk metric is integrated seamlessly into a Model
Predictive Control (MPC) framework, enabling autonomous vehicles to proactively
address complex interactive driving scenarios in terms of uncertain driving of
surrounding vehicles. Comprehensive comparative experiments demonstrate that
our ERPF-MPC approach consistently achieves smoother trajectories, higher
average speeds, and collision-free navigation, offering a robust and adaptive
solution suitable for complex interactive driving environments.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: BAN-MPC enables fast, safe embedded MPC by integrating barrier-based collision avoidance and a neural value function with parameter-sensitivity adaptation. It achieves ~200x speed-up and robust collision-free navigation on Jetson Nano.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MPC guarantees safety via constraints but is often too slow for real-time embedded platforms. There is a need for an approach that preserves MPC safety while significantly reducing online computation and adapting to parameter changes without retraining.

Method: Replace Euclidean distance with Control Barrier Functions for collision avoidance; integrate an offline-learned neural value function into the short-horizon MPC objective; train a second neural network to learn the value function's sensitivity to system parameters and adapt online when parameters change without retraining.

Result: Hardware-in-the-loop experiments on Jetson Nano show BAN-MPC solving ~200x faster than traditional MPC, enabling collision-free navigation with control error below 5% under model parameter variations up to 15%.

Conclusion: BAN-MPC is an effective embedded MPC alternative that combines neural speed with MPC safety guarantees, reduces offline computation, and robustly adapts to parameter changes without retraining.

Abstract: While Model Predictive Control (MPC) enforces safety via constraints, its
real-time execution can exceed embedded compute budgets. We propose a
Barrier-integrated Adaptive Neural Model Predictive Control (BAN-MPC) framework
that synergizes neural networks' fast computation with MPC's
constraint-handling capability. To ensure strict safety, we replace traditional
Euclidean distance with Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) for collision
avoidance. We integrate an offline-learned neural value function into the
optimization objective of a Short-horizon MPC, substantially reducing online
computational complexity. Additionally, we use a second neural network to learn
the sensitivity of the value function to system parameters, and adaptively
adjust the neural value function based on this neural sensitivity when model
parameters change, eliminating the need for retraining and reducing offline
computation costs. The hardware in-the-loop (HIL) experiments on Jetson Nano
show that BAN-MPC solves 200 times faster than traditional MPC, enabling
collision-free navigation with control error below 5\% under model parameter
variations within 15\%, making it an effective embedded MPC alternative.

TL;DR: GPU-accelerated Gaussian splatting SLAM integrated with online map-based teleoperation yields photorealistic, real-time 3D maps that boost decision speed and teleoperation efficiency in unknown environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Unknown environments hinder teleoperator situational understanding; real-time, accurate 3D mapping is computationally expensive, limiting performance.

Method: Develop modular GPU-based integration combining Gaussian splatting SLAM advances with existing online map-based teleoperation systems; validate via real-world aerial-vehicle experiments and comparisons to state-of-the-art.

Result: Significant improvements in decision-making speed and more accurate interaction with the environment; higher teleoperation efficiency; photorealistic mapping generated in real-time.

Conclusion: The integration enhances remote teleoperation in unfamiliar environments by blending high-fidelity mapping with real-time capability, enabling more effective exploration and control.

Abstract: Achieving efficient remote teleoperation is particularly challenging in
unknown environments, as the teleoperator must rapidly build an understanding
of the site's layout. Online 3D mapping is a proven strategy to tackle this
challenge, as it enables the teleoperator to progressively explore the site
from multiple perspectives. However, traditional online map-based teleoperation
systems struggle to generate visually accurate 3D maps in real-time due to the
high computational cost involved, leading to poor teleoperation performances.
In this work, we propose a solution to improve teleoperation efficiency in
unknown environments. Our approach proposes a novel, modular and efficient
GPU-based integration between recent advancement in gaussian splatting SLAM and
existing online map-based teleoperation systems. We compare the proposed
solution against state-of-the-art teleoperation systems and validate its
performances through real-world experiments using an aerial vehicle. The
results show significant improvements in decision-making speed and more
accurate interaction with the environment, leading to greater teleoperation
efficiency. In doing so, our system enhances remote teleoperation by seamlessly
integrating photorealistic mapping generation with real-time performances,
enabling effective teleoperation in unfamiliar environments.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Shaping granular media is challenging due to high-dimensional configuration space and complex dynamics; classical rule-based methods require heavy engineering. RL offers adaptive manipulation strategies learned from interaction.

Method: Develop an RL framework where a robotic arm with a cubic end-effector and a stereo camera learns to shape granular media into target structures. Emphasize compact observations and concise reward formulations. Include ablation studies to validate design choices. Train visual policies and test both in simulation and real-world deployment, comparing against two baseline approaches.

Result: The proposed framework effectively trains visual policies for manipulating granular media and achieves successful real-world deployment, outperforming two baseline methods.

Conclusion: Compact observation and reward design are key to enabling RL in high-dimensional granular manipulation tasks; the approach demonstrates practical viability and potential for broader applications, though further work is needed on generalization and sample efficiency.

Abstract: Autonomous manipulation of granular media, such as sand, is crucial for
applications in construction, excavation, and additive manufacturing. However,
shaping granular materials presents unique challenges due to their
high-dimensional configuration space and complex dynamics, where traditional
rule-based approaches struggle without extensive engineering efforts.
Reinforcement learning (RL) offers a promising alternative by enabling agents
to learn adaptive manipulation strategies through trial and error. In this
work, we present an RL framework that enables a robotic arm with a cubic
end-effector and a stereo camera to shape granular media into desired target
structures. We show the importance of compact observations and concise reward
formulations for the large configuration space, validating our design choices
with an ablation study. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of the
proposed approach for the training of visual policies that manipulate granular
media including their real-world deployment, outperforming two baseline
approaches.

TL;DR: Proposes ED-CBBA, an event-driven communication extension to the CBBA framework for multi-robot task allocation, achieving up to 52% fewer messages while preserving convergence and solution quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CBBA's performance hinges on continuous communication, which can cause congestion and packet loss in limited-range, multi-robot networks. The work aims to reduce communications without sacrificing task allocation guarantees.

Method: Introduce an event-driven communication mechanism within CBBA (ED-CBBA), prove theoretically that the solution quality remains on par with CBBA and validate via Monte-Carlo simulations across various numbers of targets, agents, and bundles.

Result: The ED-CBBA protocol reduces message transmissions by up to 52% while maintaining convergence guarantees and comparable solution quality to CBBA across tested scenarios.

Conclusion: Event-driven communication in CBBA can substantially cut communications without sacrificing performance, making decentralized multi-robot task allocation more robust to communication constraints.

Abstract: In various scenarios such as multi-drone surveillance and search-and-rescue
operations, deploying multiple robots is essential to accomplish multiple tasks
at once. Due to the limited communication range of these vehicles, a
decentralised task allocation algorithm is crucial for effective task
distribution among robots. The consensus-based bundle algorithm (CBBA) has been
promising for multi-robot operation, offering theoretical guarantees. However,
CBBA demands continuous communication, leading to potential congestion and
packet loss that can hinder performance. In this study, we introduce an
event-driven communication mechanism designed to address these communication
challenges while maintaining the convergence and performance bounds of CBBA. We
demonstrate theoretically that the solution quality matches that of CBBA and
validate the approach with Monte-Carlo simulations across varying targets,
agents, and bundles. Results indicate that the proposed algorithm (ED-CBBA) can
reduce message transmissions by up to 52%.

### [307] [Co-Located VR with Hybrid SLAM-based HMD Tracking and Motion Capture Synchronization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06582)
*Carlos A. Pinheiro de Sousa,Niklas Gröne,Mathias Günther,Oliver Deussen*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A hybrid VR co-location framework blending motion capture with inside-out SLAM to maintain real-time, drift-corrected spatial alignment across multiple users, with real-time pose sharing and improved robustness over prior methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Co-located multi-user VR requires accurate, low-latency spatial alignment across devices. External tracking can add latency/jitter; one-time calibration can't handle drift. A scalable solution that combines responsiveness of local SLAM with external realignment.

Method: Integrates motion capture with SLAM-based inside-out tracking; real-time pose sharing across devices; supports external realignments when needed; aims for high framerate, low latency; evaluates spatial accuracy and comfort.

Result: Demonstrates sufficient spatial accuracy for natural multi-user interaction; improved comfort, scalability, and robustness over existing co-located VR solutions; real-time pose sharing maintains alignment across devices; better drift handling than one-time calibration.

Conclusion: The framework offers an effective balance between responsiveness and drift correction for multi-user co-located VR, enabling robust, scalable, and comfortable shared virtual experiences.

Abstract: We introduce a multi-user VR co-location framework that synchronizes users
within a shared virtual environment aligned to physical space. Our approach
combines a motion capture system with SLAM-based inside-out tracking to deliver
smooth, high-framerate, low-latency performance. Previous methods either rely
on continuous external tracking, which introduces latency and jitter, or on
one-time calibration, which cannot correct drift over time. In contrast, our
approach combines the responsiveness of local HMD SLAM tracking with the
flexibility to realign to an external source when needed. It also supports
real-time pose sharing across devices, ensuring consistent spatial alignment
and engagement between users. Our evaluation demonstrates that our framework
achieves the spatial accuracy required for natural multi-user interaction while
offering improved comfort, scalability, and robustness over existing co-located
VR solutions.

*Meher V. R. Malladi,Tiziano Guadagnino,Luca Lobefaro,Cyrill Stachniss*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Sensor-agnostic LiDAR–IMU odometry using direct scan-to-map registration with a regularized LiDAR registration and a simplified IMU model; robust across diverse sensors and platforms and released as open-source.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate odometry is essential for navigation; existing sensor fusion methods rely on sensor-specific models or feature extraction and may not generalize across domains (urban LiDARs to handheld packages). A robust, sensor-agnostic approach enables deployment in varied environments without per-sensor tuning.

Method: Direct LiDAR scan-to-map registration with a simplified IMU integration model, avoiding sensor-specific LiDAR modeling and Kalman/filter-based fusion. Introduces a novel regularization term on LiDAR registration to improve robustness. Validates across multiple datasets using the same configuration, and open-sources the implementation.

Result: Demonstrates robustness and cross-domain applicability: the system works with the same configuration across different sensor types and platforms, achieving improved or competitive odometry performance without sensor-specific tuning.

Conclusion: A robust, sensor-agnostic LiDAR–IMU odometry framework that relies on scan-to-map registration with regularization and a simplified IMU model, showing strong generalization across domains and ready for integration into navigation stacks; released as open source.

Abstract: Accurate odometry is a critical component in a robotic navigation stack, and
subsequent modules such as planning and control often rely on an estimate of
the robot's motion. Sensor-based odometry approaches should be robust across
sensor types and deployable in different target domains, from solid-state
LiDARs mounted on cars in urban-driving scenarios to spinning LiDARs on
handheld packages used in unstructured natural environments. In this paper, we
propose a robust LiDAR-inertial odometry system that does not rely on
sensor-specific modeling. Sensor fusion techniques for LiDAR and inertial
measurement unit (IMU) data typically integrate IMU data iteratively in a
Kalman filter or use pre-integration in a factor graph framework, combined with
LiDAR scan matching often exploiting some form of feature extraction. We
propose an alternative strategy that only requires a simplified motion model
for IMU integration and directly registers LiDAR scans in a scan-to-map
approach. Our approach allows us to impose a novel regularization on the LiDAR
registration, improving the overall odometry performance. We detail extensive
experiments on a number of datasets covering a wide array of commonly used
robotic sensors and platforms. We show that our approach works with the exact
same configuration in all these scenarios, demonstrating its robustness. We
have open-sourced our implementation so that the community can build further on
our work and use it in their navigation stacks.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A multi-modal HRI safety dataset (LiHRA) with 3D LiDAR, human keypoints, and robot state for six scenarios, enabling learning-based and classical risk monitoring for human-robot collaboration; includes safe/hazardous variants and a baseline RM method.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of realistic, high-quality, multi-modal HRI datasets that capture potentially dangerous interactions, enabling development of real-time risk monitoring and adaptive safety in collaborative robots.

Method: Collected 4,431 labeled point clouds at 10 Hz across six HRI scenarios; captured 3D LiDAR, human pose keypoints, and robot joint states; provided safe and hazardous versions; demonstrated a risk-monitoring method using contextual info and robot dynamics.

Result: LiHRA delivers a comprehensive multi-modal dataset and a baseline RM method that quantifies risk over time; shows feasibility of training RM algorithms for HRI with real-time potential.

Conclusion: LiHRA provides foundational data and a demonstrator method to advance real-time RM and adaptive safety strategies in human-robot workspaces, supporting both AI-driven and classical approaches.

Abstract: We present LiHRA, a novel dataset designed to facilitate the development of
automated, learning-based, or classical risk monitoring (RM) methods for
Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) scenarios. The growing prevalence of
collaborative robots in industrial environments has increased the need for
reliable safety systems. However, the lack of high-quality datasets that
capture realistic human-robot interactions, including potentially dangerous
events, slows development. LiHRA addresses this challenge by providing a
comprehensive, multi-modal dataset combining 3D LiDAR point clouds, human body
keypoints, and robot joint states, capturing the complete spatial and dynamic
context of human-robot collaboration. This combination of modalities allows for
precise tracking of human movement, robot actions, and environmental
conditions, enabling accurate RM during collaborative tasks. The LiHRA dataset
covers six representative HRI scenarios involving collaborative and coexistent
tasks, object handovers, and surface polishing, with safe and hazardous
versions of each scenario. In total, the data set includes 4,431 labeled point
clouds recorded at 10 Hz, providing a rich resource for training and
benchmarking classical and AI-driven RM algorithms. Finally, to demonstrate
LiHRA's utility, we introduce an RM method that quantifies the risk level in
each scenario over time. This method leverages contextual information,
including robot states and the dynamic model of the robot. With its combination
of high-resolution LiDAR data, precise human tracking, robot state data, and
realistic collision events, LiHRA offers an essential foundation for future
research into real-time RM and adaptive safety strategies in human-robot
workspaces.

*Xiaobei Zhao,Xingqi Lyu,Xiang Li*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A Translator module (T-araVLN) refines natural language instructions to improve agricultural VLN navigation, achieving state-of-the-art results on A2A: SR 0.63 (from 0.47) and NE 2.28m (from 2.91m).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Agricultural robotic agents rely on natural language navigation but struggle with complex instructions; bridging the gap with an instruction translator can enhance navigation accuracy and efficiency in the agricultural domain.

Method: Introduce T-araVLN with an Instruction Translator module that refines and clarifies original instructions before feeding them to a vision-and-language navigation model; evaluated on the A2A agricultural benchmark.

Result: SR improved from 0.47 to 0.63; NE reduced from 2.91m to 2.28m; achieves state-of-the-art performance for agricultural VLN; code available at provided GitHub link.

Conclusion: Instruction translation effectively enhances VLN performance in agriculture, suggesting that refining natural language before perception-action decision can generalize to domain-specific navigation tasks.

Abstract: Agricultural robotic agents have been becoming powerful helpers in a wide
range of agricultural tasks, nevertheless, still heavily rely on manual
operation or untransportable railway for movement. The AgriVLN method and the
A2A benchmark pioneeringly extend Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) to the
agricultural domain, enabling agents navigate to the target position following
the natural language instructions. AgriVLN effectively understands the simple
instructions, however, often misunderstands the complicated instructions. To
bridge this gap, we propose the method of Translator for Agricultural Robotic
Agents on Vision-and-Language Navigation (T-araVLN), in which the Instruction
Translator module translates the original instruction to be both refined and
precise. Being evaluated on the A2A benchmark, our T-araVLN effectively
improves SR from 0.47 to 0.63 and reduces NE from 2.91m to 2.28m, demonstrating
the state-of-the-art performance in the agricultural domain. Code:

*Sajad Ahmadi,Mohammadreza Davoodi,Javad Mohammadpour Velni*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Adaptive coverage control for a fleet of off-road UGVs using UAV-assisted real-time path planning on a dynamic weighted directed graph with Voronoi partitioning; simulation shows improved path planning, lower traversal costs, and robust coverage amidst dynamic obstacles and muddy terrain.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional coverage control assumes static conditions, which fail in real-world farming where moving machinery and uneven, muddy terrain create ongoing challenges. There is a need for real-time adaptability to maintain coverage.

Method: Proposes an adaptive coverage control framework where UAVs detect obstacles and assess terrain to update a dynamic weighted directed graph. The graph uses Voronoi-based partitioning, adaptive edge weights tied to UAV observations, and cost-based path optimization to guide UGV coverage paths.

Result: Simulation results demonstrate improved path planning, reduced traversal costs, and robust coverage in the presence of dynamic obstacles and muddy terrains.

Conclusion: The framework enables effective adaptive coverage for UGV fleets in dynamic agricultural environments by leveraging UAV-perception and graph-based planning to enhance navigation efficiency.

Abstract: This paper presents an adaptive coverage control method for a fleet of
off-road and Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGVs) operating in dynamic
(time-varying) agricultural environments. Traditional coverage control
approaches often assume static conditions, making them unsuitable for
real-world farming scenarios where obstacles, such as moving machinery and
uneven terrains, create continuous challenges. To address this, we propose a
real-time path planning framework that integrates Unmanned Aerial Vehicles
(UAVs) for obstacle detection and terrain assessment, allowing UGVs to
dynamically adjust their coverage paths. The environment is modeled as a
weighted directed graph, where the edge weights are continuously updated based
on the UAV observations to reflect obstacle motion and terrain variations. The
proposed approach incorporates Voronoi-based partitioning, adaptive edge weight
assignment, and cost-based path optimization to enhance navigation efficiency.
Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in
improving path planning, reducing traversal costs, and maintaining robust
coverage in the presence of dynamic obstacles and muddy terrains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need for safe, reliable autonomous surface vessels in narrow, high-density waterways where hydrodynamic disturbances and confined boundaries challenge existing planners.

Method: Apply Robust Model Predictive Control with Control Barrier Functions encoding channel borders and obstacles as safety constraints to guarantee collision avoidance while maintaining robust performance.

Result: Simulation experiments demonstrate successful safe navigation under realistic disturbances, with enhanced safety and adaptability relative to current methods.

Conclusion: The RMPC-CBF framework is effective for safe autonomous navigation in complex waterways and may enable practical deployment, though real-world validation is needed.

Abstract: Deploying self-navigating surface vessels in inland waterways offers a
sustainable alternative to reduce road traffic congestion and emissions.
However, navigating confined waterways presents unique challenges, including
narrow channels, higher traffic density, and hydrodynamic disturbances.
Existing methods for autonomous vessel navigation often lack the robustness or
precision required for such environments. This paper presents a new motion
planning approach for Automated Surface Vessels (ASVs) using Robust Model
Predictive Control (RMPC) combined with Control Barrier Functions (CBFs). By
incorporating channel borders and obstacles as safety constraints within the
control design framework, the proposed method ensures both collision avoidance
and robust navigation on complex waterways. Simulation results demonstrate the
efficacy of the proposed method in safely guiding ASVs under realistic
conditions, highlighting its improved safety and adaptability compared to the
state-of-the-art.

The proposed system enables robots to perceive, interpret, report, and if
possible respond to urban and environmental anomalies through proactive

TL;DR: CRISP is a lightweight ROS2-compliant compliant Cartesian and joint-space controller suite in C++, with Python and Gymnasium interfaces to enable data collection and learning-policy deployment on manipulators (e.g., FR3, IIWA14, Gen3).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Learning-based controllers often cause low-frequency or discontinuous state changes. A low-level, torque-based controller is needed to achieve smooth reference tracking and compliant behavior during contact, and a unified pipeline is needed to integrate high-level policies with ROS2 manipulators.

Method: CRISP implements compliant Cartesian and joint-space controllers as a lightweight C++ ROS2 control package. It interfaces with the joint-torque interface, provides Python and Gymnasium APIs for data logging and policy deployment, and is designed for real-time performance and rapid integration with hardware and simulation (FR3, IIWA14, Gen3).

Result: Hardware validation on Franka FR3 and simulation validation on Kuka IIWA14 and Kinova Gen3, showing real-time performance and seamless interaction with learning-based policies and teleoperation workflows; demonstrates a unified pipeline for data collection and policy execution.

Conclusion: CRISP lowers barriers to applying learning-based methods on ROS2-compatible manipulators by delivering a ready-to-use, real-time, compliant torque-control solution with easy data collection and policy deployment, backed by documentation and hardware/simulation validation.

Abstract: Learning-based controllers, such as diffusion policies and vision-language
action models, often generate low-frequency or discontinuous robot state
changes. Achieving smooth reference tracking requires a low-level controller
that converts high-level targets commands into joint torques, enabling
compliant behavior during contact interactions. We present CRISP, a lightweight
C++ implementation of compliant Cartesian and joint-space controllers for the
ROS2 control standard, designed for seamless integration with high-level
learning-based policies as well as teleoperation. The controllers are
compatible with any manipulator that exposes a joint-torque interface. Through
our Python and Gymnasium interfaces, CRISP provides a unified pipeline for
recording data from hardware and simulation and deploying high-level
learning-based policies seamlessly, facilitating rapid experimentation. The
system has been validated on hardware with the Franka Robotics FR3 and in
simulation with the Kuka IIWA14 and Kinova Gen3. Designed for rapid
integration, flexible deployment, and real-time performance, our implementation
provides a unified pipeline for data collection and policy execution, lowering

TL;DR: Physics-informed online learning-based control for an over-actuated MicroASV using a weak-form approach to adapt the dynamics model in real time, improving trajectory tracking under disturbances in simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Precise, robust control of micro-scale surface vehicles is hard due to nonlinear hydrodynamics and strong sensitivity to self-motion and environmental disturbances; real-time adaptivity is needed for reliable operations.

Method: A physics-driven (physics-based) over-actuated MicroASV dynamics model is augmented with a data-driven online learning module that uses a weak formulation to update the model in real time; the adaptive model feeds an optimal control framework for trajectory tracking.

Result: Simulation results show substantially improved trajectory tracking accuracy and robustness, including under unknown payloads and external disturbances.

Conclusion: Data-driven online learning-based optimal control can enhance MicroASV performance, enabling more reliable and precise autonomous surface vehicle operations in challenging environments.

Abstract: Micro Autonomous Surface Vehicles (MicroASVs) offer significant potential for
operations in confined or shallow waters and swarm robotics applications.
However, achieving precise and robust control at such small scales remains
highly challenging, mainly due to the complexity of modeling nonlinear
hydrodynamic forces and the increased sensitivity to self-motion effects and
environmental disturbances, including waves and boundary effects in confined
spaces. This paper presents a physics-driven dynamics model for an
over-actuated MicroASV and introduces a data-driven optimal control framework
that leverages a weak formulation-based online model learning method. Our
approach continuously refines the physics-driven model in real time, enabling
adaptive control that adjusts to changing system parameters. Simulation results
demonstrate that the proposed method substantially enhances trajectory tracking
accuracy and robustness, even under unknown payloads and external disturbances.
These findings highlight the potential of data-driven online learning-based
optimal control to improve MicroASV performance, paving the way for more
reliable and precise autonomous surface vehicle operations.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: First Vision-Language-Diffusion-Action (LLaDA-VLA) model for robotic manipulation built on pretrained diffusion-based VLMs; introduces two design strategies to adapt diffusion models to robotics; achieves SOTA results in both simulation and real robots.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bridge diffusion-based vision-language models with robotic manipulation by enabling effective policy learning in the VLA setting and addressing adaptation challenges when applying d-VLMs to robotics.

Method: Two design components: (1) localized special-token classification — replace full-vocabulary classification with special action token classification to ease adaptation; (2) hierarchical action-structured decoding — decode action sequences hierarchically, capturing dependencies within and across actions.

Result: LLaDA-VLA significantly outperforms state-of-the-art Vision-Language-Action models on both simulated environments and real-world robotic platforms.

Conclusion: Demonstrates the feasibility and effectiveness of diffusion-based VLA for robotics, suggesting diffusion models are a strong building block for future vision-language-action policies in robotic manipulation.

Abstract: The rapid progress of auto-regressive vision-language models (VLMs) has
inspired growing interest in vision-language-action models (VLA) for robotic
manipulation. Recently, masked diffusion models, a paradigm distinct from
autoregressive models, have begun to demonstrate competitive performance in
text generation and multimodal applications, leading to the development of a
series of diffusion-based VLMs (d-VLMs). However, leveraging such models for
robot policy learning remains largely unexplored. In this work, we present
LLaDA-VLA, the first Vision-Language-Diffusion-Action model built upon
pretrained d-VLMs for robotic manipulation. To effectively adapt d-VLMs to
robotic domain, we introduce two key designs: (1) a localized special-token
classification strategy that replaces full-vocabulary classification with
special action token classification, reducing adaptation difficulty; (2) a
hierarchical action-structured decoding strategy that decodes action sequences
hierarchically considering the dependencies within and across actions.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that LLaDA-VLA significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art VLAs on both simulation and real-world robots.

Method: A Mixture-of-Transformer architecture with dedicated perception, foresight generation, and control modules. Introduces a next-scale prediction mechanism to synthesize goal-conditioned future visual states as explicit planning targets. Action generation is reformulated as a foresight-guided inverse dynamics problem. Three-stage training on a dataset with 330k trajectories across 136 tasks to promote modular reasoning and transferable foresight.

Result: Extensive evaluations on real-world tasks and simulation benchmarks show F1 consistently outperforms existing approaches, with substantial gains in task success rate and generalization.

Conclusion: Integrating explicit visual foresight into VLA systems via modular Transformer components and foresight-guided planning improves robustness and generalization in dynamic environments, with a scalable training recipe supporting transfer across diverse tasks.

Abstract: Executing language-conditioned tasks in dynamic visual environments remains a
central challenge in embodied AI. Existing Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models
predominantly adopt reactive state-to-action mappings, often leading to
short-sighted behaviors and poor robustness in dynamic scenes. In this paper,
we introduce F1, a pretrained VLA framework which integrates the visual
foresight generation into decision-making pipeline. F1 adopts a
Mixture-of-Transformer architecture with dedicated modules for perception,
foresight generation, and control, thereby bridging understanding, generation,
and actions. At its core, F1 employs a next-scale prediction mechanism to
synthesize goal-conditioned visual foresight as explicit planning targets. By
forecasting plausible future visual states, F1 reformulates action generation
as a foresight-guided inverse dynamics problem, enabling actions that
implicitly achieve visual goals. To endow F1 with robust and generalizable
capabilities, we propose a three-stage training recipe on an extensive dataset
comprising over 330k trajectories across 136 diverse tasks. This training
scheme enhances modular reasoning and equips the model with transferable visual
foresight, which is critical for complex and dynamic environments. Extensive
evaluations on real-world tasks and simulation benchmarks demonstrate F1
consistently outperforms existing approaches, achieving substantial gains in
both task success rate and generalization ability.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: DRP (Deep Reactive Policy) enables robust, reactive motion in dynamic, partially observable environments via a visuo-motor neural policy (IMPACT) trained on 10M expert trajectories; it uses iterative finetuning for static obstacles and a local reactive module for dynamic obstacles, achieving superior generalization and success in both simulated and real-world tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classical global planners require full environment knowledge and are slow in dynamic scenes; purely neural policies can lack generalization to complex, changing environments. There is a need for a reactive, generalizable policy that operates on raw sensor data (point clouds) and handles both static and dynamic obstacles.

Method: DRP uses IMPACT, a transformer-based neural motion policy pretrained on 10 million expert trajectories spanning diverse simulations. Static obstacle avoidance is improved via iterative student-teacher finetuning. Dynamic obstacle avoidance is augmented at inference with DCP-RMP, a locally reactive goal-proposal module. The system operates directly on point cloud inputs.

Result: DRP demonstrates strong generalization and achieves higher success rates than prior classical and neural methods across both simulated and real-world tasks featuring clutter, moving obstacles, and goal obstructions.

Conclusion: DRP offers a robust, generalizable approach to reactive motion generation in dynamic environments, leveraging large-scale imitation learning, targeted finetuning, and local reactive modules. It shows promise for real-world robotic manipulation and opens avenues for further enhancements in dynamic scene understanding and efficiency.

Abstract: Generating collision-free motion in dynamic, partially observable
environments is a fundamental challenge for robotic manipulators. Classical
motion planners can compute globally optimal trajectories but require full
environment knowledge and are typically too slow for dynamic scenes. Neural
motion policies offer a promising alternative by operating in closed-loop
directly on raw sensory inputs but often struggle to generalize in complex or
dynamic settings. We propose Deep Reactive Policy (DRP), a visuo-motor neural
motion policy designed for reactive motion generation in diverse dynamic
environments, operating directly on point cloud sensory input. At its core is
IMPACT, a transformer-based neural motion policy pretrained on 10 million
generated expert trajectories across diverse simulation scenarios. We further
improve IMPACT's static obstacle avoidance through iterative student-teacher
finetuning. We additionally enhance the policy's dynamic obstacle avoidance at
inference time using DCP-RMP, a locally reactive goal-proposal module. We
evaluate DRP on challenging tasks featuring cluttered scenes, dynamic moving
obstacles, and goal obstructions. DRP achieves strong generalization,
outperforming prior classical and neural methods in success rate across both
simulated and real-world settings. Video results and code available at

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A vision-driven cross-modal DRL framework (LocoMamba) uses selective Mamba layers to achieve near-linear-time long-sequence modeling, fusing proprioceptive signals and depth patches for robust, efficient navigation under obstacles and varied terrains, outperforming baselines in simulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address sample inefficiency and poor long-horizon reasoning in DRL for robotics by enabling scalable, long-range sequence modeling in a cross-modal setting (proprioception + vision) with robust generalization to terrain and obstacle variation.

Method: Tokenize proprioceptive states with an MLP and patchify depth images with a lightweight CNN to form compact tokens. Apply stacked Mamba layers for near-linear-time, selective fusion of tokens, enabling long sequences with reduced latency and memory. Train end-to-end with Proximal Policy Optimization under terrain/appearance randomization and an obstacle-density curriculum, using a compact state-centric reward balancing progress, smoothness, and safety.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in simulation: higher returns and success rates with fewer collisions, stronger generalization to unseen terrains and obstacle densities, and faster convergence under the same compute budget, in environments with static/moving obstacles and uneven terrain.

Conclusion: LocoMamba demonstrates that near-linear-time selective sequence modeling on cross-modal tokens can yield robust, efficient, and scalable vision-guided DRL for navigation across challenging terrains, with practical training efficiency gains and improved generalization.

Abstract: We introduce LocoMamba, a vision-driven cross-modal DRL framework built on
selective state-space models, specifically leveraging Mamba, that achieves
near-linear-time sequence modeling, effectively captures long-range
dependencies, and enables efficient training with longer sequences. First, we
embed proprioceptive states with a multilayer perceptron and patchify depth
images with a lightweight convolutional neural network, producing compact
tokens that improve state representation. Second, stacked Mamba layers fuse
these tokens via near-linear-time selective scanning, reducing latency and
memory footprint, remaining robust to token length and image resolution, and
providing an inductive bias that mitigates overfitting. Third, we train the
policy end-to-end with Proximal Policy Optimization under terrain and
appearance randomization and an obstacle-density curriculum, using a compact
state-centric reward that balances progress, smoothness, and safety. We
evaluate our method in challenging simulated environments with static and
moving obstacles as well as uneven terrain. Compared with state-of-the-art
baselines, our method achieves higher returns and success rates with fewer
collisions, exhibits stronger generalization to unseen terrains and obstacle
densities, and improves training efficiency by converging in fewer updates
under the same compute budget.

*Sariel Har-Peled,Benjamin Raichel,Eliot W. Robson*

Main category: cs.CG

TL;DR: New WSPD constructions: (i) for any finite metric space with instance-optimal size; (ii) weighted unit-distance metric in the plane with size O(ε^{-2} n log n). Also applications: near-linear-time distortion approximation between point sets; shortcut polygonal curves to low-dilation, including a near-linear time algorithm to extract a simple non-self-intersecting subcurve.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: WSPD is a fundamental tool for fast geometric algorithms to bound pair interactions; reducing their size improves running time and memory in high-performance geometry tasks. Extending WSPD to arbitrary finite metric spaces and to weighted unit-distance metrics in the plane opens doors to efficient approximation in broader settings and sharper bounds. New applications to bijection distortion and curve simplification expand practical uses.

Method: Construct a new WSPD for any finite metric space with asymptotically instance-optimal size; develop a WSPD for the weighted unit-distance metric in the plane with O(ε^{-2} n log n) size; analyze complexity and provide simpler construction; apply WSPD to approximate bijection distortion; propose and implement a near-linear-time shortcutting algorithm for polygonal curves to achieve a target dilation and produce a simple non-self-intersecting subcurve.

Result: Instance-optimal WSPD size in general finite metric spaces; improved size bound in plane weighted unit-distance metric: O(ε^{-2} n log n), beating previous ε^{-2} factor; simpler construction; near-linear-time algorithms for dilation approximation and subcurve simplification; practical algorithm for obtaining a simple subcurve with no self-intersections.

Conclusion: The work tightens theoretical bounds on WSPD size across settings and broadens practical applications in geometric computation, suggesting further exploration in other metrics, dimensions, and optimization targets.

Abstract: We revisit the notion of WSPD (i.e., well-separated pairs-decomposition),
presenting a new construction of WSPD for any finite metric space, and show
that it is asymptotically instance-optimal in size. Next, we describe a new
WSPD construction for the weighted unit-distance metric in the plane, and show
a bound $O( \varepsilon^{-2} n \log n)$ on its size, improving by a factor of
$1/\varepsilon^2$ over previous work. The new construction is arguably simpler
and more elegant.
  We point out that using WSPD, one can approximate, in near-linear time, the
distortion of a bijection between two point sets in low dimensions. As a new
application of WSPD, we show how to shortcut a polygonal curve such that its
dilation is below a prespecified quantity. In particular, we show a near-linear
time algorithm for computing a simple subcurve for a given polygonal curve in
the plane so that the new subcurve has no self-intersection.

### [321] [Using Reinforcement Learning to Optimize the Global and Local Crossing Number](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06108)
*Timo Brand,Henry Förster,Stephen Kobourov,Robin Schukrafft,Markus Wallinger,Johannes Zink*

Main category: cs.CG

TL;DR: An RL-based method for graph drawing to minimize total and maximum edge crossings, using a vertex-moving agent with local rewards and a stress-based initialization; mixed results, competitive for local crossing number.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Crossings degrade readability in graph drawings. Traditional methods use force- or stress-based optimization; a learning-based approach could adaptively optimize layouts. 

Method: An agent observes a feature vector and moves a vertex to reduce crossings. The agent receives local rewards tied to crossing reductions. An initial layout is generated by a stress-based algorithm. The method is compared against force- and stress-based baselines and three established global-crossing algorithms on benchmark graphs.

Result: Experiments show mixed results: the RL method is mainly competitive for minimizing the local crossing number; performance on global crossing minimization is not clearly superior. The results indicate potential but require further development.

Conclusion: Reinforcement learning for graph drawing is promising but not yet outperforming traditional methods across objectives; future work should focus on improving stability, generalization, and performance on global crossing minimization.

Abstract: We present a novel approach to graph drawing based on reinforcement learning
for minimizing the global and the local crossing number, that is, the total
number of edge crossings and the maximum number of crossings on any edge,
respectively. In our framework, an agent learns how to move a vertex based on a
given observation vector in order to optimize its position. The agent receives
feedback in the form of local reward signals tied to crossing reduction. To
generate an initial layout, we use a stress-based graph-drawing algorithm. We
compare our method against force- and stress-based (baseline) algorithms as
well as three established algorithms for global crossing minimization on a
suite of benchmark graphs. The experiments show mixed results: our current
algorithm is mainly competitive for the local crossing number. We see a
potential for further development of the approach in the future.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A Perception Graph to quantify perception distortion in AR tactical systems to detect cognitive attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AR systems in tactical environments are vulnerable to cognitive attacks that manipulate perception and impair decision-making; there is a need for a robust, measurable method to detect and analyze such distortion.

Method: Proposes the Perception Graph, a model that mimics how humans interpret key information from a mixed reality environment and encodes the outcomes into a semantically meaningful structure, enabling computation of a distortion score.

Result: Demonstrates that the Perception Graph can compute a quantitative score representing the level of perception distortion, offering a robust and measurable method for detecting and analyzing cognitive attacks in AR systems.

Conclusion: The Perception Graph provides a novel, quantitative framework for detecting and analyzing perception-manipulation attacks in AR/Tactical MR settings, enhancing safety and reliability.

Abstract: Augmented reality (AR) systems are increasingly deployed in tactical
environments, but their reliance on seamless human-computer interaction makes
them vulnerable to cognitive attacks that manipulate a user's perception and
severely compromise user decision-making. To address this challenge, we
introduce the Perception Graph, a novel model designed to reason about human
perception within these systems. Our model operates by first mimicking the
human process of interpreting key information from an MR environment and then
representing the outcomes using a semantically meaningful structure. We
demonstrate how the model can compute a quantitative score that reflects the
level of perception distortion, providing a robust and measurable method for
detecting and analyzing the effects of such cognitive attacks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Progress in predictive supply chain tasks is hindered by scarce, proprietary, or inconsistently maintained datasets. A high-quality, open, and privacy-preserving dataset is needed to enable reproducibility and benchmarking.

Method: A generative model trained on real-world data creates SynDelay, a synthetic delivery delay dataset that preserves realistic patterns while protecting privacy. The dataset includes baseline results and evaluation metrics. Code and data are openly available to the community.

Result: SynDelay provides a realistic, challenging testbed for predictive modelling; baseline results and evaluation metrics are provided as reference points. The dataset is publicly available via the Supply Chain Data Hub; expect some noise and inconsistencies inherent in synthetic data but useful for benchmarking.

Conclusion: SynDelay supports open benchmarking in supply chain AI, encouraging community contributions of datasets, models, and evaluation practices to advance research in delivery delay prediction.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming supply chain management, yet
progress in predictive tasks -- such as delivery delay prediction -- remains
constrained by the scarcity of high-quality, openly available datasets.
Existing datasets are often proprietary, small, or inconsistently maintained,
hindering reproducibility and benchmarking. We present SynDelay, a synthetic
dataset designed for delivery delay prediction. Generated using an advanced
generative model trained on real-world data, SynDelay preserves realistic
delivery patterns while ensuring privacy. Although not entirely free of noise
or inconsistencies, it provides a challenging and practical testbed for
advancing predictive modelling. To support adoption, we provide baseline
results and evaluation metrics as initial benchmarks, serving as reference
points rather than state-of-the-art claims. SynDelay is publicly available
through the Supply Chain Data Hub, an open initiative promoting dataset sharing
and benchmarking in supply chain AI. We encourage the community to contribute
datasets, models, and evaluation practices to advance research in this area.

*Seyed Muhammad Hossein Mousavi,Atiye Ilanloo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Launches MVRS, a synchronized multimodal emotion dataset with eye-tracking, body motion, EMG, and GSR during VR stimuli, enabling early/late fusion and classifier-based validation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the shortage of multimodal affective datasets that combine body motion and physiological signals, to advance emotion recognition research in AI-enabled domains (healthcare, education, automotive).

Method: Record 13 participants (ages 12–60) exposed to VR emotional stimuli (relaxation, fear, stress, sadness, joy). Collect synchronized data: eye tracking via VR headset webcam, Kinect v2 body motion, EMG and GSR via Arduino UNO; timestamp alignment; standardized protocol with consent and questionnaires; extract features per modality; apply early and late fusion; train/evaluate classifiers to assess data quality and emotion separability.

Result: Validated dataset quality and demonstrated emotion separability across modalities, supporting MVRS as a useful resource for multimodal affective computing.

Conclusion: MVRS provides a valuable, synchronized multimodal dataset to advance multimodal emotion recognition and fusion approaches in practical AI systems.

Abstract: Automatic emotion recognition has become increasingly important with the rise
of AI, especially in fields like healthcare, education, and automotive systems.
However, there is a lack of multimodal datasets, particularly involving body
motion and physiological signals, which limits progress in the field. To
address this, the MVRS dataset is introduced, featuring synchronized recordings
from 13 participants aged 12 to 60 exposed to VR based emotional stimuli
(relaxation, fear, stress, sadness, joy). Data were collected using eye
tracking (via webcam in a VR headset), body motion (Kinect v2), and EMG and GSR
signals (Arduino UNO), all timestamp aligned. Participants followed a unified
protocol with consent and questionnaires. Features from each modality were
extracted, fused using early and late fusion techniques, and evaluated with
classifiers to confirm the datasets quality and emotion separability, making
MVRS a valuable contribution to multimodal affective computing.

*Bo Yuan,Jiazi Hu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GPT-4o is generally preferred among evaluated LLMs for tutoring tasks; the study demonstrates the feasibility of LLMs as advanced teaching assistants and uses a structured evaluation framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of head-to-head evaluations of LLMs in authentic, personalized learning settings and to assess their ability to dissect quizzes, infer mastery, and provide targeted guidance.

Method: Empirical comparison of three state-of-the-art LLMs on a tutoring task with a dataset of 10-question mixed-format items (with correctness labels). Each model analyzes the quiz to identify knowledge components, infers the student's mastery profile, and generates targeted guidance. Gemini acts as a virtual judge to perform pairwise comparisons across accuracy, clarity, actionability, and appropriateness. Bradley-Terry model used to analyze results.

Result: GPT-4o generally preferred; produced feedback that is more informative and better structured than the others. DeepSeek-V3 and GLM-4.5 show intermittent strengths but lower consistency.

Conclusion: LLMs can be feasibly deployed as advanced teaching assistants for individualized support; the study provides methodological guidance for future empirical research on LLM-driven personalized learning.

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly envisioned as intelligent
assistants for personalized learning, systematic head-to-head evaluations
within authentic learning scenarios remain limited. This study conducts an
empirical comparison of three state-of-the-art LLMs on a tutoring task that
simulates a realistic learning setting. Using a dataset comprising a student's
answers to ten questions of mixed formats with correctness labels, each LLM is
required to (i) analyze the quiz to identify underlying knowledge components,
(ii) infer the student's mastery profile, and (iii) generate targeted guidance
for improvement. To mitigate subjectivity and evaluator bias, we employ Gemini
as a virtual judge to perform pairwise comparisons along various dimensions:
accuracy, clarity, actionability, and appropriateness. Results analyzed via the
Bradley-Terry model indicate that GPT-4o is generally preferred, producing
feedback that is more informative and better structured than its counterparts,
while DeepSeek-V3 and GLM-4.5 demonstrate intermittent strengths but lower
consistency. These findings highlight the feasibility of deploying LLMs as
advanced teaching assistants for individualized support and provide
methodological guidance for future empirical research on LLM-driven
personalized learning.

### [328] [Characterizing Fitness Landscape Structures in Prompt Engineering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05375)
*Arend Hintze*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Prompt optimization landscapes differ by generation strategy: systematic prompts yield smooth autocorrelation; novelty-driven prompts produce rugged, hierarchical landscapes, with task-specific ruggedness across error types.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To move beyond black-box prompt search by characterizing the topology of prompt fitness landscapes in semantic embedding spaces, informing search strategies.

Method: Autocorrelation analysis in embedding spaces; experiments on error detection with two prompt-gen strategies: systematic enumeration (1,024 prompts) and novelty-driven diversification (1,000 prompts). Landscape topology assessed via autocorrelation patterns; task-specific analysis across 10 error categories.

Result: Two distinct landscape topologies: smooth decay for systematic prompts; non-monotonic, peak autocorrelation at intermediate semantic distances for novelty-driven prompts, indicating rugged, hierarchical landscapes. Ruggedness varies across error categories; provides empirical evidence of landscape complexity.

Conclusion: An empirical foundation showing landscape structure depends on generation strategy; implications for choosing prompt optimization methods and understanding search difficulty in prompt engineering.

Abstract: While prompt engineering has emerged as a crucial technique for optimizing
large language model performance, the underlying optimization landscape remains
poorly understood. Current approaches treat prompt optimization as a black-box
problem, applying sophisticated search algorithms without characterizing the
landscape topology they navigate. We present a systematic analysis of fitness
landscape structures in prompt engineering using autocorrelation analysis
across semantic embedding spaces. Through experiments on error detection tasks
with two distinct prompt generation strategies -- systematic enumeration (1,024
prompts) and novelty-driven diversification (1,000 prompts) -- we reveal
fundamentally different landscape topologies. Systematic prompt generation
yields smoothly decaying autocorrelation, while diversified generation exhibits
non-monotonic patterns with peak correlation at intermediate semantic
distances, indicating rugged, hierarchically structured landscapes.
Task-specific analysis across 10 error detection categories reveals varying
degrees of ruggedness across different error types. Our findings provide an
empirical foundation for understanding the complexity of optimization in prompt
engineering landscapes.

### [329] [Code Like Humans: A Multi-Agent Solution for Medical Coding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05378)
*Andreas Motzfeldt,Joakim Edin,Casper L. Christensen,Christian Hardmeier,Lars Maaløe,Anna Rogers*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A new agentic LLM-based framework, Code Like Humans, for medical coding that scales to ICD-10 (70k+ labels), achieving best-known performance on rare codes, with discriminative classifiers aiding high-frequency codes; also analyzes system blind spots.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical coding requires accurate, scalable mapping from unstructured clinical notes to ICD-10 codes; existing approaches struggle with rare codes and the full ICD-10 scale; there is a need for guideline-aligned AI that can handle many labels.

Method: An agentic framework that enforces official human-coding guidelines via prompts/decision logic in an LLM, scales to 70k+ ICD-10 codes, uses fine-tuned discriminative classifiers for high-frequency codes, and provides analysis of performance and undercoding blind spots.

Result: Achieves best performance to date on rare diagnosis codes; fine-tuned discriminative classifiers retain an advantage for high-frequency codes; capable of supporting the full ICD-10 system; identifies systematic undercoding blind spots.

Conclusion: Demonstrates feasibility and potential of guideline-aligned LLMs for large-scale medical coding; highlights need to address blind spots and calibrate for broader clinical deployment.

Abstract: In medical coding, experts map unstructured clinical notes to alphanumeric
codes for diagnoses and procedures. We introduce Code Like Humans: a new
agentic framework for medical coding with large language models. It implements
official coding guidelines for human experts, and it is the first solution that
can support the full ICD-10 coding system (+70K labels). It achieves the best
performance to date on rare diagnosis codes (fine-tuned discriminative
classifiers retain an advantage for high-frequency codes, to which they are
limited). Towards future work, we also contribute an analysis of system
performance and identify its `blind spots' (codes that are systematically
undercoded).

### [330] [Murphys Laws of AI Alignment: Why the Gap Always Wins](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05381)
*Madhava Gaikwad*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This work reframes alignment failures in feedback-based learning as an Alignment Gap quantified via KL-tilting, and offers a taxonomy (Murphy’s Laws) and trade-offs (Alignment Trilemma) with practical levers (MAPS) to guide future design, rather than claiming impossibility or complete resolution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite progress in RLHF and related methods, recurring failure patterns (reward hacking, sycophancy, annotator drift, misgeneralization) persist. A unifying conceptual framework is needed to diagnose, compare, and design around these structural issues in alignment research.

Method: Introduce a KL-tilting formalism to explain how optimization pressure drives divergence between proxy rewards and true human intent (Alignment Gap). Catalog failures as Murphy’s Laws of AI Alignment. Frame trade-offs via the Alignment Trilemma among optimization strength, value capture, and generalization. Propose the MAPS framework (Misspecification, Annotation, Pressure, Shift) as actionable design levers. Support with small-scale empirical illustrations.

Result: Provides a unifying perspective and design guidance rather than definitive impossibility results. Clarifies how feedback-based optimization can amplify misalignment, organizes failures into a coherent taxonomy, and offers practical levers (MAPS) and framing (Alignment Gap, Trilemma) to guide future work and experiments.

Conclusion: The paper reframes alignment debates around structural limits and trade-offs, offering a structured framework to diagnose and mitigate alignment failures and to guide future research and design in feedback-based alignment.

Abstract: Large language models are increasingly aligned to human preferences through
reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) and related methods such as
Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), Constitutional AI, and RLAIF. While
effective, these methods exhibit recurring failure patterns i.e., reward
hacking, sycophancy, annotator drift, and misgeneralization. We introduce the
concept of the Alignment Gap, a unifying lens for understanding recurring
failures in feedback-based alignment. Using a KL-tilting formalism, we
illustrate why optimization pressure tends to amplify divergence between proxy
rewards and true human intent. We organize these failures into a catalogue of
Murphys Laws of AI Alignment, and propose the Alignment Trilemma as a way to
frame trade-offs among optimization strength, value capture, and
generalization. Small-scale empirical studies serve as illustrative support.
Finally, we propose the MAPS framework (Misspecification, Annotation, Pressure,
Shift) as practical design levers. Our contribution is not a definitive
impossibility theorem but a perspective that reframes alignment debates around
structural limits and trade-offs, offering clearer guidance for future design.

*Chenguang Wang,Xiang Yan,Yilong Dai,Ziyi Wang,Susu Xu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A multi-agent pipeline edits real street-view imagery to design bicycle facilities with context-aware generation and automated evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Public engagement in street design is hampered by labor-intensive workflows and limited ability to meaningfully vary designs in complex street-view contexts; AI-based generative design should require less tailored data while enabling precise spatial control.

Method: A multi-agent framework that localizes lanes, optimizes prompts, generates bicycle-facility designs, and performs automated evaluation directly on real street-view imagery to synthesize realistic, contextually appropriate designs.

Result: Across diverse urban scenarios the system adapts to varying road geometries and environmental conditions, yielding visually coherent, instruction-compliant designs consistently.

Conclusion: This work lays a foundation for applying multi-agent pipelines to transportation infrastructure planning and facility design, enabling scalable, participatory AI-assisted design.

Abstract: Realistic visual renderings of street-design scenarios are essential for
public engagement in active transportation planning. Traditional approaches are
labor-intensive, hindering collective deliberation and collaborative
decision-making. While AI-assisted generative design shows transformative
potential by enabling rapid creation of design scenarios, existing generative
approaches typically require large amounts of domain-specific training data and
struggle to enable precise spatial variations of design/configuration in
complex street-view scenes. We introduce a multi-agent system that edits and
redesigns bicycle facilities directly on real-world street-view imagery. The
framework integrates lane localization, prompt optimization, design generation,
and automated evaluation to synthesize realistic, contextually appropriate
designs. Experiments across diverse urban scenarios demonstrate that the system
can adapt to varying road geometries and environmental conditions, consistently
yielding visually coherent and instruction-compliant results. This work
establishes a foundation for applying multi-agent pipelines to transportation
infrastructure planning and facility design.

### [332] [TreeGPT: A Novel Hybrid Architecture for Abstract Syntax Tree Processing with Global Parent-Child Aggregation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05550)
*Zixi Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TreeGPT is a hybrid transformer-TreeFFN model for processing Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs) using a Global Parent-Child Aggregation mechanism, achieving 96% accuracy on ARC Prize 2025 with only 1.5M parameters, surpassing transformers, Grok-4, and SOAR. Edge projection and gating are identified as key components.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations of purely sequential transformers and pure graph neural networks in neural program synthesis by explicitly modeling hierarchical AST structure. The goal is to enable efficient, scalable, and accurate aggregation of information across the entire tree through a global parent-child mechanism.

Method: A hybrid architecture that combines self-attention with a Tree Feed-Forward Network (TreeFFN) and introduces Global Parent-Child Aggregation: h_i^{(t+1)} = sigma(h_i^{(0)} + W_pc * sum_{(p,c) in E_i} f(h_p^{(t)}, h_c^{(t)}) + b). Nodes update over T iterations by aggregating information from parent-child edges. Optional enhancements include gated aggregation with learnable edge weights, residual connections, and bidirectional (bottom-up/top-down) propagation. The method is evaluated on the ARC Prize 2025 dataset for visual reasoning and rule inference.

Result: On ARC Prize 2025, TreeGPT achieves 96% accuracy, outperforming transformers baselines (1.3%), Grok-4 (15.9%), and SOAR (52%) while using only 1.5M parameters. An ablation study indicates edge projection is the most critical component, with the combination of edge projection and gating yielding optimal performance.

Conclusion: Global parent-child aggregation combined with attention-based processing and TreeFFN effectively captures hierarchical AST structure for neural program synthesis. The approach delivers strong performance with a compact model, highlighting the importance of edge projection and gating in the aggregation mechanism.

Abstract: We introduce TreeGPT, a novel neural architecture that combines
transformer-based attention mechanisms with global parent-child aggregation for
processing Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs) in neural program synthesis tasks.
Unlike traditional approaches that rely solely on sequential processing or
graph neural networks, TreeGPT employs a hybrid design that leverages both
self-attention for capturing local dependencies and a specialized Tree
Feed-Forward Network (TreeFFN) for modeling hierarchical tree structures
through iterative message passing.
  The core innovation lies in our Global Parent-Child Aggregation mechanism,
formalized as: $$h_i^{(t+1)} = \sigma \Big( h_i^{(0)} + W_{pc} \sum_{(p,c) \in
E_i} f(h_p^{(t)}, h_c^{(t)}) + b \Big)$$ where $h_i^{(t)}$ represents the
hidden state of node $i$ at iteration $t$, $E_i$ denotes all parent-child edges
involving node $i$, and $f(h_p, h_c)$ is an edge aggregation function. This
formulation enables each node to progressively aggregate information from the
entire tree structure through $T$ iterations.
  Our architecture integrates optional enhancements including gated aggregation
with learnable edge weights, residual connections for gradient stability, and
bidirectional propagation for capturing both bottom-up and top-down
dependencies. We evaluate TreeGPT on the ARC Prize 2025 dataset, a challenging
visual reasoning benchmark requiring abstract pattern recognition and rule
inference. Experimental results demonstrate that TreeGPT achieves 96\%
accuracy, significantly outperforming transformer baselines (1.3\%),
large-scale models like Grok-4 (15.9\%), and specialized program synthesis
methods like SOAR (52\%) while using only 1.5M parameters. Our comprehensive
ablation study reveals that edge projection is the most critical component,
with the combination of edge projection and gating achieving optimal
performance.

### [333] [OccVLA: Vision-Language-Action Model with Implicit 3D Occupancy Supervision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05578)
*Ruixun Liu,Lingyu Kong,Derun Li,Hang Zhao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: OccVLA integrates 3D occupancy into multimodal LLMs for autonomous driving by predicting occupancy as supervision from 2D inputs, enabling fine-grained 3D reasoning with no inference overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the lack of robust 3D spatial understanding in vision-and-language models for autonomous driving, caused by scarce accessible 3D representations and degradation of 3D details in VLM1 pretraining.

Method: OccVLA treats dense 3D occupancy as both a predictive output and a supervisory signal learned from 2D visual inputs. Occupancy predictions are used as implicit reasoning and can be skipped at inference time without extra computation.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art trajectory planning on the nuScenes benchmark and strong 3D VQA performance, offering a scalable, fully vision-based solution with interpretable occupancy as an auxiliary signal.

Conclusion: Integrating occupancy-based 3D representations into multimodal reasoning enhances 3D understanding in MLLMs for autonomous driving without increasing inference cost, enabling scalable vision-based perception and reasoning.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown strong vision-language
reasoning abilities but still lack robust 3D spatial understanding, which is
critical for autonomous driving. This limitation stems from two key challenges:
(1) the difficulty of constructing accessible yet effective 3D representations
without expensive manual annotations, and (2) the loss of fine-grained spatial
details in VLMs due to the absence of large-scale 3D vision-language
pretraining. To address these challenges, we propose OccVLA, a novel framework
that integrates 3D occupancy representations into a unified multimodal
reasoning process. Unlike prior approaches that rely on explicit 3D inputs,
OccVLA treats dense 3D occupancy as both a predictive output and a supervisory
signal, enabling the model to learn fine-grained spatial structures directly
from 2D visual inputs. The occupancy predictions are regarded as implicit
reasoning processes and can be skipped during inference without performance
degradation, thereby adding no extra computational overhead. OccVLA achieves
state-of-the-art results on the nuScenes benchmark for trajectory planning and
demonstrates superior performance on 3D visual question-answering tasks,
offering a scalable, interpretable, and fully vision-based solution for
autonomous driving.

*Jian Yang,Jiahui Wu,Li Fang,Hongchao Fan,Bianying Zhang,Huijie Zhao,Guangyi Yang,Rui Xin,Xiong You*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MSRFormer introduces a multi-scale, flow-aware road network representation framework that combines spatial flow convolution, scale-aware interaction regions, and a graph transformer with residual fusion and contrastive learning. It captures heterogeneous, hierarchical road networks and long-range dependencies, achieving notable improvements over baselines, especially when using trajectory data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Urban road networks are heterogeneous and hierarchical. GNNs that assume homogeneity and single-scale interactions struggle to learn effective representations. There is a need to model multi-scale spatial interactions, flow heterogeneity, and long-distance dependencies to improve road network analysis tasks.

Method: MSRFormer integrates spatial flow convolution to extract small-scale features from large trajectory datasets, identifies scale-dependent spatial interaction regions to capture network structure and flow heterogeneity, uses a graph transformer to capture cross-scale spatial dependencies, fuses features via residual connections, and applies contrastive learning to obtain the final road network representation. Validated on two real-world datasets, with trajectory data boosting performance, especially in complex networks.

Result: MSRFormer outperforms baseline methods on two road network analysis tasks, with up to 16% improvements over the strongest baseline. The gains are larger for tasks leveraging trajectory data and in more complex road network structures.

Conclusion: The framework offers a practical, task-agnostic approach to road network representation learning that emphasizes the interplay between scale effects and flow heterogeneity. It demonstrates the value of incorporating trajectory data and provides a basis for further exploration of multi-scale, flow-aware learning in road networks.

Abstract: Transforming road network data into vector representations using deep
learning has proven effective for road network analysis. However, urban road
networks' heterogeneous and hierarchical nature poses challenges for accurate
representation learning. Graph neural networks, which aggregate features from
neighboring nodes, often struggle due to their homogeneity assumption and focus
on a single structural scale. To address these issues, this paper presents
MSRFormer, a novel road network representation learning framework that
integrates multi-scale spatial interactions by addressing their flow
heterogeneity and long-distance dependencies. It uses spatial flow convolution
to extract small-scale features from large trajectory datasets, and identifies
scale-dependent spatial interaction regions to capture the spatial structure of
road networks and flow heterogeneity. By employing a graph transformer,
MSRFormer effectively captures complex spatial dependencies across multiple
scales. The spatial interaction features are fused using residual connections,
which are fed to a contrastive learning algorithm to derive the final road
network representation. Validation on two real-world datasets demonstrates that
MSRFormer outperforms baseline methods in two road network analysis tasks. The
performance gains of MSRFormer suggest the traffic-related task benefits more
from incorporating trajectory data, also resulting in greater improvements in
complex road network structures with up to 16% improvements compared to the
most competitive baseline method. This research provides a practical framework
for developing task-agnostic road network representation models and highlights
distinct association patterns of the interplay between scale effects and flow
heterogeneity of spatial interactions.

*Zhaoyu Fan,Kaihang Pan,Mingze Zhou,Bosheng Qin,Juncheng Li,Shengyu Zhang,Wenqiao Zhang,Siliang Tang,Fei Wu,Yueting Zhuang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CogEdit introduces a benchmark suite to evaluate meta-cognitive knowledge editing in multimodal LLMs across three levels (self-awareness, boundary generalization, and noise robustness), and proposes MIND, a framework for meta-cognitive Integrated Dynamic Knowledge Editing that uses a meta-knowledge memory, game-theoretic monitoring, and label refinement; results show superior performance over traditional cognitive editing methods on both standard and meta-cognitive tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks mainly target cognitive-level edits and overlook meta-cognitive processes like self-awareness, controlled generalization, and handling uncertainty. There is a need to evaluate and enable meta-cognitive editing in MLLMs.

Method: 1) Propose CogEdit benchmark with three evaluation axes: Counterfactual-Driven Editing, Boundary Constraint Editing, Noise-Robust Editing. 2) Propose MIND framework that builds a meta-knowledge memory for self-awareness, employs game-theoretic interactions to monitor knowledge activation, and uses label refinement for noise-robust updates.

Result: Experiments show MIND significantly outperforms existing cognitive editing approaches and achieves strong performance on both traditional cognitive editing benchmarks and the proposed meta-cognitive benchmarks.

Conclusion: Meta-cognitive editing is feasible and beneficial for MLLMs. The CogEdit benchmark and MIND framework provide a comprehensive path to self-aware, robust, and well-generalized knowledge editing in multimodal models.

Abstract: Knowledge editing enables multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to
efficiently update outdated or incorrect information. However, existing
benchmarks primarily emphasize cognitive-level modifications while lacking a
focus on deeper meta-cognitive processes. To bridge this gap, we introduce
CogEdit, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate MLLMs' meta-cognitive knowledge
editing abilities across three levels: (1) Counterfactual-Driven Editing,
assessing self-awareness of knowledge correctness changes; (2) Boundary
Constraint Editing, ensuring appropriate generalization without unintended
interference; and (3) Noise-Robust Editing, promoting reflective evaluation of
uncertain information. To advance meta-cognitive editing, we propose MIND
(Meta-cognitive INtegrated Dynamic Knowledge Editing), a framework that
constructs a meta-knowledge memory for self-awareness, employs game-theoretic
interactions to monitor knowledge activation, and incorporates label refinement
for noise-robust updates. Extensive experiments show that MIND significantly
outperforms existing cognitive editing approaches, achieving strong performance
on both traditional and meta-cognitive knowledge editing benchmarks.

### [336] [Hyperbolic Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05757)
*Sarang Patil,Zeyong Zhang,Yiran Huang,Tengfei Ma,Mengjia Xu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A survey of how hyperbolic geometry can enhance LLMs for modeling hierarchical semantic relations. It classifies Hyperbolic LLM methods, outlines applications, and provides a resource hub.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world data often exhibit non-Euclidean, tree-like, hierarchical structures. Hyperbolic space efficiently embeds such hierarchies, enabling better semantic entailment and multi-scale reasoning in LLMs.

Method: Proposes a taxonomy of Hyperbolic LLMs (HypLLMs) into four categories: (1) hyperbolic LLMs via exp/log maps; (2) hyperbolic fine-tuned models; (3) fully hyperbolic LLMs; and (4) hyperbolic state-space models. Surveys key techniques, applications, and datasets, and highlights future research directions, accompanied by a repository of papers, models, datasets, and code.

Result: Provides a comprehensive synthesis of recent HypLLM advances, clarifying methodological categories, mapping existing work, and identifying gaps and opportunities for multi-domain semantic representation and hierarchical reasoning.

Conclusion: Hyperbolic geometry offers a compelling latent space for LLMs to capture hierarchical and multi-scale structures; the surveyed work outlines a promising research direction and provides practical resources for researchers to advance this area.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success and
demonstrated superior performance across various tasks, including natural
language processing (NLP), weather forecasting, biological protein folding,
text generation, and solving mathematical problems. However, many real-world
data exhibit highly non-Euclidean latent hierarchical anatomy, such as protein
networks, transportation networks, financial networks, brain networks, and
linguistic structures or syntactic trees in natural languages. Effectively
learning intrinsic semantic entailment and hierarchical relationships from
these raw, unstructured input data using LLMs remains an underexplored area.
Due to its effectiveness in modeling tree-like hierarchical structures,
hyperbolic geometry -- a non-Euclidean space -- has rapidly gained popularity
as an expressive latent representation space for complex data modeling across
domains such as graphs, images, languages, and multi-modal data. Here, we
provide a comprehensive and contextual exposition of recent advancements in
LLMs that leverage hyperbolic geometry as a representation space to enhance
semantic representation learning and multi-scale reasoning. Specifically, the
paper presents a taxonomy of the principal techniques of Hyperbolic LLMs
(HypLLMs) in terms of four main categories: (1) hyperbolic LLMs through exp/log
maps; (2) hyperbolic fine-tuned models; (3) fully hyperbolic LLMs, and (4)
hyperbolic state-space models. We also explore crucial potential applications
and outline future research directions. A repository of key papers, models,
datasets, and code implementations is available at

*Yuwei Lou,Hao Hu,Shaocong Ma,Zongfei Zhang,Liang Wang,Jidong Ge,Xianping Tao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A dynamic reputation filtering framework (DRF) for multi-agent LLM systems uses an interactive rating network, reputation scoring for honesty/capability, and an Upper Confidence Bound strategy to improve agent selection, boosting task quality and collaboration in logic and coding tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address difficulties in quantifying agent performance and assessing credibility in multi-agent LLM systems, enabling more reliable task completion and efficient collaboration.

Method: Introduce DRF with: (1) an interactive rating network to quantify agent performance; (2) a reputation scoring mechanism to measure honesty and capability; (3) an Upper Confidence Bound (UCB)-based strategy to improve agent selection efficiency.

Result: DRF significantly improves task completion quality and collaboration efficiency in logical reasoning and code-generation tasks on large-scale multi-agent tasks.

Conclusion: DRF provides a new approach for multi-agent systems to handle large-scale tasks by quantifying agent performance, assessing credibility, and guiding agent selection with UCB-based decisions.

Abstract: With the evolution of generative AI, multi - agent systems leveraging large -
language models(LLMs) have emerged as a powerful tool for complex tasks.
However, these systems face challenges in quantifying agent performance and
lack mechanisms to assess agent credibility. To address these issues, we
introduce DRF, a dynamic reputation filtering framework. DRF constructs an
interactive rating network to quantify agent performance, designs a reputation
scoring mechanism to measure agent honesty and capability, and integrates an
Upper Confidence Bound - based strategy to enhance agent selection efficiency.
Experiments show that DRF significantly improves task completion quality and
collaboration efficiency in logical reasoning and code - generation tasks,
offering a new approach for multi - agent systems to handle large - scale
tasks.

### [338] [Decision-Focused Learning Enhanced by Automated Feature Engineering for Energy Storage Optimisation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05772)
*Nasser Alkhulaifi,Ismail Gokay Dogan,Timothy R. Cargan,Alexander L. Bowler,Direnc Pekaslan,Nicholas J. Watson,Isaac Triguero*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AFE-DFL improves BESS optimization under uncertainty by integrating prediction and optimization, outperforming traditional PTO; adding Automated Feature Engineering (AFE) yields substantial gains (22.9-56.5%) over the same models without AFE on real-world data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Decision-Focused Learning (DFL) promises better downstream optimization by integrating prediction and optimization, but evidence has been limited to synthetic or small-scale problems. Real-world BESS contexts face data scarcity and greater variability, making PTO prone to error cascades.

Method: Propose an Automated Feature Engineering (AFE) enhanced DFL framework that forecasts electricity prices and demand while optimizing BESS operations to minimize costs. Evaluate on a novel real-world UK property dataset, comparing DFL (with and without AFE) against PTO (with and without AFE).

Result: DFL achieves lower operating costs than PTO on average. Incorporating AFE substantially boosts DFL performance, improving results by 22.9-56.5% compared with the same models without AFE.

Conclusion: Domain-specific AFE enhances DFL and reduces reliance on domain expertise for BESS optimization, delivering clear economic benefits. The findings support the practical viability of DFL in real-world energy management and imply broader applicability to systems facing data scarcity and parameter uncertainty.

Abstract: Decision-making under uncertainty in energy management is complicated by
unknown parameters hindering optimal strategies, particularly in Battery Energy
Storage System (BESS) operations. Predict-Then-Optimise (PTO) approaches treat
forecasting and optimisation as separate processes, allowing prediction errors
to cascade into suboptimal decisions as models minimise forecasting errors
rather than optimising downstream tasks. The emerging Decision-Focused Learning
(DFL) methods overcome this limitation by integrating prediction and
optimisation; however, they are relatively new and have been tested primarily
on synthetic datasets or small-scale problems, with limited evidence of their
practical viability. Real-world BESS applications present additional
challenges, including greater variability and data scarcity due to collection
constraints and operational limitations. Because of these challenges, this work
leverages Automated Feature Engineering (AFE) to extract richer representations
and improve the nascent approach of DFL. We propose an AFE-DFL framework
suitable for small datasets that forecasts electricity prices and demand while
optimising BESS operations to minimise costs. We validate its effectiveness on
a novel real-world UK property dataset. The evaluation compares DFL methods
against PTO, with and without AFE. The results show that, on average, DFL
yields lower operating costs than PTO and adding AFE further improves the
performance of DFL methods by 22.9-56.5% compared to the same models without
AFE. These findings provide empirical evidence for DFL's practical viability in
real-world settings, indicating that domain-specific AFE enhances DFL and
reduces reliance on domain expertise for BESS optimisation, yielding economic
benefits with broader implications for energy management systems facing similar
challenges.

### [339] [Chatbot To Help Patients Understand Their Health](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05818)
*Won Seok Jang,Hieu Tran,Manav Mistry,SaiKiran Gandluri,Yifan Zhang,Sharmin Sultana,Sunjae Kown,Yuan Zhang,Zonghai Yao,Hong Yu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A lightweight, two-stage trained chatbot (NoteAid-Chatbot) uses a learning-as-conversation approach with no labeled data to educate patients. It leverages a multi-agent LLM and PPO-based RL, trained on synthetic medical conversations and simulated discharge scenarios, achieving emergent patient-education behaviors and outperforming non-expert humans in a Turing-like evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Empower patients to actively participate in care and reduce the need for labeled data by showing that low-cost RL alignment can yield effective, domain-specific educational chatbots in healthcare.

Method: Two-stage training of a lightweight LLaMA 3.2 3B model: (1) supervised fine-tuning on synthetically generated medical conversation data using medical conversation strategies, (2) reinforcement learning using rewards derived from patient understanding assessments in simulated hospital discharge contexts; a multi-agent LLM framework with no explicit supervision for clarity/relevance; PPO-based reward modeling to guide multi-turn, educational dialogue.

Result: The chatbot exhibits emergent patient-education behaviors such as clarity, relevance, and structured dialogue; it handles multi-turn interactions and learns to incorporate diverse educational strategies without explicit supervision. A Turing-like test shows it can surpass non-expert humans in evaluation, demonstrating that simple PPO-based reward modeling can train lightweight, domain-specific chatbots for realistic conversations.

Conclusion: This work demonstrates the feasibility of applying low-cost PPO-based RL to realistic, open-ended conversational domains like healthcare education, supporting broader RL-based alignment methods and suggesting wide applicability beyond the study domain.

Abstract: Patients must possess the knowledge necessary to actively participate in
their care. We present NoteAid-Chatbot, a conversational AI that promotes
patient understanding via a novel 'learning as conversation' framework, built
on a multi-agent large language model (LLM) and reinforcement learning (RL)
setup without human-labeled data. NoteAid-Chatbot was built on a lightweight
LLaMA 3.2 3B model trained in two stages: initial supervised fine-tuning on
conversational data synthetically generated using medical conversation
strategies, followed by RL with rewards derived from patient understanding
assessments in simulated hospital discharge scenarios. Our evaluation, which
includes comprehensive human-aligned assessments and case studies, demonstrates
that NoteAid-Chatbot exhibits key emergent behaviors critical for patient
education, such as clarity, relevance, and structured dialogue, even though it
received no explicit supervision for these attributes. Our results show that
even simple Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)-based reward modeling can
successfully train lightweight, domain-specific chatbots to handle multi-turn
interactions, incorporate diverse educational strategies, and meet nuanced
communication objectives. Our Turing test demonstrates that NoteAid-Chatbot
surpasses non-expert human. Although our current focus is on healthcare, the
framework we present illustrates the feasibility and promise of applying
low-cost, PPO-based RL to realistic, open-ended conversational domains,
broadening the applicability of RL-based alignment methods.

### [340] [MapAgent: A Hierarchical Agent for Geospatial Reasoning with Dynamic Map Tool Integration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05933)
*Md Hasebul Hasan,Mahir Labib Dihan,Mohammed Eunus Ali,Md Rizwan Parvez*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MapAgent is a hierarchical, plug-and-play multi-agent framework for map-aware geospatial reasoning that decouples planning from execution and uses a dedicated map-tool agent to coordinate map APIs, achieving notable gains on diverse geospatial benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Geospatial tasks demand spatial reasoning, multi-hop planning, and real-time map interaction. Existing LLM agent frameworks often struggle with handling numerous similar geospatial APIs and can overwhelm the model with tool use. A decoupled, hierarchical design can reduce cognitive load and improve tool selection.

Method: A high-level planner decomposes queries into subgoals routed to specialized modules. A dedicated map-tool agent orchestrates map APIs in parallel to fetch geospatial data relevant to the query; simpler modules (solution generation, answer extraction) operate with minimal overhead. The framework is evaluated on four benchmarks (MapEval-Textual, MapEval-API, MapEval-Visual, MapQA) and is open-sourced.

Result: Substantial gains over state-of-the-art tool-augmented and agentic baselines on the four geospatial benchmarks.

Conclusion: MapAgent reduces cognitive load, improves tool selection accuracy, and enables precise coordination across similar APIs; the framework is open-source at the provided repository.

Abstract: Agentic AI has significantly extended the capabilities of large language
models (LLMs) by enabling complex reasoning and tool use. However, most
existing frameworks are tailored to domains such as mathematics, coding, or web
automation, and fall short on geospatial tasks that require spatial reasoning,
multi-hop planning, and real-time map interaction. To address these challenges,
we introduce MapAgent, a hierarchical multi-agent plug-and-play framework with
customized toolsets and agentic scaffolds for map-integrated geospatial
reasoning. Unlike existing flat agent-based approaches that treat tools
uniformly-often overwhelming the LLM when handling similar but subtly different
geospatial APIs-MapAgent decouples planning from execution. A high-level
planner decomposes complex queries into subgoals, which are routed to
specialized modules. For tool-heavy modules-such as map-based services-we then
design a dedicated map-tool agent that efficiently orchestrates related APIs
adaptively in parallel to effectively fetch geospatial data relevant for the
query, while simpler modules (e.g., solution generation or answer extraction)
operate without additional agent overhead. This hierarchical design reduces
cognitive load, improves tool selection accuracy, and enables precise
coordination across similar APIs. We evaluate MapAgent on four diverse
geospatial benchmarks-MapEval-Textual, MapEval-API, MapEval-Visual, and
MapQA-and demonstrate substantial gains over state-of-the-art tool-augmented
and agentic baselines. We open-source our framwork at
https://github.com/Hasebul/MapAgent.

### [341] [Rethinking Reasoning Quality in Large Language Models through Enhanced Chain-of-Thought via RL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06024)
*Haoyang He,Zihua Rong,Kun Ji,Chenyang Li,Qing Huang,Chong Xia,Lan Yang,Honggang Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Introduces Dynamic Reasoning Efficiency Reward (DRER), a plug-and-play RL reward framework that directly incentivizes useful chain-of-thought (CoT) and stabilizes training via a dynamic length constraint; includes Logictree dataset; shows a 7B model attaining GPT-o3-mini level on Logictree with minimal training steps and a ~30% rise in CoT confidence; code released.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current task-specific reward signals often ignore the quality of reasoning within CoT and fail to probe genuine reasoning capacity or control reasoning depth, limiting generalization.

Method: Two-part approach: (1) Reasoning Quality Reward assigns credit to reasoning chains that increase the likelihood of the correct answer; (2) Dynamic Length Advantage decays the value of responses that deviate from a validation-derived length threshold; introduces Logictree as a dynamic deductive reasoning dataset for RL data and benchmarking; evaluates on Logictree and AIME24; reports a 7B model achieving GPT-o3-mini parity in 400 training steps.

Result: Demonstrates that DRER can shape CoT behavior effectively: a 7B model reaches GPT-o3-mini level on Logictree with limited steps; average confidence of CoT-augmented answers rises by about 30%; shows generalization across diverse logical reasoning datasets.

Conclusion: DRER provides a practical RL-based pathway to enhance formal reasoning in LLMs, with released code/data enabling reproducibility and broader evaluation; further work could explore scalability, robustness, and domain transfer.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has recently become the dominant paradigm for
strengthening the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs). Yet the
rule-based reward functions commonly used on mathematical or programming
benchmarks assess only answer format and correctness, providing no signal as to
whether the induced Chain-of-Thought (CoT) actually improves the answer.
Furthermore, such task-specific training offers limited control over logical
depth and therefore may fail to reveal a model's genuine reasoning capacity. We
propose Dynamic Reasoning Efficiency Reward (DRER) -- a plug-and-play RL reward
framework that reshapes both reward and advantage signals. (i) A Reasoning
Quality Reward assigns fine-grained credit to those reasoning chains that
demonstrably raise the likelihood of the correct answer, directly incentivising
the trajectories with beneficial CoT tokens. (ii) A Dynamic Length Advantage
decays the advantage of responses whose length deviates from a
validation-derived threshold, stabilising training. To facilitate rigorous
assessment, we also release Logictree, a dynamically constructed deductive
reasoning dataset that functions both as RL training data and as a
comprehensive benchmark. Experiments confirm the effectiveness of DRER: our 7B
model attains GPT-o3-mini level performance on Logictree with 400 trianing
steps, while the average confidence of CoT-augmented answers rises by 30%. The
model further exhibits generalisation across diverse logical-reasoning
datasets, and the mathematical benchmark AIME24. These results illuminate how
RL shapes CoT behaviour and chart a practical path toward enhancing
formal-reasoning skills in large language models. All code and data are
available in repository https://github.com/Henryhe09/DRER.

*Haozhe Wang,Haoran Que,Qixin Xu,Minghao Liu,Wangchunshu Zhou,Jiazhan Feng,Wanjun Zhong,Wei Ye,Tong Yang,Wenhao Huang,Ge Zhang,Fangzhen Lin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A backward-engineering reasoning approach (REER) learns latent step-by-step reasoning from known-good solutions for open-ended generation, enabling gradient-free discovery and producing DeepWriting-20K data and a model (DeepWriter-8B) that rivals leading proprietary models on open-ended tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Open-ended creative generation remains hard for deep reasoning. RL has reward-signal issues and distillation is expensive and capped by teacher models. A backward, gradient-free approach to infer plausible reasoning sequences can leverage existing solutions at scale.

Method: Reverse-engineered reasoning (REER) constructs latent reasoning steps by starting from correct outcomes and inferring the steps that could have produced them. This gradient-free process scales to create DeepWriting-20K (20,000 trajectories) and trains DeepWriter-8B on this data to perform open-ended tasks.

Result: DeepWriter-8B surpasses strong open-source baselines and is competitive with, and occasionally superior to, leading proprietary models like GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 on open-ended tasks.

Conclusion: REER offers a novel paradigm for deep reasoning in open-ended generation, enabling scalable, reward-free discovery of reasoning steps, and providing an open dataset and a competitive model that broadens access beyond proprietary systems.

Abstract: While the ``deep reasoning'' paradigm has spurred significant advances in
verifiable domains like mathematics, its application to open-ended, creative
generation remains a critical challenge. The two dominant methods for
instilling reasoning -- reinforcement learning (RL) and instruction
distillation -- falter in this area; RL struggles with the absence of clear
reward signals and high-quality reward models, while distillation is
prohibitively expensive and capped by the teacher model's capabilities. To
overcome these limitations, we introduce REverse-Engineered Reasoning (REER), a
new paradigm that fundamentally shifts the approach. Instead of building a
reasoning process ``forwards'' through trial-and-error or imitation, REER works
``backwards'' from known-good solutions to computationally discover the latent,
step-by-step deep reasoning process that could have produced them. Using this
scalable, gradient-free approach, we curate and open-source DeepWriting-20K, a
large-scale dataset of 20,000 deep reasoning trajectories for open-ended tasks.
Our model, DeepWriter-8B, trained on this data, not only surpasses strong
open-source baselines but also achieves performance competitive with, and at
times superior to, leading proprietary models like GPT-4o and Claude 3.5.

*Wei Han,Geng Zhan,Sicheng Yu,Chenyu Wang,Bryan Hooi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Efficient Dynamic Inference Trimming (EDIT) trims LRMs' reasoning paths at test time by constraint-guided generation to balance brevity and correctness, improving readability and efficiency without sacrificing accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large reasoning models often achieve high performance via extended reasoning traces but suffer from overthinking, leading to overly long, less interpretable outputs. There is a need to balance correctness and conciseness at test time.

Method: Introduce EDIT (Efficient Dynamic Inference Trimming): a constraint-guided generation framework that jointly tracks output length and answer distributions under varying constraints to identify and output the shortest correct reasoning paths.

Result: Extensive experiments across diverse models and datasets show that EDIT substantially improves reasoning efficiency, producing concise yet informative outputs, with improved readability and user experience while maintaining accuracy.

Conclusion: Balancing multiple generation objectives at test time is feasible; EDIT provides a practical, retraining-free approach to generate compact, correct reasoning traces, enhancing user experience and interpretability.

Abstract: O1/R1 style large reasoning models (LRMs) signal a substantial leap forward
over conventional instruction-following LLMs. By applying test-time scaling to
generate extended reasoning paths, they establish many SOTAs across a wide
range of complex reasoning tasks. However, recent studies show that LRMs are
prone to suffer from overthinking -- the tendency to overcomplicate simple
problems, leading to excessive strategy switching and long, convoluted
reasoning traces that hinder their interpretability. To mitigate this issue, we
conduct a systematic investigation into the reasoning efficiency of a broad set
of LRMs and uncover a common dilemma: the difficulty in balancing multiple
generation objectives such as correctness and brevity. Based on this discovery,
we propose a test-time scaling method, EDIT (Efficient Dynamic Inference
Trimming), which efficiently guides LRMs to identify the shortest correct
reasoning paths at test time. EDIT employs constraint-guided generation while
jointly tracking length and answer distributions under varying constraints,
allowing it to select responses that strike an optimal balance between
conciseness and correctness. Extensive experiments across diverse models and
datasets show that EDIT substantially enhance the reasoning efficiency,
producing compact yet informative outputs that improve readability and user
experience.

*Manvi Jha,Jiaxin Wan,Deming Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Introduces Proof2Silicon, an end-to-end framework that combines PREFACE's RL-based prompt repair with automatic Dafny-to-C translation and Vivado HLS to synthesize hardware from natural-language specs, achieving up to 72% end-to-end RTL synthesis success on a 100-task benchmark, and improving Dafny verification by up to 21%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Formal verification is essential for hardware and safety-critical domains, but LLM-generated code frequently fails verification. A model-agnostic, scalable pipeline from natural language to silicon is needed without costly fine-tuning.

Method: Leverages PREFACE's verifier-driven RL to iteratively optimize prompts to produce correct Dafny code; translates verified Dafny to high-level C using Dafny's Python backend and PyLog; uses Vivado HLS to synthesize RTL.

Result: On a 100-task benchmark, PREFACE's RL-guided prompt optimization improved Dafny verification success rates across diverse LLMs by up to 21%. Proof2Silicon achieved an end-to-end hardware synthesis success rate of up to 72%, generating RTL designs through Vivado HLS.

Conclusion: Demonstrates a robust, scalable pipeline for LLM-driven, formally verified hardware synthesis, bridging natural-language specifications and silicon realization.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in
automated code generation but frequently produce code that fails formal
verification, an essential requirement for hardware and safety-critical
domains. To overcome this fundamental limitation, we previously proposed
PREFACE, a model-agnostic framework based on reinforcement learning (RL) that
iteratively repairs the prompts provided to frozen LLMs, systematically
steering them toward generating formally verifiable Dafny code without costly
fine-tuning. This work presents Proof2Silicon, a novel end-to-end synthesis
framework that embeds the previously proposed PREFACE flow to enable the
generation of correctness-by-construction hardware directly from natural
language specifications. Proof2Silicon operates by: (1) leveraging PREFACE's
verifier-driven RL agent to optimize prompt generation iteratively, ensuring
Dafny code correctness; (2) automatically translating verified Dafny programs
into synthesizable high-level C using Dafny's Python backend and PyLog; and (3)
employing Vivado HLS to produce RTL implementations. Evaluated rigorously on a
challenging 100-task benchmark, PREFACE's RL-guided prompt optimization
consistently improved Dafny verification success rates across diverse LLMs by
up to 21%. Crucially, Proof2Silicon achieved an end-to-end hardware synthesis
success rate of up to 72%, generating RTL designs through Vivado HLS synthesis
flows. These results demonstrate a robust, scalable, and automated pipeline for
LLM-driven, formally verified hardware synthesis, bridging natural-language

*Vishal Raman,Vijai Aravindh R,Abhijith Ragav*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Remi introduces a memory-augmented, causal reasoning architecture (CSM) for personalized, explainable multimodal lifestyle agents, integrating a personal causal graph, causal reasoning, and schema-based planning orchestrated by an LLM to deliver tailored, explainable recommendations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current personalized AI assistants struggle to integrate complex personal data and causal knowledge, yielding generic, opaque advice. There is a need for explainable, context-aware personalization that respects user life events, habits, and external knowledge.

Method: Proposes REMI: a Causal Schema Memory architecture with a personal causal knowledge graph, a causal reasoning engine, and a schema-based planning module for a multimodal lifestyle agent. A Large Language Model orchestrates components to perform goal-directed causal traversals enriched with external knowledge and hypothetical reasoning, retrieving adaptable plan schemas to generate tailored action plans. Introduces evaluation metrics (Personalization Salience Score and Causal Reasoning Accuracy) and a system design outline.

Result: CSM-based agents produced more context-aware, user-aligned recommendations than baseline LLM agents, demonstrating improved personalization and explainability.

Conclusion: The work presents a novel memory-augmented, causal-reasoning framework for personalized agents, advancing transparent and trustworthy AI lifestyle assistants through structured memory, reasoning, and planning.

Abstract: Personalized AI assistants often struggle to incorporate complex personal
data and causal knowledge, leading to generic advice that lacks explanatory
power. We propose REMI, a Causal Schema Memory architecture for a multimodal
lifestyle agent that integrates a personal causal knowledge graph, a causal
reasoning engine, and a schema based planning module. The idea is to deliver
explainable, personalized recommendations in domains like fashion, personal
wellness, and lifestyle planning. Our architecture uses a personal causal graph
of the user's life events and habits, performs goal directed causal traversals
enriched with external knowledge and hypothetical reasoning, and retrieves
adaptable plan schemas to generate tailored action plans. A Large Language
Model orchestrates these components, producing answers with transparent causal
explanations. We outline the CSM system design and introduce new evaluation
metrics for personalization and explainability, including Personalization
Salience Score and Causal Reasoning Accuracy, to rigorously assess its
performance. Results indicate that CSM based agents can provide more context
aware, user aligned recommendations compared to baseline LLM agents. This work
demonstrates a novel approach to memory augmented, causal reasoning in
personalized agents, advancing the development of transparent and trustworthy
AI lifestyle assistants.

### [347] [TableMind: An Autonomous Programmatic Agent for Tool-Augmented Table Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06278)
*Chuang Jiang,Mingyue Cheng,Xiaoyu Tao,Qingyang Mao,Jie Ouyang,Qi Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TableMind is an autonomous, tool-augmented table reasoning agent that writes and executes data-analysis code in a sandbox, uses planning and self-reflection, and is trained via supervised and reinforcement fine-tuning with RAPO, achieving state-of-the-art results on benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of purely text-based LLMs in numeric-heavy table reasoning and the rigid, imitation-based patterns of existing tool-enabled systems.

Method: A two-stage fine-tuning paradigm: (1) supervised fine-tuning on high-quality reasoning trajectories to learn effective tool usage and planning; (2) reinforcement fine-tuning using Rank-Aware Policy Optimization (RAPO) which increases the update weight of high-quality trajectories when their output probabilities are lower than those of low-quality ones. The model autonomously performs multi-turn tool invocation and writes/executes data-analysis code in a secure sandbox, with planning and self-reflection to adapt strategies.

Result: Extensive experiments on mainstream benchmarks show TableMind achieves superior performance compared to competitive baselines, with substantial gains in reasoning accuracy and computational precision.

Conclusion: Demonstrates that autonomous tool usage, sandboxed code execution, and RAPO-based training can significantly improve table reasoning in LLM-powered agents, pointing to a promising direction for data-analysis AI systems.

Abstract: Table reasoning is crucial for leveraging structured data in domains such as
finance, healthcare, and scientific research. While large language models
(LLMs) show promise in multi-step reasoning, purely text-based methods often
struggle with the complex numerical computations and fine-grained operations
inherently required in this task. Tool-integrated reasoning improves
computational accuracy via explicit code execution, yet existing systems
frequently rely on rigid patterns, supervised imitation, and lack true
autonomous adaptability. In this paper, we present TableMind, an LLM-driven
table reasoning agent that (i) autonomously performs multi-turn tool
invocation, (ii) writes and executes data-analyzing code in a secure sandbox
environment for data analysis and precise numerical reasoning, and (iii)
exhibits high-level capabilities such as planning and self-reflection to adapt
strategies. To realize these capabilities, we adopt a two-stage fine-tuning
paradigm built on top of a powerful pre-trained language model: supervised
fine-tuning on high-quality reasoning trajectories to establish effective tool
usage patterns, followed by reinforcement fine-tuning to optimize
multi-objective strategies. In particular, we propose Rank-Aware Policy
Optimization (RAPO), which increases the update weight of high-quality
trajectories when their output probabilities are lower than those of
low-quality ones, thereby guiding the model more consistently toward better and
more accurate answers. Extensive experiments on several mainstream benchmarks
demonstrate that TableMind achieves superior performance compared to
competitive baselines, yielding substantial gains in both reasoning accuracy
and computational precision.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Autonomous single-agent RL for deep research (DR) with minimal web crawling and Python tool integration; synthetic-data RL recipe; best model SFR-DR-20B reaches 28.7% on Humanity's Last Exam, with additional analyses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Advance agentic AI by enabling autonomous, interleaved reasoning and tool-use in a single agent for Deep Research tasks, avoiding rigid multi-agent workflows and heavy external tooling.

Method: Propose a simple continual reinforcement learning (RL) recipe trained entirely on synthetic data, applied to multiple open-source LLMs, focusing on reasoning-optimized behavior with minimal web access and Python tool integration.

Result: Through this RL recipe, the authors report a best variant SFR-DR-20B achieving up to 28.7% on Humanity's Last Exam, plus targeted analysis experiments to illuminate the approach.

Conclusion: Shows that continual RL with a synthetic-data recipe can improve reasoning-enabled autonomous agents for DR, even with limited web crawling and tool integration, and highlights areas for further insight-driven experimentation.

Abstract: Equipping large language models (LLMs) with complex, interleaved reasoning
and tool-use capabilities has become a key focus in agentic AI research,
especially with recent advances in reasoning-oriented (``thinking'') models.
Such capabilities are key to unlocking a number of important applications. One
such application is Deep Research (DR), which requires extensive search and
reasoning over many sources. Our work in this paper focuses on the development
of native Autonomous Single-Agent models for DR featuring minimal web crawling
and Python tool integration. Unlike multi-agent systems, where agents take up
pre-defined roles and are told what to do at each step in a static workflow, an
autonomous single-agent determines its next action dynamically based on
context, without manual directive. While prior work has proposed training
recipes for base or instruction-tuned LLMs, we focus on continual reinforcement
learning (RL) of reasoning-optimized models to further enhance agentic skills
while preserving reasoning ability. Towards this end, we propose a simple RL
recipe with entirely synthetic data, which we apply to various open-source
LLMs. Our best variant SFR-DR-20B achieves up to 28.7% on Humanity's Last Exam
benchmark. In addition, we conduct key analysis experiments to provide more
insights into our methodologies.

*Jiaxiang Chen,Zhuo Wang,Mingxi Zou,Zhucong Li,Zhijian Zhou,Song Wang,Zenglin Xu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Structured reasoning with stepwise guidelines and refinement improves LLMs' reasoning stability, generalization, and cross-domain transfer, outperforming strong baselines and matching supervised fine-tuning in scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To combat unstable, unguided reasoning paths caused by implicit exploration, which leads to error accumulation, poor error correction, and limited learning from past experience in LLMs.

Method: Extract structured reasoning patterns from successful trajectories and failure signals; during inference, follow step-by-step guidelines with post-step refinement to correct errors and stabilize reasoning; evaluate on BBH and four benchmarks (GSM8K, MATH-500, MBPP, HumanEval) to assess generalization and cross-domain transfer.

Result: The approach consistently outperforms strong baselines across diverse reasoning tasks, yielding improved stability and generalization. Guidelines transfer across domains and model collaborations, with performance matching or surpassing supervised fine-tuning in effectiveness and scalability.

Conclusion: Structured, guideline-driven reasoning with iterative refinement offers a scalable, transferable framework that improves robustness and generalization of LLMs, and can rival supervised fine-tuning.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have advanced general-purpose reasoning, showing
strong performance across diverse tasks. However, existing methods often rely
on implicit exploration, where the model follows stochastic and unguided
reasoning paths-like walking without a map. This leads to unstable reasoning
paths, lack of error correction, and limited learning from past experience. To
address these issues, we propose a framework that shifts from implicit
exploration to structured reasoning through guideline and refinement. First, we
extract structured reasoning patterns from successful trajectories and
reflective signals from failures. During inference, the model follows these
guidelines step-by-step, with refinement applied after each step to correct
errors and stabilize the reasoning process. Experiments on BBH and four
additional benchmarks (GSM8K, MATH-500, MBPP, HumanEval) show that our method
consistently outperforms strong baselines across diverse reasoning tasks.
Structured reasoning with stepwise execution and refinement improves stability
and generalization, while guidelines transfer well across domains and flexibly
support cross-model collaboration, matching or surpassing supervised
fine-tuning in effectiveness and scalability.

### [350] [Can AI Make Energy Retrofit Decisions? An Evaluation of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06307)
*Lei Shu,Dong Zhao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs can assist residential retrofit decisions with moderate accuracy, especially for technical CO2-reduction goals, but show low cross-model agreement and limited handling of sociotechnical context; interpretation and consistency require improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To test whether large language models can generalize across diverse residential contexts and provide practitioner-friendly retrofit recommendations for CO2 reduction and payback minimization, addressing gaps in generalizability and interpretability.

Method: Evaluate seven LLMs (ChatGPT, DeepSeek, Gemini, Grok, Llama, Claude; with others implied by text) on a dataset of 400 homes across 49 US states, for two objectives (technical CO2 reduction and sociotechnical payback minimization). Assess four dimensions—accuracy, consistency, sensitivity, and reasoning—without fine-tuning.

Result: LLMs produced effective recommendations in many cases, with top-1 match up to 54.5% and top-5 up to 92.8% without fine-tuning. Technical objective yielded stronger performance than sociotechnical. Agreement across models was low; higher-performing models tended to diverge. Models were sensitive to location and building geometry but less so to technology and occupant behavior. Most models used step-by-step engineering-style reasoning, which was often superficial and lacked deep contextual awareness.

Conclusion: LLMs show promise as decision-support tools for energy retrofit planning but require improvements in accuracy, cross-model consistency, and richer handling of local context and economic trade-offs to be reliable in practice.

Abstract: Conventional approaches to building energy retrofit decision making suffer
from limited generalizability and low interpretability, hindering adoption in
diverse residential contexts. With the growth of Smart and Connected
Communities, generative AI, especially large language models (LLMs), may help
by processing contextual information and producing practitioner readable
recommendations. We evaluate seven LLMs (ChatGPT, DeepSeek, Gemini, Grok,
Llama, and Claude) on residential retrofit decisions under two objectives:
maximizing CO2 reduction (technical) and minimizing payback period
(sociotechnical). Performance is assessed on four dimensions: accuracy,
consistency, sensitivity, and reasoning, using a dataset of 400 homes across 49
US states. LLMs generate effective recommendations in many cases, reaching up
to 54.5 percent top 1 match and 92.8 percent within top 5 without fine tuning.
Performance is stronger for the technical objective, while sociotechnical
decisions are limited by economic trade offs and local context. Agreement
across models is low, and higher performing models tend to diverge from others.
LLMs are sensitive to location and building geometry but less sensitive to
technology and occupant behavior. Most models show step by step, engineering
style reasoning, but it is often simplified and lacks deeper contextual
awareness. Overall, LLMs are promising assistants for energy retrofit decision
making, but improvements in accuracy, consistency, and context handling are
needed for reliable practice.

*Jianpeng Zhao,Chenyu Yuan,Weiming Luo,Haoling Xie,Guangwei Zhang,Steven Jige Quan,Zixuan Yuan,Pengyang Wang,Denghui Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes LLM-based simulation of survey respondents using PAS (partial attribute simulation) and FAS (full attribute simulation) to create scalable, demographically coherent synthetic data; introduces LLM-S^3 benchmark across 11 real datasets; evaluates multiple LLMs, analyzes context/prompt effects, and highlights both potential and limitations of this approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional surveys are costly, time-consuming, and limited in scale. Generating synthetic, demographically coherent responses with LLMs offers a scalable alternative for sociological research and policy evaluation, enabling large-scale testing and privacy-preserving data generation.

Method: Introduce two simulation settings: PAS (predict missing attributes from partial profiles) and FAS (generate full synthetic datasets under zero-context and context-enhanced conditions). Build LLM-S^3 benchmark across 11 real-world datasets in four sociological domains. Evaluate multiple mainstream LLMs (GPT-3.5/4 Turbo, LLaMA 3.0/3.1-8B), analyze prediction performance, failure modes, and the impact of context and prompt design on fidelity.

Result: LLMs exhibit consistent trends in predicting attributes and generating responses, but reveal notable failure modes. Context and prompt design significantly influence simulation fidelity; model choice also affects outcomes. The study demonstrates potential for scalable, cost-efficient survey simulations and provides a dataset/benchmark for future research.

Conclusion: LLM-driven survey simulations can provide a rigorous, scalable foundation for sociological research and policy evaluation, but require careful prompt engineering and awareness of biases and limitations. The work offers public code and data to support broader adoption and ongoing benchmarking.

Abstract: Questionnaire-based surveys are foundational to social science research and
public policymaking, yet traditional survey methods remain costly,
time-consuming, and often limited in scale. This paper explores a new paradigm:
simulating virtual survey respondents using Large Language Models (LLMs). We
introduce two novel simulation settings, namely Partial Attribute Simulation
(PAS) and Full Attribute Simulation (FAS), to systematically evaluate the
ability of LLMs to generate accurate and demographically coherent responses. In
PAS, the model predicts missing attributes based on partial respondent
profiles, whereas FAS involves generating complete synthetic datasets under
both zero-context and context-enhanced conditions. We curate a comprehensive
benchmark suite, LLM-S^3 (Large Language Model-based Sociodemographic Survey
Simulation), that spans 11 real-world public datasets across four sociological
domains. Our evaluation of multiple mainstream LLMs (GPT-3.5/4 Turbo, LLaMA
3.0/3.1-8B) reveals consistent trends in prediction performance, highlights
failure modes, and demonstrates how context and prompt design impact simulation
fidelity. This work establishes a rigorous foundation for LLM-driven survey
simulations, offering scalable and cost-effective tools for sociological
research and policy evaluation. Our code and dataset are available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of tracking cumulative buyer intents across long negotiations and to enable robust, multi-turn evaluation beyond simple outcome metrics in online marketplaces.

Method: 1) Construct a large-scale bargaining benchmark spanning 622 categories, 9,892 products, and 3,014 tasks. 2) Propose a turn-level evaluation framework grounded in Theory of Mind with annotated buyer intents. 3) Develop an automated pipeline that extracts reliable buyer intents from massive dialogue data.

Result: Introduces a scalable benchmark, a ToM-based turn-level evaluation framework, and an automated intent-extraction pipeline, enabling measurement of agents' ability to extract and track buyer intents in multi-turn negotiations.

Conclusion: The framework advances assessment and development of seller agents in e-commerce bargaining by focusing on multi-turn intent tracking and ToM-based reasoning under business constraints.

Abstract: In online second-hand marketplaces, multi-turn bargaining is a crucial part
of seller-buyer interactions. Large Language Models (LLMs) can act as seller
agents, negotiating with buyers on behalf of sellers under given business
constraints. A critical ability for such agents is to track and accurately
interpret cumulative buyer intents across long negotiations, which directly
impacts bargaining effectiveness. We introduce a multi-turn evaluation
framework for measuring the bargaining ability of seller agents in e-commerce
dialogues. The framework tests whether an agent can extract and track buyer
intents. Our contributions are: (1) a large-scale e-commerce bargaining
benchmark spanning 622 categories, 9,892 products, and 3,014 tasks; (2) a
turn-level evaluation framework grounded in Theory of Mind (ToM) with annotated
buyer intents, moving beyond outcome-only metrics; and (3) an automated
pipeline that extracts reliable intent from massive dialogue data.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DECOY introduces a high-level, discretized multi-agent simulator for 3D terrains that preserves low-level environmental fidelity by abstracting long-horizon planning. It uses a waypoint system and neural predictive/generative models trained on real CS:GO data to reproduce human-like replays using only movement decisions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To balance high-fidelity environmental detail with computational efficiency in complex multi-agent simulations, enabling strategic long-horizon planning without modeling low-level mechanics.

Method: A waypoint-based discretization of states and actions coupled with neural predictive/generative models trained on real CS:GO tournament data. The simulator operates on 3D terrains (CS:GO) and uses movement decisions for tactical positioning, reconstructing event outcomes without explicit low-level mechanics like aiming. Outputs are replays generated from human data.

Result: Extensive evaluations show that replays generated from human data in DECOY closely match those observed in the original CS:GO games, validating the fidelity of strategic planning and behavior generation within the discretized framework.

Conclusion: DECOY provides a publicly available tool that advances research in strategic multi-agent planning and behavior generation by offering a computationally efficient, high-fidelity simulator that can reproduce human-like gameplay through high-level decision modeling.

Abstract: Modern simulation environments for complex multi-agent interactions must
balance high-fidelity detail with computational efficiency. We present DECOY, a
novel multi-agent simulator that abstracts strategic, long-horizon planning in
3D terrains into high-level discretized simulation while preserving low-level
environmental fidelity. Using Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS:GO) as a
testbed, our framework accurately simulates gameplay using only movement
decisions as tactical positioning -- without explicitly modeling low-level
mechanics such as aiming and shooting. Central to our approach is a waypoint
system that simplifies and discretizes continuous states and actions, paired
with neural predictive and generative models trained on real CS:GO tournament
data to reconstruct event outcomes. Extensive evaluations show that replays
generated from human data in DECOY closely match those observed in the original
game. Our publicly available simulation environment provides a valuable tool
for advancing research in strategic multi-agent planning and behavior

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TOA is a multi-agent, tree-structured reasoning framework that chunks long inputs, enables cross-agent collaboration, and uses caching and pruning to improve long-context handling with compact models, reducing position bias and hallucinations while delivering strong performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long-context tasks suffer from information loss in the middle, reduced effectiveness when inputs are dropped, or attention dispersion when contexts are expanded. There is a need for scalable, robust long-context reasoning that works with smaller models.

Method: Split the input into chunks processed by independent agents. Agents generate local cognition and dynamically exchange information along tree-structured paths for collaborative reasoning. Explore multiple reasoning orders to diversify perspectives. Improve efficiency with prefix-hash caching and adaptive pruning. Implemented with compact LLaMA3.1-8B; code available.

Result: TOA significantly outperforms several baselines on long-context tasks and is comparable to Gemini1.5-pro, despite using a much smaller model. Efficiency gains from caching and pruning are achieved with comparable API overhead.

Conclusion: Tree of Agents provides robust, scalable long-context reasoning by leveraging multi-agent collaboration and efficient inference techniques, narrowing the gap between compact and large commercial models.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) face persistent challenges when handling
long-context tasks, most notably the lost in the middle issue, where
information located in the middle of a long input tends to be underutilized.
Some existing methods that reduce input have the risk of discarding key
information, while others that extend context windows often lead to attention
dispersion. To address these limitations, we propose Tree of Agents (TOA), a
multi-agent reasoning framework that segments the input into chunks processed
by independent agents. Each agent generates its local cognition, then agents
dynamically exchange information for collaborative reasoning along
tree-structured paths. TOA enables agents to probe different reasoning orders
for multi-perspective understanding, effectively mitigating position bias and
reducing hallucinations. To improve processing efficiency, we incorporate
prefix-hash caching and adaptive pruning strategies, achieving significant
performance improvements with comparable API overhead. Experiments show that
TOA, powered by compact LLaMA3.1-8B, significantly outperforms multiple
baselines and demonstrates comparable performance to the latest and much larger
commercial models, such as Gemini1.5-pro, on various long-context tasks. Code

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Federated RAG for hybrid healthcare data (SQL, graphs, notes) using edge-cloud collaboration to preserve privacy, with anonymization and multi-tier caching; shows improved retrieval, generation, and efficiency on PMC-Patients.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Centralized RAG struggles with privacy constraints and heterogeneity of healthcare data across SQL, knowledge graphs, and clinical notes. A federated approach can enable privacy-preserving access and reasoning across distributed, diverse data sources.

Method: Edge-cloud collaboration using Flower. Edge LLMs transform diverse data into privacy-preserving representations; server LLMs perform global reasoning. Lightweight local retrievers with privacy-aware LLMs; three anonymization tools for de-identified summaries. Three-tier caching (local, intermediate representation, cloud inference) to reduce latency and redundant computation.

Result: PMC-Patients experiments show HyFedRAG outperforms baselines in retrieval quality, generation consistency, and system efficiency.

Conclusion: HyFedRAG offers a scalable, privacy-compliant framework for RAG over structural-heterogeneous data, enabling effective LLM deployment in sensitive, diverse healthcare environments.

Abstract: Centralized RAG pipelines struggle with heterogeneous and privacy-sensitive
data, especially in distributed healthcare settings where patient data spans
SQL, knowledge graphs, and clinical notes. Clinicians face difficulties
retrieving rare disease cases due to privacy constraints and the limitations of
traditional cloud-based RAG systems in handling diverse formats and edge
devices. To address this, we introduce HyFedRAG, a unified and efficient
Federated RAG framework tailored for Hybrid data modalities. By leveraging an
edge-cloud collaborative mechanism, HyFedRAG enables RAG to operate across
diverse data sources while preserving data privacy. Our key contributions are:
(1) We design an edge-cloud collaborative RAG framework built on Flower, which
supports querying structured SQL data, semi-structured knowledge graphs, and
unstructured documents. The edge-side LLMs convert diverse data into
standardized privacy-preserving representations, and the server-side LLMs
integrates them for global reasoning and generation. (2) We integrate
lightweight local retrievers with privacy-aware LLMs and provide three
anonymization tools that enable each client to produce semantically rich,
de-identified summaries for global inference across devices. (3) To optimize
response latency and reduce redundant computation, we design a three-tier
caching strategy consisting of local cache, intermediate representation cache,
and cloud inference cache. Experimental results on PMC-Patients demonstrate
that HyFedRAG outperforms existing baselines in terms of retrieval quality,
generation consistency, and system efficiency. Our framework offers a scalable
and privacy-compliant solution for RAG over structural-heterogeneous data,
unlocking the potential of LLMs in sensitive and diverse data environments.

*Chengwei Wu,Li Du,Hanyu Zhao,Yiming Ju,Jiapu Wang,Tengfei Pan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes an instruction data selection method that jointly maximizes instruction depth and semantic coverage to boost alignment performance and enable faster scaling as the candidate pool grows.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As large language models are aligned via instruction datasets, expanding candidate pools makes selecting informative instructions harder. Understanding which factors drive the relationship between instruction distributions and model performance is essential to maintain gains with scaling.

Method: The authors analyze factors influencing instruction distributions and model performance, identify depth and semantic coverage as key determinants, and design a selection algorithm that simultaneously maximizes both. They validate the approach with experiments showing that the method explains a large portion of the loss (over 70%) on the development set and outperforms baselines.

Result: The proposed method sustainably improves model performance faster than state-of-the-art baselines and scales better as the instruction pool expands, achieving accelerated scaling.

Conclusion: Focusing on instruction depth and semantic coverage yields a scalable, effective data-selection strategy for aligning models, enabling faster performance gains with growing instruction pools.

Abstract: With the growing demand for applying large language models to downstream
tasks, improving model alignment performance and efficiency has become crucial.
Such a process involves selecting informative instructions from a candidate
pool. However, due to the complexity of instruction set distributions, the key
factors driving the performance of aligned models remain unclear. As a result,
current instruction set refinement methods fail to improve performance as the
instruction pool expands continuously. To address this issue, we first
investigate the key factors that influence the relationship between instruction
dataset distribution and aligned model performance. Based on these insights, we
propose a novel instruction data selection method. We identify that the depth
of instructions and the coverage of the semantic space are the crucial factors
determining downstream performance, which could explain over 70\% of the model
loss on the development set. We then design an instruction selection algorithm
to simultaneously maximize the depth and semantic coverage of the selected
instructions. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared to
state-of-the-art baseline methods, it can sustainably improve model performance

*Pengxiang Zhao,Guangyi Liu,Yaozhen Liang,Weiqing He,Zhengxi Lu,Yuehao Huang,Yaxuan Guo,Kexin Zhang,Hao Wang,Liang Liu,Yong Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MAS-Bench introduces a mobile-focused benchmark for GUI-shortcut hybrid agents, enabling autonomous shortcut generation with 139 tasks, 88 predefined shortcuts, and 7 metrics; experiments show hybrids outperform GUI-only agents, establishing a foundation for evaluating shortcut-generation capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a lack of systematic benchmarks for hybrid GUI-shortcut agents, hindering development of efficient, robust agents across platforms. A benchmark focused on mobile GUI-shortcut hybrids is needed to evaluate shortcut discovery and reuse.

Method: MAS-Bench defines 139 complex tasks across 11 real-world mobile apps, plus a knowledge base of 88 predefined shortcuts (APIs, deep-links, RPA scripts), and 7 evaluation metrics; tasks are solvable by GUI but accelerated by incorporating shortcuts. The framework enables agents to autonomously generate and reuse low-cost workflows and measures their performance.

Result: Hybrid agents achieved significantly higher success rates and efficiency than GUI-only agents, validating the benchmark and demonstrating effective shortcut-generation evaluation.

Conclusion: MAS-Bench fills a critical evaluation gap in mobile GUI agents and provides a foundational platform for future research to build more efficient, robust hybrid agents.

Abstract: To enhance the efficiency of GUI agents on various platforms like smartphones
and computers, a hybrid paradigm that combines flexible GUI operations with
efficient shortcuts (e.g., API, deep links) is emerging as a promising
direction. However, a framework for systematically benchmarking these hybrid
agents is still underexplored. To take the first step in bridging this gap, we
introduce MAS-Bench, a benchmark that pioneers the evaluation of GUI-shortcut
hybrid agents with a specific focus on the mobile domain. Beyond merely using
predefined shortcuts, MAS-Bench assesses an agent's capability to autonomously
generate shortcuts by discovering and creating reusable, low-cost workflows. It
features 139 complex tasks across 11 real-world applications, a knowledge base
of 88 predefined shortcuts (APIs, deep-links, RPA scripts), and 7 evaluation
metrics. The tasks are designed to be solvable via GUI-only operations, but can
be significantly accelerated by intelligently embedding shortcuts. Experiments
show that hybrid agents achieve significantly higher success rates and
efficiency than their GUI-only counterparts. This result also demonstrates the
effectiveness of our method for evaluating an agent's shortcut generation
capabilities. MAS-Bench fills a critical evaluation gap, providing a
foundational platform for future advancements in creating more efficient and
robust intelligent agents.

*Niki Kotecha,Ehecatl Antonio del Rio Chanona*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A framework that combines Reinforcement Learning and Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithms with CVaR for dynamic, risk-aware multi-objective optimization in supply chains, producing a Pareto front of policies for real-time, robust decision-making.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Supply chains face multiple conflicting objectives (cost, service, sustainability) under dynamic uncertainty. Traditional optimization methods struggle to adapt in real time, requiring a flexible, robust approach.

Method: Use MOEAs to search the parameter space of policy neural networks, generating a Pareto front of policies. Integrate Reinforcement Learning to optimize policies, and incorporate Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) to handle risk. Apply to dynamic, uncertain supply chain scenarios with inventory management as a case study.

Result: The approach is effective, capable of responding to supply chain dynamics, and outperforms state-of-the-art methods in the inventory management case study, offering improved decision-making efficiency and robustness.

Conclusion: The proposed framework provides a flexible, robust tool for dynamic, risk-aware multi-objective optimization in supply chains, enabling real-time policy adaptation through a Pareto-rich set of options.

Abstract: In supply chain management, decision-making often involves balancing multiple
conflicting objectives, such as cost reduction, service level improvement, and
environmental sustainability. Traditional multi-objective optimization methods,
such as linear programming and evolutionary algorithms, struggle to adapt in
real-time to the dynamic nature of supply chains. In this paper, we propose an
approach that combines Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Multi-Objective
Evolutionary Algorithms (MOEAs) to address these challenges for dynamic
multi-objective optimization under uncertainty. Our method leverages MOEAs to
search the parameter space of policy neural networks, generating a Pareto front
of policies. This provides decision-makers with a diverse population of
policies that can be dynamically switched based on the current system
objectives, ensuring flexibility and adaptability in real-time decision-making.
We also introduce Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) to incorporate
risk-sensitive decision-making, enhancing resilience in uncertain environments.
We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through case studies,
showcasing its ability to respond to supply chain dynamics and outperforming
state-of-the-art methods in an inventory management case study. The proposed
strategy not only improves decision-making efficiency but also offers a more
robust framework for managing uncertainty and optimizing performance in supply
chains.

*Ran Xin,Zeyu Zheng,Yanchen Nie,Kun Yuan,Xia Xiao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: BFS-Prover-V2 presents dual-scaling for LLM-based automated theorem proving: an AlphaZero-inspired multi-turn off-policy RL framework for training-time improvement, and a planner-enhanced multi-agent search architecture for inference-time scaling, achieving state-of-the-art on MiniF2F and ProofNet.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: to overcome two bottlenecks in scaling LLM-driven theorem provers: training-time reinforcement learning and inference-time search/compute, while enabling long-horizon multi-turn reasoning.

Method: two innovations: 1) multi-turn off-policy RL with multi-stage expert iteration, adaptive tactic-level data filtering, periodic retraining; 2) planner-enhanced multi-agent search using a high-level planner to decompose theorems into subgoals, shared proof cache enabling parallel agents.

Result: state-of-the-art results on MiniF2F (95.08%) and ProofNet (41.4%).

Conclusion: the RL and inference techniques are broadly applicable to other domains requiring long-horizon reasoning and complex search beyond formal mathematics.

Abstract: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into automated theorem
proving has shown immense promise, yet is fundamentally constrained by
challenges in scaling up both training-time reinforcement learning (RL) and
inference-time compute. This paper introduces \texttt{BFS-Prover-V2}, a system
designed to address this dual scaling problem. We present two primary
innovations. The first is a novel multi-turn off-policy RL framework for
continually improving the performance of LLM step-prover at training time. This
framework, inspired by the principles of AlphaZero, utilizes a multi-stage
expert iteration pipeline featuring adaptive tactic-level data filtering and
periodic retraining to surmount the performance plateaus that typically curtail
long-term RL in LLM-based agents. The second innovation is a planner-enhanced
multi-agent search architecture that scales reasoning capabilities at inference
time. This architecture employs a general reasoning model as a high-level
planner to iteratively decompose complex theorems into a sequence of simpler
subgoals. This hierarchical approach substantially reduces the search space,
enabling a team of parallel prover agents to collaborate efficiently by
leveraging a shared proof cache. We demonstrate that this dual approach to
scaling yields state-of-the-art results on established formal mathematics
benchmarks. \texttt{BFS-Prover-V2} achieves 95.08\% and 41.4\% on the MiniF2F
and ProofNet test sets respectively. While demonstrated in the domain of formal
mathematics, the RL and inference techniques presented in this work are of
broader interest and may be applied to other domains requiring long-horizon
multi-turn reasoning and complex search.

TL;DR: An AI system combines a large language model with tree search to automatically generate expert-level scientific software aimed at maximizing a quality metric, achieving state-of-the-art results across multiple domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Scientific progress is slowed by the manual and bespoke development of software for computational experiments; an automated system could accelerate discovery by producing high-quality tools continuously.

Method: Leverages a Large Language Model (LLM) guided tree search to iteratively improve a defined quality metric, enabling intelligent navigation of a large solution space and integration of external research ideas to generate software.

Result: The approach yields expert-level results: in bioinformatics, 40 novel methods for single-cell data analysis outperform top human methods on public benchmarks; in epidemiology, 14 models beat the CDC ensemble and all other individual models for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations; the system also produces state-of-the-art software for geospatial analysis, neural activity prediction in zebrafish, time series forecasting, and numerical integration.

Conclusion: A significant step toward accelerating scientific progress by automatically creating high-quality scientific software, with demonstrated cross-domain effectiveness and potential for broad applicability.

Abstract: The cycle of scientific discovery is frequently bottlenecked by the slow,
manual creation of software to support computational experiments. To address
this, we present an AI system that creates expert-level scientific software
whose goal is to maximize a quality metric. The system uses a Large Language
Model (LLM) and Tree Search (TS) to systematically improve the quality metric
and intelligently navigate the large space of possible solutions. The system
achieves expert-level results when it explores and integrates complex research
ideas from external sources. The effectiveness of tree search is demonstrated
across a wide range of benchmarks. In bioinformatics, it discovered 40 novel
methods for single-cell data analysis that outperformed the top human-developed
methods on a public leaderboard. In epidemiology, it generated 14 models that
outperformed the CDC ensemble and all other individual models for forecasting
COVID-19 hospitalizations. Our method also produced state-of-the-art software
for geospatial analysis, neural activity prediction in zebrafish, time series
forecasting and numerical solution of integrals. By devising and implementing
novel solutions to diverse tasks, the system represents a significant step
towards accelerating scientific progress.

*Zhou-Peng Shou,Zhi-Qiang You,Fang Wang,Hai-Bo Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A zero-shot, plug-and-play three-module framework—Intent Perceiver, Strategy Generator, Strategy Selector—creates an 'intent sketch' to guide cross-modal reasoning, reducing shortcuts without fine-tuning and achieving robust gains across datasets and pipelines (up to ~9.5 percentage points).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address shortcuts and shallow contextual understanding in complex cross-modal reasoning by introducing a human-like, intent-driven cognitive process that works in zero-shot settings without parameter tuning.

Method: A three-module pipeline that builds an 'understand-plan-select' cognitive loop: Intent Perceiver generates candidate 'intent sketches', Strategy Generator refines and expands them, and Strategy Selector selects the best one to guide final reasoning. The method uses in-context engineering and information-theoretic analysis to reduce conditional entropy and improve information utilization, thereby mitigating unintended shortcuts.

Result: The approach shows generality and robustness across reasoning engines and pipeline combinations, producing consistent improvements over baselines with gains up to about 9.51 percentage points on IntentBench, WorldSense, and Daily-Omni.

Conclusion: The 'intent sketch' reasoning component is practical and portable for zero-shot multimodal reasoning, effectively reducing shortcuts and enhancing information efficiency without requiring fine-tuning.

Abstract: Targeting the issues of "shortcuts" and insufficient contextual understanding
in complex cross-modal reasoning of multimodal large models, this paper
proposes a zero-shot multimodal reasoning component guided by human-like
cognitive strategies centered on an "intent sketch". The component comprises a
plug-and-play three-module pipeline-Intent Perceiver, Strategy Generator, and
Strategy Selector-that explicitly constructs a "understand-plan-select"
cognitive process. By generating and filtering "intent sketch" strategies to
guide the final reasoning, it requires no parameter fine-tuning and achieves
cross-model transfer solely through in-context engineering.
Information-theoretic analysis shows that this process can reduce conditional
entropy and improve information utilization efficiency, thereby suppressing
unintended shortcut reasoning. Experiments on IntentBench, WorldSense, and
Daily-Omni validate the method's generality and robust gains; compared with
their respective baselines, the complete "three-module" scheme yields
consistent improvements across different reasoning engines and pipeline
combinations, with gains up to approximately 9.51 percentage points,
demonstrating the practical value and portability of the "intent sketch"
reasoning component in zero-shot scenarios.

*Wenjun Li,Zhi Chen,Jingru Lin,Hannan Cao,Wei Han,Sheng Liang,Zhi Zhang,Kuicai Dong,Dexun Li,Chen Zhang,Yong Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This survey foregrounds reinforcement learning (RL) as essential for building hierarchical, tool-using deep research systems, and offers a taxonomy and practical guidance across data, RL methods, and training infrastructures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: End-to-end training of entire deep research stacks is impractical; supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and preference methods (e.g., DPO) suffer biases and weak long-horizon credit assignment. RL enables closed-loop interaction, exploration, recovery, and multi-objective trade-offs without heavy reliance on human priors.

Method: A systematic survey (following DeepSeek-R1) organized along three axes: (i) data synthesis and curation; (ii) RL methods for agentic research (stability, sample efficiency, long context handling, reward/credit design, multi-objective optimization, multimodal integration); (iii) agentic RL training systems and frameworks. It also examines agent architecture/coordination and evaluation benchmarks (QA, VQA, long-form synthesis, domain-grounded tool interaction).

Result: First dedicated RL foundations survey for deep research systems; provides a structured taxonomy, synthesizes relevant literature, identifies recurring patterns and infrastructure bottlenecks, and offers practical guidance for building robust, transparent agentic RL systems.

Conclusion: RL aligns with closed-loop tool interaction, enabling exploration, recovery, principled credit assignment, and reduced reliance on hand-crafted priors; this survey fills a gap in the literature and guides future work toward robust, transparent agentic agents and scalable training architectures.

Abstract: Deep research systems, agentic AI that solve complex, multi-step tasks by
coordinating reasoning, search across the open web and user files, and tool
use, are moving toward hierarchical deployments with a Planner, Coordinator,
and Executors. In practice, training entire stacks end-to-end remains
impractical, so most work trains a single planner connected to core tools such
as search, browsing, and code. While SFT imparts protocol fidelity, it suffers
from imitation and exposure biases and underuses environment feedback.
Preference alignment methods such as DPO are schema and proxy-dependent,
off-policy, and weak for long-horizon credit assignment and multi-objective
trade-offs. A further limitation of SFT and DPO is their reliance on human
defined decision points and subskills through schema design and labeled
comparisons. Reinforcement learning aligns with closed-loop, tool-interaction
research by optimizing trajectory-level policies, enabling exploration,
recovery behaviors, and principled credit assignment, and it reduces dependence
on such human priors and rater biases.
  This survey is, to our knowledge, the first dedicated to the RL foundations
of deep research systems. It systematizes work after DeepSeek-R1 along three
axes: (i) data synthesis and curation; (ii) RL methods for agentic research
covering stability, sample efficiency, long context handling, reward and credit
design, multi-objective optimization, and multimodal integration; and (iii)
agentic RL training systems and frameworks. We also cover agent architecture
and coordination, as well as evaluation and benchmarks, including recent QA,
VQA, long-form synthesis, and domain-grounded, tool-interaction tasks. We
distill recurring patterns, surface infrastructure bottlenecks, and offer
practical guidance for training robust, transparent deep research agents with
RL.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: VehicleWorld provides a comprehensive automotive environment to evaluate vehicle agents; direct state prediction beats function calling; State-based Function Call (SFC) maintains explicit state and improves performance; code available on GitHub.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Intelligent vehicle cockpits require coordinating tightly coupled subsystems, often beyond the scope of conventional task environments. Stateless Function Calling (FC) is inefficient for environmental awareness and error recovery in such domains; a robust, executable automotive environment plus state-aware control method is needed.

Method: Introduce VehicleWorld, a large-scale automotive environment with 30 modules, 250 APIs, and 680 properties with fully executable implementations that expose real-time state during agent execution. Systematically compare FC and direct state prediction, leading to the State-based Function Call (SFC) that uses explicit state and direct state transitions to achieve target conditions. Evaluate across diverse, challenging scenarios.

Result: Direct state prediction outperforms function calling for environmental control. SFC significantly improves execution accuracy and reduces latency compared to traditional FC. VehicleWorld enables precise evaluation of vehicle agent behaviors. All code is publicly available on GitHub.

Conclusion: State-aware control with explicit state management (SFC) is a superior approach for complex, stateful automotive agent coordination. VehicleWorld provides a valuable benchmark platform for robust evaluation and development of automotive AI agents.

Abstract: Intelligent vehicle cockpits present unique challenges for API Agents,
requiring coordination across tightly-coupled subsystems that exceed typical
task environments' complexity. Traditional Function Calling (FC) approaches
operate statelessly, requiring multiple exploratory calls to build
environmental awareness before execution, leading to inefficiency and limited
error recovery. We introduce VehicleWorld, the first comprehensive environment
for the automotive domain, featuring 30 modules, 250 APIs, and 680 properties
with fully executable implementations that provide real-time state information
during agent execution. This environment enables precise evaluation of vehicle
agent behaviors across diverse, challenging scenarios. Through systematic
analysis, we discovered that direct state prediction outperforms function
calling for environmental control. Building on this insight, we propose
State-based Function Call (SFC), a novel approach that maintains explicit
system state awareness and implements direct state transitions to achieve
target conditions. Experimental results demonstrate that SFC significantly
outperforms traditional FC approaches, achieving superior execution accuracy
and reduced latency. We have made all implementation code publicly available on
Github https://github.com/OpenMOSS/VehicleWorld.

### [365] [Another Turn, Better Output? A Turn-Wise Analysis of Iterative LLM Prompting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06770)
*Shashidhar Reddy Javaji,Bhavul Gauri,Zining Zhu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes a domain-agnostic evaluation framework for iterative refinement in LLM-driven workflows (ideation, coding, math), using controlled 12-turn tasks, varied prompts, and per-turn logs with domain-specific checks and three families of turn-level metrics to measure semantic movement, change, and output growth.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To quantify when iterative refinement helps or hurts LLM performance and to enable fair cross-model comparisons across domains by providing standardized measurements of iterations.

Method: A controlled protocol with 12-turn conversations per task across ideation, code, and math. Uses a spectrum of prompts from vague feedback to targeted steering. Logs per-turn outputs. Evaluates outcomes with domain-specific checks (unit tests for code; answer-equivalence plus reasoning-soundness for math; originality and feasibility for ideation). Tracks turn-level behavior via three metric families: semantic movement across turns, turn-to-turn change, and output size growth.

Result: Findings are domain-dependent: gains from iteration appear early in ideation and code but later in math when elaboration guides the process. Vague feedback tends to plateau or harm correctness after a few turns, while targeted prompts consistently shift quality (novelty vs feasibility in ideation; speed vs readability in code; elaboration outperforms exploration in math). Domain patterns persist: ideation shows more meaning progression across turns, code tends to grow in size with limited semantic change, and math starts fixed but can be steered by late elaboration. The framework enables measuring iteration, comparing models, and signaling when to steer, stop, or switch strategies.

Conclusion: The proposed framework and metrics enable systematic, cross-model evaluation of iterative refinement in LLM workflows, reveal domain-specific best practices (e.g., when to elaborate in math, when to steer in ideation/code), and provide actionable guidance on steering and stopping strategies.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are now used in multi-turn workflows, but we
still lack a clear way to measure when iteration helps and when it hurts. We
present an evaluation framework for iterative refinement that spans ideation,
code, and math. Our protocol runs controlled 12-turn conversations per task,
utilizing a variety of prompts ranging from vague ``improve it'' feedback to
targeted steering, and logs per-turn outputs. We score outcomes with
domain-appropriate checks (unit tests for code; answer-equivalence plus
reasoning-soundness for math; originality and feasibility for ideation) and
track turn-level behavior with three families of metrics: semantic movement
across turns, turn-to-turn change, and output size growth. Across models and
tasks, gains are domain-dependent: they arrive early in ideas and code, but in
math late turns matter when guided by elaboration. After the first few turns,
vague feedback often plateaus or reverses correctness, while targeted prompts
reliably shift the intended quality axis (novelty vs. feasibility in ideation;
speed vs. readability in code; in math, elaboration outperforms exploration and
drives late-turn gains). We also observe consistent domain patterns: ideation
moves more in meaning across turns, code tends to grow in size with little
semantic change, and math starts fixed but can break that path with late,
elaborative iteration.Together, the framework and metrics make iteration
measurable and comparable across models, and signal when to steer, stop, or
switch strategies.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RAFFLES introduces an iterative, multi-component evaluation architecture for long-horizon LLM agentic systems, using a central Judge and specialized Evaluators to diagnose faults and refine hypotheses, yielding substantial performance gains on Who&When benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluation methods are limited to single-pass metrics and human preferences, hindering understanding of complex long-horizon reasoning and failure modes in agentic systems.

Method: RAFFLES uses an iterative pipeline with a central Judge and multiple Evaluators; builds a history of hypotheses; tests on Who&When dataset; compares against baselines.

Result: Achieves agent-step fault pair accuracy >43% on Algorithmically-Generated dataset (vs 16.6% best) and >20% on Hand-Crafted dataset (vs 8.8% best); demonstrates automated fault detection potential.

Conclusion: Automates fault detection for autonomous systems, reducing reliance on labor-intensive human review; a key step toward robust evaluation of long-horizon agentic capabilities.

Abstract: We have reached a critical roadblock in the development and enhancement of
long-horizon, multi-component LLM agentic systems: it is incredibly tricky to
identify where these systems break down and why. Evaluation capabilities that
currently exist today (e.g., single pass LLM-as-a-judge) are limited in that
they often focus on individual metrics or capabilities, end-to-end outcomes,
and are narrowly grounded on the preferences of humans. We argue that to match
the agentic capabilities, evaluation frameworks must also be able to reason,
probe, iterate, and understand the complex logic passing through these systems
over long horizons. In this paper, we present RAFFLES - an evaluation
architecture that incorporates reasoning and iterative refinement.
Specifically, RAFFLES operates as an iterative, multi-component pipeline, using
a central Judge to systematically investigate faults and a set of specialized
Evaluators to assess not only the system's components but also the quality of
the reasoning by the Judge itself, thereby building a history of hypotheses. We
tested RAFFLES against several baselines on the Who&When dataset, a benchmark
designed to diagnose the "who" (agent) and "when" (step) of a system's failure.
RAFFLES outperforms these baselines, achieving an agent-step fault pair
accuracy of over 43% on the Algorithmically-Generated dataset (a substantial
increase from the previously published best of 16.6%) and over 20% on the
Hand-Crafted dataset (surpassing the previously published best of 8.8%). These
results demonstrate a key step towards introducing automated fault detection
for autonomous systems over labor-intensive manual human review.

### [367] [Test-Time Scaling in Reasoning Models Is Not Effective for Knowledge-Intensive Tasks Yet](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06861)
*James Xu Zhao,Bryan Hooi,See-Kiong Ng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Test-time scaling for long reasoning chains does not reliably improve accuracy in knowledge-intensive tasks and can raise hallucinations; gains often come from abstention after reasoning rather than improved recall, though thinking is still better than not thinking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Evaluate the effectiveness of test-time reasoning (thinking) for factual knowledge-heavy tasks, characterizing its impact on accuracy, hallucinations, abstention, and biases across multiple models and benchmarks.

Method: Empirically evaluate 12 reasoning models on two knowledge-intensive benchmarks, comparing accuracy and hallucination rates with varying at-test time computation; analyze how extended reasoning affects hallucinations, with case studies on abstention, recall, and confirmation bias; contrast with non-thinking baselines; provide code/data.

Result: Increasing test-time computation does not consistently improve accuracy and can increase hallucinations. Reduced hallucinations often arise from the model abstaining after thinking rather than enhanced recall, while longer reasoning can encourage attempts on unanswered questions, leading to more hallucinations. Case studies show extended reasoning may cause confirmation bias and overconfident hallucinations. Nevertheless, thinking remains beneficial compared to not thinking.

Conclusion: Test-time reasoning is not a universal solution for knowledge-intensive tasks; it can help but also introduce new failure modes (hallucinations, bias). Future work should aim to mitigate hallucinations while preserving the benefits of reasoning, and the authors provide code and data for replication.

Abstract: Test-time scaling increases inference-time computation by allowing models to
generate long reasoning chains, and has shown strong performance across many
domains. However, in this work, we show that this approach is not yet effective
for knowledge-intensive tasks, where high factual accuracy and low
hallucination rates are essential. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of
test-time scaling using 12 reasoning models on two knowledge-intensive
benchmarks. Our results reveal that increasing test-time computation does not
consistently improve accuracy and, in many cases, it even leads to more
hallucinations. We then analyze how extended reasoning affects hallucination
behavior. We find that reduced hallucinations often result from the model
choosing to abstain after thinking more, rather than from improved factual
recall. Conversely, for some models, longer reasoning encourages attempts on
previously unanswered questions, many of which result in hallucinations. Case
studies show that extended reasoning can induce confirmation bias, leading to
overconfident hallucinations. Despite these limitations, we observe that
compared to non-thinking, enabling thinking remains beneficial. Code and data

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Paper2Agent converts research papers into interactive AI agents by analyzing the paper and codebase with multiple agents to build a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server, enabling natural-language queries via a chat agent and access to the original workflows. Demonstrated with AlphaGenome, ScanPy, and TISSUE for single-cell and spatial transcriptomics analyses; agents can reproduce results and handle novel queries, suggesting a shift from static papers to dynamic co-scientist systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Static scientific papers pose barriers to dissemination, reuse, and reproducibility because readers must extract code, data, and methods manually. An automated agent-based framework could accelerate adoption, experimentation, and discovery by turning papers into active knowledge systems.

Method: The approach uses multiple agents to analyze the paper and its codebase to construct a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server. It iteratively generates and runs tests to refine and robustify the MCP. The resulting MCPs can be connected to a chat agent (e.g., Claude Code) to perform complex scientific queries by invoking tools/workflows from the original paper. Case studies demonstrate agents built around AlphaGenome, ScanPy, and TISSUE for genomics and transcriptomics tasks.

Result: Paper2Agent successfully creates reliable paper agents that can reproduce the original results and tackle novel user queries. The agents demonstrate the ability to interpret genomic variants and conduct single-cell/spatial transcriptomics analyses by leveraging the original software stacks.

Conclusion: Transforming static research papers into dynamic AI agents enables new modes of knowledge dissemination and collaboration, laying groundwork for an ecosystem of AI co-scientists that accelerates scientific progress.

Abstract: We introduce Paper2Agent, an automated framework that converts research
papers into AI agents. Paper2Agent transforms research output from passive
artifacts into active systems that can accelerate downstream use, adoption, and
discovery. Conventional research papers require readers to invest substantial
effort to understand and adapt a paper's code, data, and methods to their own
work, creating barriers to dissemination and reuse. Paper2Agent addresses this
challenge by automatically converting a paper into an AI agent that acts as a
knowledgeable research assistant. It systematically analyzes the paper and the
associated codebase using multiple agents to construct a Model Context Protocol
(MCP) server, then iteratively generates and runs tests to refine and robustify
the resulting MCP. These paper MCPs can then be flexibly connected to a chat
agent (e.g. Claude Code) to carry out complex scientific queries through
natural language while invoking tools and workflows from the original paper. We
demonstrate Paper2Agent's effectiveness in creating reliable and capable paper
agents through in-depth case studies. Paper2Agent created an agent that
leverages AlphaGenome to interpret genomic variants and agents based on ScanPy
and TISSUE to carry out single-cell and spatial transcriptomics analyses. We
validate that these paper agents can reproduce the original paper's results and
can correctly carry out novel user queries. By turning static papers into
dynamic, interactive AI agents, Paper2Agent introduces a new paradigm for
knowledge dissemination and a foundation for the collaborative ecosystem of AI
co-scientists.

*Xiangwei Shen,Zhimin Li,Zhantao Yang,Shiyi Zhang,Yingfang Zhang,Donghao Li,Chunyu Wang,Qinglin Lu,Yansong Tang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Efficient direct alignment of diffusion models to human preferences via Direct-Align and SRPO, enabling online reward adaptation and outperforming baselines by over 3x in realism/aesthetics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current reward-alignment methods rely on costly multistep denoising with gradient-based rewards and offline reward fine-tuning to reach aesthetic goals; this limits timesteps and adaptability.

Method: Direct-Align predefines a noise prior and uses interpolation to recover original images from any timestep, reducing over-optimization in late steps. SRPO uses text-conditioned rewards to allow online adjustment via prompt augmentation. The model FLUX.1.dev is fine-tuned with optimized denoising and online reward adjustment.

Result: Human-evaluated realism and aesthetic quality improve by more than 3x.

Conclusion: The approach mitigates computational burden and enables online, adaptable reward optimization, yielding substantial gains in image realism and aesthetics.

Abstract: Recent studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of directly aligning
diffusion models with human preferences using differentiable reward. However,
they exhibit two primary challenges: (1) they rely on multistep denoising with
gradient computation for reward scoring, which is computationally expensive,
thus restricting optimization to only a few diffusion steps; (2) they often
need continuous offline adaptation of reward models in order to achieve desired
aesthetic quality, such as photorealism or precise lighting effects. To address
the limitation of multistep denoising, we propose Direct-Align, a method that
predefines a noise prior to effectively recover original images from any time
steps via interpolation, leveraging the equation that diffusion states are
interpolations between noise and target images, which effectively avoids
over-optimization in late timesteps. Furthermore, we introduce Semantic
Relative Preference Optimization (SRPO), in which rewards are formulated as
text-conditioned signals. This approach enables online adjustment of rewards in
response to positive and negative prompt augmentation, thereby reducing the
reliance on offline reward fine-tuning. By fine-tuning the FLUX.1.dev model
with optimized denoising and online reward adjustment, we improve its
human-evaluated realism and aesthetic quality by over 3x.
