### [1] [nuCarla: A nuScenes-Style Bird's-Eye View Perception Dataset for CARLA Simulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13744)
*Zhijie Qiao,Zhong Cao,Henry X. Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: nuCarla: a nuScenes-style, large-scale BEV perception dataset in CARLA designed for closed-loop end-to-end autonomous driving. It features nuScenes-format compatibility, balanced class distributions, direct usability for closed-loop simulation, and high-performance BEV backbones achieving state-of-the-art detection. Provides data and models as open benchmarks to accelerate safe E2E research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of standardized, large-scale, thoroughly verified BEV datasets for closed-loop E2E learning, enabling transfer of real-world perception models, robust BEV representations, and reliable closed-loop evaluation in simulation.

Method: Develop nuCarla inside the CARLA simulator, ensure full nuScenes-format compatibility, scale the dataset to nuScenes-like size with balanced class distributions, make it directly usable for closed-loop deployment, and provide high-performance BEV backbone models; release data and models as open benchmarks.

Result: A new BEV perception dataset and accompanying models (within CARLA) that enable closed-loop E2E testing, with BEV backbones achieving state-of-the-art detection results and nuScenes compatibility facilitating real-world transfer.

Conclusion: nuCarla is poised to significantly accelerate closed-loop E2E autonomous driving research by providing standardized, scalable data, open benchmarks, and compatible models for simulation-based testing and safer, more reliable development.

Abstract: End-to-end (E2E) autonomous driving heavily relies on closed-loop simulation, where perception, planning, and control are jointly trained and evaluated in interactive environments. Yet, most existing datasets are collected from the real world under non-interactive conditions, primarily supporting open-loop learning while offering limited value for closed-loop testing. Due to the lack of standardized, large-scale, and thoroughly verified datasets to facilitate learning of meaningful intermediate representations, such as bird's-eye-view (BEV) features, closed-loop E2E models remain far behind even simple rule-based baselines. To address this challenge, we introduce nuCarla, a large-scale, nuScenes-style BEV perception dataset built within the CARLA simulator. nuCarla features (1) full compatibility with the nuScenes format, enabling seamless transfer of real-world perception models; (2) a dataset scale comparable to nuScenes, but with more balanced class distributions; (3) direct usability for closed-loop simulation deployment; and (4) high-performance BEV backbones that achieve state-of-the-art detection results. By providing both data and models as open benchmarks, nuCarla substantially accelerates closed-loop E2E development, paving the way toward reliable and safety-aware research in autonomous driving.

### [2] [Known Meets Unknown: Mitigating Overconfidence in Open Set Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13775)
*Dongdong Zhao,Ranxin Fang,Changtian Song,Zhihui Liu,Jianwen Xiang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A two-component framework mitigates overconfidence in open set recognition by combining perturbation-based uncertainty estimation with a two-stage unknown detection classifier, achieving state-of-the-art results on three datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Open Set Recognition (OSR) models often misclassify unknown samples as known classes when unknowns are semantically similar, due to inter-class feature space overlap. This leads to overconfidence and blurred decision boundaries. There is a need for reliable uncertainty estimation and a discriminative unknown-detection mechanism to improve OSR.

Method: 1) Perturbation-based uncertainty estimation module: applies controllable parameter perturbations to generate diverse predictions and quantify predictive uncertainty. 2) Unknown detection module: uses distinct learning-based classifiers in a two-stage procedure, leveraging estimated uncertainty to better discriminate known vs unknown samples.

Result: Experimental results on three public datasets show superior performance of the proposed framework compared with existing OSR methods.

Conclusion: The framework effectively mitigates overconfidence caused by inter-class overlap, improving OSR performance by more accurately separating known and unknown classes; results suggest robustness and potential generalizability across datasets.

Abstract: Open Set Recognition (OSR) requires models not only to accurately classify known classes but also to effectively reject unknown samples. However, when unknown samples are semantically similar to known classes, inter-class overlap in the feature space often causes models to assign unjustifiably high confidence to them, leading to misclassification as known classes -- a phenomenon known as overconfidence. This overconfidence undermines OSR by blurring the decision boundary between known and unknown classes. To address this issue, we propose a framework that explicitly mitigates overconfidence caused by inter-class overlap. The framework consists of two components: a perturbation-based uncertainty estimation module, which applies controllable parameter perturbations to generate diverse predictions and quantify predictive uncertainty, and an unknown detection module with distinct learning-based classifiers, implemented as a two-stage procedure, which leverages the estimated uncertainty to improve discrimination between known and unknown classes, thereby enhancing OSR performance. Experimental results on three public datasets show that the proposed framework achieves superior performance over existing OSR methods.

### [3] [Temporal Object-Aware Vision Transformer for Few-Shot Video Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13784)
*Yogesh Kumar,Anand Mishra*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel object-aware temporal propagation method for few-shot video object detection that filters and propagates high-confidence features across frames, avoiding explicit region proposals and yielding robust improvements across multiple benchmarks in the 5-shot setting; code is released.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address temporal inconsistency and poor generalization in few-shot video object detection (FSVOD). Challenges include maintaining frame-to-frame consistency under occlusion and appearance changes, and generalizing to novel objects without relying on computationally expensive region proposals that require task-specific training.

Method: Introduce a filtering mechanism that selectively propagates high-confidence object features across frames. Use few-shot trained detection and classification heads with focused feature propagation, avoiding explicit object tube proposals to reduce noise accumulation and improve temporal consistency.

Result: In the 5-shot setting, achieve AP gains of 3.7% (FSVOD-500), 5.3% (FSYTV-40), 4.3% (VidOR), and 4.5 (VidVRD). Also report improvements in 1-shot, 3-shot, and 10-shot configurations. Code is publicly available at the provided GitHub URL.

Conclusion: The object-aware temporal modeling approach enhances robustness and temporal consistency in FSVOD without reliance on region proposals, delivering consistent performance gains across multiple datasets and shot configurations, with a computationally efficient propagation strategy.

Abstract: Few-shot Video Object Detection (FSVOD) addresses the challenge of detecting novel objects in videos with limited labeled examples, overcoming the constraints of traditional detection methods that require extensive training data. This task presents key challenges, including maintaining temporal consistency across frames affected by occlusion and appearance variations, and achieving novel object generalization without relying on complex region proposals, which are often computationally expensive and require task-specific training. Our novel object-aware temporal modeling approach addresses these challenges by incorporating a filtering mechanism that selectively propagates high-confidence object features across frames. This enables efficient feature progression, reduces noise accumulation, and enhances detection accuracy in a few-shot setting. By utilizing few-shot trained detection and classification heads with focused feature propagation, we achieve robust temporal consistency without depending on explicit object tube proposals. Our approach achieves performance gains, with AP improvements of 3.7% (FSVOD-500), 5.3% (FSYTV-40), 4.3% (VidOR), and 4.5 (VidVRD) in the 5-shot setting. Further results demonstrate improvements in 1-shot, 3-shot, and 10-shot configurations. We make the code public at: https://github.com/yogesh-iitj/fs-video-vit

### [4] [FusionFM: All-in-One Multi-Modal Image Fusion with Flow Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13794)
*Huayi Zhu,Xiu Shu,Youqiang Xiong,Qiao Liu,Rui Chen,Di Yuan,Xiaojun Chang,Zhenyu He*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a flow-matching-based direct probabilistic transport for multi-modal image fusion, using pseudo-label priors from multiple models, a Fusion Refiner with divide-and-conquer, and continual-learning strategies (elastic weight consolidation and experience replay) to achieve competitive performance with improved sampling efficiency and a lightweight model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multi-modal image fusion methods rely on task-specific models, causing high training costs and limited scalability. Generative approaches face slow inference due to lengthy sampling. There is also a lack of high-quality fused images for supervision, motivating the use of priors from multiple models and a learning strategy that supports continual learning.

Method: Formulate image fusion as direct probabilistic transport from source modalities to the fused distribution using flow matching to enhance sampling efficiency and structural consistency. Use a task-aware selection function to curate reliable pseudo-labels from fusion results of multiple state-of-the-art models. Introduce a Fusion Refiner module with a divide-and-conquer strategy to identify, decompose, and enhance degraded components in pseudo-labels. For multi-task settings, integrate elastic weight consolidation and experience replay to preserve cross-task performance and improve continual learning from both parameter stability and memory retention perspectives.

Result: Achieves competitive performance across diverse fusion tasks while significantly improving sampling efficiency and maintaining a lightweight model design; code will be available at the provided GitHub link.

Conclusion: The proposed framework delivers an efficient, scalable solution for multi-modal image fusion with continual-learning capabilities, leveraging priors from multiple models and a structured refinement process to produce robust fused results.

Abstract: Current multi-modal image fusion methods typically rely on task-specific models, leading to high training costs and limited scalability. While generative methods provide a unified modeling perspective, they often suffer from slow inference due to the complex sampling trajectories from noise to image. To address this, we formulate image fusion as a direct probabilistic transport from source modalities to the fused image distribution, leveraging the flow matching paradigm to improve sampling efficiency and structural consistency. To mitigate the lack of high-quality fused images for supervision, we collect fusion results from multiple state-of-the-art models as priors, and employ a task-aware selection function to select the most reliable pseudo-labels for each task. We further introduce a Fusion Refiner module that employs a divide-and-conquer strategy to systematically identify, decompose, and enhance degraded components in selected pseudo-labels. For multi-task scenarios, we integrate elastic weight consolidation and experience replay mechanisms to preserve cross-task performance and enhance continual learning ability from both parameter stability and memory retention perspectives. Our approach achieves competitive performance across diverse fusion tasks, while significantly improving sampling efficiency and maintaining a lightweight model design. The code will be available at: https://github.com/Ist-Zhy/FusionFM.

### [5] [A Trajectory-free Crash Detection Framework with Generative Approach and Segment Map Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13795)
*Weiying Shen,Hao Yu,Yu Dong,Pan Liu,Yu Han,Xin Wen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A two-stage, trajectory-free crash detection framework using diffusion-based Mapfusion to predict future road-segment maps and detect crashes by comparing with observed maps; robust to sampling intervals and trained on non-crash data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome limits of trajectory acquisition and vehicle tracking by using road-segment maps with individual-level dynamic data to enable real-time, trajectory-free crash detection for proactive safety management.

Method: Stage 1: Mapfusion, a diffusion-based model that progressively adds noise to road-segment maps (noisy-to-normal) guided by temporal embeddings to generate future maps; ControlNet provides background context to enhance control. Stage 2: Crash detection by comparing the monitored segment map with generated maps from Stage 1. The model is trained on non-crash motion data and is robust across different sampling intervals.

Result: The method effectively detects crashes in real-world data, producing realistic future-segment maps and demonstrating robustness to varying sampling intervals.

Conclusion: A viable trajectory-free crash detection framework that leverages diffusion-based generation of future road-segment maps to identify crashes, reducing reliance on explicit trajectory data while maintaining real-time performance.

Abstract: Real-time crash detection is essential for developing proactive safety management strategy and enhancing overall traffic efficiency. To address the limitations associated with trajectory acquisition and vehicle tracking, road segment maps recording the individual-level traffic dynamic data were directly served in crash detection. A novel two-stage trajectory-free crash detection framework, was present to generate the rational future road segment map and identify crashes. The first-stage diffusion-based segment map generation model, Mapfusion, conducts a noisy-to-normal process that progressively adds noise to the road segment map until the map is corrupted to pure Gaussian noise. The denoising process is guided by sequential embedding components capturing the temporal dynamics of segment map sequences. Furthermore, the generation model is designed to incorporate background context through ControlNet to enhance generation control. Crash detection is achieved by comparing the monitored segment map with the generations from diffusion model in second stage. Trained on non-crash vehicle motion data, Mapfusion successfully generates realistic road segment evolution maps based on learned motion patterns and remains robust across different sampling intervals. Experiments on real-world crashes indicate the effectiveness of the proposed two-stage method in accurately detecting crashes.

### [6] [Synergizing Multigrid Algorithms with Vision Transformer: A Novel Approach to Enhance the Seismic Foundation Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13800)
*Huiwen Wu,Shuo Zhang,Yi Liu,Hongbin Ye*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes ADATG with Hilbert encoding for seismogram data to train visual seismic foundation models; uses spectrum decomposition and adaptive coarse-to-fine training to capture high- and low-frequency features; reports improved pretraining efficiency and effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Seismic data contain distinct high- and low-frequency information and inherent hierarchical patterns. Standard ViTs with simple tokenization struggle to efficiently and effectively capture these components, limiting the quality of seismic foundation model pretraining.

Method: An Adaptive Two-Grid Foundation model training strategy (ADATG) with Hilbert encoding. It performs spectrum decomposition to separate high- and low-frequency components and uses hierarchical Hilbert encoding to represent seismic data. The training strategy adapts by emphasizing coarse-level information first and progressively refining to fine-level features, leveraging the frequency principle observed in ViTs.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed training methods, showing that data encoding and training strategies aligned with seismic high-/low-frequency characteristics improve the pretraining of visual seismic foundation models.

Conclusion: Tailored data encoding and frequency-aware adaptive training strategies enhance seismic foundation model pretraining and highlight the value of inspecting high- and low-frequency information in seismic imagery; potential applicability to other domains with multi-frequency patterns.

Abstract: Due to the emergency and homogenization of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology development, transformer-based foundation models have revolutionized scientific applications, such as drug discovery, materials research, and astronomy. However, seismic data presents unique characteristics that require specialized processing techniques for pretraining foundation models in seismic contexts with high- and low-frequency features playing crucial roles. Existing vision transformers (ViTs) with sequential tokenization ignore the intrinsic pattern and fail to grasp both the high- and low-frequency seismic information efficiently and effectively. This work introduces a novel adaptive two-grid foundation model training strategy (ADATG) with Hilbert encoding specifically tailored for seismogram data, leveraging the hierarchical structures inherent in seismic data. Specifically, our approach employs spectrum decomposition to separate high- and low-frequency components and utilizes hierarchical Hilbert encoding to represent the data effectively. Moreover, observing the frequency principle observed in ViTs, we propose an adaptive training strategy that initially emphasizes coarse-level information and then progressively refines the model's focus on fine-level features. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our training methods. This research highlights the importance of data encoding and training strategies informed by the distinct characteristics of high- and low-frequency features in seismic images, ultimately contributing to the enhancement of visual seismic foundation models pretraining.

### [7] [Passive Dementia Screening via Facial Temporal Micro-Dynamics Analysis of In-the-Wild Talking-Head Video](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13802)
*Filippo Cenacchi. Longbing Cao,Mitchell McEwan,Deborah Richards*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Passive dementia screening from short talking-head videos using facial microdynamics, enabling language-free, in-the-wild analysis at scale. Introduces YT DemTalk dataset (300 clips: 150 with self-reported dementia, 150 controls) and shows high performance with light-weight models (AUROC ~0.95–0.96; AP ~0.96; F1 ~0.85; accuracy ~0.86), with gaze lability and mouth/jaw dynamics as key cues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing dementia screening resources are largely speech-based or scripted, linking predictions to language and transcription and limiting use outside clinics. A language-free, noninvasive, scalable approach using nonverbal facial microdynamics in unconstrained video could enable broader, unsupervised screening across devices, topics, and cultures.

Method: Stabilize facial signals and convert subtle facial movements into interpretable microdynamic time series. Smooth and summarize short windows into clip-level statistics. Each window is encoded by activity mix—the relative share of motion across streams (blink dynamics, mouth/jaw motion, gaze variability, head adjustments). The model analyzes the distribution of motion across streams rather than absolute magnitude for transparency. A new dataset (YT DemTalk) with 300 in-the-wild, camera-facing clips (150 self-reported dementia, 150 controls) is introduced. Ablations identify gaze lability and mouth/jaw dynamics as informative cues. Lightweight shallow classifiers achieve AUROC ~0.953, AP ~0.961, F1 ~0.851, accuracy ~0.857.

Result: High-performance language-free dementia screening from facial microdynamics in-the-wild. Gaze lability and mouth/jaw dynamics emerge as key cues; robust performance on YT DemTalk demonstrates feasibility and scalability of the approach.

Conclusion: Demonstrates feasibility of nonverbal facial microdynamic analysis for dementia screening outside clinical settings, introducing a first benchmarking dataset. Indicates promise for scalable, language-free screening, though validation on diverse, clinically diagnosed cohorts and addressing potential biases (e.g., self-reported dementia) are needed.

Abstract: We target passive dementia screening from short camera-facing talking head video, developing a facial temporal micro dynamics analysis for language free detection of early neuro cognitive change. This enables unscripted, in the wild video analysis at scale to capture natural facial behaviors, transferrable across devices, topics, and cultures without active intervention by clinicians or researchers during recording. Most existing resources prioritize speech or scripted interviews, limiting use outside clinics and coupling predictions to language and transcription. In contrast, we identify and analyze whether temporal facial kinematics, including blink dynamics, small mouth jaw motions, gaze variability, and subtle head adjustments, are sufficient for dementia screening without speech or text. By stabilizing facial signals, we convert these micro movements into interpretable facial microdynamic time series, smooth them, and summarize short windows into compact clip level statistics for screening. Each window is encoded by its activity mix (the relative share of motion across streams), thus the predictor analyzes the distribution of motion across streams rather than its magnitude, making per channel effects transparent. We also introduce YT DemTalk, a new dataset curated from publicly available, in the wild camera facing videos. It contains 300 clips (150 with self reported dementia, 150 controls) to test our model and offer a first benchmarking of the corpus. On YT DemTalk, ablations identify gaze lability and mouth/jaw dynamics as the most informative cues, and light weighted shallow classifiers could attain a dementia prediction performance of (AUROC) 0.953, 0.961 Average Precision (AP), 0.851 F1-score, and 0.857 accuracy.

### [8] [Can World Simulators Reason? Gen-ViRe: A Generative Visual Reasoning Benchmark](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13853)
*Xinxin Liu,Zhaopan Xu,Kai Wang,Yong Jae Lee,Yuzhang Shang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Gen-ViRe introduces a video-based reasoning benchmark to quantify Chain-of-Frames (CoF) reasoning in vision-language models. It decomposes CoF into six cognitive dimensions and 24 subtasks, uses multi-source data, minimal prompts, and a hybrid VLM-based evaluation to assess true reasoning depth beyond visual quality. Results show a gap between impressive visuals and reasoning, providing baselines and diagnostic tools to develop genuine world simulators.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks emphasis on visual fidelity or alignment and do not measure multi-step reasoning, planning, or abstract pattern extrapolation in video-based reasoning. There is a need for principled evaluation of CoF reasoning to understand capabilities and guide improvements toward real-world world simulators.

Method: Gen-ViRe frameworks grounds the task in cognitive science, decomposing CoF reasoning into six cognitive dimensions and 24 subtasks. It employs multi-source data curation, minimal prompting protocols, and a hybrid evaluation pipeline that combines visual-language models with detailed criteria to quantify reasoning depth.

Result: First quantitative assessment of video models as reasoners. Experiments on state-of-the-art systems reveal substantial gaps between strong visual quality and actual reasoning depth. The framework establishes baselines and diagnostic tools for assessing and improving video-based reasoning.

Conclusion: Gen-ViRe provides a principled, scalable benchmark to evaluate and advance video-based reasoning in AI agents, moving beyond surface fidelity to measure core cognitive abilities like multi-step planning, algorithmic logic, and abstract extrapolation.

Abstract: While Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting enables sophisticated symbolic reasoning in LLMs, it remains confined to discrete text and cannot simulate the continuous, physics-governed dynamics of the real world. Recent video generation models have emerged as potential world simulators through Chain-of-Frames (CoF) reasoning -- materializing thought as frame-by-frame visual sequences, with each frame representing a physically-grounded reasoning step. Despite compelling demonstrations, a challenge persists: existing benchmarks, focusing on fidelity or alignment, do not assess CoF reasoning and thus cannot measure core cognitive abilities in multi-step planning, algorithmic logic, or abstract pattern extrapolation. This evaluation void prevents systematic understanding of model capabilities and principled guidance for improvement. We introduce Gen-ViRe (Generative Visual Reasoning Benchmark), a framework grounded in cognitive science and real-world AI applications, which decomposes CoF reasoning into six cognitive dimensions -- from perceptual logic to abstract planning -- and 24 subtasks. Through multi-source data curation, minimal prompting protocols, and hybrid VLM-assisted evaluation with detailed criteria, Gen-ViRe delivers the first quantitative assessment of video models as reasoners. Our experiments on SOTA systems reveal substantial discrepancies between impressive visual quality and actual reasoning depth, establishing baselines and diagnostic tools to advance genuine world simulators.

### [9] [RSPose: Ranking Based Losses for Human Pose Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13857)
*Muhammed Can Keles,Bedrettin Cetinkaya,Sinan Kalkan,Emre Akbas*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes ranking-based losses for heatmap-based pose estimation (RSPose) to align optimization with mAP, improving peak localization and mitigating heatmap imbalances. Demonstrates theoretical and empirical advantages over MSE/KL, and reports state-of-the-art results on COCO-val with ViTPose-H (AP 79.9) and a 1.5 AP gain for SimCC-ResNet-50 (73.6 AP).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MSE losses treat all pixel deviations equally and do not explicitly sharpen joint peaks; heatmaps are spatially and class-wise imbalanced; mAP is the evaluation metric, but existing losses do not optimize for it. A ranking-based objective can better correlate confidence with localization quality, improving NMS decisions and AP.

Method: Introduce one- and two-dimensional ranking-based loss functions for heatmaps, optimizing the relative ordering of candidate joint peaks to align with ground-truth localization and AP. Integrate these losses into RSPose and evaluate across COCO, CrowdPose, MPII on ViTPose-H and on SimCC-ResNet-50.

Result: The proposed ranking-based losses show higher correlation between confidence and localization quality than MSE/KL, outperforming prior heatmap losses. RSPose achieves state-of-the-art results on COCO-val with ViTPose-H (AP 79.9) and improves SimCC-ResNet-50 by 1.5 AP to 73.6 AP.

Conclusion: First to align heatmap losses with mAP for human pose estimation. Ranking-based losses address MSE limitations, heatmap imbalance, and loss-vs-evaluation mismatch, benefiting NMS and overall AP across 1D/2D heatmaps and multiple architectures.

Abstract: While heatmap-based human pose estimation methods have shown strong performance, they suffer from three main problems: (P1) "Commonly used Mean Squared Error (MSE)" Loss may not always improve joint localization because it penalizes all pixel deviations equally, without focusing explicitly on sharpening and correctly localizing the peak corresponding to the joint; (P2) heatmaps are spatially and class-wise imbalanced; and, (P3) there is a discrepancy between the evaluation metric (i.e., mAP) and the loss functions.
  We propose ranking-based losses to address these issues.
  Both theoretically and empirically, we show that our proposed losses are superior to commonly used heatmap losses (MSE, KL-Divergence). Our losses considerably increase the correlation between confidence scores and localization qualities, which is desirable because higher correlation leads to more accurate instance selection during Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS) and better Average Precision (mAP) performance. We refer to the models trained with our losses as RSPose.
  We show the effectiveness of RSPose across two different modes: one-dimensional and two-dimensional heatmaps, on three different datasets (COCO, CrowdPose, MPII).
  To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to propose losses that align with the evaluation metric (mAP) for human pose estimation.
  RSPose outperforms the previous state of the art on the COCO-val set and achieves an mAP score of 79.9 with ViTPose-H, a vision transformer model for human pose estimation.
  We also improve SimCC Resnet-50, a coordinate classification-based pose estimation method, by 1.5 AP on the COCO-val set, achieving 73.6 AP.

### [10] [Segmenting Collision Sound Sources in Egocentric Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13863)
*Kranti Kumar Parida,Omar Emara,Hazel Doughty,Dima Damen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Collision Sound Source Segmentation (CS3) introduces a new task to segment the objects responsible for a collision sound in video, conditioned on audio. The paper proposes a weakly-supervised method using foundation models (CLIP and SAM2) and egocentric cues, achieving large mIoU gains on two new benchmarks (EPIC-CS3 and Ego4D-CS3).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Humans naturally integrate multisensory cues to identify object properties from sounds. Collision sounds arise from interactions between two objects, making the visual source nontrivial to identify. In egocentric video, sounds are clear but the visuals are cluttered and brief interactions require precise localization. A task that localizes collision sound sources conditioned on audio addresses this gap and mirrors real-world multisensory perception.

Method: Propose a weakly-supervised audio-conditioned segmentation framework that leverages foundation models CLIP (for visual-language alignment) and SAM2 (for segmentation) and incorporate egocentric cues (e.g., objects held in hands) to narrow the potential sound sources. The method operates under weak supervision (no pixel-level labels for collision sources) and uses audio-visual signals to produce segmentation masks.

Result: The approach outperforms competitive baselines by approximately 3x and 4.7x in mean IoU on two new CS3 benchmarks, EPIC-CS3 and Ego4D-CS3.

Conclusion: CS3 demonstrates the feasibility of audio-conditioned visual segmentation for collision sources in egocentric video and highlights the value of combining foundation-models with egocentric cues. The work introduces two benchmarks and motivates future exploration of audio-visual segmentation tasks under weak supervision.

Abstract: Humans excel at multisensory perception and can often recognise object properties from the sound of their interactions. Inspired by this, we propose the novel task of Collision Sound Source Segmentation (CS3), where we aim to segment the objects responsible for a collision sound in visual input (i.e. video frames from the collision clip), conditioned on the audio. This task presents unique challenges. Unlike isolated sound events, a collision sound arises from interactions between two objects, and the acoustic signature of the collision depends on both. We focus on egocentric video, where sounds are often clear, but the visual scene is cluttered, objects are small, and interactions are brief.
  To address these challenges, we propose a weakly-supervised method for audio-conditioned segmentation, utilising foundation models (CLIP and SAM2). We also incorporate egocentric cues, i.e. objects in hands, to find acting objects that can potentially be collision sound sources. Our approach outperforms competitive baselines by $3\times$ and $4.7\times$ in mIoU on two benchmarks we introduce for the CS3 task: EPIC-CS3 and Ego4D-CS3.

### [11] [GRLoc: Geometric Representation Regression for Visual Localization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13864)
*Changyang Li,Xuejian Ma,Lixiang Liu,Zhan Li,Qingan Yan,Yi Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Geometric Representation Regression (GRR): an inverse, geometrically grounded APR that regresses two world-space geometric representations from an image and recovers 6-DoF pose via a differentiable solver, achieving state-of-the-art results and better generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address APRs' black-box nature and memorization of training views by injecting explicit geometric priors and leveraging inverse rendering to improve generalization.

Method: Predict two disentangled geometric representations in world coordinates: (1) ray bundle directions for camera rotation, (2) a pointmap for translation; use a differentiable solver to compute the 6-DoF pose from these representations.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on 7-Scenes and Cambridge Landmarks, demonstrating improved generalization and robustness due to explicit geometric decoupling.

Conclusion: Modeling the inverse rendering process via GRR provides a robust, generalizable alternative to traditional APR by separating learning of geometry from pose estimation and enforcing a geometric prior.

Abstract: Absolute Pose Regression (APR) has emerged as a compelling paradigm for visual localization. However, APR models typically operate as black boxes, directly regressing a 6-DoF pose from a query image, which can lead to memorizing training views rather than understanding 3D scene geometry. In this work, we propose a geometrically-grounded alternative. Inspired by novel view synthesis, which renders images from intermediate geometric representations, we reformulate APR as its inverse that regresses the underlying 3D representations directly from the image, and we name this paradigm Geometric Representation Regression (GRR). Our model explicitly predicts two disentangled geometric representations in the world coordinate system: (1) a ray bundle's directions to estimate camera rotation, and (2) a corresponding pointmap to estimate camera translation. The final 6-DoF camera pose is then recovered from these geometric components using a differentiable deterministic solver. This disentangled approach, which separates the learned visual-to-geometry mapping from the final pose calculation, introduces a strong geometric prior into the network. We find that the explicit decoupling of rotation and translation predictions measurably boosts performance. We demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on 7-Scenes and Cambridge Landmarks datasets, validating that modeling the inverse rendering process is a more robust path toward generalizable absolute pose estimation.

### [12] [H-CNN-ViT: A Hierarchical Gated Attention Multi-Branch Model for Bladder Cancer Recurrence Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13869)
*Xueyang Li,Zongren Wang,Yuliang Zhang,Zixuan Pan,Yu-Jen Chen,Nishchal Sapkota,Gelei Xu,Danny Z. Chen,Yiyu Shi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduces a curated multi-sequence MRI dataset for bladder cancer recurrence prediction and presents H-CNN-ViT, a hierarchical gated attention model that fuses global ViT and local CNN features across modalities, achieving 78.6% AUC and setting a benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bladder cancer has a high post-surgical recurrence rate; multi-sequence MRI offers rich information but is challenging to interpret. There is a lack of dedicated multi-sequence MRI datasets for recurrence prediction, hindering AI development.

Method: 1) Build a curated multi-sequence, multi-modal MRI dataset for bladder cancer recurrence prediction. 2) Propose H-CNN-ViT, a hierarchical gated attention multi-branch model that processes each modality separately and fuses features via selective gating between a global ViT path and a local CNN path.

Result: On the proposed dataset, H-CNN-ViT achieves an AUC of 78.6%, outperforming state-of-the-art models.

Conclusion: The dataset provides a valuable benchmark for bladder cancer recurrence studies, and H-CNN-ViT demonstrates effective fusion of multi-sequence MRI features, with code publicly available for reproducibility.

Abstract: Bladder cancer is one of the most prevalent malignancies worldwide, with a recurrence rate of up to 78%, necessitating accurate post-operative monitoring for effective patient management. Multi-sequence contrast-enhanced MRI is commonly used for recurrence detection; however, interpreting these scans remains challenging, even for experienced radiologists, due to post-surgical alterations such as scarring, swelling, and tissue remodeling. AI-assisted diagnostic tools have shown promise in improving bladder cancer recurrence prediction, yet progress in this field is hindered by the lack of dedicated multi-sequence MRI datasets for recurrence assessment study. In this work, we first introduce a curated multi-sequence, multi-modal MRI dataset specifically designed for bladder cancer recurrence prediction, establishing a valuable benchmark for future research. We then propose H-CNN-ViT, a new Hierarchical Gated Attention Multi-Branch model that enables selective weighting of features from the global (ViT) and local (CNN) paths based on contextual demands, achieving a balanced and targeted feature fusion. Our multi-branch architecture processes each modality independently, ensuring that the unique properties of each imaging channel are optimally captured and integrated. Evaluated on our dataset, H-CNN-ViT achieves an AUC of 78.6%, surpassing state-of-the-art models. Our model is publicly available at https://github.com/XLIAaron/H-CNN-ViT}.

### [13] [QwenCLIP: Boosting Medical Vision-Language Pretraining via LLM Embeddings and Prompt tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13876)
*Xiaoyang Wei,Camille Kurtz,Florence Cloppet*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: QwenCLIP replaces CLIP's text encoder with an LLM-based embedding module and learnable prompts, enabling long-form radiology text understanding and improved vision-language alignment in medical imaging tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP's text encoder is limited to ~77 tokens, and medical-domain encoders (e.g., PubMedBERT/ClinicalBERT) are restricted to ~512 tokens with relatively shallow semantics. Long, information-heavy radiology reports require extended context and richer semantics.

Method: Integrate an LLM-based embedding module (e.g., Qwen3-Embedding) as the text encoder in CLIP and introduce trainable prompts to align cross-modal representations; exploit the extended context window and richer language representations of LLMs to enhance image-text alignment. Public code available.

Result: Substantial improvement in medical image-text alignment and downstream radiology benchmarks.

Conclusion: LLM-based embedding with learnable prompts enables longer-context, richer medical semantics for CLIP in radiology, improving cross-modal alignment and downstream performance.

Abstract: Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) has demonstrated strong generalization for vision-language tasks in computer vision and medical domains, yet its text encoder accepts only up to 77 tokens, which limits its ability to represent long and information-rich radiology reports. Recent adaptations using domain-specific encoders, such as PubMedBERT or ClinicalBERT, mitigate this issue by leveraging medical corpora, but remain constrained by their limited input length (typically 512 tokens) and relatively shallow semantic understanding. To address these limitations, we propose QwenCLIP, a vision-language framework that replaces CLIP's text encoder with a large language model (LLM)-based embedding module (e.g., Qwen3-Embedding) and introduces learnable prompts to enhance cross-modal alignment. By leveraging the extended context window and richer representations of LLMs, QwenCLIP captures comprehensive medical semantics from long-form clinical text, substantially improving medical image-text alignment and downstream performance on radiology benchmarks. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/Wxy-24/QwenCLIP.

*Pandiyaraju V,Abishek Karthik,Jaspin K,Kannan A,Jaime Lloret*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A hybrid EfficientNet+VGG19 model with Pseudo-Newton Boosting and Sparsity-Induced Feature Reduction layers achieves superior lumbar spine degeneration classification on DICOM images, outperforming baseline EfficientNet.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations of traditional transfer learning in high-dimensional medical images by enhancing feature selection and representation, enabling more accurate automated lumbar spine pathology diagnostics.

Method: Proposes a multi-tier architecture that fuses EfficientNet and VGG19 with two custom components: a Pseudo-Newton Boosting layer to adapt feature weights for finer anatomical detail, and a Sparsity-Induced Feature Reduction Layer to remove redundancy, along with a standard preprocessing pipeline and experimental evaluation against a baseline EfficientNet.

Result: On lumbar spine DICOM image classification, the model achieves precision 0.90, recall 0.861, F1 0.88, loss 0.18, and accuracy 0.881, showing a significant performance boost over the baseline EfficientNet.

Conclusion: The architecture is novel and effective in overcoming transfer-learning constraints for high-dimensional medical images, contributing to automated diagnostic tools for medical imaging.

Abstract: This paper proposes a new enhanced model architecture to perform classification of lumbar spine degeneration with DICOM images while using a hybrid approach, integrating EfficientNet and VGG19 together with custom-designed components. The proposed model is differentiated from traditional transfer learning methods as it incorporates a Pseudo-Newton Boosting layer along with a Sparsity-Induced Feature Reduction Layer that forms a multi-tiered framework, further improving feature selection and representation. The Pseudo-Newton Boosting layer makes smart variations of feature weights, with more detailed anatomical features, which are mostly left out in a transfer learning setup. In addition, the Sparsity-Induced Layer removes redundancy for learned features, producing lean yet robust representations for pathology in the lumbar spine. This architecture is novel as it overcomes the constraints in the traditional transfer learning approach, especially in the high-dimensional context of medical images, and achieves a significant performance boost, reaching a precision of 0.9, recall of 0.861, F1 score of 0.88, loss of 0.18, and an accuracy of 88.1%, compared to the baseline model, EfficientNet. This work will present the architectures, preprocessing pipeline, and experimental results. The results contribute to the development of automated diagnostic tools for medical images.

*Xin Hu,Taotao Jing,Renran Tian,Zhengming Ding*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Reframes VLMs as semantic enhancers for autonomous driving: enrich visual inputs with structured, language-described scenes, fuse visual and linguistic features via a multi-modal architecture, add post-hoc refinement for reliability, and achieve state-of-the-art, interpretable decisions on two driving benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address brittleness and lack of robustness in VLM-based decision making for autonomous driving, caused by reliance on handcrafted prompts and inconsistent VLM performance, by leveraging VLMs for rich scene understanding rather than direct decision generation.

Method: 1) Convert ego-view scenes into linguistically rich descriptions using VLMs to augment visual data. 2) Propose a multi-modal architecture that fuses visual and linguistic features to improve decision accuracy and provides textual explanations. 3) Add a post-hoc refinement module that uses VLMs to boost prediction reliability. 4) Evaluate on two autonomous driving benchmarks.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on two autonomous driving benchmarks, with improved reliability and interpretable textual explanations, demonstrating the value of VLM-enabled semantic enhancement for AD.

Conclusion: Shifting VLMs from direct decision makers to semantic enhancers enables more reliable, context-aware, and interpretable autonomous driving systems, and opens a promising direction for integrating VLMs into AD pipelines.

Abstract: Recent advancements in autonomous driving (AD) have explored the use of vision-language models (VLMs) within visual question answering (VQA) frameworks for direct driving decision-making. However, these approaches often depend on handcrafted prompts and suffer from inconsistent performance, limiting their robustness and generalization in real-world scenarios. In this work, we evaluate state-of-the-art open-source VLMs on high-level decision-making tasks using ego-view visual inputs and identify critical limitations in their ability to deliver reliable, context-aware decisions. Motivated by these observations, we propose a new approach that shifts the role of VLMs from direct decision generators to semantic enhancers. Specifically, we leverage their strong general scene understanding to enrich existing vision-based benchmarks with structured, linguistically rich scene descriptions. Building on this enriched representation, we introduce a multi-modal interactive architecture that fuses visual and linguistic features for more accurate decision-making and interpretable textual explanations. Furthermore, we design a post-hoc refinement module that utilizes VLMs to enhance prediction reliability. Extensive experiments on two autonomous driving benchmarks demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance, offering a promising direction for integrating VLMs into reliable and interpretable AD systems.

### [16] [Revisiting Data Scaling Law for Medical Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13883)
*Yuetan Chu,Zhongyi Han,Gongning Luo,Xin Gao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study investigates data-size scaling laws for medical image segmentation across 15 tasks and 4 modalities, introduces deformation-guided augmentation, including a novel diffeomorphic method from geodesic subspace via image registration, and shows enhanced data efficiency and faster convergence that can exceed standard power-law scaling without extra data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While data-size scaling (power laws) is well-documented in deep learning, its specifics for medical anatomical segmentation are underexplored. Understanding scaling and deformation-based augmentation can reduce annotation burden and computational costs in medical imaging.

Method: Empirical analysis of segmentation performance across varying data sizes for 15 semantic tasks and 4 imaging modalities; evaluation of random elastic deformation and registration-guided deformation; development of a scalable augmentation that generates diffeomorphic mappings from a geodesic subspace based on image registration; assessment of performance, data efficiency, and convergence.

Result: Larger datasets follow power-law-like improvements in segmentation performance across tasks and modalities; deformation-guided augmentation improves data utilization efficiency; the proposed generated deformation method achieves superior performance and faster convergence, surpassing standard power-law trends without requiring additional data.

Conclusion: The work enhances understanding of segmentation scalability and topological variation in medical imaging, enabling more efficient model development with reduced annotation and computational costs, aided by effective deformation-based augmentations.

Abstract: The population loss of trained deep neural networks often exhibits power law scaling with the size of the training dataset, guiding significant performance advancements in deep learning applications. In this study, we focus on the scaling relationship with data size in the context of medical anatomical segmentation, a domain that remains underexplored. We analyze scaling laws for anatomical segmentation across 15 semantic tasks and 4 imaging modalities, demonstrating that larger datasets significantly improve segmentation performance, following similar scaling trends. Motivated by the topological isomorphism in images sharing anatomical structures, we evaluate the impact of deformation-guided augmentation strategies on data scaling laws, specifically random elastic deformation and registration-guided deformation. We also propose a novel, scalable image augmentation approach that generates diffeomorphic mappings from geodesic subspace based on image registration to introduce realistic deformation. Our experimental results demonstrate that both registered and generated deformation-based augmentation considerably enhance data utilization efficiency. The proposed generated deformation method notably achieves superior performance and accelerated convergence, surpassing standard power law scaling trends without requiring additional data. Overall, this work provides insights into the understanding of segmentation scalability and topological variation impact in medical imaging, thereby leading to more efficient model development with reduced annotation and computational costs.

### [17] [Uni-Hema: Unified Model for Digital Hematopathology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13889)
*Abdul Rehman,Iqra Rasool,Ayesha Imran,Mohsen Ali,Waqas Sultani*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Uni-Hema is a multi-task, unified multi-modal model for digital hematopathology that jointly handles detection, classification, segmentation, morphology prediction, and reasoning across many diseases, leveraging 46 datasets and a Hema-Former backbone to outperform single-task models while offering single-cell level interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Single-task, vision-language, WSI-optimized, and single-cell hematology models fail to provide unified multi-task, multi-modal reasoning needed for the complexity of digital hematopathology.

Method: Introduce Uni-Hema, built on Hema-Former, bridging visual and textual representations across tasks and granularities; train on 46 datasets (~700k images, 21k QA pairs); supports detection, classification, segmentation, morphology prediction, mask language modeling, and VQA.

Result: Achieves comparable or superior performance to single-task/single-dataset models across diverse hematology tasks and offers interpretable, morphology-relevant insights at the single-cell level.

Conclusion: Sets a new standard for multi-task and multi-modal digital hematopathology; code will be publicly available.

Abstract: Digital hematopathology requires cell-level analysis across diverse disease categories, including malignant disorders (e.g., leukemia), infectious conditions (e.g., malaria), and non-malignant red blood cell disorders (e.g., sickle cell disease). Whether single-task, vision-language, WSI-optimized, or single-cell hematology models, these approaches share a key limitation, they cannot provide unified, multi-task, multi-modal reasoning across the complexities of digital hematopathology. To overcome these limitations, we propose Uni-Hema, a multi-task, unified model for digital hematopathology integrating detection, classification, segmentation, morphology prediction, and reasoning across multiple diseases. Uni-Hema leverages 46 publicly available datasets, encompassing over 700K images and 21K question-answer pairs, and is built upon Hema-Former, a multimodal module that bridges visual and textual representations at the hierarchy level for the different tasks (detection, classification, segmentation, morphology, mask language modeling and visual question answer) at different granularity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Uni-Hema achieves comparable or superior performance to train on a single-task and single dataset models, across diverse hematological tasks, while providing interpretable, morphologically relevant insights at the single-cell level. Our framework establishes a new standard for multi-task and multi-modal digital hematopathology. The code will be made publicly available.

### [18] [Weakly Supervised Ephemeral Gully Detection In Remote Sensing Images Using Vision Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13891)
*Seyed Mohamad Ali Tousi,John A. Lory,G. N. DeSouza*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A weakly supervised pipeline using Vision-Language Models and a teacher-student framework is proposed for detecting ephemeral gullies from remote sensing, leveraging noisy VLM-derived labels and weak supervision; accompanied by a large semi-supervised dataset and public code/dataset; results show improvements over standalone VLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ephemeral gullies have short temporal cycles and sparse labeled data, making automatic detection difficult with traditional methods.

Method: Employ VLM pretraining knowledge; a teacher learns from noisy VLM-derived labels; a student is trained with weak supervision using labels from the teacher and a noise-aware loss; public dataset combining labeled and unlabeled locations (18k images over 13 years).

Result: The approach yields superior performance compared to using VLMs or label models alone, demonstrating the effectiveness of weak supervision for this task.

Conclusion: This work introduces the first weakly supervised detection pipeline for ephemeral gullies and provides a semi-supervised dataset; code and data are publicly available to spur further research.

Abstract: Among soil erosion problems, Ephemeral Gullies are one of the most concerning phenomena occurring in agricultural fields. Their short temporal cycles increase the difficulty in automatically detecting them using classical computer vision approaches and remote sensing. Also, due to scarcity of and the difficulty in producing accurate labeled data, automatic detection of ephemeral gullies using Machine Learning is limited to zero-shot approaches which are hard to implement. To overcome these challenges, we present the first weakly supervised pipeline for detection of ephemeral gullies. Our method relies on remote sensing and uses Vision Language Models (VLMs) to drastically reduce the labor-intensive task of manual labeling. In order to achieve that, the method exploits: 1) the knowledge embedded in the VLM's pretraining; 2) a teacher-student model where the teacher learns from noisy labels coming from the VLMs, and the student learns by weak supervision using teacher-generate labels and a noise-aware loss function. We also make available the first-of-its-kind dataset for semi-supervised detection of ephemeral gully from remote-sensed images. The dataset consists of a number of locations labeled by a group of soil and plant scientists, as well as a large number of unlabeled locations. The dataset represent more than 18,000 high-resolution remote-sensing images obtained over the course of 13 years. Our experimental results demonstrate the validity of our approach by showing superior performances compared to VLMs and the label model itself when using weak supervision to train an student model. The code and dataset for this work are made publicly available.

### [19] [Temporal Realism Evaluation of Generated Videos Using Compressed-Domain Motion Vectors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13897)
*Mert Onur Cakiroglu,Idil Bilge Altun,Zhihe Lu,Mehmet Dalkilic,Hasan Kurban*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A scalable, compressed-domain motion-vector–based framework to quantify temporal realism in generative videos; uses MV statistics and divergences to reveal motion defects and can improve discrimination when fused with RGB.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluation of generative videos emphasizes spatial fidelity with limited sensitivity to motion; there is a need for scalable, model-agnostic temporal metrics. Compressed-domain motion vectors from codecs are lightweight, resolution-stable descriptors of motion dynamics that can bridge evaluation and model improvement.

Method: Extract codec-generated motion vectors (MVs) from H.264/HEVC streams for real and generated videos (GenVidBench, eight generators). Compute distribution divergences (KL, JS, Wasserstein) on MV statistics; visualize MV fields and motion heatmaps; explore MV-RGB fusion (channel concatenation, cross-attention, joint embedding, motion-aware fusion) and evaluate downstream classifiers (ResNet, I3D, TSN).

Result: Divergence measures reveal systematic motion discrepancies; entropy-based divergences rank Pika and SVD closest to real videos, MV-sum statistics favor VC2 and Text2Video-Zero, CogVideo shows largest deviations. MV-field visualizations show center bias, sparse/piecewise-constant flows, and grid-like artifacts not captured by frame-level metrics. MV-RGB fusion improves discrimination performance across backbones (ResNet-18/34 up to 97.4%, I3D up to 99.0%), demonstrating that MVs are effective temporal signals for diagnosing motion defects and strengthening temporal reasoning in discriminative models.

Conclusion: Compressed-domain motion vectors provide a scalable, model-agnostic temporal signal for diagnosing motion defects in generative videos and for improving temporal reasoning in discriminative models; code available at the referenced GitHub repository.

Abstract: Temporal realism remains a central weakness of current generative video models, as most evaluation metrics prioritize spatial appearance and offer limited sensitivity to motion. We introduce a scalable, model-agnostic framework that assesses temporal behavior using motion vectors (MVs) extracted directly from compressed video streams. Codec-generated MVs from standards such as H.264 and HEVC provide lightweight, resolution-consistent descriptors of motion dynamics. We quantify realism by computing Kullback-Leibler, Jensen-Shannon, and Wasserstein divergences between MV statistics of real and generated videos. Experiments on the GenVidBench dataset containing videos from eight state-of-the-art generators reveal systematic discrepancies from real motion: entropy-based divergences rank Pika and SVD as closest to real videos, MV-sum statistics favor VC2 and Text2Video-Zero, and CogVideo shows the largest deviations across both measures. Visualizations of MV fields and class-conditional motion heatmaps further reveal center bias, sparse and piecewise constant flows, and grid-like artifacts that frame-level metrics do not capture. Beyond evaluation, we investigate MV-RGB fusion through channel concatenation, cross-attention, joint embedding, and a motion-aware fusion module. Incorporating MVs improves downstream classification across ResNet, I3D, and TSN backbones, with ResNet-18 and ResNet-34 reaching up to 97.4% accuracy and I3D achieving 99.0% accuracy on real-versus-generated discrimination. These findings demonstrate that compressed-domain MVs provide an effective temporal signal for diagnosing motion defects in generative videos and for strengthening temporal reasoning in discriminative models.

### [20] [SAE-MCVT: A Real-Time and Scalable Multi-Camera Vehicle Tracking Framework Powered by Edge Computing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13904)
*Yuqiang Lin,Sam Lockyer,Florian Stanek,Markus Zarbock,Adrian Evans,Wenbin Li,Nic Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SAE-MCVT is a scalable, real-time multi-camera vehicle tracking framework for city-scale ITS. Edge devices process streams locally and send lightweight metadata to a central server, where cross-camera association uses learned spatial-temporal constraints via a self-supervised camera-link model; it achieves real-time 2K 15 FPS operation with IDF1 61.2 on RoundaboutHD, marking a first in scalable real-time MCVT for city-scale deployments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MCVT methods emphasize accuracy but struggle with real-time performance and scalability at city scale. As camera networks grow, centralized processing becomes a bottleneck and bandwidth increases. A scalable edge-centric architecture with efficient metadata sharing and learned camera-link constraints is needed to enable real-time operation across many cameras.

Method: A multi-edge architecture: multiple edge devices each process live RTSP streams through object detection, tracking, geo-mapping, and feature extraction. Only lightweight metadata (vehicle locations and deep appearance features) are sent to a central workstation. Central cross-camera association is performed under the constraint of spatial-temporal relations between adjacent cameras, learned via a self-supervised camera link model.

Result: The system operates in real-time on 2K 15 FPS video streams and achieves an IDF1 score of 61.2 on the RoundaboutHD dataset, demonstrating real-time scalability and practical performance. It is claimed to be the first scalable real-time MCVT framework suitable for city-scale deployment.

Conclusion: SAE-MCVT demonstrates that a distributed edge-centric approach with learned camera-link relationships can deliver scalable, real-time MCVT for city-scale ITS, balancing detection/tracking accuracy with latency and bandwidth constraints by transmitting minimal metadata to a central server.

Abstract: In modern Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), cameras are a key component due to their ability to provide valuable information for multiple stakeholders. A central task is Multi-Camera Vehicle Tracking (MCVT), which generates vehicle trajectories and enables applications such as anomaly detection, traffic density estimation, and suspect vehicle tracking. However, most existing studies on MCVT emphasize accuracy while overlooking real-time performance and scalability. These two aspects are essential for real-world deployment and become increasingly challenging in city-scale applications as the number of cameras grows. To address this issue, we propose SAE-MCVT, the first scalable real-time MCVT framework. The system includes several edge devices that interact with one central workstation separately. On the edge side, live RTSP video streams are serialized and processed through modules including object detection, object tracking, geo-mapping, and feature extraction. Only lightweight metadata -- vehicle locations and deep appearance features -- are transmitted to the central workstation. On the central side, cross-camera association is calculated under the constraint of spatial-temporal relations between adjacent cameras, which are learned through a self-supervised camera link model. Experiments on the RoundaboutHD dataset show that SAE-MCVT maintains real-time operation on 2K 15 FPS video streams and achieves an IDF1 score of 61.2. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first scalable real-time MCVT framework suitable for city-scale deployment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To ensure autonomous driving systems align with human road-safety norms by evaluating whether current multi-modal LLMs can reason about safety concepts in schematic/illustrative representations.

Method: Create a pilot dataset of traffic-sign and road-safety norm images sourced from school textbooks. Evaluate multi-modal LLMs in a zero-shot setting on safety-reasoning tasks using these images.

Result: Preliminary results indicate that models struggle with safety reasoning and exhibit gaps between human learning and model interpretation.

Conclusion: Identify and discuss performance gaps and propose directions for future research to enhance safety reasoning in multi-modal LLMs for road safety applications.

Abstract: Following road safety norms is non-negotiable not only for humans but also for the AI systems that govern autonomous vehicles. In this work, we evaluate how well multi-modal large language models (LLMs) understand road safety concepts, specifically through schematic and illustrative representations. We curate a pilot dataset of images depicting traffic signs and road-safety norms sourced from school text books and use it to evaluate models capabilities in a zero-shot setting. Our preliminary results show that these models struggle with safety reasoning and reveal gaps between human learning and model interpretation. We further provide an analysis of these performance gaps for future research.

### [22] [Start Small, Think Big: Curriculum-based Relative Policy Optimization for Visual Grounding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13924)
*Qingyang Yan,Guangyao Chen,Yixiong Zou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CuRPO introduces a curriculum-based training regime that organizes data by complexity (CoT length and gIoU) to improve reinforcement-learning fine-tuned CoT reasoning for visual grounding, yielding substantial gains (up to 12.52 mAP on RefCOCO) and robust few-shot performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Chain-of-Thought prompting helps reasoning but RL-based fine-tuning can degrade performance in visual grounding when CoT outputs become lengthy or complex. Increasing dataset size does not always improve performance due to varying data complexities. A curriculum that adapts to complexity is needed.

Method: Propose Curriculum-based Relative Policy Optimization (CuRPO), which uses CoT length and generalized IoU (gIoU) rewards as complexity indicators to progressively structure training data from simpler to more challenging examples, optimized via a relative policy optimization framework.

Result: Extensive experiments on RefCOCO, RefCOCO+, RefCOCOg, and LISA show CuRPO consistently outperforms baselines, including Visual-RFT, with gains up to +12.52 mAP on RefCOCO. It also delivers strong localization in few-shot settings and handles ambiguous/intricate textual descriptions well; code released at the provided GitHub link.

Conclusion: CuRPO demonstrates that curriculum-guided policy optimization guided by CoT length and localization rewards can mitigate CoT-driven degradation in visual grounding and achieve robust, data-efficient improvements across multiple datasets.

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has recently shown significant promise across various NLP and computer vision tasks by explicitly generating intermediate reasoning steps. However, we find that reinforcement learning (RL)-based fine-tuned CoT reasoning can paradoxically degrade performance in Visual Grounding tasks, particularly as CoT outputs become lengthy or complex. Additionally, our analysis reveals that increased dataset size does not always enhance performance due to varying data complexities. Motivated by these findings, we propose Curriculum-based Relative Policy Optimization (CuRPO), a novel training strategy that leverages CoT length and generalized Intersection over Union (gIoU) rewards as complexity indicators to progressively structure training data from simpler to more challenging examples. Extensive experiments on RefCOCO, RefCOCO+, RefCOCOg, and LISA datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. CuRPO consistently outperforms existing methods, including Visual-RFT, with notable improvements of up to +12.52 mAP on RefCOCO. Moreover, CuRPO exhibits exceptional efficiency and robustness, delivering strong localization performance even in few-shot learning scenarios, particularly benefiting tasks characterized by ambiguous and intricate textual descriptions.The code is released on https://github.com/qyoung-yan/CuRPO.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Video-derived frame datasets are prone to information leakage when highly similar frames span training, validation, and test splits, harming generalization. A partitioning method that preserves cross-split integrity and distribution is needed.

Method: Cluster visually similar frames using representation features, then split data into train/val/test with cluster-aware partitioning so that similar frames are managed to reduce leakage and preserve distribution across splits.

Result: Partitions are more representative, balanced, and reliable, indicating reduced leakage and improved dataset integrity.

Conclusion: A cluster-based frame selection approach is effective for mitigating information leakage and improving the quality of video-frame dataset partitions.

Abstract: We propose a cluster-based frame selection strategy to mitigate information leakage in video-derived frames datasets.

*Zachary Shinnick,Liangze Jiang,Hemanth Saratchandran,Damien Teney,Anton van den Hengel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Training ViTs with procedurally generated data before standard image data improves data efficiency and performance; a small budget of synthetic, non-semantic data can match or exceed large real-data gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To uncover and instill generic inductive biases in vision transformers that transfer across modalities, using data that does not rely on natural or semantic content to guide learning.

Method: Pretrain ViTs on procedurally generated data (e.g., formal grammars) in a warm-up phase that bypasses the visual patch embedding, forcing the model to learn abstract computational priors; then fine-tune with standard image-based data.

Result: Significant improvements in data efficiency, convergence speed, and downstream accuracy; on ImageNet-1k, 1% of training budget with procedural data yields >1.7% final accuracy gain; equivalence to ~28% of ImageNet data.

Conclusion: Procedurally generated pretraining offers a promising path toward data-efficient, domain-agnostic pretraining strategies for vision transformers.

Abstract: Transformers show remarkable versatility across domains, suggesting the existence of inductive biases beneficial across modalities. In this work, we explore a new way to instil such generic biases in vision transformers (ViTs) by pretraining on procedurally-generated data devoid of visual or semantic content. We generate this data with simple algorithms such as formal grammars, so the results bear no relationship to either natural or synthetic images. We use this procedurally-generated data to pretrain ViTs in a warm-up phase that bypasses their visual patch embedding mechanisms, thus encouraging the models to internalise abstract computational priors. When followed by standard image-based training, this warm-up significantly improves data efficiency, convergence speed, and downstream performance. On ImageNet-1k for example, allocating just 1% of the training budget to procedural data improves final accuracy by over 1.7%. In terms of its effect on performance, 1% procedurally generated data is thus equivalent to 28% of the ImageNet-1k data. These findings suggest a promising path toward new data-efficient and domain-agnostic pretraining strategies.

*Kevin I. Ruiz Vargas,Gabriel G. Galdino,Tsang Ing Ren,Alexandre L. Cunha*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Learn a PDE-based scalar field with a U‑Net for watershed-based cell segmentation; a robust, resource-efficient approach with competitive results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cell segmentation in images requires robustness to outliers and sharp boundaries while being efficient for edge devices; PDE-based scalar fields offer geometric priors that improve segmentation.

Method: Train a U‑Net to output a scalar field over the image domain. The field is constrained to satisfy Poisson or diffusion (heat) equations by minimizing field residuals without explicit regularization. Segmentation is performed via watershed on the learned field; only a single tensor is needed, enabling lightweight training and inference.

Result: The approach achieves competitive cell segmentation results on public datasets, with robust regression properties that combat outliers and yield sharp boundaries, while maintaining a small memory footprint and fast runtimes.

Conclusion: A simple, geometrically motivated method that delivers strong segmentation performance with low resource requirements, making it suitable for edge computing.

Abstract: We investigate image segmentation of cells under the lens of scalar fields. Our goal is to learn a continuous scalar field on image domains such that its segmentation produces robust instances for cells present in images. This field is a function parameterized by the trained network, and its segmentation is realized by the watershed method. The fields we experiment with are solutions to the Poisson partial differential equation and a diffusion mimicking the steady-state solution of the heat equation. These solutions are obtained by minimizing just the field residuals, no regularization is needed, providing a robust regression capable of diminishing the adverse impacts of outliers in the training data and allowing for sharp cell boundaries. A single tensor is all that is needed to train a \unet\ thus simplifying implementation, lowering training and inference times, hence reducing energy consumption, and requiring a small memory footprint, all attractive features in edge computing. We present competitive results on public datasets from the literature and show that our novel, simple yet geometrically insightful approach can achieve excellent cell segmentation results.

*Kumar Ashutosh,Kristen Grauman*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CrossTrainer learns transfer-friendly, sport-agnostic skill attributes from video and uses a multimodal language model to generate actionable feedback, enabling cross-sport skill assessment with strong performance gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the scarcity of expert annotations and sport-specific models by seeking transferable representations of human skill that apply across different sports.

Method: Identify latent skill-attributes (e.g., balance, control, hand positioning) that generalize across sports from video; train a multimodal language model to produce actionable feedback and proficiency labels for novel videos, validating on cross-sport transfer and in-domain settings.

Result: The approach achieves up to 60% relative gains over state-of-the-art on multiple datasets in both cross-sport transfer and within-sport evaluation, demonstrating improved generalization of the skill representation.

Conclusion: Abstracting shared motor behaviors into transferable skill-attributes yields better generalization and can enrich multimodal LLMs for video-based skill assessment across diverse sports.

Abstract: Skill assessment from video entails rating the quality of a person's physical performance and explaining what could be done better. Today's models specialize for an individual sport, and suffer from the high cost and scarcity of expert-level supervision across the long tail of sports. Towards closing that gap, we explore transferable video representations for skill assessment. Our CrossTrainer approach discovers skill-attributes, such as balance, control, and hand positioning -- whose meaning transcends the boundaries of any given sport, then trains a multimodal language model to generate actionable feedback for a novel video, e.g., "lift hands more to generate more power" as well as its proficiency level, e.g., early expert. We validate the new model on multiple datasets for both cross-sport (transfer) and intra-sport (in-domain) settings, where it achieves gains up to 60% relative to the state of the art. By abstracting out the shared behaviors indicative of human skill, the proposed video representation generalizes substantially better than an array of existing techniques, enriching today's multimodal large language models.

### [28] [CD-DPE: Dual-Prompt Expert Network based on Convolutional Dictionary Feature Decoupling for Multi-Contrast MRI Super-Resolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14014)
*Xianming Gu,Lihui Wang,Ying Cao,Zeyu Deng,Yingfeng Ou,Guodong Hu,Yi Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A dual-prompt expert network (CD-DPE) with convolutional dictionary feature decoupling (CD-FDM) and a dual-prompt feature fusion expert module (DP-FFEM) improves multi-contrast MRI super-resolution by decoupling cross- and intra-contrast features and using prompts to guide feature fusion, yielding better reconstruction and generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Contrasts differences across MRI modalities create challenges in transferring texture and structural information from high-quality reference images to low-resolution targets, leading to suboptimal feature integration and degraded reconstructions.

Method: Introduce CD-DPE framework featuring (1) CD-FDM to iterative decouple features into cross-contrast and intra-contrast components, reducing redundancy and interference, and (2) DP-FFEM with a frequency prompt to select relevant reference features and an adaptive routing prompt to decide how to fuse reference and target features for improved reconstruction.

Result: Extensive experiments on public multi-contrast MRI datasets show that CD-DPE outperforms state-of-the-art methods in reconstructing fine details and generalizes well to unseen datasets.

Conclusion: CD-DPE effectively leverages cross-contrast information through feature decoupling and prompt-guided fusion, achieving higher reconstruction quality and stronger generalization, with potential clinical impact for early diagnosis and decision-making.

Abstract: Multi-contrast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) super-resolution intends to reconstruct high-resolution (HR) images from low-resolution (LR) scans by leveraging structural information present in HR reference images acquired with different contrasts. This technique enhances anatomical detail and soft tissue differentiation, which is vital for early diagnosis and clinical decision-making. However, inherent contrasts disparities between modalities pose fundamental challenges in effectively utilizing reference image textures to guide target image reconstruction, often resulting in suboptimal feature integration. To address this issue, we propose a dual-prompt expert network based on a convolutional dictionary feature decoupling (CD-DPE) strategy for multi-contrast MRI super-resolution. Specifically, we introduce an iterative convolutional dictionary feature decoupling module (CD-FDM) to separate features into cross-contrast and intra-contrast components, thereby reducing redundancy and interference. To fully integrate these features, a novel dual-prompt feature fusion expert module (DP-FFEM) is proposed. This module uses a frequency prompt to guide the selection of relevant reference features for incorporation into the target image, while an adaptive routing prompt determines the optimal method for fusing reference and target features to enhance reconstruction quality. Extensive experiments on public multi-contrast MRI datasets demonstrate that CD-DPE outperforms state-of-the-art methods in reconstructing fine details. Additionally, experiments on unseen datasets demonstrated that CD-DPE exhibits strong generalization capabilities.

*Jack Qin,Zhitao Wang,Yinan Zheng,Keyu Chen,Yang Zhou,Yuanxin Zhong,Siyuan Cheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Risk Semantic Distillation (RSD) introduces a plug-in RiskHead that distills causal risk estimates from Vision-Language Models into Bird's-Eye-View features to boost end-to-end autonomous driving performance and generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generalization gaps in autonomous driving remain a key challenge. Existing Vision-Language Model (VLM) approaches can create inconsistent hybrid planning systems or be computationally prohibitive when used for end-to-end control. There is a need to leverage risk-aware signals from VLMs to improve BEV representations and planning in a lightweight, interpretable way.

Method: Introduce RiskHead, a plug-in module that distills causal risk estimates from Vision-Language Models into BEV features, producing interpretable risk-attention maps. These risk attentions guide BEV representations so the end-to-end AD backbone can learn richer, risk-aware features, improving handling of spatial boundaries and risky objects. The approach focuses on risk attention to align driving behavior with human-like risk awareness.

Result: Bench2Drive experiments show that incorporating RSD yields significant improvements in perception and planning capabilities. The enhanced BEV representations enable better handling of complex and unpredictable driving conditions, with interpretable risk-attention maps illustrating where the model concentrates on risk.

Conclusion: RSD provides a practical, interpretable framework to infuse risk awareness into end-to-end autonomous driving training by distilling risk signals from VLMs into BEV features, improving generalization and aligning behavior with human-like driving in dynamic environments.

Abstract: The autonomous driving (AD) system has exhibited remarkable performance in complex driving scenarios. However, generalization is still a key limitation for the current system, which refers to the ability to handle unseen scenarios or unfamiliar sensor configurations.Related works have explored the use of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to address few-shot or zero-shot tasks. While promising, these methods introduce a new challenge: the emergence of a hybrid AD system, where two distinct systems are used to plan a trajectory, leading to potential inconsistencies. Alternative research directions have explored Vision-Language-Action (VLA) frameworks that generate control actions from VLM directly. However, these end-to-end solutions demonstrate prohibitive computational demands. To overcome these challenges, we introduce Risk Semantic Distillation (RSD), a novel framework that leverages VLMs to enhance the training of End-to-End (E2E) AD backbones. By providing risk attention for key objects, RSD addresses the issue of generalization. Specifically, we introduce RiskHead, a plug-in module that distills causal risk estimates from Vision-Language Models into Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) features, yielding interpretable risk-attention maps.This approach allows BEV features to learn richer and more nuanced risk attention representations, which directly enhance the model's ability to handle spatial boundaries and risky objects.By focusing on risk attention, RSD aligns better with human-like driving behavior, which is essential to navigate in complex and dynamic environments. Our experiments on the Bench2Drive benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of RSD in managing complex and unpredictable driving conditions. Due to the enhanced BEV representations enabled by RSD, we observed a significant improvement in both perception and planning capabilities.

### [30] [RISE: Single Static Radar-based Indoor Scene Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14019)
*Kaichen Zhou,Laura Dodds,Sayed Saad Afzal,Fadel Adib*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RISE: a radar-based indoor scene understanding benchmark and system that leverages multipath reflections via Bi-Angular Multipath Enhancement and a Hierarchical Diffusion framework to reconstruct layouts and detect objects from a single static mmWave radar, with a 50k-frame dataset showing major gains in layout accuracy and first mmWave object detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Indoor scene understanding with privacy preservation is important; RGB/LiDAR raise occlusion and privacy concerns indoors, while mmWave offers privacy but suffers from low resolution. Exploiting multipath reflections as informative cues can enable geometry-aware understanding with a single radar.

Method: Bi-Angular Multipath Enhancement models Angle-of-Arrival and Angle-of-Departure to recover ghost reflections and reveal hidden structures. A simulation-to-reality Hierarchical Diffusion framework converts fragmented radar responses into complete layout reconstructions and object detections. A large-scale radar-based indoor scene dataset (50k frames, 100 trajectories) supports evaluation.

Result: RISE reduces layout Chamfer Distance by 60% (to 16 cm) and achieves 58% IoU for mmWave-based object detection, establishing the first mmWave-based object detection and providing a foundation for privacy-preserving indoor scene understanding with a single static radar.

Conclusion: RISE introduces a new benchmark and system that harnesses multipath cues for geometry-aware indoor understanding, enabling reliable layout reconstruction and object detection while preserving privacy with a single static mmWave radar.

Abstract: Robust and privacy-preserving indoor scene understanding remains a fundamental open problem. While optical sensors such as RGB and LiDAR offer high spatial fidelity, they suffer from severe occlusions and introduce privacy risks in indoor environments. In contrast, millimeter-wave (mmWave) radar preserves privacy and penetrates obstacles, but its inherently low spatial resolution makes reliable geometric reasoning difficult.
  We introduce RISE, the first benchmark and system for single-static-radar indoor scene understanding, jointly targeting layout reconstruction and object detection. RISE is built upon the key insight that multipath reflections, traditionally treated as noise, encode rich geometric cues. To exploit this, we propose a Bi-Angular Multipath Enhancement that explicitly models Angle-of-Arrival and Angle-of-Departure to recover secondary (ghost) reflections and reveal invisible structures. On top of these enhanced observations, a simulation-to-reality Hierarchical Diffusion framework transforms fragmented radar responses into complete layout reconstruction and object detection.
  Our benchmark contains 50,000 frames collected across 100 real indoor trajectories, forming the first large-scale dataset dedicated to radar-based indoor scene understanding. Extensive experiments show that RISE reduces the Chamfer Distance by 60% (down to 16 cm) compared to the state of the art in layout reconstruction, and delivers the first mmWave-based object detection, achieving 58% IoU. These results establish RISE as a new foundation for geometry-aware and privacy-preserving indoor scene understanding using a single static radar.

TL;DR: Co-Me accelerates visual geometric transformers by using a lightweight confidence predictor to rank tokens by uncertainty and selectively merge low-confidence tokens, achieving substantial speedups without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce computation in visual geometric transformers (VGGTs) while preserving spatial coverage and performance, enabling real-time 3D perception and reconstruction.

Method: Train a compact confidence predictor that scores token uncertainty and guides selective token merging; merge low-confidence tokens to reduce sequence length; designed to work without retraining or finetuning the base model and to apply to multi-view and streaming VGGTs.

Result: Demonstrates significant speedups (up to 11.3x on VGGT and 7.2x on MapAnything) with no degradation in performance, outperforming similarity-based merging or pruning by leveraging the confidence signal.

Conclusion: Co-Me provides a practical, model-agnostic acceleration mechanism for VGGTs that scales with sequence length and enables real-time 3D perception and reconstruction without retraining.

Abstract: We propose Confidence-Guided Token Merging (Co-Me), an acceleration mechanism for visual geometric transformers without retraining or finetuning the base model. Co-Me distilled a light-weight confidence predictor to rank tokens by uncertainty and selectively merge low-confidence ones, effectively reducing computation while maintaining spatial coverage. Compared to similarity-based merging or pruning, the confidence signal in Co-Me reliably indicates regions emphasized by the transformer, enabling substantial acceleration without degrading performance. Co-Me applies seamlessly to various multi-view and streaming visual geometric transformers, achieving speedups that scale with sequence length. When applied to VGGT and MapAnything, Co-Me achieves up to $11.3\times$ and $7.2\times$ speedup, making visual geometric transformers practical for real-time 3D perception and reconstruction.

*SangHyuk Kim,Daniel Haehn,Sumientra Rampersad*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A 2.5D context-aware model predicts MRI plane orientation metadata from 2D/3D slices, outperforming a 2D baseline; improves downstream brain-tumor detection; and is provided via an open-source web app.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Missing plane orientation metadata in MRI datasets complicates analysis, increases domain shift when merging heterogeneous data, and lowers diagnostic classifier accuracy. While humans can identify planes on a 2D slice, automation struggles and metadata gaps hinder robust analysis.

Method: Developed a 2.5D context-aware model that leverages multi-slice information to disambiguate plane orientation. Trained on both 3D slice sequences and static 2D images. Includes a gating strategy that uses uncertainty to selectively apply metadata-enhanced predictions, and is integrated into an interactive web application.

Result: 2D reference model accuracy: 98.74%. 2.5D model accuracy: 99.49% (≈60% error reduction). In brain tumor detection, accuracy improves from 97.0% (image-only) to 98.0% with metadata-guided predictions, reducing misdiagnoses by 33.3%. The system is provided as open-source via an interactive web app.

Conclusion: A 2.5D plane-orientation generator effectively creates reliable orientation metadata, reducing ambiguity and improving downstream diagnostic performance, with practical deployment via an open-source web interface.

Abstract: Humans can easily identify anatomical planes (axial, coronal, and sagittal) on a 2D MRI slice, but automated systems struggle with this task. Missing plane orientation metadata can complicate analysis, increase domain shift when merging heterogeneous datasets, and reduce accuracy of diagnostic classifiers. This study develops a classifier that accurately generates plane orientation metadata. We adopt a 2.5D context-aware model that leverages multi-slice information to avoid ambiguity from isolated slices and enable robust feature learning. We train the 2.5D model on both 3D slice sequences and static 2D images. While our 2D reference model achieves 98.74% accuracy, our 2.5D method raises this to 99.49%, reducing errors by 60%, highlighting the importance of 2.5D context. We validate the utility of our generated metadata in a brain tumor detection task. A gated strategy selectively uses metadata-enhanced predictions based on uncertainty scores, boosting accuracy from 97.0% with an image-only model to 98.0%, reducing misdiagnoses by 33.3%. We integrate our plane orientation model into an interactive web application and provide it open-source.

### [33] [LINGUAL: Language-INtegrated GUidance in Active Learning for Medical Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14028)
*Md Shazid Islam,Shreyangshu Bera,Sudipta Paul,Amit K. Roy-Chowdhury*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LINGUAL uses natural language instructions to automate sub-tasks for active domain adaptation in segmentation, achieving similar or better results than active learning with ~80% annotation time savings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Active learning in medical image segmentation is labor-intensive due to blurry boundaries; ROI size affects cognitive load and annotation cost; language guidance offers a low-effort alternative.

Method: Accepts natural language instructions and uses in-context learning to translate them into executable programs, which autonomously perform a sequence of segmentation/adaptation subtasks without human input.

Result: Comparable or superior performance to active learning baselines in active domain adaptation, with an estimated ~80% reduction in annotation time.

Conclusion: Language-guided, programmatic execution is an effective and efficient alternative to traditional active learning for medical image segmentation in active domain adaptation, reducing annotation burden while maintaining or improving performance.

Abstract: Although active learning (AL) in segmentation tasks enables experts to annotate selected regions of interest (ROIs) instead of entire images, it remains highly challenging, labor-intensive, and cognitively demanding due to the blurry and ambiguous boundaries commonly observed in medical images. Also, in conventional AL, annotation effort is a function of the ROI- larger regions make the task cognitively easier but incur higher annotation costs, whereas smaller regions demand finer precision and more attention from the expert. In this context, language guidance provides an effective alternative, requiring minimal expert effort while bypassing the cognitively demanding task of precise boundary delineation in segmentation. Towards this goal, we introduce LINGUAL: a framework that receives natural language instructions from an expert, translates them into executable programs through in-context learning, and automatically performs the corresponding sequence of sub-tasks without any human intervention. We demonstrate the effectiveness of LINGUAL in active domain adaptation (ADA) achieving comparable or superior performance to AL baselines while reducing estimated annotation time by approximately 80%.

*Sungik Choi,Hankook Lee,Moontae Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WaRPAD is a training-free AI-generated image detector that uses self-supervised features. It measures embedding sensitivity to high-frequency perturbations via Haar wavelets, aggregates across image patches to handle resizing, and achieves competitive performance with robustness to corruptions across diverse datasets and 23 generative models, applicable across self-supervised models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid emergence of vision-generative models necessitates detectors that do not rely on task-specific training data. By leveraging self-supervised representations—trained to be invariant to augmentations like RandomResizedCrop—WaRPAD aims to detect AI-generated imagery without prior data knowledge or datasets.

Method: Define a base score based on the sensitivity of image embeddings to perturbations along high-frequency directions identified by Haar wavelet decomposition. To simulate cropping robustness, resize each image to a multiple of the model's input size, partition into patches, compute the base score for each patch, and average over patches to obtain the final detection score.

Result: WaRPAD was validated on real datasets with diverse resolutions and domains and on images generated by 23 different generative models. It achieved competitive performance and demonstrated strong robustness to test-time corruptions. The method is applicable across different self-supervised models due to the common invariance to RandomResizedCrop training.

Conclusion: WaRPAD demonstrates that a training-free detector leveraging self-supervised invariances and high-frequency perturbation sensitivity can yield robust AI-generated image detection across diverse conditions and model families, without requiring prior data.

Abstract: AI-generated image detection has become crucial with the rapid advancement of vision-generative models. Instead of training detectors tailored to specific datasets, we study a training-free approach leveraging self-supervised models without requiring prior data knowledge. These models, pre-trained with augmentations like RandomResizedCrop, learn to produce consistent representations across varying resolutions. Motivated by this, we propose WaRPAD, a training-free AI-generated image detection algorithm based on self-supervised models. Since neighborhood pixel differences in images are highly sensitive to resizing operations, WaRPAD first defines a base score function that quantifies the sensitivity of image embeddings to perturbations along high-frequency directions extracted via Haar wavelet decomposition. To simulate robustness against cropping augmentation, we rescale each image to a multiple of the models input size, divide it into smaller patches, and compute the base score for each patch. The final detection score is then obtained by averaging the scores across all patches. We validate WaRPAD on real datasets of diverse resolutions and domains, and images generated by 23 different generative models. Our method consistently achieves competitive performance and demonstrates strong robustness to test-time corruptions. Furthermore, as invariance to RandomResizedCrop is a common training scheme across self-supervised models, we show that WaRPAD is applicable across self-supervised models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A diffusion-based deformation-free framework, FashionMAC, outpaints garment regions to preserve texture and uses region-adaptive decoupled attention (RADA) with chained mask injection to enable fine-grained control over fashion-model appearance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address garment texture distortions caused by garment deformation during generation and to enable fine-grained control over generated models’ appearance, which current methods struggle to achieve.

Method: Propose FashionMAC, a diffusion-based deformation-free framework that outpaints the garment region segmented from a dressed person instead of deforming the garment. Introduces region-adaptive decoupled attention (RADA) to predict generation regions for each fine-grained text attribute and uses a chained mask injection strategy to enforce attributes on the predicted regions.

Result: Extensive experiments show superior performance versus state-of-the-art methods in fidelity and controllability of fashion showcase images.

Conclusion: FashionMAC achieves high-quality and controllable fashion image generation by preserving garment details without deformation and enabling fine-grained control through RADA and chained mask injection.

Abstract: Garment-centric fashion image generation aims to synthesize realistic and controllable human models dressing a given garment, which has attracted growing interest due to its practical applications in e-commerce. The key challenges of the task lie in two aspects: (1) faithfully preserving the garment details, and (2) gaining fine-grained controllability over the model's appearance. Existing methods typically require performing garment deformation in the generation process, which often leads to garment texture distortions. Also, they fail to control the fine-grained attributes of the generated models, due to the lack of specifically designed mechanisms. To address these issues, we propose FashionMAC, a novel diffusion-based deformation-free framework that achieves high-quality and controllable fashion showcase image generation. The core idea of our framework is to eliminate the need for performing garment deformation and directly outpaint the garment segmented from a dressed person, which enables faithful preservation of the intricate garment details. Moreover, we propose a novel region-adaptive decoupled attention (RADA) mechanism along with a chained mask injection strategy to achieve fine-grained appearance controllability over the synthesized human models. Specifically, RADA adaptively predicts the generated regions for each fine-grained text attribute and enforces the text attribute to focus on the predicted regions by a chained mask injection strategy, significantly enhancing the visual fidelity and the controllability. Extensive experiments validate the superior performance of our framework compared to existing state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: Latent diffusion-based super-resolution for coarse flood maps delivers high-fidelity, real-time flood maps with improved cross-location generalizability and physics-informed inputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional physics-based hydrodynamic models are computationally expensive for high-resolution, large-scale, real-time flood mapping. CNN-based super-resolution boosts speed but struggles to generalize to unseen regions and often lacks interpretability.

Method: Apply latent diffusion models to upsample coarse-grid flood maps to fine-resolution predictions. Incorporate physics-informed inputs, employ transfer learning for rapid adaptation to new regions, and compare against baseline methods.

Result: Significantly reduced inference time while maintaining high accuracy; better generalization across geographic locations; transfer learning accelerates adaptation to new regions; code released for reproducibility.

Conclusion: The approach enables real-time, high-fidelity flood risk mapping with improved interpretability and cross-location robustness, addressing computational and generalization limitations of prior methods.

Abstract: Flood prediction is critical for emergency planning and response to mitigate human and economic losses. Traditional physics-based hydrodynamic models generate high-resolution flood maps using numerical methods requiring fine-grid discretization; which are computationally intensive and impractical for real-time large-scale applications. While recent studies have applied convolutional neural networks for flood map super-resolution with good accuracy and speed, they suffer from limited generalizability to unseen areas. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that leverages latent diffusion models to perform super-resolution on coarse-grid flood maps, with the objective of achieving the accuracy of fine-grid flood maps while significantly reducing inference time. Experimental results demonstrate that latent diffusion models substantially decrease the computational time required to produce high-fidelity flood maps without compromising on accuracy, enabling their use in real-time flood risk management. Moreover, diffusion models exhibit superior generalizability across different physical locations, with transfer learning further accelerating adaptation to new geographic regions. Our approach also incorporates physics-informed inputs, addressing the common limitation of black-box behavior in machine learning, thereby enhancing interpretability.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A two-stage defect detection/classification framework for concrete bridge defects using drone imagery: (1) saliency-based region proposals to identify defect regions, (2) a YOLOX detector on saliency-enhanced images with bounding-box brightness augmentation. Demonstrates accuracy and efficiency on standard datasets and shows potential for self-powered inspection systems.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bridge structures are prone to defects that are challenging to detect automatically. Drone-based inspection coupled with efficient detection methods can enable rapid, accurate, and remote assessment of infrastructure health.

Method: Stage 1 uses saliency to propose defect regions by exploiting local discontinuities in surface patterns. Stage 2 applies a YOLOX-based detector on saliency-enhanced images, where brightness augmentation is performed at the bounding-box level for salient defect regions.

Result: Experimental results on standard datasets indicate good performance in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency, suggesting the framework is viable for deployment in automated or self-powered inspection contexts.

Conclusion: The proposed two-stage framework demonstrates promise for practical deployment in autonomous bridge inspection, achieving accurate defect detection and efficient computation, with potential integration into self-powered inspection systems.

Abstract: Anomaly object detection and classification are one of the main challenging tasks in computer vision and pattern recognition. In this paper, we propose a new method to automatically detect, localize and classify defects in concrete bridge structures using drone imagery. This framework is constituted of two main stages. The first stage uses saliency for defect region proposals where defects often exhibit local discontinuities in the normal surface patterns with regard to their surrounding. The second stage employs a YOLOX-based deep learning detector that operates on saliency-enhanced images obtained by applying bounding-box level brightness augmentation to salient defect regions. Experimental results on standard datasets confirm the performance of our framework and its suitability in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency, which give a huge potential to be implemented in a self-powered inspection system.

*Dongyang Jin,Ryan Xu,Jianhao Zeng,Rui Lan,Yancheng Bai,Lei Sun,Xiangxiang Chu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SCAR: a semantic-context-driven autoregressive image editing/generation method that uses Compressed Semantic Prefilling and Semantic Alignment Guidance to improve instruction fidelity and visual quality, generalizes to next-token and next-set AR with minimal changes, outperforming prior AR methods on editing and controllable generation benchmarks; code will be released.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autoregressive image models historically struggle with weak, inefficient conditioning for editing tasks, leading to poor adherence to instructions and artifacts. The paper seeks to improve conditioning and alignment to enable reliable editing and controllable generation.

Method: Introduce Compressed Semantic Prefilling to encode high-level semantics into a compact prefix; apply Semantic Alignment Guidance to align the final visual hidden states with target semantics during autoregressive decoding; build on vector-quantized prefilling for efficiency; compatible with next-token and next-set AR with minimal architectural changes.

Result: SCAR achieves superior visual fidelity and semantic alignment on instruction editing and controllable generation benchmarks, outperforming prior AR-based methods while preserving controllability.

Conclusion: SCAR overcomes semantic limitations of prior AR methods, offering flexible, efficient, and generalizable semantic conditioning for autoregressive image generation/editing; code will be released.

Abstract: Recently, autoregressive (AR) models have shown strong potential in image generation, offering better scalability and easier integration with unified multi-modal systems compared to diffusion-based methods. However, extending AR models to general image editing remains challenging due to weak and inefficient conditioning, often leading to poor instruction adherence and visual artifacts. To address this, we propose SCAR, a Semantic-Context-driven method for Autoregressive models. SCAR introduces two key components: Compressed Semantic Prefilling, which encodes high-level semantics into a compact and efficient prefix, and Semantic Alignment Guidance, which aligns the last visual hidden states with target semantics during autoregressive decoding to enhance instruction fidelity. Unlike decoding-stage injection methods, SCAR builds upon the flexibility and generality of vector-quantized-based prefilling while overcoming its semantic limitations and high cost.

### [39] [CORE: Compact Object-centric REpresentations as a New Paradigm for Token Merging in LVLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14072)
*Jingyu Lei,Gaoang Wang,Der-Horng Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CORE introduces object-centric representations for visual token compression in LVLMs, using an object-mask prior to guide token merging and a centroid-guided sorting to preserve spatial order, achieving state-of-the-art fixed-rate compression and strong adaptive-rate efficiency with minimal performance loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LVLMs incur very high computational/memory costs due to quadratic growth of visual tokens. Existing token compression lacks high-level semantic guidance, causing suboptimal merges and information loss.

Method: Employ a segmentation decoder to generate object masks as semantic priors, merge visual tokens into compact object-centric representations guided by these masks, and apply centroid-guided sorting to restore coherent spatial ordering.

Result: Demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on six fixed-rate compression benchmarks; exhibits dramatic efficiency gains in adaptive-rate settings; under extreme compression (2.2% tokens), retains 97.4% of baseline performance.

Conclusion: Object-centric representations are superior for efficient and effective LVLM processing; CORE provides a practical and scalable approach to token compression.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) usually suffer from prohibitive computational and memory costs due to the quadratic growth of visual tokens with image resolution. Existing token compression methods, while varied, often lack a high-level semantic understanding, leading to suboptimal merges, information redundancy, or context loss. To address these limitations, we introduce CORE (Compact Object-centric REpresentations), a new paradigm for visual token compression. CORE leverages an efficient segmentation decoder to generate object masks, which serve as a high-level semantic prior to guide the merging of visual tokens into a compact set of object-centric representations. Furthermore, a novel centroid-guided sorting mechanism restores a coherent spatial order to the merged tokens, preserving vital positional information. Extensive experiments show that CORE not only establishes a new state-of-the-art on six authoritative benchmarks for fixed-rate compression, but also achieves dramatic efficiency gains in adaptive-rate settings. Even under extreme compression, after aggressively retaining with only 2.2% of all visual tokens, CORE still maintains 97.4% of baseline performance. Our work demonstrates the superiority of object-centric representations for efficient and effective LVLM processing.

### [40] [Zero-Training Task-Specific Model Synthesis for Few-Shot Medical Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14082)
*Yao Qin,Yangyang Yan,YuanChao Yang,Jinhua Pang,Huanyong Bi,Yuan Liu,HaiHua Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Zero-training paradigm that synthesizes an entire task-specific classifier’s weights from minimal inputs (1-shot image + clinical text) using a pre-trained generative engine, enabling immediate deployment without task-specific training and achieving state-of-the-art few-shot performance on medical imaging benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical image analysis hinges on large, meticulously annotated datasets. This is especially problematic for rare diseases with scarce samples and expensive expert labeling. A data-efficient solution that eliminates task-specific training could dramatically accelerate deployment and widen access to AI-assisted diagnosis.

Method: Propose Semantic-Guided Parameter Synthesizer (SGPS) under a Zero-Training Task-Specific Model Synthesis (ZS-TMS) framework. Given minimal task information (e.g., a single example image and a clinical text description), a large-scale pre-trained generative engine directly synthesizes the entire parameter set for a lightweight classifier (e.g., EfficientNet-V2). The synthesized classifier is ready for inference without any task-specific training or fine-tuning.

Result: Extensive evaluations on few-shot benchmarks derived from ISIC 2018 and a custom rare-disease dataset show SGPS achieving new state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming advanced few-shot and zero-shot methods, particularly in ultra-low data regimes (1-shot and 5-shot).

Conclusion: ZS-TMS with SGPS offers rapid development and deployment of AI-powered diagnostic tools, especially for the long tail of rare diseases where data are severely limited. It shifts the burden from collecting annotated data to leveraging a generative engine to synthesize task-specific parameters, enabling immediate inference without task-specific training.

Abstract: Deep learning models have achieved remarkable success in medical image analysis but are fundamentally constrained by the requirement for large-scale, meticulously annotated datasets. This dependency on "big data" is a critical bottleneck in the medical domain, where patient data is inherently difficult to acquire and expert annotation is expensive, particularly for rare diseases where samples are scarce by definition. To overcome this fundamental challenge, we propose a novel paradigm: Zero-Training Task-Specific Model Synthesis (ZS-TMS). Instead of adapting a pre-existing model or training a new one, our approach leverages a large-scale, pre-trained generative engine to directly synthesize the entire set of parameters for a task-specific classifier. Our framework, the Semantic-Guided Parameter Synthesizer (SGPS), takes as input minimal, multi-modal task information as little as a single example image (1-shot) and a corresponding clinical text description to directly synthesize the entire set of parameters for a task-specific classifier.
  The generative engine interprets these inputs to generate the weights for a lightweight, efficient classifier (e.g., an EfficientNet-V2), which can be deployed for inference immediately without any task-specific training or fine-tuning. We conduct extensive evaluations on challenging few-shot classification benchmarks derived from the ISIC 2018 skin lesion dataset and a custom rare disease dataset. Our results demonstrate that SGPS establishes a new state-of-the-art, significantly outperforming advanced few-shot and zero-shot learning methods, especially in the ultra-low data regimes of 1-shot and 5-shot classification. This work paves the way for the rapid development and deployment of AI-powered diagnostic tools, particularly for the long tail of rare diseases where data is critically limited.

### [41] [Automated glenoid bone loss measurement and segmentation in CT scans for pre-operative planning in shoulder instability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14083)
*Zhonghao Liu,Hanxue Gu,Qihang Li,Michael Fox,Jay M. Levin,Maciej A. Mazurowski,Brian C. Lau*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A fully automated deep learning pipeline for measuring glenoid bone loss on 3D CT shows strong agreement with expert consensus and surgeon consistency, using a multi-stage approach (segmentation, landmark detection, geometric fitting) with PCA-based circle fitting; good performance in low/high bone-loss subgroups and reasonable ability to categorize patients by severity; code/data released.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce time and interreader variability in glenoid bone loss measurement, which currently relies on manual/semi-automated methods and may be inconsistent across readers.

Method: A three-stage pipeline: (1) U-Net-based segmentation of glenoid and humerus; (2) anatomical landmark detection to predict glenoid rim points; (3) geometric fitting using PCA, projection, and circle fitting to compute percentage bone loss from en-face 2D projection of 3D CT (best-circle method). Evaluation on 91 retrospective shoulder CT scans with manual labels; metrics include ICC for measurement agreement and recall for classifying bone-loss severity.

Result: Automated measurements showed strong agreement with consensus readings and exceeded surgeon-to-surgeon consistency (ICC 0.84 vs 0.78). Subgroup ICCs: low-bone-loss 0.71 vs 0.63; high-bone-loss 0.83 vs 0.21 (note: requires context for the high-loss comparator). For severity classification, recall: low 0.714, high 0.857; no misclassification between low and high groups.Code and dataset publicly available on GitHub.

Conclusion: The pipeline is time-efficient and clinically reliable for preoperative planning and screening for substantial glenoid bone loss, with robust performance across bone-loss levels; potential utility in reducing variability and expediting shoulder instability assessments.

Abstract: Reliable measurement of glenoid bone loss is essential for operative planning in shoulder instability, but current manual and semi-automated methods are time-consuming and often subject to interreader variability. We developed and validated a fully automated deep learning pipeline for measuring glenoid bone loss on three-dimensional computed tomography (CT) scans using a linear-based, en-face view, best-circle method. Shoulder CT images of 91 patients (average age, 40 years; range, 14-89 years; 65 men) were retrospectively collected along with manual labels including glenoid segmentation, landmarks, and bone loss measurements. The multi-stage algorithm has three main stages: (1) segmentation, where we developed a U-Net to automatically segment the glenoid and humerus; (2) anatomical landmark detection, where a second network predicts glenoid rim points; and (3) geometric fitting, where we applied principal component analysis (PCA), projection, and circle fitting to compute the percentage of bone loss. The automated measurements showed strong agreement with consensus readings and exceeded surgeon-to-surgeon consistency (intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) 0.84 vs 0.78), including in low- and high-bone-loss subgroups (ICC 0.71 vs 0.63 and 0.83 vs 0.21, respectively; P < 0.001). For classifying patients into low, medium, and high bone-loss categories, the pipeline achieved a recall of 0.714 for low and 0.857 for high severity, with no low cases misclassified as high or vice versa. These results suggest that our method is a time-efficient and clinically reliable tool for preoperative planning in shoulder instability and for screening patients with substantial glenoid bone loss.

### [42] [Error-Driven Scene Editing for 3D Grounding in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14086)
*Yue Zhang,Zun Wang,Han Lin,Jialu Li,Jianing Yang,Yonatan Bitton,Idan Szpektor,Mohit Bansal*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DEER-3D presents an error-driven 3D scene editing framework to improve grounding of 3D LLMs by diagnosing predicate-level failures and applying minimal, targeted edits to generate counterfactual supervision for iterative fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D-LLMs struggle with accurate grounding due to scarce 3D data and biases toward language reasoning, causing grounding failures in 3D environments. The paper proposes scene editing as a data-efficient method to produce precise counterfactuals and reduce grounding bias.

Method: Introduce the DEER-3D workflow: Decompose, Diagnostic Evaluation, Edit, and Re-train. When grounding fails, diagnose the predicate-level error (e.g., attribute or spatial relation); perform minimal, predicate-aligned 3D edits (e.g., recolor, reposition) to create counterfactual supervision; iteratively fine-tune the model; evaluate on multiple 3D grounding benchmarks showing improvements.

Result: The editing pipeline yields consistent improvements across multiple 3D grounding and scene understanding benchmarks after iterative refinement.

Conclusion: Targeted, error-driven scene editing bridges linguistic reasoning and spatial grounding in 3D LLMs; DEER-3D provides a principled framework that improves grounding more effectively than broad data augmentation.

Abstract: Despite recent progress in 3D-LLMs, they remain limited in accurately grounding language to visual and spatial elements in 3D environments. This limitation stems in part from training data that focuses on language reasoning rather than spatial understanding due to scarce 3D resources, leaving inherent grounding biases unresolved. To address this, we propose 3D scene editing as a key mechanism to generate precise visual counterfactuals that mitigate these biases through fine-grained spatial manipulation, without requiring costly scene reconstruction or large-scale 3D data collection. Furthermore, to make these edits targeted and directly address the specific weaknesses of the model, we introduce DEER-3D, an error-driven framework following a structured "Decompose, Diagnostic Evaluation, Edit, and Re-train" workflow, rather than broadly or randomly augmenting data as in conventional approaches. Specifically, upon identifying a grounding failure of the 3D-LLM, our framework first diagnoses the exact predicate-level error (e.g., attribute or spatial relation). It then executes minimal, predicate-aligned 3D scene edits, such as recoloring or repositioning, to produce targeted counterfactual supervision for iterative model fine-tuning, significantly enhancing grounding accuracy. We evaluate our editing pipeline across multiple benchmarks for 3D grounding and scene understanding tasks, consistently demonstrating improvements across all evaluated datasets through iterative refinement. DEER-3D underscores the effectiveness of targeted, error-driven scene editing in bridging linguistic reasoning capabilities with spatial grounding in 3D LLMs.

*Jun Ding,Shang Gao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GCA-ResUNet adds Grouped Coordinate Attention to ResNet-50 blocks to capture global dependencies efficiently in medical image segmentation, yielding strong Dice scores (86.11% Synapse, 92.64% ACDC) with good efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: U-Net-like architectures excel but struggle with long-range dependencies; vanilla transformers improve global context but are heavy and data-hungry. There is a need for efficient global modeling in CNN-based medical segmentation.

Method: Incorporate Grouped Coordinate Attention (GCA) into ResNet-50 residual blocks. GCA jointly models global dependencies across channels and spatial coordinates using grouped coordinate operations, providing global contextual modeling with minimal parameter and FLOP overhead compared to self-attention.

Result: On Synapse dataset, Dice = 86.11%; on ACDC dataset, Dice = 92.64%; outperforms several state-of-the-art baselines while maintaining fast inference and computational efficiency.

Conclusion: GCA offers a practical way to enrich convolutional architectures with global modeling capability, enabling high-accuracy and resource-efficient medical image segmentation.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation underpins computer-aided diagnosis and therapy by supporting clinical diagnosis, preoperative planning, and disease monitoring. While U-Net style convolutional neural networks perform well due to their encoder-decoder structures with skip connections, they struggle to capture long-range dependencies. Transformer-based variants address global context but often require heavy computation and large training datasets. This paper proposes GCA-ResUNet, an efficient segmentation network that integrates Grouped Coordinate Attention (GCA) into ResNet-50 residual blocks. GCA uses grouped coordinate modeling to jointly encode global dependencies across channels and spatial locations, strengthening feature representation and boundary delineation while adding minimal parameter and FLOP overhead compared with self-attention. On the Synapse dataset, GCA-ResUNet achieves a Dice score of 86.11%, and on the ACDC dataset, it reaches 92.64%, surpassing several state-of-the-art baselines while maintaining fast inference and favorable computational efficiency. These results indicate that GCA offers a practical way to enhance convolutional architectures with global modeling capability, enabling high-accuracy and resource-efficient medical image segmentation.

### [44] [SMGeo: Cross-View Object Geo-Localization with Grid-Level Mixture-of-Experts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14093)
*Fan Zhang,Haoyuan Ren,Fei Ma,Qiang Yin,Yongsheng Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SMGeo is an end-to-end, promptable transformer model for cross-view object geo-localization that uses grid-level sparse MoE and an anchor-free detector to achieve real-time, interactive localization, outperforming prior multi-stage pipelines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional cross-view localization relies on multi-stage retrieval and matching pipelines that accumulate errors due to large viewpoint/scale gaps and background clutter; there's a need for an end-to-end, interactive, real-time model.

Method: A Swin-Transformer-based joint encoder processes drone and satellite imagery; grid-level sparse Mixture-of-Experts (GMoE) in the cross-view encoder adaptively activates specialized experts per grid; an anchor-free detection head regresses coordinates with heat-map supervision; click prompting enables interactive use; inference is real-time.

Result: On the drone-to-satellite task, SMGeo achieves leading performance across IoU=0.25 and mIoU metrics (e.g., 87.51%, 62.50%, and 61.45% in the test set, respectively), significantly surpassing DetGeo (61.97%, 57.66%, and 54.05%, respectively). Ablation studies indicate gains from shared encoding, query-guided fusion, and grid-level sparse MoE.

Conclusion: The work demonstrates that shared encoding, query-guided fusion, and adaptive GMoE provide complementary gains enabling an end-to-end, promptable, real-time cross-view geo-localization system that outperforms traditional pipelines.

Abstract: Cross-view object Geo-localization aims to precisely pinpoint the same object across large-scale satellite imagery based on drone images. Due to significant differences in viewpoint and scale, coupled with complex background interference, traditional multi-stage "retrieval-matching" pipelines are prone to cumulative errors. To address this, we present SMGeo, a promptable end-to-end transformer-based model for object Geo-localization. This model supports click prompting and can output object Geo-localization in real time when prompted to allow for interactive use. The model employs a fully transformer-based architecture, utilizing a Swin-Transformer for joint feature encoding of both drone and satellite imagery and an anchor-free transformer detection head for coordinate regression. In order to better capture both inter-modal and intra-view dependencies, we introduce a grid-level sparse Mixture-of-Experts (GMoE) into the cross-view encoder, allowing it to adaptively activate specialized experts according to the content, scale and source of each grid. We also employ an anchor-free detection head for coordinate regression, directly predicting object locations via heat-map supervision in the reference images. This approach avoids scale bias and matching complexity introduced by predefined anchor boxes. On the drone-to-satellite task, SMGeo achieves leading performance in accuracy at IoU=0.25 and mIoU metrics (e.g., 87.51%, 62.50%, and 61.45% in the test set, respectively), significantly outperforming representative methods such as DetGeo (61.97%, 57.66%, and 54.05%, respectively). Ablation studies demonstrate complementary gains from shared encoding, query-guided fusion, and grid-level sparse mixture-of-experts.

### [45] [BCE3S: Binary Cross-Entropy Based Tripartite Synergistic Learning for Long-tailed Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14097)
*Weijia Fan,Qiufu Li,Jiajun Wen,Xiaoyang Peng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BCE3S: a BCE-based tripartite learning framework for long-tailed recognition that improves intra-class compactness, inter-class separability, and balance among classifier vectors, achieving state-of-the-art results on major LT datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long-tailed recognition (LTR) suffers from imbalanced data, where cross-entropy (CE) loss struggles to produce compact intra-class features and well-separated inter-class features, and the Softmax denominator amplifies classifier imbalance. There is a need to decouple feature and classifier metrics and to balance classifier vector separability.

Method: Propose BCE3S with three components: (1) BCE-based joint learning that optimizes both classifier and sample features by decoupling feature and classifier metrics using multiple Sigmoid functions; (2) BCE-based contrastive learning to enhance intra-class compactness; (3) BCE-based uniform learning to balance separability among classifier vectors and interact with joint learning.

Result: Empirical evaluations show improved feature compactness and separability, balanced classifier separability, and SOTA performance on CIFAR10-LT, CIFAR100-LT, ImageNet-LT, and iNaturalist2018.

Conclusion: BCE3S effectively addresses imbalances in long-tailed recognition by combining BCE-based joint, contrastive, and uniform learning, yielding stronger feature properties and balanced classifier vectors, leading to state-of-the-art results.

Abstract: For long-tailed recognition (LTR) tasks, high intra-class compactness and inter-class separability in both head and tail classes, as well as balanced separability among all the classifier vectors, are preferred. The existing LTR methods based on cross-entropy (CE) loss not only struggle to learn features with desirable properties but also couple imbalanced classifier vectors in the denominator of its Softmax, amplifying the imbalance effects in LTR. In this paper, for the LTR, we propose a binary cross-entropy (BCE)-based tripartite synergistic learning, termed BCE3S, which consists of three components: (1) BCE-based joint learning optimizes both the classifier and sample features, which achieves better compactness and separability among features than the CE-based joint learning, by decoupling the metrics between feature and the imbalanced classifier vectors in multiple Sigmoid; (2) BCE-based contrastive learning further improves the intra-class compactness of features; (3) BCE-based uniform learning balances the separability among classifier vectors and interactively enhances the feature properties by combining with the joint learning. The extensive experiments show that the LTR model trained by BCE3S not only achieves higher compactness and separability among sample features, but also balances the classifier's separability, achieving SOTA performance on various long-tailed datasets such as CIFAR10-LT, CIFAR100-LT, ImageNet-LT, and iNaturalist2018.

*Jingren Liu,Shuning Xu,Qirui Yang,Yun Wang,Xiangyu Chen,Zhong Ji*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A unified AIO-IR framework named FAPE-IR integrates semantic planning with frequency-aware restoration, using a frozen Multimodal LLM as planner and a LoRA-MoE diffusion executor, achieving state-of-the-art results across seven tasks and strong zero-shot generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AIO-IR methods rely on task-specific designs or latent routing, which hinders adaptability to real-world degradations. There is a need for a unified, interpretable approach that can handle diverse degradations and provide controllable, frequency-aware restoration.

Method: FAPE-IR employs a frozen Multimodal LLM as a planner to assess degraded images and generate concise, frequency-aware restoration plans. A LoRA-based Mixture-of-Experts within a diffusion-based executor dynamically selects high- or low-frequency experts guided by input frequency features. Adversarial training and a frequency regularization loss are added to improve restoration quality and reduce artifacts.

Result: The framework achieves state-of-the-art performance across seven restoration tasks and shows strong zero-shot generalization under mixed degradations.

Conclusion: Coupling semantic planning with frequency-based restoration yields a unified, interpretable solution for all-in-one image restoration with improved robustness and generalization.

Abstract: All-in-One Image Restoration (AIO-IR) aims to develop a unified model that can handle multiple degradations under complex conditions. However, existing methods often rely on task-specific designs or latent routing strategies, making it hard to adapt to real-world scenarios with various degradations. We propose FAPE-IR, a Frequency-Aware Planning and Execution framework for image restoration. It uses a frozen Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) as a planner to analyze degraded images and generate concise, frequency-aware restoration plans. These plans guide a LoRA-based Mixture-of-Experts (LoRA-MoE) module within a diffusion-based executor, which dynamically selects high- or low-frequency experts, complemented by frequency features of the input image. To further improve restoration quality and reduce artifacts, we introduce adversarial training and a frequency regularization loss. By coupling semantic planning with frequency-based restoration, FAPE-IR offers a unified and interpretable solution for all-in-one image restoration. Extensive experiments show that FAPE-IR achieves state-of-the-art performance across seven restoration tasks and exhibits strong zero-shot generalization under mixed degradations.

*Yiqing Shen,Chenjia Li,Mathias Unberath*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RIVER is a reasoning-based implicit video editor that uses digital twin representations and an LLM to perform multi-hop reasoning to output structured editing instructions guiding a diffusion-based editor, plus RVEBenchmark for evaluating such reasoning. It achieves state-of-the-art on VegGIE and FiVE.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Implicit, semantic or relational edits are hard to capture with explicit spatial/temporal targets; existing methods require precise target descriptions. There is a need for multi-hop reasoning to infer editing targets from implicit queries before editing.

Method: Construct digital-twin style video representations that preserve spatial relations, temporal trajectories, and semantic attributes. A large language model processes this representation with the implicit query to perform multi-hop reasoning and outputs structured, edit-instruction tokens. A diffusion-based editor then applies pixel-level changes according to these tokens. Training employs reinforcement learning with rewards for reasoning accuracy and generation quality.

Result: RIVER achieves best performance on the proposed RVEBenchmark and attains state-of-the-art results on VegGIE and FiVE, surpassing six baselines.

Conclusion: Presents first solving approach for reasoning-based implicit video editing; introduces RVEBenchmark and demonstrates that separating reasoning from generation via digital twins + LLMs can enable effective implicit-editing with competitive performance across multiple benchmarks.

Abstract: Text-driven video editing enables users to modify video content only using text queries. While existing methods can modify video content if explicit descriptions of editing targets with precise spatial locations and temporal boundaries are provided, these requirements become impractical when users attempt to conceptualize edits through implicit queries referencing semantic properties or object relationships. We introduce reasoning video editing, a task where video editing models must interpret implicit queries through multi-hop reasoning to infer editing targets before executing modifications, and a first model attempting to solve this complex task, RIVER (Reasoning-based Implicit Video Editor). RIVER decouples reasoning from generation through digital twin representations of video content that preserve spatial relationships, temporal trajectories, and semantic attributes. A large language model then processes this representation jointly with the implicit query, performing multi-hop reasoning to determine modifications, then outputs structured instructions that guide a diffusion-based editor to execute pixel-level changes. RIVER training uses reinforcement learning with rewards that evaluate reasoning accuracy and generation quality. Finally, we introduce RVEBenchmark, a benchmark of 100 videos with 519 implicit queries spanning three levels and categories of reasoning complexity specifically for reasoning video editing. RIVER demonstrates best performance on the proposed RVEBenchmark and also achieves state-of-the-art performance on two additional video editing benchmarks (VegGIE and FiVE), where it surpasses six baseline methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need for efficient, real-time monocular depth estimation suitable for autonomous driving/robot navigation; existing models are too heavy or slow, hindering real-world deployment.

Method: A lightweight encoder (Lite-Encoder) combined with a multi-scale sparse fusion decoder to reduce redundancy while preserving performance; real-time self-supervised training on monocular sequences; optimized for low resource devices.

Result: SoTA performance at high/low resolutions with only 3M parameters on KITTI; at low res Abs Rel and Sq Rel improved by 5.6% and 9.8%; at high res Sq Rel and RMSE improved by 6.1% and 1.9%; real-time inference at 49 FPS on Nvidia Jetson Orin; code released.

Conclusion: RTS-Mono offers a practical, efficient solution enabling real-world deployment of self-supervised monocular depth estimation on edge devices, balancing accuracy, speed, and resource usage.

Abstract: Depth information is crucial for autonomous driving and intelligent robot navigation. The simplicity and flexibility of self-supervised monocular depth estimation are conducive to its role in these fields. However, most existing monocular depth estimation models consume many computing resources. Although some methods have reduced the model's size and improved computing efficiency, the performance deteriorates, seriously hindering the real-world deployment of self-supervised monocular depth estimation models in the real world. To address this problem, we proposed a real-time self-supervised monocular depth estimation method and implemented it in the real world. It is called RTS-Mono, which is a lightweight and efficient encoder-decoder architecture. The encoder is based on Lite-Encoder, and the decoder is designed with a multi-scale sparse fusion framework to minimize redundancy, ensure performance, and improve inference speed. RTS-Mono achieved state-of-the-art (SoTA) performance in high and low resolutions with extremely low parameter counts (3 M) in experiments based on the KITTI dataset. Compared with lightweight methods, RTS-Mono improved Abs Rel and Sq Rel by 5.6% and 9.8% at low resolution and improved Sq Rel and RMSE by 6.1% and 1.9% at high resolution. In real-world deployment experiments, RTS-Mono has extremely high accuracy and can perform real-time inference on Nvidia Jetson Orin at a speed of 49 FPS.

*Zhenyu Li,Tianyi Shang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduces A^2GC-VPR, an asymmetric aggregation method with geometry-aware constraints for VPR, addressing distribution mismatch between features and clusters and improving robustness; achieves state-of-the-art results on MSLS, NordLand, and Pittsburgh.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The standard Sinkhorn-based aggregation treats source and target marginals symmetrically, which can be suboptimal when the distributions of image features and cluster centers differ significantly; there is a need for asymmetry and geometric awareness in aggregation for VPR.

Method: Proposes row-column normalization averaging with separate marginal calibration to enable asymmetric matching. Incorporates geometric constraints via learnable coordinate embeddings, computing compatibility scores that fuse with feature similarities to promote spatially proximate features to the same cluster and improve spatial awareness.

Result: Empirical results on MSLS, NordLand, and Pittsburgh datasets show superior performance, validating improved matching accuracy and robustness of the proposed method.

Conclusion: Asymmetric, geometry-aware aggregation improves VPR performance by better handling distributional discrepancies and enhancing spatial coherence; A^2GC-VPR demonstrates strong potential for robust visual place recognition across challenging datasets.

Abstract: Visual Place Recognition (VPR) aims to match query images against a database using visual cues. State-of-the-art methods aggregate features from deep backbones to form global descriptors. Optimal transport-based aggregation methods reformulate feature-to-cluster assignment as a transport problem, but the standard Sinkhorn algorithm symmetrically treats source and target marginals, limiting effectiveness when image features and cluster centers exhibit substantially different distributions. We propose an asymmetric aggregation VPR method with geometric constraints for locally aggregated descriptors, called $A^2$GC-VPR. Our method employs row-column normalization averaging with separate marginal calibration, enabling asymmetric matching that adapts to distributional discrepancies in visual place recognition. Geometric constraints are incorporated through learnable coordinate embeddings, computing compatibility scores fused with feature similarities, thereby promoting spatially proximal features to the same cluster and enhancing spatial awareness. Experimental results on MSLS, NordLand, and Pittsburgh datasets demonstrate superior performance, validating the effectiveness of our approach in improving matching accuracy and robustness.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CViT introduces Cascaded-Chunk FFN (CCFFN) to create a lightweight, compute-efficient vision transformer. It maintains accuracy while reducing FLOPs and energy versus a strong baseline, and achieves top compute efficiency via the Accuracy-Per-FLOP (APF) metric. CViT-L surpasses EfficientViT-M2 in accuracy with similar APF.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision Transformers achieve strong accuracy but are computationally and energy intensive, hindering deployment on mobile/edge devices. There is a need for more efficient ViTs with lower FLOPs and energy consumption without sacrificing accuracy.

Method: Propose Cascaded-ViT (CViT) with Cascaded-Chunk Feed Forward Network (CCFFN), which splits input features to reduce parameters and FLOPs. Train/evaluate CViT variants (e.g., CViT-XL, CViT-L) on ImageNet-1K and compare against EfficientViT baselines. Introduce Accuracy-Per-FLOP (APF) as a compute-efficiency metric.

Result: CViT-XL achieves 75.5% Top-1 on ImageNet-1K with 15% fewer FLOPs and 3.3% lower energy than EfficientViT-M5. Across sizes, CViT consistently has the lowest energy consumption. Under APF, CViT models rank highly in compute efficiency. CViT-L is 2.2% more accurate than EfficientViT-M2 with comparable APF.

Conclusion: CCFFN enables a lightweight ViT that delivers competitive or superior accuracy with reduced computation and energy, making CViT suitable for battery-limited devices. The APF metric confirms that CViT maintains high accuracy per FLOP across model scales.

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across a range of computer vision tasks; however, their high computational, memory, and energy demands hinder deployment on resource-constrained platforms. In this paper, we propose \emph{Cascaded-ViT (CViT)}, a lightweight and compute-efficient vision transformer architecture featuring a novel feedforward network design called \emph{Cascaded-Chunk Feed Forward Network (CCFFN)}. By splitting input features, CCFFN improves parameter and FLOP efficiency without sacrificing accuracy. Experiments on ImageNet-1K show that our \emph{CViT-XL} model achieves 75.5\% Top-1 accuracy while reducing FLOPs by 15\% and energy consumption by 3.3\% compared to EfficientViT-M5. Across various model sizes, the CViT family consistently exhibits the lowest energy consumption, making it suitable for deployment on battery-constrained devices such as mobile phones and drones. Furthermore, when evaluated using a new metric called \emph{Accuracy-Per-FLOP (APF)}, which quantifies compute efficiency relative to accuracy, CViT models consistently achieve top-ranking efficiency. Particularly, CViT-L is 2.2\% more accurate than EfficientViT-M2 while having comparable APF scores.

### [51] [Coffee: Controllable Diffusion Fine-tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14113)
*Ziyao Zeng,Jingcheng Ni,Ruyi Liu,Alex Wong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Coffee is a language-based, training-free regularization for fine-tuning text-to-image diffusion models that prevents learning undesired concepts and entanglement with user prompts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Controllable model personalization can inadvertently incorporate undesired concepts from user data, leading to biased or unsafe outputs. Effective methods should block such concepts without heavy retraining or entanglement with prompts, enabling bias mitigation, safety, and disentangled fine-tuning.

Method: Define undesired concepts through natural language and regularize the adaptation by keeping the user-prompt embeddings from aligning with these undesired concept embeddings. The approach requires no additional training components and allows updating undesired concepts by editing textual descriptions, integrating with standard fine-tuning.

Result: Empirical evaluation shows Coffee prevents learning of specified undesired concepts during fine-tuning and outperforms existing methods.

Conclusion: Coffee provides a flexible, training-free mechanism for safe and controllable personalization of diffusion models, supporting bias mitigation and generalizable fine-tuning; code will be released after acceptance.

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models can generate diverse content with flexible prompts, which makes them well-suited for customization through fine-tuning with a small amount of user-provided data. However, controllable fine-tuning that prevents models from learning undesired concepts present in the fine-tuning data, and from entangling those concepts with user prompts, remains an open challenge. It is crucial for downstream tasks like bias mitigation, preventing malicious adaptation, attribute disentanglement, and generalizable fine-tuning of diffusion policy. We propose Coffee that allows using language to specify undesired concepts to regularize the adaptation process. The crux of our method lies in keeping the embeddings of the user prompt from aligning with undesired concepts. Crucially, Coffee requires no additional training and enables flexible modification of undesired concepts by modifying textual descriptions. We evaluate Coffee by fine-tuning on images associated with user prompts paired with undesired concepts. Experimental results demonstrate that Coffee can prevent text-to-image models from learning specified undesired concepts during fine-tuning and outperforms existing methods. Code will be released upon acceptance.

### [52] [Multi-view Phase-aware Pedestrian-Vehicle Incident Reasoning Framework with Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14120)
*Hao Zhen,Yunxiang Yang,Jidong J. Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A multi-view, phase-aware framework (MP-PVIR) for analyzing pedestrian-vehicle incidents that segments behavior into cognitive phases, performs phase-specific multi-view reasoning, and generates diagnostic reports, achieving measurable gains with TG-VLM and PhaVR-VLM on a traffic-safety dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video systems and vision-language models lack explicit temporal structuring and multi-view integration, hindering understanding of dynamic pedestrian behavior and hindering actionable prevention insights.

Method: Four-stage pipeline: (1) event-triggered multi-view video acquisition; (2) pedestrian behavior phase segmentation; (3) phase-specific multi-view reasoning; (4) hierarchical synthesis and diagnostic reasoning. Utilizes TG-VLM for behavioral phase segmentation (mIoU 0.4881) and PhaVR-VLM for phase-aware multi-view analysis (captioning 33.063; QA accuracy up to 64.70%). A large language model generates comprehensive reports.

Result: On the Woven Traffic Safety dataset, MP-PVIR translates multi-view video data into actionable insights, delivering scene understanding, behavior interpretation, causal reasoning, and prevention recommendations; key metrics include TG-VLM mIoU 0.4881, PhaVR-VLM captioning 33.063, QA accuracy 64.70%.

Conclusion: MP-PVIR demonstrates that structuring multi-view video data around pedestrian behavioral phases and integrating specialized VLMs with an LLM can advance AI-driven traffic safety analytics for vehicle-infrastructure cooperative systems.

Abstract: Pedestrian-vehicle incidents remain a critical urban safety challenge, with pedestrians accounting for over 20% of global traffic fatalities. Although existing video-based systems can detect when incidents occur, they provide little insight into how these events unfold across the distinct cognitive phases of pedestrian behavior. Recent vision-language models (VLMs) have shown strong potential for video understanding, but they remain limited in that they typically process videos in isolation, without explicit temporal structuring or multi-view integration. This paper introduces Multi-view Phase-aware Pedestrian-Vehicle Incident Reasoning (MP-PVIR), a unified framework that systematically processes multi-view video streams into structured diagnostic reports through four stages: (1) event-triggered multi-view video acquisition, (2) pedestrian behavior phase segmentation, (3) phase-specific multi-view reasoning, and (4) hierarchical synthesis and diagnostic reasoning. The framework operationalizes behavioral theory by automatically segmenting incidents into cognitive phases, performing synchronized multi-view analysis within each phase, and synthesizing results into causal chains with targeted prevention strategies. Particularly, two specialized VLMs underpin the MP-PVIR pipeline: TG-VLM for behavioral phase segmentation (mIoU = 0.4881) and PhaVR-VLM for phase-aware multi-view analysis, achieving a captioning score of 33.063 and up to 64.70% accuracy on question answering. Finally, a designated large language model is used to generate comprehensive reports detailing scene understanding, behavior interpretation, causal reasoning, and prevention recommendations. Evaluation on the Woven Traffic Safety dataset shows that MP-PVIR effectively translates multi-view video data into actionable insights, advancing AI-driven traffic safety analytics for vehicle-infrastructure cooperative systems.

### [53] [Attention Via Convolutional Nearest Neighbors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14137)
*Mingi Kang,Jeová Farias Sales Rocha Neto*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Convolution and self-attention are two ends of a spectrum that can be unified under a single k-nearest-neighbor (ConvNN) aggregation. ConvNN serves as a drop-in replacement for conv and attention, enabling interpolation between local and global receptive fields and yielding regularization benefits, demonstrated on CIFAR-10/100 with VGG and ViT.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CNNs and Transformers are often treated as fundamentally distinct in vision. A unifying, interpretable framework that blends their strengths could improve architecture design, provide clearer insights into receptive fields, and offer regularization benefits.

Method: Introduce ConvNN, a unified k-NN aggregation layer that selects neighbors by either spatial proximity (convolution-like) or feature similarity (attention-like), forming a continuous spectrum between the two. Treat ConvNN as a drop-in replacement for convolution and attention. Evaluate on CIFAR-10/100 using two setups: (1) a VGG variant with hybrid branching combining spatial-proximity and feature-similarity selection; (2) a ViT variant where ConvNN replaces standard attention. Conduct extensive ablations over k and architectural variants to study spectrum interpolation.

Result: ConvNN-based models outperform or match standard conv/attention across the tasks. The VGG hybrid with mixed neighbor selection improves CIFAR-10/100 accuracy; ConvNN in ViT surpasses standard attention and other variants. Ablations show that intermediate k values, interpolating between local and global receptive fields, provide regularization benefits.

Conclusion: Convolution and attention are not fundamentally distinct but lie on a continuum of neighbor-aggregation. ConvNN provides a principled, interpretable framework with a flexible design space that can yield improved performance and regularization, guiding the development of future vision architectures.

Abstract: The shift from Convolutional Neural Networks to Transformers has reshaped computer vision, yet these two architectural families are typically viewed as fundamentally distinct. We argue that convolution and self-attention, despite their apparent differences, can be unified within a single k-nearest neighbor aggregation framework. The critical insight is that both operations are special cases of neighbor selection and aggregation; convolution selects neighbors by spatial proximity, while attention selects by feature similarity, revealing they exist on a continuous spectrum. We introduce Convolutional Nearest Neighbors (ConvNN), a unified framework that formalizes this connection. Crucially, ConvNN serves as a drop-in replacement for convolutional and attention layers, enabling systematic exploration of the intermediate spectrum between these two extremes. We validate the framework's coherence on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 classification tasks across two complementary architectures: (1) Hybrid branching in VGG improves accuracy on both CIFAR datasets by combining spatial-proximity and feature-similarity selection; and (2) ConvNN in ViT outperforms standard attention and other attention variants on both datasets. Extensive ablations on $k$ values and architectural variants reveal that interpolating along this spectrum provides regularization benefits by balancing local and global receptive fields. Our work provides a unifying framework that dissolves the apparent distinction between convolution and attention, with implications for designing more principled and interpretable vision architectures.

*An Yu,Weiheng Lu,Jian Li,Zhenfei Zhang,Yunhang Shen,Felix X. -F. Ye,Ming-Ching Chang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Shot-aware multimodal audio-enhanced retrieval (SMART) improves video moment retrieval by fusing audio-visual features with shot-level token compression in an MLLM-based framework, achieving notable gains on Charades-STA.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods rely on coarse temporal understanding and single visual modality; leveraging audio cues and shot-level structure can improve fine-grained localization in complex videos.

Method: Proposes SMART, an MLLM-based framework that (1) fuses audio and visual features, (2) applies Shot-aware Token Compression to retain high-information tokens within each shot, reducing redundancy and preserving temporal detail, and (3) refines prompts to better utilize audio-visual cues.

Result: Empirical results on Charades-STA and QVHighlights show improvements over state-of-the-art, with a 1.61% absolute gain in R1@0.5 and 2.59% in R1@0.7 on Charades-STA.

Conclusion: Integrating audio cues and shot-level structure via SMART enhances video moment retrieval and demonstrates the benefit of shot-aware token handling and prompt design for multimodal video understanding.

Abstract: Video Moment Retrieval is a task in video understanding that aims to localize a specific temporal segment in an untrimmed video based on a natural language query. Despite recent progress in moment retrieval from videos using both traditional techniques and Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLM), most existing methods still rely on coarse temporal understanding and a single visual modality, limiting performance on complex videos. To address this, we introduce \textit{S}hot-aware \textit{M}ultimodal \textit{A}udio-enhanced \textit{R}etrieval of \textit{T}emporal \textit{S}egments (SMART), an MLLM-based framework that integrates audio cues and leverages shot-level temporal structure. SMART enriches multimodal representations by combining audio and visual features while applying \textbf{Shot-aware Token Compression}, which selectively retains high-information tokens within each shot to reduce redundancy and preserve fine-grained temporal details. We also refine prompt design to better utilize audio-visual cues. Evaluations on Charades-STA and QVHighlights show that SMART achieves significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods, including a 1.61\% increase in R1@0.5 and 2.59\% gain in R1@0.7 on Charades-STA.

### [55] [iGaussian: Real-Time Camera Pose Estimation via Feed-Forward 3D Gaussian Splatting Inversion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14149)
*Hao Wang,Linqing Zhao,Xiuwei Xu,Jiwen Lu,Haibin Yan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: iGaussian is a real-time camera pose estimator that directly inverts 3D Gaussian scene priors via a two-stage feed-forward network, achieving ~2.87 FPS and ~0.2° median rotation error without differentiable rendering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D Gaussian–based SLAM/visual navigation often relies on an iterative render–compare–refine loop, which incurs high computational cost and limits real-time performance on robots. A fast, non-iterative pose estimator would unlock real-time robotics applications.

Method: A two-stage pipeline: (1) coarse 6DoF pose regression using a Gaussian Scene Prior-based Pose Regression Network with spatial uniform sampling and guided attention; (2) refinement via feature matching and multi-model fusion. A cross-correlation module links image embeddings with 3D Gaussian attributes without rendering, and a Weighted Multiview Predictor fuses features from strategically sampled viewpoints.

Result: Experiments on NeRF Synthetic, Mip-NeRF 360, and T&T+DB show strong improvements over prior methods, achieving 0.2° median rotation error and 2.87 FPS tracking on mobile robots, a ~10× speedup over optimization-based approaches.

Conclusion: iGaussian demonstrates real-time, pose-estimation-from-3D-Gaussians without differentiable rendering, enabling efficient robotic SLAM/navigation with publicly available code.

Abstract: Recent trends in SLAM and visual navigation have embraced 3D Gaussians as the preferred scene representation, highlighting the importance of estimating camera poses from a single image using a pre-built Gaussian model. However, existing approaches typically rely on an iterative \textit{render-compare-refine} loop, where candidate views are first rendered using NeRF or Gaussian Splatting, then compared against the target image, and finally, discrepancies are used to update the pose. This multi-round process incurs significant computational overhead, hindering real-time performance in robotics. In this paper, we propose iGaussian, a two-stage feed-forward framework that achieves real-time camera pose estimation through direct 3D Gaussian inversion. Our method first regresses a coarse 6DoF pose using a Gaussian Scene Prior-based Pose Regression Network with spatial uniform sampling and guided attention mechanisms, then refines it through feature matching and multi-model fusion. The key contribution lies in our cross-correlation module that aligns image embeddings with 3D Gaussian attributes without differentiable rendering, coupled with a Weighted Multiview Predictor that fuses features from Multiple strategically sampled viewpoints. Experimental results on the NeRF Synthetic, Mip-NeRF 360, and T\&T+DB datasets demonstrate a significant performance improvement over previous methods, reducing median rotation errors to 0.2° while achieving 2.87 FPS tracking on mobile robots, which is an impressive 10 times speedup compared to optimization-based approaches.

*Laura Dodds,Maisy Lam,Waleed Akbar,Yibo Cheng,Fadel Adib*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Wave-Former is a three-stage mmWave-based 3D shape reconstruction method that infers full geometry of occluded objects, trained on synthetic data, achieving 72% recall and 85% precision, outperforming baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reconstructing partially occluded or fully occluded everyday objects is crucial for robotics, AR, and logistics. mmWave signals can penetrate occluders and reflect off hidden objects, but prior mmWave methods suffer from limited coverage, high noise, and lack of generalization. A physics-aware, completion-driven approach that can learn from synthetic data and generalize to real scenes can unlock practical applications.

Method: A three-stage pipeline: (1) propose candidate geometric surfaces from mmWave data; (2) apply a transformer-based shape completion model designed for mmWave signals; (3) perform entropy-guided surface selection. The model is trained on entirely synthetic point-clouds and bridges mmWave signals to contemporary vision-based completion techniques by incorporating physical properties of mmWave propagation.

Result: In head-to-head comparisons with state-of-the-art baselines, Wave-Former increases recall from 54% to 72% while maintaining a high precision of 85%. It enables high-accuracy 3D reconstruction for completely occluded, diverse everyday objects and generalizes well from synthetic to real-world data.

Conclusion: Wave-Former demonstrates that integrating physics-aware mmWave shape completion with a synthetic-training regime can deliver robust 3D reconstruction of occluded objects, enabling new applications in robotics, augmented reality, and logistics, and setting a path for bridging radio signals with vision-based geometry."

Abstract: We present Wave-Former, a novel method capable of high-accuracy 3D shape reconstruction for completely occluded, diverse, everyday objects. This capability can open new applications spanning robotics, augmented reality, and logistics. Our approach leverages millimeter-wave (mmWave) wireless signals, which can penetrate common occlusions and reflect off hidden objects. In contrast to past mmWave reconstruction methods, which suffer from limited coverage and high noise, Wave-Former introduces a physics-aware shape completion model capable of inferring full 3D geometry. At the heart of Wave-Former's design is a novel three-stage pipeline which bridges raw wireless signals with recent advancements in vision-based shape completion by incorporating physical properties of mmWave signals. The pipeline proposes candidate geometric surfaces, employs a transformer-based shape completion model designed specifically for mmWave signals, and finally performs entropy-guided surface selection. This enables Wave-Former to be trained using entirely synthetic point-clouds, while demonstrating impressive generalization to real-world data.In head-to-head comparisons with state-of-the-art baselines, Wave-Former raises recall from 54% to 72% while maintaining a high precision of 85%.

### [57] [Learning Representation and Synergy Invariances: A Povable Framework for Generalized Multimodal Face Anti-Spoofing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14157)
*Xun Lin,Shuai Wang,Yi Yu,Zitong Yu,Jiale Zhou,Yizhong Liu,Xiaochun Cao,Alex Kot,Yefeng Zheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RiSe addresses two cross-domain risks in multimodal Face Anti-Spoofing: (1) representation risk from class asymmetry that enlarges generalization error, worsened in multimodal settings, and (2) synergy risk from domain-specific inter-modal correlations that overfit to spurious cross-modal cues. It proposes Asymmetric Invariant Risk Minimization (AsyIRM) to fit an invariant spherical decision boundary in radial space while preserving angular domain cues, and Multimodal Synergy Disentanglement (MMSD) as a self-supervised task to enhance generalizable modal features via cross-sample mixing and disentanglement. Theoretical analysis and experiments show RiSe achieves state-of-the-art cross-domain performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In multimodal FAS, combining multiple visual modalities often leads to worse cross-domain generalization than unimodal systems due to two overlooked risks. First, class asymmetry (diverse spoofs vs. compact reals) inflates the upper bound of generalization error, especially in multimodal settings. Second, models may overfit to domain-specific inter-modal correlations (synergy), causing poor generalization to unseen attacks in new domains. A provable framework is needed to enforce representation and synergy invariance across domains.

Method: AsyIRM: learns an invariant spherical decision boundary in radial space to fit the asymmetric distributions while keeping domain cues in angular space. MMSD: a self-supervised task that improves intrinsic, generalizable modal features through cross-sample mixing and disentanglement of modalities, reducing reliance on spurious cross-modal correlations. The combination constitutes RiSe, a framework for Representation and Synergy Invariance learning across modalities.

Result: Theoretical analysis supports the proposed invariance properties and bounds. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that RiSe achieves state-of-the-art cross-domain performance on multimodal FAS tasks, outperforming baselines by improving generalization to unseen domains.

Conclusion: RiSe provides a provable framework to address both representation and synergy risks in cross-domain multimodal FAS. By enforcing invariant representations and disentangling inter-modal synergy, RiSe achieves superior cross-domain generalization.

Abstract: Multimodal Face Anti-Spoofing (FAS) methods, which integrate multiple visual modalities, often suffer even more severe performance degradation than unimodal FAS when deployed in unseen domains. This is mainly due to two overlooked risks that affect cross-domain multimodal generalization. The first is the modal representation invariant risk, i.e., whether representations remain generalizable under domain shift. We theoretically show that the inherent class asymmetry in FAS (diverse spoofs vs. compact reals) enlarges the upper bound of generalization error, and this effect is further amplified in multimodal settings. The second is the modal synergy invariant risk, where models overfit to domain-specific inter-modal correlations. Such spurious synergy cannot generalize to unseen attacks in target domains, leading to performance drops. To solve these issues, we propose a provable framework, namely Multimodal Representation and Synergy Invariance Learning (RiSe). For representation risk, RiSe introduces Asymmetric Invariant Risk Minimization (AsyIRM), which learns an invariant spherical decision boundary in radial space to fit asymmetric distributions, while preserving domain cues in angular space. For synergy risk, RiSe employs Multimodal Synergy Disentanglement (MMSD), a self-supervised task enhancing intrinsic, generalizable modal features via cross-sample mixing and disentanglement. Theoretical analysis and experiments verify RiSe, which achieves state-of-the-art cross-domain performance.

*Huiyi Chen,Jiawei Peng,Dehai Min,Changchang Sun,Kaijie Chen,Yan Yan,Xu Yang,Lu Cheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MVI-Bench is the first comprehensive benchmark to assess how misleading visual inputs affect the robustness of LVLMs, using a three-level taxonomy, 1,248 VQA instances, and a new MVI-Sensitivity metric across 18 models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing robustness benchmarks focus on textual inputs; misleading visuals pose a critical, under-explored threat to visual understanding in LVLMs; need systematic evaluation and actionable guidance.

Method: Defines a three-tier taxonomy of misleading visuals (Visual Concept, Visual Attribute, Visual Relationship), with six categories; curates 1,248 expert VQA instances; introduces MVI-Sensitivity for granular robustness; evaluates 18 LVLMs and analyzes vulnerabilities to provide actionable insights.

Result: Empirically reveals pronounced vulnerabilities of 18 LVLMs to misleading visuals; provides robust insights and a publicly accessible benchmark and code at GitHub.

Conclusion: MVI-Bench fills a critical gap for robust LVLM development, enabling targeted improvements and guiding future research on resistance to misleading visual inputs.

Abstract: Evaluating the robustness of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) is essential for their continued development and responsible deployment in real-world applications. However, existing robustness benchmarks typically focus on hallucination or misleading textual inputs, while largely overlooking the equally critical challenge posed by misleading visual inputs in assessing visual understanding. To fill this important gap, we introduce MVI-Bench, the first comprehensive benchmark specially designed for evaluating how Misleading Visual Inputs undermine the robustness of LVLMs. Grounded in fundamental visual primitives, the design of MVI-Bench centers on three hierarchical levels of misleading visual inputs: Visual Concept, Visual Attribute, and Visual Relationship. Using this taxonomy, we curate six representative categories and compile 1,248 expertly annotated VQA instances. To facilitate fine-grained robustness evaluation, we further introduce MVI-Sensitivity, a novel metric that characterizes LVLM robustness at a granular level. Empirical results across 18 state-of-the-art LVLMs uncover pronounced vulnerabilities to misleading visual inputs, and our in-depth analyses on MVI-Bench provide actionable insights that can guide the development of more reliable and robust LVLMs. The benchmark and codebase can be accessed at https://github.com/chenyil6/MVI-Bench.

*Xinliang Zhang,Lei Zhu,Hangzhou He,Shuang Zeng,Ourui Fu,Jiakui Hu,Zhengjian Yao,Yanye Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Object-level token merging for adaptive token compression in Multimodal LLMs reduces image tokens to about 10% while retaining ~96% of vanilla model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Patch-level patch-tokenization causes quadratic token growth, heavy compute/memory, and misalignment with human vision, leading to hallucination and redundancy; an alignment with human vision could improve efficiency and accuracy.

Method: Introduce an object-level token merging strategy for adaptive token compression that aggregates patch tokens into object-level representations, reducing tokens dynamically while preserving semantics and aligning with human visual processing.

Result: Experiments across multiple benchmarks show substantially reduced token usage (around 10%) with nearly 96% of the vanilla model's performance, and favorable compression-performance trade-offs compared to relevant prior works.

Conclusion: The proposed object-level token merging method provides efficient, vision-aligned tokenization for MLLMs, achieving strong performance with far fewer tokens and offering practical deployment potential; code will be released.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated substantial value in unified text-image understanding and reasoning, primarily by converting images into sequences of patch-level tokens that align with their architectural paradigm. However, patch-level tokenization leads to a quadratic growth in image tokens, burdening MLLMs' understanding and reasoning with enormous computation and memory. Additionally, the traditional patch-wise scanning tokenization workflow misaligns with the human vision cognition system, further leading to hallucination and computational redundancy. To address this issue, we propose an object-level token merging strategy for Adaptive Token compression, revealing the consistency with human vision system. The experiments are conducted on multiple comprehensive benchmarks, which show that our approach averagely, utilizes only 10% tokens while achieving almost 96% of the vanilla model's performance. More extensive experimental results in comparison with relevant works demonstrate the superiority of our method in balancing compression ratio and performance. Our code will be available.

*Yanshan Li,Ke Ma,Miaomiao Wei,Linhui Dai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DoGCLR reframes contrastive learning for skeleton action recognition as a dynamic Dominance Game to jointly optimize positive and negative samples, using spatio-temporal region weighting and entropy-based memory to improve discrimination and robustness; achieves state-of-the-art or competitive results on NTU RGB+D and PKU-MMD datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current self-supervised skeleton action recognition methods treat all skeleton regions uniformly and use FIFO memory banks, leading to motion information loss and suboptimal negative sampling. There is a need for region-aware augmentations and smarter negative selection.

Method: Proposes DoGCLR: models positive/negative sample construction as a Dominance Game; introduces a spatio-temporal dual weight localization mechanism to identify key motion regions and guide region-wise augmentations; employs an entropy-driven dominance strategy to manage the memory bank by retaining high-entropy (hard) negatives and replacing low-entropy (weak) ones; evaluates on NTU RGB+D (60/120) and PKU-MMD datasets.

Result: On NTU RGB+D 60 X-Sub/X-View: 81.1%/89.4% accuracy; NTU RGB+D 120 X-Sub/X-Set: 71.2%/75.5% accuracy; improvements over SOTA by 0.1%, 2.7%, 1.1%, and 2.3% respectively; on PKU-MMD Part I/Part II, performances comparable to SOTA with 1.9% higher accuracy on Part II; demonstrates robustness on challenging scenarios.

Conclusion: DoGCLR offers a robust, region-aware, self-supervised framework for skeleton-based action recognition that improves negative sampling and semantic preservation, achieving competitive or superior performance across challenging datasets.

Abstract: Existing self-supervised contrastive learning methods for skeleton-based action recognition often process all skeleton regions uniformly, and adopt a first-in-first-out (FIFO) queue to store negative samples, which leads to motion information loss and non-optimal negative sample selection. To address these challenges, this paper proposes Dominance-Game Contrastive Learning network for skeleton-based action Recognition (DoGCLR), a self-supervised framework based on game theory. DoGCLR models the construction of positive and negative samples as a dynamic Dominance Game, where both sample types interact to reach an equilibrium that balances semantic preservation and discriminative strength. Specifically, a spatio-temporal dual weight localization mechanism identifies key motion regions and guides region-wise augmentations to enhance motion diversity while maintaining semantics. In parallel, an entropy-driven dominance strategy manages the memory bank by retaining high entropy (hard) negatives and replacing low-entropy (weak) ones, ensuring consistent exposure to informative contrastive signals. Extensive experiments are conducted on NTU RGB+D and PKU-MMD datasets. On NTU RGB+D 60 X-Sub/X-View, DoGCLR achieves 81.1%/89.4% accuracy, and on NTU RGB+D 120 X-Sub/X-Set, DoGCLR achieves 71.2%/75.5% accuracy, surpassing state-of-the-art methods by 0.1%, 2.7%, 1.1%, and 2.3%, respectively. On PKU-MMD Part I/Part II, DoGCLR performs comparably to the state-of-the-art methods and achieves a 1.9% higher accuracy on Part II, highlighting its strong robustness on more challenging scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UniSER is a foundational universal model for restoring images degraded by soft effects (lens flare, haze, shadows, reflections) trained on a 3.8M-pair dataset and diffusion transformer with mask/strength controls, outperforming specialist and generalist methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Soft degradations are common, overlapping, and poorly handled by isolated specialist models; current generalist editors require detailed prompts and often fail to preserve scene identity. A scalable, robust approach that leverages shared underlying principles of soft effects is needed.

Method:  curate a large 3.8M-pair dataset including physically plausible data, fine-tune a Diffusion Transformer to learn robust restoration priors, and integrate fine-grained mask and strength controls within a single framework to address diverse soft-effect degradations.

Result: UniSER significantly outperforms both specialist and generalist models, delivering robust, high-fidelity restoration in real-world scenarios.

Conclusion: A versatile foundational model can unify restoration tasks for soft-image degradations, with the dataset and training pipeline enabling broad generalization across varied soft effects.

Abstract: Digital images are often degraded by soft effects such as lens flare, haze, shadows, and reflections, which reduce aesthetics even though the underlying pixels remain partially visible. The prevailing works address these degradations in isolation, developing highly specialized, specialist models that lack scalability and fail to exploit the shared underlying essences of these restoration problems. While specialist models are limited, recent large-scale pretrained generalist models offer powerful, text-driven image editing capabilities. while recent general-purpose systems (e.g., GPT-4o, Flux Kontext, Nano Banana) require detailed prompts and often fail to achieve robust removal on these fine-grained tasks or preserve identity of the scene. Leveraging the common essence of soft effects, i.e., semi-transparent occlusions, we introduce a foundational versatile model UniSER, capable of addressing diverse degradations caused by soft effects within a single framework. Our methodology centers on curating a massive 3.8M-pair dataset to ensure robustness and generalization, which includes novel, physically-plausible data to fill critical gaps in public benchmarks, and a tailored training pipeline that fine-tunes a Diffusion Transformer to learn robust restoration priors from this diverse data, integrating fine-grained mask and strength controls. This synergistic approach allows UniSER to significantly outperform both specialist and generalist models, achieving robust, high-fidelity restoration in the wild.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Global Perspective Tokenizer (GloTok) introduces a codebook-wise histogram relation learning to create a more uniform semantic distribution for tokenized features, augmented by a residual module to recover quantization details. It enables autoregressive-based image generation without requiring pre-trained models during training and achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction and generation on ImageNet-1k.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the non-uniform semantic distributions produced by locally supervised tokenizers and leverage the insight from VA-VAE that uniform semantic distributions improve generation.

Method: Leverage global relational information to transfer semantics from a dataset-wide pre-trained model to a semantic codebook via a codebook-wise histogram relation learning method; add a residual learning module to recover fine-grained details and minimize reconstruction error due to quantization; train autoregressive models without access to pre-trained models; evaluate on ImageNet-1k.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction performance and generation quality on ImageNet-1k.

Conclusion: GloTok yields more uniformly distributed semantic latent representations, which facilitates training autoregressive models for high-quality image generation without direct access to pre-trained models during training; demonstrates superior reconstruction and generation performance on standard benchmarks.

Abstract: Existing state-of-the-art image tokenization methods leverage diverse semantic features from pre-trained vision models for additional supervision, to expand the distribution of latent representations and thereby improve the quality of image reconstruction and generation. These methods employ a locally supervised approach for semantic supervision, which limits the uniformity of semantic distribution. However, VA-VAE proves that a more uniform feature distribution yields better generation performance. In this work, we introduce a Global Perspective Tokenizer (GloTok), which utilizes global relational information to model a more uniform semantic distribution of tokenized features. Specifically, a codebook-wise histogram relation learning method is proposed to transfer the semantics, which are modeled by pre-trained models on the entire dataset, to the semantic codebook. Then, we design a residual learning module that recovers the fine-grained details to minimize the reconstruction error caused by quantization. Through the above design, GloTok delivers more uniformly distributed semantic latent representations, which facilitates the training of autoregressive (AR) models for generating high-quality images without requiring direct access to pre-trained models during the training process. Experiments on the standard ImageNet-1k benchmark clearly show that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction performance and generation quality.

*Xiangyu Li,Chen Wang,Yumao Liu,Dengbo He,Jiahao Zhang,Ke Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: First end-to-end benchmark dataset collected entirely in autonomous-driving mode, enabling safety evaluation of AV behavior with end-to-end motion planning; 100+ hours, 32,727 key frames with multi-sensor data and rich scenario attributes; ADE of 1.4 m on autonomous-driving frames; dataset grows by ~10 hours weekly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing datasets (e.g., KITTI, nuScenes, Waymo) are collected in human-driven or unidentified modes, limiting evaluation of real behavioral safety when AVs are controlled end-to-end. There is a need for a dataset that captures pure autonomous-driving mode in naturalistic conditions to assess safety in the black-box setting.

Method: Data were collected from multiple production autonomous-driving vehicle models in real-world operation. The data are segmented into 32,727 key frames, each containing four synchronized camera images and high-precision GNSS/IMU data (0.8 cm localization). For each key frame, 20 Hz trajectories spanning the past 6 s and future 5 s are provided, along with 2D annotations of surrounding vehicles, pedestrians, traffic lights, and traffic signs. Rich scenario attributes include driver intent, area type (highways, urban, residential), lighting, weather, road surface, VRU/traffic density, and traffic-sign types. An end-to-end motion-planning model predicts trajectories, achieving an Average Displacement Error (ADE) of 1.4 m on autonomous-driving frames.

Result: The dataset demonstrates the feasibility of end-to-end safety evaluation in autonomous driving, achieving ADE = 1.4 m for predicted trajectories on autonomous driving frames. It contains 100+ hours of naturalistic data and grows by ~10 hours per week, enabling ongoing research on AV driving behavior and safety evaluation.

Conclusion: This work presents the first end-to-end benchmark dataset collected entirely in autonomous-driving mode, providing a sustainable, richly annotated resource (with diverse scenarios and precise localization) for driving-behavior analysis and safety evaluation of AVs using end-to-end planning approaches.

Abstract: Most existing autonomous-driving datasets (e.g., KITTI, nuScenes, and the Waymo Perception Dataset), collected by human-driving mode or unidentified driving mode, can only serve as early training for the perception and prediction of autonomous vehicles (AVs). To evaluate the real behavioral safety of AVs controlled in the black box, we present the first end-to-end benchmark dataset collected entirely by autonomous-driving mode in the real world. This dataset contains over 100 hours of naturalistic data from multiple production autonomous-driving vehicle models in the market. We segment the original data into 32,727 key frames, each consisting of four synchronized camera images and high-precision GNSS/IMU data (0.8 cm localization accuracy). For each key frame, 20 Hz vehicle trajectories spanning the past 6 s and future 5 s are provided, along with detailed 2D annotations of surrounding vehicles, pedestrians, traffic lights, and traffic signs. These key frames have rich scenario-level attributes, including driver intent, area type (covering highways, urban roads, and residential areas), lighting (day, night, or dusk), weather (clear or rain), road surface (paved or unpaved), traffic and vulnerable road users (VRU) density, traffic lights, and traffic signs (warning, prohibition, and indication). To evaluate the safety of AVs, we employ an end-to-end motion planning model that predicts vehicle trajectories with an Average Displacement Error (ADE) of 1.4 m on autonomous-driving frames. The dataset continues to expand by over 10 hours of new data weekly, thereby providing a sustainable foundation for research on AV driving behavior analysis and safety evaluation.

*Zhaoyu Liu,Kan Jiang,Murong Ma,Zhe Hou,Yun Lin,Jin Song Dong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A few-shot precise event spotting (PES) method using a Unified Multi-Entity Graph Network (UME G-Net) that fuses human skeletons and sport-specific object keypoints, with a spatio-temporal GCN and multi-scale temporal shift, plus multimodal distillation to transfer keypoint knowledge to visual features; achieves strong performance with limited labeled data and outperforms baselines in few-shot PES. Code is available.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PES aims to recognize fine-grained events at exact moments but faces challenges like rapid sequences, motion blur, and subtle visual differences. Existing approaches rely on large labeled datasets and end-to-end training, which is impractical in few-shot scenarios. There is a need for robust methods that leverage structured cues (skeletons and object keypoints) and knowledge transfer to visual representations.

Method: Propose UMEG-Net, which builds a unified graph from human skeletons and sport-specific object keypoints. It uses an efficient spatio-temporal extraction module based on advanced Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) and multi-scale temporal shift. Additionally, multimodal distillation transfers knowledge from keypoint-based graphs to visual representations to improve performance under few-shot conditions.

Result: The approach yields robust performance with limited labeled data and significantly outperforms baseline models in few-shot PES setups.

Conclusion: UMEG-Net provides a scalable and effective solution for few-shot PES, leveraging fused keypoint graphs and distillation to enhance visual representations. The method's code is publicly available for replication.

Abstract: Precise event spotting (PES) aims to recognize fine-grained events at exact moments and has become a key component of sports analytics. This task is particularly challenging due to rapid succession, motion blur, and subtle visual differences. Consequently, most existing methods rely on domain-specific, end-to-end training with large labeled datasets and often struggle in few-shot conditions due to their dependence on pixel- or pose-based inputs alone. However, obtaining large labeled datasets is practically hard. We propose a Unified Multi-Entity Graph Network (UMEG-Net) for few-shot PES. UMEG-Net integrates human skeletons and sport-specific object keypoints into a unified graph and features an efficient spatio-temporal extraction module based on advanced GCN and multi-scale temporal shift. To further enhance performance, we employ multimodal distillation to transfer knowledge from keypoint-based graphs to visual representations. Our approach achieves robust performance with limited labeled data and significantly outperforms baseline models in few-shot settings, providing a scalable and effective solution for few-shot PES.

*Pengcheng Shi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A curriculum-learning framework with a fractal softmax for hierarchical semantic learning improves vascular segmentation, achieving faster inference and higher Dice scores, enabling real-time clinical use.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The aorta and branch vessels require accurate 3D segmentation for minimally invasive repairs, but traditional methods ignore hierarchical anatomical relationships and suffer from severe class imbalance between dominant vascular structures and rare, clinically critical components.

Method: Proposes a curriculum learning strategy that progressively decomposes complex vascular anatomy from simple to complex components, aided by a fractal softmax for hierarchical semantic learning. A two-stage inference process is used to accelerate performance, and hierarchical semantic loss guides learning to respect anatomical hierarchies, addressing class imbalance by first solidifying representations for dominant classes before tackling rare structures.

Result: On validation (epoch 50), hierarchical semantic loss improves Dice by 11.65% for nnU-Net ResEnc M. On the test set, the model achieves a 5.6% higher Dice than baselines. The two-stage inference yields up to fivefold acceleration. Overall, the approach enhances segmentation accuracy and efficiency for potential real-time clinical use.

Conclusion: The curriculum-driven, hierarchy-aware framework with fractal softmax significantly improves segmentation accuracy and efficiency for aorta and branch-vessel analyses, supporting real-time clinical applications; code is publicly available for reproduction.

Abstract: The aorta, the body's largest artery, is prone to pathologies such as dissection, aneurysm, and atherosclerosis, which often require timely intervention. Minimally invasive repairs involving branch vessels necessitate detailed 3D anatomical analysis. Existing methods often overlook hierarchical anatomical relationships while struggling with severe class imbalance inherent in vascular structures. We address these challenges with a curriculum learning strategy that leverages a novel fractal softmax for hierarchical semantic learning. Inspired by human cognition, our approach progressively learns anatomical constraints by decomposing complex structures from simple to complex components. The curriculum learning framework naturally addresses class imbalance by first establishing robust feature representations for dominant classes before tackling rare but anatomically critical structures, significantly accelerating model convergence in multi-class scenarios. Our two-stage inference strategy achieves up to fivefold acceleration, enhancing clinical practicality. On the validation set at epoch 50, our hierarchical semantic loss improves the Dice score of nnU-Net ResEnc M by 11.65%. The proposed model demonstrates a 5.6% higher Dice score than baselines on the test set. Experimental results show significant improvements in segmentation accuracy and efficiency, making the framework suitable for real-time clinical applications. The implementation code for this challenge entry is publicly available at: https://github.com/PengchengShi1220/AortaSeg24.

*Zitang Sun,Masakazu Yoshimura,Junji Otsuka,Atsushi Irie,Takeshi Ohashi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DetGain is an online data-collection method for object detection that estimates how each image would affect dataset AP, and uses these estimates to selectively train with informative samples, improving accuracy and robustness across detectors with minimal changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-quality data is crucial for progress under scale laws, but obtaining large curated datasets is costly. Online curation that selects informative samples based on the model’s state can improve data efficiency, but existing strategies struggle for object detection due to its complexity and domain gaps.

Method: DetGain estimates the marginal perturbation of each image on dataset-level Average Precision (AP) by leveraging prediction quality and modeling global score distributions. It efficiently estimates global AP change and computes teacher–student contribution gaps to identify informative samples at each iteration. The approach is architecture-agnostic and minimally intrusive, enabling easy integration into various object detection architectures.

Result: Experiments on the COCO dataset across multiple representative detectors show consistent improvements in accuracy. DetGain is robust to low-quality data and can be combined with knowledge distillation to further enhance performance.

Conclusion: DetGain provides a general, complementary data-efficient strategy for object detection that works across architectures, improves accuracy, and offers robustness to data quality, with straightforward integration and potential synergy with distillation.

Abstract: High-quality data has become a primary driver of progress under scale laws, with curated datasets often outperforming much larger unfiltered ones at lower cost. Online data curation extends this idea by dynamically selecting training samples based on the model's evolving state. While effective in classification and multimodal learning, existing online sampling strategies rarely extend to object detection because of its structural complexity and domain gaps. We introduce DetGain, an online data curation method specifically for object detection that estimates the marginal perturbation of each image to dataset-level Average Precision (AP) based on its prediction quality. By modeling global score distributions, DetGain efficiently estimates the global AP change and computes teacher-student contribution gaps to select informative samples at each iteration. The method is architecture-agnostic and minimally intrusive, enabling straightforward integration into diverse object detection architectures. Experiments on the COCO dataset with multiple representative detectors show consistent improvements in accuracy. DetGain also demonstrates strong robustness under low-quality data and can be effectively combined with knowledge distillation techniques to further enhance performance, highlighting its potential as a general and complementary strategy for data-efficient object detection.

### [67] [Multi-Scale Correlation-Aware Transformer for Maritime Vessel Re-Identification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14203)
*Yunhe Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MCFormer is a Transformer-based maritime vessel Re-ID method that uses global and local correlation modeling to suppress outliers and handle missing parts, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Maritime vessel re-identification faces higher intra-identity variation and more severe local part occlusion than pedestrians. Existing methods adapted from pedestrian Re-ID fail to address these issues; there's a need to exploit cross-image correlations and robust local features.

Method: MCFormer introduces Global Correlation Module (GCM) and Local Correlation Module (LCM). GCM builds a global similarity affinity matrix across all input images to model inter-image consistency for global correlations. LCM maintains a dynamic memory bank to mine and align local features of positive samples with contextual similarity, mitigating missing/occluded regions. The model fuses multi-scale global and local features to capture latent relationships across image features for robust representations.

Result: Experimental evaluation on three benchmarks shows that MCFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance in maritime vessel Re-ID.

Conclusion: Modeling both global and local correlations across multiple scales effectively handles intra-identity variation and missing/local occlusions, offering a robust solution for vessel Re-ID and improving performance over prior pedestrian-derived methods.

Abstract: Maritime vessel re-identification (Re-ID) plays a crucial role in advancing maritime monitoring and intelligent situational awareness systems. However, some existing vessel Re-ID methods are directly adapted from pedestrian-focused algorithms, making them ill-suited for mitigating the unique problems present in vessel images, particularly the greater intra-identity variations and more severe missing of local parts, which lead to the emergence of outlier samples within the same identity. To address these challenges, we propose the Multi-scale Correlation-aware Transformer Network (MCFormer), which explicitly models multi-scale correlations across the entire input set to suppress the adverse effects of outlier samples with intra-identity variations or local missing, incorporating two novel modules, the Global Correlation Module (GCM), and the Local Correlation Module (LCM). Specifically, GCM constructs a global similarity affinity matrix across all input images to model global correlations through feature aggregation based on inter-image consistency, rather than solely learning features from individual images as in most existing approaches. Simultaneously, LCM mines and aligns local features of positive samples with contextual similarity to extract local correlations by maintaining a dynamic memory bank, effectively compensating for missing or occluded regions in individual images. To further enhance feature robustness, MCFormer integrates global and local features that have been respectively correlated across multiple scales, effectively capturing latent relationships among image features. Experiments on three benchmarks demonstrate that MCFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance.

### [68] [InstantViR: Real-Time Video Inverse Problem Solver with Distilled Diffusion Prior](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14208)
*Weimin Bai,Suzhe Xu,Yiwei Ren,Jinhua Hao,Ming Sun,Wenzheng Chen,He Sun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: InstantViR is an amortized, real-time video reconstruction framework that distills a pretrained bidirectional video diffusion model into a causal autoregressive student, enabling single-pass restoration with no external paired data and LeanVAE for low-latency latent processing; it achieves ~35 FPS on A100 and up to 100x speedups over iterative solvers while matching or surpassing diffusion-based baselines across inpainting, deblurring, and super-resolution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Video inverse problems require high perceptual quality under tight latency. Diffusion priors offer state-of-the-art reconstructions but are too slow or use ad hoc temporal regularizers, making real-time streaming impractical.

Method: A teacher–student distillation where a bidirectional video diffusion model (teacher) is distilled into a causal autoregressive student that maps degraded video to restored video in a single forward pass. Distillation is prior-driven and does not require paired clean/noisy data; degradation operators are known. Additionally, a LeanVAE backbone replaces the diffusion-based VAE, using a teacher-space regularized distillation to enable low-latency latent-space processing.

Result: InstantViR matches or surpasses diffusion-based baselines in reconstruction quality across streaming random inpainting, Gaussian deblurring, and super-resolution, while running at >35 FPS on NVIDIA A100 GPUs and delivering up to 100× speedups over iterative video diffusion solvers.

Conclusion: Diffusion-based video reconstruction can be made real-time and interactive. InstantViR demonstrates that real-time, editable video restoration is practical in streaming systems, enabling high-quality results with low latency.

Abstract: Video inverse problems are fundamental to streaming, telepresence, and AR/VR, where high perceptual quality must coexist with tight latency constraints. Diffusion-based priors currently deliver state-of-the-art reconstructions, but existing approaches either adapt image diffusion models with ad hoc temporal regularizers - leading to temporal artifacts - or rely on native video diffusion models whose iterative posterior sampling is far too slow for real-time use. We introduce InstantViR, an amortized inference framework for ultra-fast video reconstruction powered by a pre-trained video diffusion prior. We distill a powerful bidirectional video diffusion model (teacher) into a causal autoregressive student that maps a degraded video directly to its restored version in a single forward pass, inheriting the teacher's strong temporal modeling while completely removing iterative test-time optimization. The distillation is prior-driven: it only requires the teacher diffusion model and known degradation operators, and does not rely on externally paired clean/noisy video data. To further boost throughput, we replace the video-diffusion backbone VAE with a high-efficiency LeanVAE via an innovative teacher-space regularized distillation scheme, enabling low-latency latent-space processing. Across streaming random inpainting, Gaussian deblurring and super-resolution, InstantViR matches or surpasses the reconstruction quality of diffusion-based baselines while running at over 35 FPS on NVIDIA A100 GPUs, achieving up to 100 times speedups over iterative video diffusion solvers. These results show that diffusion-based video reconstruction is compatible with real-time, interactive, editable, streaming scenarios, turning high-quality video restoration into a practical component of modern vision systems.

*Wenjie Li,Yulun Zhang,Guangwei Gao,Heng Guo,Zhanyu Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A measurement-constrained diffusion framework for diverse blind face restoration that yields multiple HQ reconstructions aligned to user prompts, outperforming prior methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Blind face restoration is highly ill-posed; multiple plausible HQ reconstructions exist. Current methods are often deterministic and fail to capture one-to-many possibilities, especially when guided by textual prompts.

Method: Measurement-Constrained Sampling (MCS) for BFR: formulate as inverse problem via controlled degradations of coarse restorations; use posterior-guided sampling within a text-to-image diffusion model; introduce Forward Measurement to align outputs with input structures and Reverse Measurement to create projection spaces enabling alignment with various prompts.

Result: Experiments indicate MCS can generate prompt-aligned, diverse HQ reconstructions and outperforms existing BFR methods.

Conclusion: MCS enables diversity and prompt-guided control in blind face restoration; code will be released after acceptance.

Abstract: Blind face restoration (BFR) may correspond to multiple plausible high-quality (HQ) reconstructions under extremely low-quality (LQ) inputs. However, existing methods typically produce deterministic results, struggling to capture this one-to-many nature. In this paper, we propose a Measurement-Constrained Sampling (MCS) approach that enables diverse LQ face reconstructions conditioned on different textual prompts. Specifically, we formulate BFR as a measurement-constrained generative task by constructing an inverse problem through controlled degradations of coarse restorations, which allows posterior-guided sampling within text-to-image diffusion. Measurement constraints include both Forward Measurement, which ensures results align with input structures, and Reverse Measurement, which produces projection spaces, ensuring that the solution can align with various prompts. Experiments show that our MCS can generate prompt-aligned results and outperforms existing BFR methods. Codes will be released after acceptance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Streaming autoregressive diffusion for speech-driven 3D facial animation: processes audio in a streaming fashion using a fixed set of past frames as context to achieve low-latency, real-time synthesis, addressing horizon and latency issues of full-sequence diffusion models; code and demo released.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current audio-conditioned diffusion models process entire audio sequences in one go, leading to poor handling of long inputs and high latency. A streaming, autoregressive approach with a limited history window aims to enable flexible-length inputs and real-time performance.

Method: An autoregressive diffusion model that ingests audio in a streaming manner. It selects a limited number of past motion frames as historical context, combines them with the current audio to form a dynamic condition, and uses this condition to guide iterative diffusion to generate facial frames one by one. This enables real-time synthesis and includes a real-time interactive demo. Code will be released at the project site.

Result: Demonstrates real-time, high-quality facial animation driven by speech with latency that does not scale with audio duration. The approach provides flexibility for varying audio lengths and shows effectiveness via an interactive demo; code release planned.

Conclusion: Streaming diffusion with a limited history context is effective for scalable, low-latency speech-driven 3D facial animation, enabling real-time synthesis for arbitrary-length audio sequences.

Abstract: This paper focuses on the task of speech-driven 3D facial animation, which aims to generate realistic and synchronized facial motions driven by speech inputs.Recent methods have employed audio-conditioned diffusion models for 3D facial animation, achieving impressive results in generating expressive and natural animations.However, these methods process the whole audio sequences in a single pass, which poses two major challenges: they tend to perform poorly when handling audio sequences that exceed the training horizon and will suffer from significant latency when processing long audio inputs. To address these limitations, we propose a novel autoregressive diffusion model that processes input audio in a streaming manner. This design ensures flexibility with varying audio lengths and achieves low latency independent of audio duration. Specifically, we select a limited number of past frames as historical motion context and combine them with the audio input to create a dynamic condition. This condition guides the diffusion process to iteratively generate facial motion frames, enabling real-time synthesis with high-quality results. Additionally, we implemented a real-time interactive demo, highlighting the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach. We will release the code at https://zju3dv.github.io/StreamingTalker/.

*Juncheng Hu,Zijian Zhang,Zeyu Wang,Guoyu Wang,Yingji Li,Kedi Lyu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: An active perceptual strategy (APS) for 3D human motion prediction using quotient-space representations and restorative learning, producing state-of-the-art results across multiple datasets and is model-agnostic.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current motion forecasting heavily relies on implicit spatiotemporal modeling and passive learning, leading to redundant coordinate information and limited explicit learning of motion properties. APS aims to provide explicit geometric representations and active auxiliary supervision to improve learning efficiency and performance.

Method: Data perception module projects poses into the quotient space, decoupling motion geometry from coordinate redundancy by encoding tangent vectors and Grassmann projections for dimension reduction, semantic decoupling, and dynamic constraint enforcement. Network perception module uses restorative learning, masking joints or injecting noise to create auxiliary supervision, with a dedicated auxiliary network that learns from perturbed information. APS is model-agnostic and can be integrated with various predictors.

Result: Achieves new state-of-the-art performance: 16.3% improvement on H3.6M, 13.9% on CMU Mocap, and 10.1% on 3DPW compared to prior methods.

Conclusion: By combining explicit quotient-space representations with active, perturbation-based auxiliary learning, APS provides stronger spatio-temporal modeling and generalizes across prediction models, yielding substantial gains on standard benchmarks.

Abstract: Forecasting 3D human motion is an important embodiment of fine-grained understanding and cognition of human behavior by artificial agents. Current approaches excessively rely on implicit network modeling of spatiotemporal relationships and motion characteristics, falling into the passive learning trap that results in redundant and monotonous 3D coordinate information acquisition while lacking actively guided explicit learning mechanisms. To overcome these issues, we propose an Active Perceptual Strategy (APS) for human motion prediction, leveraging quotient space representations to explicitly encode motion properties while introducing auxiliary learning objectives to strengthen spatio-temporal modeling. Specifically, we first design a data perception module that projects poses into the quotient space, decoupling motion geometry from coordinate redundancy. By jointly encoding tangent vectors and Grassmann projections, this module simultaneously achieves geometric dimension reduction, semantic decoupling, and dynamic constraint enforcement for effective motion pose characterization. Furthermore, we introduce a network perception module that actively learns spatio-temporal dependencies through restorative learning. This module deliberately masks specific joints or injects noise to construct auxiliary supervision signals. A dedicated auxiliary learning network is designed to actively adapt and learn from perturbed information. Notably, APS is model agnostic and can be integrated with different prediction models to enhance active perceptual. The experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves the new state-of-the-art, outperforming existing methods by large margins: 16.3% on H3.6M, 13.9% on CMU Mocap, and 10.1% on 3DPW.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WeSTAR improves monocular depth estimation by weakly supervised self-training with regularization, combining dense self-supervision, semantically-aware hierarchical normalization, and pairwise ordinal depth constraints to enhance robustness and generalization in unseen domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address robustness and generalization gaps of foundation-model-based MDE when deployed in unseen or diverse domains; leverage a mix of dense self-supervision, weak supervision, and stable fine-tuning to preserve generalizable knowledge.

Method: 1) Dense self-training objective as primary self-supervision; 2) semantically-aware hierarchical normalization that uses instance-level segmentation maps for stable, multi-scale normalization; 3) weak supervision via pairwise ordinal depth annotations to enforce informative depth-order constraints; 4) weight regularization loss to anchor LoRA updates and maintain training stability and knowledge preservation.

Result: Extensive experiments on realistic and corrupted out-of-distribution datasets demonstrate consistently improved generalization and state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of benchmarks.

Conclusion: WeSTAR provides a parameter-efficient, robust adaptation framework for MDE foundation models, achieving strong generalization in unseen domains while maintaining training stability and efficiency.

Abstract: The emergence of foundation models has substantially advanced zero-shot generalization in monocular depth estimation (MDE), as exemplified by the Depth Anything series. However, given access to some data from downstream tasks, a natural question arises: can the performance of these models be further improved? To this end, we propose WeSTAR, a parameter-efficient framework that performs Weakly supervised Self-Training Adaptation with Regularization, designed to enhance the robustness of MDE foundation models in unseen and diverse domains. We first adopt a dense self-training objective as the primary source of structural self-supervision. To further improve robustness, we introduce semantically-aware hierarchical normalization, which exploits instance-level segmentation maps to perform more stable and multi-scale structural normalization. Beyond dense supervision, we introduce a cost-efficient weak supervision in the form of pairwise ordinal depth annotations to further guide the adaptation process, which enforces informative ordinal constraints to mitigate local topological errors. Finally, a weight regularization loss is employed to anchor the LoRA updates, ensuring training stability and preserving the model's generalizable knowledge. Extensive experiments on both realistic and corrupted out-of-distribution datasets under diverse and challenging scenarios demonstrate that WeSTAR consistently improves generalization and achieves state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of benchmarks.

*Wenkai Lin,Qiming Xia,Wen Li,Xun Huang,Chenglu Wen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A GNSS-free collaborative perception framework for LiDAR-based localization using a Pose Generator with Confidence (PGC) and a Pose-Aware Spatio-Temporal Alignment Transformer (PASTAT), tested on the V2VLoc dataset with Town1Loc, Town4Loc, and V2VDet, achieving state-of-the-art in GNSS-denied conditions and validated on real-world data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GNSS-denied environments degrade collaborative perception; conventional GNSS-based localization causes misalignment between agents, hindering cooperative sensing. A robust, GNSS-free solution is needed for accurate pose estimation and alignment in multi-agent systems.

Method: Introduce Pose Generator with Confidence (PGC) to estimate compact pose and confidence; develop Pose-Aware Spatio-Temporal Alignment Transformer (PASTAT) for confidence-aware spatial alignment with temporal context; present V2VLoc dataset with Town1Loc, Town4Loc, and V2VDet for LiDAR localization and collaborative detection tasks.

Result: Extensive experiments on V2VLoc show state-of-the-art performance under GNSS-denied conditions; extended experiments on real-world V2V4Real validate effectiveness and generalizability of PASTAT and the overall framework.

Conclusion: The proposed GNSS-free framework combining PGC and PASTAT enables robust collaborative perception without GNSS, with a dedicated LiDAR-based dataset (V2VLoc) supporting localization and collaborative detection tasks; results indicate strong performance and generalization to real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Multi-agents rely on accurate poses to share and align observations, enabling a collaborative perception of the environment. However, traditional GNSS-based localization often fails in GNSS-denied environments, making consistent feature alignment difficult in collaboration. To tackle this challenge, we propose a robust GNSS-free collaborative perception framework based on LiDAR localization. Specifically, we propose a lightweight Pose Generator with Confidence (PGC) to estimate compact pose and confidence representations. To alleviate the effects of localization errors, we further develop the Pose-Aware Spatio-Temporal Alignment Transformer (PASTAT), which performs confidence-aware spatial alignment while capturing essential temporal context. Additionally, we present a new simulation dataset, V2VLoc, which can be adapted for both LiDAR localization and collaborative detection tasks. V2VLoc comprises three subsets: Town1Loc, Town4Loc, and V2VDet. Town1Loc and Town4Loc offer multi-traversal sequences for training in localization tasks, whereas V2VDet is specifically intended for the collaborative detection task. Extensive experiments conducted on the V2VLoc dataset demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance under GNSS-denied conditions. We further conduct extended experiments on the real-world V2V4Real dataset to validate the effectiveness and generalizability of PASTAT.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ManipBench is a large-scale image manipulation benchmark with 450k AI-edited images from 25 editing models across 12 categories, plus 100k images annotated for localization and explanations. ManipShield is an all-in-one, multimodal LLM-based model using contrastive LoRA fine-tuning and task-specific decoders for unified detection, localization, and explanation. The results show state-of-the-art performance and strong generalization to unseen models; both will be released with publication.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current image manipulation detection and localization (IMDL) benchmarks lack content diversity, broad generative-model coverage, and interpretable annotations. This limits generalization and explainability of detection methods in the face of advanced AI editing.

Method: Construct ManipBench by compiling over 450k manipulated images generated by 25 state-of-the-art editing models spanning 12 manipulation categories, with 100k images annotated with bounding boxes, judgment cues, and textual explanations for interpretability. Develop ManipShield, an all-in-one model based on a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) that uses contrastive LoRA fine-tuning and task-specific decoders to perform unified manipulation detection, localization, and explanation across modalities.

Result: ManipBench and ManipShield achieve state-of-the-art performance on ManipBench and several public datasets and demonstrate strong generalization to unseen manipulation models.

Conclusion: ManipBench and ManipShield will be released publicly, advancing robust detection, precise localization, and interpretable explanations for AI-edited image manipulation.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of generative models, powerful image editing methods now enable diverse and highly realistic image manipulations that far surpass traditional deepfake techniques, posing new challenges for manipulation detection. Existing image manipulation detection and localization (IMDL) benchmarks suffer from limited content diversity, narrow generative-model coverage, and insufficient interpretability, which hinders the generalization and explanation capabilities of current manipulation detection methods. To address these limitations, we introduce \textbf{ManipBench}, a large-scale benchmark for image manipulation detection and localization focusing on AI-edited images. ManipBench contains over 450K manipulated images produced by 25 state-of-the-art image editing models across 12 manipulation categories, among which 100K images are further annotated with bounding boxes, judgment cues, and textual explanations to support interpretable detection. Building upon ManipBench, we propose \textbf{ManipShield}, an all-in-one model based on a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) that leverages contrastive LoRA fine-tuning and task-specific decoders to achieve unified image manipulation detection, localization, and explanation. Extensive experiments on ManipBench and several public datasets demonstrate that ManipShield achieves state-of-the-art performance and exhibits strong generality to unseen manipulation models. Both ManipBench and ManipShield will be released upon publication.

### [76] [Gaussian Splatting-based Low-Rank Tensor Representation for Multi-Dimensional Image Recovery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14270)
*Yiming Zeng,Xi-Le Zhao,Wei-Hao Wu,Teng-Yu Ji,Chao Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Gaussian Splatting-based Low-rank tensor Representation (GSLR) for multi-dimensional images uses 2D Gaussian splatting to form latent tensors and 1D Gaussian splatting to form transform matrices, addressing coarse latent representations and fixed bases in t-SVD; an unsupervised recovery model demonstrates superior performance, especially in local high-frequency information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: t-SVD-based methods suffer from (i) coarse latent tensor approximations that fail to capture spatial local high-frequency information, and (ii) fixed transform bases (e.g., DFT, DCT) that cannot precisely capture high-frequency content along mode-3 fibers. A continuous, compact representation that better preserves local detail is desired.

Method: Propose GSLR by generating the latent tensor via tailored 2D Gaussian splatting and the transform matrix via 1D Gaussian splatting. The 2D and 1D splatting are complementary within this framework. Develop an unsupervised GSLR-based multi-dimensional image recovery model.

Result: Extensive experiments on multi-dimensional image recovery show that GSLR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, particularly in capturing local high-frequency information.

Conclusion: GSLR offers a powerful representation for local high-frequency content and improves multi-dimensional image reconstruction by jointly leveraging Gaussian splatting for latent and transform components; the 2D and 1D splatting are essential for its performance.

Abstract: Tensor singular value decomposition (t-SVD) is a promising tool for multi-dimensional image representation, which decomposes a multi-dimensional image into a latent tensor and an accompanying transform matrix. However, two critical limitations of t-SVD methods persist: (1) the approximation of the latent tensor (e.g., tensor factorizations) is coarse and fails to accurately capture spatial local high-frequency information; (2) The transform matrix is composed of fixed basis atoms (e.g., complex exponential atoms in DFT and cosine atoms in DCT) and cannot precisely capture local high-frequency information along the mode-3 fibers. To address these two limitations, we propose a Gaussian Splatting-based Low-rank tensor Representation (GSLR) framework, which compactly and continuously represents multi-dimensional images. Specifically, we leverage tailored 2D Gaussian splatting and 1D Gaussian splatting to generate the latent tensor and transform matrix, respectively. The 2D and 1D Gaussian splatting are indispensable and complementary under this representation framework, which enjoys a powerful representation capability, especially for local high-frequency information. To evaluate the representation ability of the proposed GSLR, we develop an unsupervised GSLR-based multi-dimensional image recovery model. Extensive experiments on multi-dimensional image recovery demonstrate that GSLR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, particularly in capturing local high-frequency information.

### [77] [Let Language Constrain Geometry: Vision-Language Models as Semantic and Spatial Critics for 3D Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14271)
*Weimin Bai,Yubo Li,Weijian Luo,Zeqiang Lai,Yequan Wang,Wenzheng Chen,He Sun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VLM3D introduces a dual-query, differentiable critic from vision-language models to guide text-to-3D generation, addressing semantic alignment and 3D spatial coherence; validated as both a reward for optimization-based pipelines and as test-time guidance for feed-forward models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: State-of-the-art text-to-3D methods struggle with fine-grained prompt details and robust 3D spatial understanding, leading to semantic gaps and geometric/inconsistency errors. A general, language-grounded critic could unify semantics and space across divergent 3D generation paradigms.

Method: Repurpose large vision-language models as a differentiable critic by extracting Yes/No log-odds to form a dual-query signal: one for semantic fidelity and one for geometric coherence. Apply this signal in two modes: (1) as a reward objective to optimize 3D generation pipelines, and (2) as a test-time guidance module to steer iterative sampling in feed-forward models, correcting severe spatial errors.

Result: When used as a reward, VLM3D significantly outperforms existing methods on standard benchmarks. As a test-time guidance module, it effectively steers the sampling process of state-of-the-art native 3D models to fix major spatial errors. The framework is generalizable and provides a principled way to inject VLM-based semantic-space understanding into diverse 3D pipelines.

Conclusion: VLM3D offers a general, principled pathway to leverage VLMs for both semantic and spatial supervision in 3D generation, enabling improved alignment with prompts and robust geometric consistency across optimization-based and feed-forward architectures.

Abstract: Text-to-3D generation has advanced rapidly, yet state-of-the-art models, encompassing both optimization-based and feed-forward architectures, still face two fundamental limitations. First, they struggle with coarse semantic alignment, often failing to capture fine-grained prompt details. Second, they lack robust 3D spatial understanding, leading to geometric inconsistencies and catastrophic failures in part assembly and spatial relationships. To address these challenges, we propose VLM3D, a general framework that repurposes large vision-language models (VLMs) as powerful, differentiable semantic and spatial critics. Our core contribution is a dual-query critic signal derived from the VLM's Yes or No log-odds, which assesses both semantic fidelity and geometric coherence. We demonstrate the generality of this guidance signal across two distinct paradigms: (1) As a reward objective for optimization-based pipelines, VLM3D significantly outperforms existing methods on standard benchmarks. (2) As a test-time guidance module for feed-forward pipelines, it actively steers the iterative sampling process of SOTA native 3D models to correct severe spatial errors. VLM3D establishes a principled and generalizable path to inject the VLM's rich, language-grounded understanding of both semantics and space into diverse 3D generative pipelines.

### [78] [Free Lunch to Meet the Gap: Intermediate Domain Reconstruction for Cross-Domain Few-Shot Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14279)
*Tong Zhang,Yifan Zhao,Liangyu Wang,Jia Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduces Intermediate Domain Proxies (IDP) for cross-domain few-shot learning by reconstructing target features from a source-based codebook, enabling fast domain alignment and achieving state-of-the-art results on eight benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CDFSL suffers from semantic disjointness between source and target domains, large domain discrepancies, and data scarcity. Existing generalized-representation approaches may underutilize structured intermediate information; the paper proposes Intermediate Domain Proxies to bridge domains using source embeddings as a codebook to reconstruct target features.

Method: Construct Intermediate Domain Proxies (IDP) using source feature embeddings as a codebook to reconstruct target-domain features; analyze IDP attributes regarding visual styles and semantic contents; develop a fast domain-alignment method that uses IDPs as guidance for target feature transformation; train with collaborative learning of IDP reconstruction and target feature transformation.

Result: The proposed model surpasses state-of-the-art models by a margin on 8 cross-domain few-shot learning benchmarks.

Conclusion: IDP-based proxy learning with joint reconstruction and target-feature transformation effectively bridges domain gaps under data scarcity and yields strong generalization across multiple cross-domain few-shot benchmarks.

Abstract: Cross-Domain Few-Shot Learning (CDFSL) endeavors to transfer generalized knowledge from the source domain to target domains using only a minimal amount of training data, which faces a triplet of learning challenges in the meantime, i.e., semantic disjoint, large domain discrepancy, and data scarcity. Different from predominant CDFSL works focused on generalized representations, we make novel attempts to construct Intermediate Domain Proxies (IDP) with source feature embeddings as the codebook and reconstruct the target domain feature with this learned codebook. We then conduct an empirical study to explore the intrinsic attributes from perspectives of visual styles and semantic contents in intermediate domain proxies. Reaping benefits from these attributes of intermediate domains, we develop a fast domain alignment method to use these proxies as learning guidance for target domain feature transformation. With the collaborative learning of intermediate domain reconstruction and target feature transformation, our proposed model is able to surpass the state-of-the-art models by a margin on 8 cross-domain few-shot learning benchmarks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NeuralSSD is a solver-based neural Galerkin approach that reconstructs high-quality 3D implicit surfaces from point clouds, balancing data fidelity with a learned 3D representation via a new energy term and convolutional network, achieving state-of-the-art results on ShapeNet and Matterport.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Explicitly enforce a tight fit between implicit surfaces and input data, addressing limitations of existing implicit field parameterizations in capturing fine details and handling topology changes.

Method: NeuralSSD uses a neural Galerkin framework to reconstruct implicit surfaces from point clouds, introducing a novel energy equation that balances point cloud reliability with surface fitting, and a new 3D convolutional network that learns volumetric information to improve optimization and reconstruction accuracy.

Result: Demonstrates state-of-the-art reconstruction accuracy and generalizability on ShapeNet and Matterport datasets.

Conclusion: NeuralSSD provides accurate, stable, and generalizable 3D surface reconstructions from point clouds, powered by the new energy term and the specialized 3D conv network, with robustness to topological changes.

Abstract: We proposed a generalized method, NeuralSSD, for reconstructing a 3D implicit surface from the widely-available point cloud data. NeuralSSD is a solver-based on the neural Galerkin method, aimed at reconstructing higher-quality and accurate surfaces from input point clouds. Implicit method is preferred due to its ability to accurately represent shapes and its robustness in handling topological changes. However, existing parameterizations of implicit fields lack explicit mechanisms to ensure a tight fit between the surface and input data. To address this, we propose a novel energy equation that balances the reliability of point cloud information. Additionally, we introduce a new convolutional network that learns three-dimensional information to achieve superior optimization results. This approach ensures that the reconstructed surface closely adheres to the raw input points and infers valuable inductive biases from point clouds, resulting in a highly accurate and stable surface reconstruction. NeuralSSD is evaluated on a variety of challenging datasets, including the ShapeNet and Matterport datasets, and achieves state-of-the-art results in terms of both surface reconstruction accuracy and generalizability.

*Luohong Wu,Matthias Seibold,Nicola A. Cavalcanti,Yunke Ao,Roman Flepp,Aidana Massalimova,Lilian Calvet,Philipp Fürnstahl*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NeuralBoneReg is a self-supervised, surface-based bone registration framework that uses a neural unsigned distance field (UDF) and an MLP-based registration module to align intraoperative point clouds with preoperative bone models in a modality-agnostic way, achieving strong cross-modal accuracy across multiple datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In CAOS, accurate transfer of surgical plans requires robust cross-registration between preoperative and intraoperative data. Modality heterogeneity across imaging modalities makes this challenging and prone to error, necessitating automatic, modality-agnostic bone surface registration.

Method: A self-supervised, two-module approach: (1) an implicit UDF that learns the preoperative bone surface model from 3D point clouds, and (2) an MLP-based registration module that performs global initialization and local refinement by generating transformation hypotheses to align the intraoperative point cloud with the neural UDF. The method operates directly on 3D point clouds and does not require inter-subject training data.

Result: Evaluated on two public multi-modal datasets (UltraBones100k CT-US fibula/tibia; SpineDepth CT-RGB-D) and a newly introduced UltraBones-Hip CT-US dataset. NeuralBoneReg matches or surpasses state-of-the-art methods, achieving mean RRE/RTE of 1.68°/1.86 mm (UltraBones100k), 1.88°/1.89 mm (UltraBones-Hip), and 3.79°/2.45 mm (SpineDepth). Demonstrates strong generalizability across anatomies and modalities.

Conclusion: NeuralBoneReg provides robust, automatic, modality-agnostic bone surface registration for CAOS, with self-supervised training and strong cross-domain performance, enabling more accurate transfer of preoperative plans to the intraoperative setting.

Abstract: In computer- and robot-assisted orthopedic surgery (CAOS), patient-specific surgical plans derived from preoperative imaging define target locations and implant trajectories. During surgery, these plans must be accurately transferred, relying on precise cross-registration between preoperative and intraoperative data. However, substantial modality heterogeneity across imaging modalities makes this registration challenging and error-prone. Robust, automatic, and modality-agnostic bone surface registration is therefore clinically important. We propose NeuralBoneReg, a self-supervised, surface-based framework that registers bone surfaces using 3D point clouds as a modality-agnostic representation. NeuralBoneReg includes two modules: an implicit neural unsigned distance field (UDF) that learns the preoperative bone model, and an MLP-based registration module that performs global initialization and local refinement by generating transformation hypotheses to align the intraoperative point cloud with the neural UDF. Unlike SOTA supervised methods, NeuralBoneReg operates in a self-supervised manner, without requiring inter-subject training data. We evaluated NeuralBoneReg against baseline methods on two publicly available multi-modal datasets: a CT-ultrasound dataset of the fibula and tibia (UltraBones100k) and a CT-RGB-D dataset of spinal vertebrae (SpineDepth). The evaluation also includes a newly introduced CT--ultrasound dataset of cadaveric subjects containing femur and pelvis (UltraBones-Hip), which will be made publicly available. NeuralBoneReg matches or surpasses existing methods across all datasets, achieving mean RRE/RTE of 1.68°/1.86 mm on UltraBones100k, 1.88°/1.89 mm on UltraBones-Hip, and 3.79°/2.45 mm on SpineDepth. These results demonstrate strong generalizability across anatomies and modalities, providing robust and accurate cross-modal alignment for CAOS.

Conclusion: Gen3d shows that single-image to 3D scene generation is feasible with broad generalization, enabling scalable 3D world models and high-quality view synthesis for embodied AI and related applications.

Abstract: Despite recent advancements in neural 3D reconstruction, the dependence on dense multi-view captures restricts their broader applicability. Additionally, 3D scene generation is vital for advancing embodied AI and world models, which depend on diverse, high-quality scenes for learning and evaluation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SAM-Fed introduces a federated semi-supervised learning framework that uses a high-capacity segmentation foundation model to guide lightweight clients. It employs dual knowledge distillation and an adaptive agreement mechanism to refine pixel-level supervision, improving segmentation performance in privacy-preserving settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Data privacy and labeling cost limit labeled data for medical image segmentation. Federated semi-supervised learning (FSSL) faces two challenges: pseudo-label reliability depends on local model strength, and client devices often have limited compute, requiring compact or heterogeneous architectures. These constraints degrade pseudo-label quality and stability, while large models, though accurate, are impractical for routine client-side use.

Method: SAM-Fed leverages a high-capacity segmentation foundation model to guide lightweight clients during training. It combines dual knowledge distillation with an adaptive agreement mechanism to refine pixel-level supervision.

Result: Experiments on skin lesion and polyp segmentation across both homogeneous and heterogeneous settings show that SAM-Fed consistently outperforms state-of-the-art FSSL methods.

Conclusion: A foundation-model-guided federated semi-supervised framework with dual distillation and adaptive agreement improves pseudo-label quality and segmentation performance on resource-constrained clients, enabling effective privacy-preserving medical image segmentation.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation is clinically important, yet data privacy and the cost of expert annotation limit the availability of labeled data. Federated semi-supervised learning (FSSL) offers a solution but faces two challenges: pseudo-label reliability depends on the strength of local models, and client devices often require compact or heterogeneous architectures due to limited computational resources. These constraints reduce the quality and stability of pseudo-labels, while large models, though more accurate, cannot be trained or used for routine inference on client devices. We propose SAM-Fed, a federated semi-supervised framework that leverages a high-capacity segmentation foundation model to guide lightweight clients during training. SAM-Fed combines dual knowledge distillation with an adaptive agreement mechanism to refine pixel-level supervision.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Diff-NAF: an iterative framework for ultra-sparse-view multi-source stationary CT that uses Neural Attenuation Field representation plus a dual-branch conditional diffusion model to synthesize and refine projections through angle-prior guided projection synthesis and diffusion-driven refinement, improving reconstructions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ultra-sparse-view sampling in multi-source stationary CT degrades reconstructions, with interpolation being unreliable. A robust, iterative method leveraging priors and diffusion models is needed to enhance projection completeness and image quality.

Method: Train an initial Neural Attenuation Field (NAF) from ultra-sparse projections. Generate new projections via Angle-Prior Guided Projection Synthesis using inter-view priors. Refine projections with a Diffusion-driven Reuse Projection Refinement Module. Use refined projections as pseudo-labels for the next iteration, and repeat to improve projection completeness and reconstruction fidelity.

Result: Experiments on simulated 3D CT volumes and real projection data show that Diff-NAF achieves the best performance under ultra-sparse-view conditions, yielding higher-quality reconstructions than baselines.

Conclusion: Diff-NAF effectively addresses ultra-sparse-view CT challenges by integrating NAF with a dual-branch conditional diffusion model and an iterative pseudo-label refinement loop, producing high-quality CT reconstructions in challenging sampling regimes.

Abstract: Multi-source stationary computed tomography (CT) has recently attracted attention for its ability to achieve rapid image reconstruction, making it suitable for time-sensitive clinical and industrial applications. However, practical systems are often constrained by ultra-sparse-view sampling, which significantly degrades reconstruction quality. Traditional methods struggle under ultra-sparse-view settings, where interpolation becomes inaccurate and the resulting reconstructions are unsatisfactory. To address this challenge, this study proposes Diffusion-Refined Neural Attenuation Fields (Diff-NAF), an iterative framework tailored for multi-source stationary CT under ultra-sparse-view conditions. Diff-NAF combines a Neural Attenuation Field representation with a dual-branch conditional diffusion model. The process begins by training an initial NAF using ultra-sparse-view projections. New projections are then generated through an Angle-Prior Guided Projection Synthesis strategy that exploits inter view priors, and are subsequently refined by a Diffusion-driven Reuse Projection Refinement Module. The refined projections are incorporated as pseudo-labels into the training set for the next iteration. Through iterative refinement, Diff-NAF progressively enhances projection completeness and reconstruction fidelity under ultra-sparse-view conditions, ultimately yielding high-quality CT reconstructions. Experimental results on multiple simulated 3D CT volumes and real projection data demonstrate that Diff-NAF achieves the best performance under ultra-sparse-view conditions.

*Yiyi Miao,Taoyu Wu,Tong Chen,Ji Jiang,Zhe Tang,Zhengyong Jiang,Angelos Stefanidis,Limin Yu,Jionglong Su*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Dental3R introduces a pose-free, graph-guided reconstruction pipeline for sparse intraoral photos using GAPS to select informative image pairs and a wavelet-regularized 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) objective for high-fidelity results, validated on large clinical datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Intraoral 3D reconstruction is essential for digital orthodontics but traditional intraoral scans are impractical for remote tele-orthodontics, which rely on sparse smartphone imagery. Existing 3DGS approaches struggle with unposed, sparse, and dynamically lit intraoral data, often producing over-smoothed results due to sparse-view photometric supervision.

Method: Build Geometry-Aware Pairing Strategy (GAPS) to select a compact subgraph of high-value image pairs emphasizing accurate correspondences, improving geometry initialization stability and reducing memory needs. Use recovered poses and point cloud to train 3D Gaussian Splatting with a wavelet-regularized objective that enforces band-limited fidelity via discrete wavelet transform to preserve fine enamel boundaries and interproximal edges while suppressing high-frequency artifacts.

Result: Validated on a large-scale dataset of 950 clinical cases and an additional 195 video-based cases, with results showing superior novel view synthesis for dental occlusion visualization and outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: Dental3R demonstrates robust pose-free reconstruction from sparse intraoral images by combining a principled correspondence-based graph selection (GAPS) with wavelet-regularized 3DGS optimization, enabling high-fidelity dental visualization suitable for remote tele-orthodontics.

Abstract: Intraoral 3D reconstruction is fundamental to digital orthodontics, yet conventional methods like intraoral scanning are inaccessible for remote tele-orthodontics, which typically relies on sparse smartphone imagery. While 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) shows promise for novel view synthesis, its application to the standard clinical triad of unposed anterior and bilateral buccal photographs is challenging. The large view baselines, inconsistent illumination, and specular surfaces common in intraoral settings can destabilize simultaneous pose and geometry estimation. Furthermore, sparse-view photometric supervision often induces a frequency bias, leading to over-smoothed reconstructions that lose critical diagnostic details. To address these limitations, we propose \textbf{Dental3R}, a pose-free, graph-guided pipeline for robust, high-fidelity reconstruction from sparse intraoral photographs. Our method first constructs a Geometry-Aware Pairing Strategy (GAPS) to intelligently select a compact subgraph of high-value image pairs. The GAPS focuses on correspondence matching, thereby improving the stability of the geometry initialization and reducing memory usage. Building on the recovered poses and point cloud, we train the 3DGS model with a wavelet-regularized objective. By enforcing band-limited fidelity using a discrete wavelet transform, our approach preserves fine enamel boundaries and interproximal edges while suppressing high-frequency artifacts. We validate our approach on a large-scale dataset of 950 clinical cases and an additional video-based test set of 195 cases. Experimental results demonstrate that Dental3R effectively handles sparse, unposed inputs and achieves superior novel view synthesis quality for dental occlusion visualization, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address high intrusiveness, heavy computation, and poor edge real-time performance of traditional two-stage posture methods relying on invasive sensors or heavy CV pipelines.

Method: Proposes LSP-YOLO, a lightweight adaptation with Light-C3k2 (Partial Convolution + SimAM), direct keypoint-to-class mapping via pointwise conv, and intermediate supervision; dataset of 5,000 images across six postures; evaluation on PC and SV830C+GC030A.

Conclusion: The approach offers a highly efficient, deployable solution for smart classrooms, rehabilitation, and HCI, balancing accuracy, speed, and resource usage.

Abstract: With the rise in sedentary behavior, health problems caused by poor sitting posture have drawn increasing attention. Most existing methods, whether using invasive sensors or computer vision, rely on two-stage pipelines, which result in high intrusiveness, intensive computation, and poor real-time performance on embedded edge devices. Inspired by YOLOv11-Pose, a lightweight single-stage network for sitting posture recognition on embedded edge devices termed LSP-YOLO was proposed. By integrating partial convolution(PConv) and Similarity-Aware Activation Module(SimAM), a lightweight module, Light-C3k2, was designed to reduce computational cost while maintaining feature extraction capability. In the recognition head, keypoints were directly mapped to posture classes through pointwise convolution, and intermediate supervision was employed to enable efficient fusion of pose estimation and classification. Furthermore, a dataset containing 5,000 images across six posture categories was constructed for model training and testing.

*Dongchen Han,Tianzhu Ye,Zhuofan Xia,Kaiyi Chen,Yulin Wang,Hanting Chen,Gao Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: StepsNet is a generalized residual architecture that splits features along the channel dimension and stacks blocks with increasing width to mitigate shortcut degradation and width limits, achieving broad performance gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome two main barriers in deep residual networks — shortcut degradation in very deep models and the depth–width trade-off that limits effective width — so deeper networks can better realize their theoretical capacity.

Method: Introduce Step by Step Network (StepsNet) by separating features along channels and progressively widening through stacked blocks; this macro design is adaptable to various backbone models.

Result: Extensive experiments show StepsNet consistently outperforms residual models across image classification, object detection, semantic segmentation, and language modeling.

Conclusion: StepsNet generalizes and surpasses the residual architecture, effectively unlocking deeper networks' potential.

Abstract: Scaling up network depth is a fundamental pursuit in neural architecture design, as theory suggests that deeper models offer exponentially greater capability. Benefiting from the residual connections, modern neural networks can scale up to more than one hundred layers and enjoy wide success. However, as networks continue to deepen, current architectures often struggle to realize their theoretical capacity improvements, calling for more advanced designs to further unleash the potential of deeper networks. In this paper, we identify two key barriers that obstruct residual models from scaling deeper: shortcut degradation and limited width. Shortcut degradation hinders deep-layer learning, while the inherent depth-width trade-off imposes limited width. To mitigate these issues, we propose a generalized residual architecture dubbed Step by Step Network (StepsNet) to bridge the gap between theoretical potential and practical performance of deep models. Specifically, we separate features along the channel dimension and let the model learn progressively via stacking blocks with increasing width. The resulting method mitigates the two identified problems and serves as a versatile macro design applicable to various models. Extensive experiments show that our method consistently outperforms residual models across diverse tasks, including image classification, object detection, semantic segmentation, and language modeling. These results position StepsNet as a superior generalization of the widely adopted residual architecture.

*Bohan Zhang,Yiyi Miao,Taoyu Wu,Tong Chen,Ji Jiang,Zhuoxiao Li,Zhe Tang,Limin Yu,Jionglong Su*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ArchMap is a training-free, ontology-guided framework that standardizes raw intraoral 3D scans via geometry-aware arch-flattening and uses a Dental Knowledge Base to constrain multimodal reasoning, enabling robust, device-agnostic structured dental understanding (tooth counting, partitioning, dentition-stage classification, and clinical-condition detection).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome generalization limits of deep learning on intraoral 3D data, which rely on modality-specific training, large annotated datasets, and controlled scanning, and to handle pose variation, occlusions, and lack of texture cues.

Method: 1) geometry-aware arch-flattening to produce aligned, continuity-preserving multi-view projections of 3D meshes; 2) a Dental Knowledge Base encoding hierarchical tooth ontology, dentition-stage policies, and clinical semantics to constrain symbolic reasoning; 3) training-free, geometry+ontology-guided multimodal reasoning.

Result: Validated on 1060 pre-/post-orthodontic cases, ArchMap achieved higher accuracy, reduced semantic drift, and greater stability under sparse or artifact-prone data, outperforming supervised pipelines and prompted VLM baselines in tooth counting, partitioning, dentition-stage classification, and detection of crowding, missing teeth, prosthetics, and caries.

Conclusion: A geometry-normalization plus ontology-guided multimodal reasoning approach can deliver practical, scalable, training-free structured analysis of 3D intraoral scans for modern digital orthodontics.

Abstract: A structured understanding of intraoral 3D scans is essential for digital orthodontics. However, existing deep-learning approaches rely heavily on modality-specific training, large annotated datasets, and controlled scanning conditions, which limit generalization across devices and hinder deployment in real clinical workflows. Moreover, raw intraoral meshes exhibit substantial variation in arch pose, incomplete geometry caused by occlusion or tooth contact, and a lack of texture cues, making unified semantic interpretation highly challenging. To address these limitations, we propose ArchMap, a training-free and knowledge-guided framework for robust structured dental understanding. ArchMap first introduces a geometry-aware arch-flattening module that standardizes raw 3D meshes into spatially aligned, continuity-preserving multi-view projections. We then construct a Dental Knowledge Base (DKB) encoding hierarchical tooth ontology, dentition-stage policies, and clinical semantics to constrain the symbolic reasoning space. We validate ArchMap on 1060 pre-/post-orthodontic cases, demonstrating robust performance in tooth counting, anatomical partitioning, dentition-stage classification, and the identification of clinical conditions such as crowding, missing teeth, prosthetics, and caries. Compared with supervised pipelines and prompted VLM baselines, ArchMap achieves higher accuracy, reduced semantic drift, and superior stability under sparse or artifact-prone conditions. As a fully training-free system, ArchMap demonstrates that combining geometric normalization with ontology-guided multimodal reasoning offers a practical and scalable solution for the structured analysis of 3D intraoral scans in modern digital orthodontics.

*Yiyi Miao,Taoyu Wu,Ji Jiang,Tong Chen,Zhe Tang,Zhengyong Jiang,Angelos Stefanidis,Limin Yu,Jionglong Su*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A contour-guided, pose-stable 3D-2D registration for IOS-to-cephalograms using a unified dental axis and DRR-based silhouette projections, yielding robust, interpretable alignments and outperforming traditional intensity-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cephalometric registration suffers from projective magnification, geometric distortion, low-contrast dental crowns, and acquisition variability, causing unstable, implausible alignments and convergence failures. A stable initialization and interpretable silhouette-based approach are needed.

Method: 1) Build a U-Midline Dental Axis (UMDA) to establish a unified cross-arch coordinate system. 2) Generate radiograph-like projections using a surface-based DRR with coronal-axis perspective and Gaussian splatting to preserve magnification and emphasize external silhouettes. 3) Register via a 2D similarity transform optimized with a symmetric bidirectional Chamfer distance under a hierarchical coarse-to-fine schedule.

Result: Evaluated on 34 expert-annotated clinical cases, showing substantial reductions in landmark error (notably at posterior teeth) and tighter dispersion on the lower jaw. Achieved low Chamfer distances and controlled Hausdorff distances at the curve level, indicating robust silhouette-to-contour alignment.

Conclusion: DentalSCR robustly handles real-world cephalograms, delivering high-fidelity, clinically inspectable 3D–2D alignment and outperforming conventional baselines.

Abstract: Reliable 3D-2D alignment between intraoral scan (IOS) models and lateral cephalometric radiographs is critical for orthodontic diagnosis, yet conventional intensity-driven registration methods struggle under real clinical conditions, where cephalograms exhibit projective magnification, geometric distortion, low-contrast dental crowns, and acquisition-dependent variation. These factors hinder the stability of appearance-based similarity metrics and often lead to convergence failures or anatomically implausible alignments. To address these limitations, we propose DentalSCR, a pose-stable, contour-guided framework for accurate and interpretable silhouette-to-contour registration. Our method first constructs a U-Midline Dental Axis (UMDA) to establish a unified cross-arch anatomical coordinate system, thereby stabilizing initialization and standardizing projection geometry across cases. Using this reference frame, we generate radiograph-like projections via a surface-based DRR formulation with coronal-axis perspective and Gaussian splatting, which preserves clinical source-object-detector magnification and emphasizes external silhouettes. Registration is then formulated as a 2D similarity transform optimized with a symmetric bidirectional Chamfer distance under a hierarchical coarse-to-fine schedule, enabling both large capture range and subpixel-level contour agreement. We evaluate DentalSCR on 34 expert-annotated clinical cases. Experimental results demonstrate substantial reductions in landmark error-particularly at posterior teeth-tighter dispersion on the lower jaw, and low Chamfer and controlled Hausdorff distances at the curve level. These findings indicate that DentalSCR robustly handles real-world cephalograms and delivers high-fidelity, clinically inspectable 3D--2D alignment, outperforming conventional baselines.

*Junfu Pu,Teng Wang,Yixiao Ge,Yuying Ge,Chen Li,Ying Shan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ARC-Chapter is a first large-scale bilingual video chaptering model trained on 1M+ long video chapters with multi-level, temporally grounded annotations, introducing GRACE as a better-fit evaluation metric. It achieves state-of-the-art results and shows strong transfer to dense video captioning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long-form videos (lectures, documentaries) are increasingly prevalent, but existing chaptering methods rely on small, coarse annotations that do not generalize well to nuanced transitions in long videos.

Method: Curate a bilingual English–Chinese chapter dataset by unifying ASR transcripts, scene texts, and visual captions into multi-level annotations from short titles to long summaries; train ARC-Chapter; propose GRACE (many-to-one overlaps and semantic similarity) as a new evaluation metric; demonstrate data- and label-intensity scaling.

Result: ARC-Chapter achieves clear gains with data scaling, outperforming the previous best by 14.0% in F1 and 11.3% in SODA; demonstrates strong transferability, improving state-of-the-art on YouCook2 dense video captioning.

Conclusion:  ARC-Chapter establishes a new state-of-the-art in long-video chaptering, with data-scale and a semantics-aware GRACE metric better reflecting real-world versatility; the approach transfers effectively to related tasks such as dense video captioning.

Abstract: The proliferation of hour-long videos (e.g., lectures, podcasts, documentaries) has intensified demand for efficient content structuring. However, existing approaches are constrained by small-scale training with annotations that are typical short and coarse, restricting generalization to nuanced transitions in long videos. We introduce ARC-Chapter, the first large-scale video chaptering model trained on over million-level long video chapters, featuring bilingual, temporally grounded, and hierarchical chapter annotations. To achieve this goal, we curated a bilingual English-Chinese chapter dataset via a structured pipeline that unifies ASR transcripts, scene texts, visual captions into multi-level annotations, from short title to long summaries. We demonstrate clear performance improvements with data scaling, both in data volume and label intensity. Moreover, we design a new evaluation metric termed GRACE, which incorporates many-to-one segment overlaps and semantic similarity, better reflecting real-world chaptering flexibility. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ARC-Chapter establishes a new state-of-the-art by a significant margin, outperforming the previous best by 14.0% in F1 score and 11.3% in SODA score. Moreover, ARC-Chapter shows excellent transferability, improving the state-of-the-art on downstream tasks like dense video captioning on YouCook2.

*Hoang Chuong Nguyen,Wei Mao,Jose M. Alvarez,Miaomiao Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Image-Based Gaussian Splatting augments 3D Gaussian Splatting by adding per-pixel color residuals inferred from neighboring training views, using high-resolution source images to capture fine detail and view-dependent effects without increasing storage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) is limited by low-degree spherical harmonics, which struggle to model spatially varying color and view-dependent effects like specular highlights. Global textures risk underfitting complex scenes, while per-Gaussian textures incur high storage. The paper seeks an efficient, high-fidelity alternative.

Method: Render each pixel color as a sum of a base color from standard 3DGS rendering and a learned residual inferred from neighboring training images, leveraging high-resolution source images to capture fine details and view-specific color variations.

Result: On standard NVS benchmarks, the approach significantly outperforms prior Gaussian Splatting methods in rendering quality without increasing storage footprint.

Conclusion: The method delivers higher-quality renderings with accurate view-dependent effects by using image-based residuals tied to high-resolution source images, all without extra storage cost.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently emerged as a fast, high-quality method for novel view synthesis (NVS). However, its use of low-degree spherical harmonics limits its ability to capture spatially varying color and view-dependent effects such as specular highlights. Existing works augment Gaussians with either a global texture map, which struggles with complex scenes, or per-Gaussian texture maps, which introduces high storage overhead. We propose Image-Based Gaussian Splatting, an efficient alternative that leverages high-resolution source images for fine details and view-specific color modeling. Specifically, we model each pixel color as a combination of a base color from standard 3DGS rendering and a learned residual inferred from neighboring training images. This promotes accurate surface alignment and enables rendering images of high-frequency details and accurate view-dependent effects. Experiments on standard NVS benchmarks show that our method significantly outperforms prior Gaussian Splatting approaches in rendering quality, without increasing the storage footprint.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A mobile app (Bapp) for real-time, on-device blink analysis shows high accuracy (98.3% overall) and precision (98.4%) on 45 patient videos, validated against expert ground truth, enabling objective, portable ocular surface monitoring.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing blink assessment tools are expensive and clinically impractical. There is a need for an accessible, objective, on-device solution to quantify eyelid movements for routine monitoring and postoperative evaluation.

Method: Developed Bapp using Flutter with Google ML Kit for on-device real-time eyelid analysis. Validated on 45 videos with ophthalmology specialists annotating ground truth. Evaluated using Precision, Recall, and F1-Score (and overall accuracy).

Result: Bapp achieved 98.4% precision, 96.9% recall, and 98.3% overall accuracy in blink detection against expert annotations, indicating high reliability for monitoring both normal and abnormal eyelid movements.

Conclusion: Bapp offers a portable, accessible, and objective alternative to manual blink counting, supporting continuous ocular health monitoring and postoperative assessment in clinical settings.

Abstract: Blinking is a vital physiological process that protects and maintains the health of the ocular surface. Objective assessment of eyelid movements remains challenging due to the complexity, cost, and limited clinical applicability of existing tools. This study presents the clinical validation of Bapp (Blink Application), a mobile application developed using the Flutter framework and integrated with Google ML Kit for on-device, real-time analysis of eyelid movements. The validation occurred using 45 videos from real patients, whose blinks were manually annotated by ophthalmology specialists from the Paulista School of Medicine of the Federal University of Sao Paulo (EPM-UNIFESP) to serve as the ground truth. Bapp's performance was evaluated using standard metrics, including Precision, Recall, and F1-Score, with results demonstrating 98.4% precision, 96.9% recall, and an overall accuracy of 98.3%. These outcomes confirm the reliability of Bapp as a portable, accessible, and objective tool for monitoring both normal and abnormal eyelid movements. The application offers a promising alternative to traditional manual blink counting, supporting continuous ocular health monitoring and postoperative evaluation in clinical environments.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduces SketchVCL and O3SLM: a large-scale image-sketch-instruction dataset and a vision-language model trained on it, achieving state-of-the-art results on sketch-based tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LVLMs struggle with abstract inputs like hand-drawn sketches due to a lack of joint sketch-photo-language data. The work aims to bridge this gap by providing a large-scale dataset that pairs sketches, real images, and natural language instructions to enhance sketch comprehension and reasoning in LVLMs.

Method: (1) Construct SketchVCL, a large image-sketch-instruction triplet dataset for pretraining and instruction tuning, combining existing sketch datasets (QuickDraw!, Sketchy, Tu Berlin) with their own generated data. (2) Train O3SLM, an LVLM on this dataset and evaluate on sketch-based tasks including object localization, counting, image retrieval (SBIR and fine-grained SBIR), and VQA.

Result: O3SLM achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple sketch-based tasks and substantially outperforms existing LVLMs in sketch comprehension and reasoning across the evaluated benchmarks.

Conclusion: Providing a large-scale, richly annotated sketch dataset and an LVLM trained on it significantly improves abstract-visual-understanding capabilities in LVLMs, enabling better sketch interpretation, localization, counting, retrieval, and VQA. This work paves the way for future exploration into more diverse sketch modalities and instruction-following capabilities.

Abstract: While Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) are increasingly deployed in real-world applications, their ability to interpret abstract visual inputs remains limited. Specifically, they struggle to comprehend hand-drawn sketches, a modality that offers an intuitive means of expressing concepts that are difficult to describe textually. We identify the primary bottleneck as the absence of a large-scale dataset that jointly models sketches, photorealistic images, and corresponding natural language instructions. To address this, we present two key contributions: (1) a new, large-scale dataset of image-sketch-instruction triplets designed to facilitate both pretraining and instruction tuning, and (2) O3SLM, an LVLM trained on this dataset. Comprehensive evaluations on multiple sketch-based tasks: (a) object localization, (b) counting, (c) image retrieval i.e., (SBIR and fine-grained SBIR), and (d) visual question answering (VQA); while incorporating the three existing sketch datasets, namely QuickDraw!, Sketchy, and Tu Berlin, along with our generated SketchVCL dataset, show that O3SLM achieves state-of-the-art performance, substantially outperforming existing LVLMs in sketch comprehension and reasoning.

*Xiaolin Wang,Houzhang Fang,Qingshan Li,Lu Wang,Yi Chang,Luxin Yan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Joint Feature-Domain Deblurring and Detection (JFD3) proposes a dual-branch, end-to-end architecture that uses a lightweight restoration network and a frequency structure guidance module to enhance feature representations for infrared UAV detection under motion blur, with a feature-consistency self-supervised loss and a new IRBlurUAV benchmark; achieves superior detection with real-time efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Infrared UAV target images suffer from motion blur which degrades discriminative features and hinders detection. Traditional deblurring focuses on visual quality rather than task-relevant feature enhancement, motivating a framework that jointly improves deblurring and detection features.

Method: A dual-branch network with shared weights where the clear branch guides the blurred branch via a lightweight feature restoration network and feature-level supervision. Introduces a frequency structure guidance module to refine the restoration-derived structure priors and injects them into shallow detection layers. Applies a feature consistency self-supervised loss between the two detection backbones to align blurred features to the clear branch.

Result: On the IRBlurUAV benchmark (30,000 simulated + 4,118 real infrared UAV images), JFD3 achieves superior detection performance while maintaining real-time efficiency.

Conclusion: A joint, task-oriented approach can substantially improve detection under motion blur by leveraging cross-branch feature supervision, structure-guided restoration, and self-supervised feature alignment, validated on a realistic IR UAV dataset.

Abstract: Infrared unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) target images often suffer from motion blur degradation caused by rapid sensor movement, significantly reducing contrast between target and background. Generally, detection performance heavily depends on the discriminative feature representation between target and background. Existing methods typically treat deblurring as a preprocessing step focused on visual quality, while neglecting the enhancement of task-relevant features crucial for detection. Improving feature representation for detection under blur conditions remains challenging. In this paper, we propose a novel Joint Feature-Domain Deblurring and Detection end-to-end framework, dubbed JFD3. We design a dual-branch architecture with shared weights, where the clear branch guides the blurred branch to enhance discriminative feature representation. Specifically, we first introduce a lightweight feature restoration network, where features from the clear branch serve as feature-level supervision to guide the blurred branch, thereby enhancing its distinctive capability for detection. We then propose a frequency structure guidance module that refines the structure prior from the restoration network and integrates it into shallow detection layers to enrich target structural information. Finally, a feature consistency self-supervised loss is imposed between the dual-branch detection backbones, driving the blurred branch to approximate the feature representations of the clear one. Wealso construct a benchmark, named IRBlurUAV, containing 30,000 simulated and 4,118 real infrared UAV target images with diverse motion blur. Extensive experiments on IRBlurUAV demonstrate that JFD3 achieves superior detection performance while maintaining real-time efficiency.

*Alfonso Pedro Ridao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A lightweight Shoulder Presentation Evaluation (SPE) that quantifies shoulder yaw and roll from two shoulder landmarks' 3D coordinates; correlates with human labels (r ≈ 0.80) on 121 images and supports automated compliance filtering for enrolment systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standards require square shoulder presentation; prior automated QA lacks quantitative measures for this attribute; need a simple, model-free metric using readily available pose data.

Method: Compute yaw and roll from 3D shoulder landmark coordinates provided by common pose estimation frameworks; develop SPE algorithm; evaluate on 121 portrait images.

Result: SPE scores correlate with human labels with Pearson r ≈ 0.80; adapted Error-versus-Discard analysis shows effective filtering of non-compliant samples.

Conclusion: SPE is a viable lightweight tool for automated compliance checking in enrolment systems.

Abstract: International standards for biometric identity documents mandate strict compliance with pose requirements, including the square presentation of a subject's shoulders. However, the literature on automated quality assessment offers few quantitative methods for evaluating this specific attribute. This paper proposes a Shoulder Presentation Evaluation (SPE) algorithm to address this gap. The method quantifies shoulder yaw and roll using only the 3D coordinates of two shoulder landmarks provided by common pose estimation frameworks. The algorithm was evaluated on a dataset of 121 portrait images. The resulting SPE scores demonstrated a strong Pearson correlation (r approx. 0.80) with human-assigned labels. An analysis of the metric's filtering performance, using an adapted Error-versus-Discard methodology, confirmed its utility in identifying non-compliant samples. The proposed algorithm is a viable lightweight tool for automated compliance checking in enrolment systems.

*Kangqiao Zhao,Shuo Huai,Xurui Song,Jun Luo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Texture-enabled 3D physical adversarial examples can fool stereo depth models in autonomous driving using a global camouflage texture, a 3D rendering module, and a merging optimization to achieve cross-view stealthy depth manipulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning-based perception in autonomous driving is vulnerable to adversarial inputs, but most attacks target 2D patches or monocular systems. Stereo depth estimation remains under-explored and risks from cross-view, realistic adversaries.

Method: Develop a 3D PAE with a global camouflage texture (not a 2D patch). Introduce a 3D stereo matching rendering module to align the PAE with real-world positions/headings. Propose a merging attack with fine-grained optimization to seamlessly blend the PAE into the environment across viewpoints.

Result: Extensive evaluations demonstrate that the proposed PAEs reliably cause stereo models to output erroneous depth across viewpoints, outperforming existing hiding attacks in stealth and effectiveness.

Conclusion: The work proves the feasibility and stealth of texture-enabled 3D PAEs against stereo depth estimation in autonomous driving, highlighting a security risk in depth sensors and motivating the development of defenses.

Abstract: Though deep neural models adopted to realize the perception of autonomous driving have proven vulnerable to adversarial examples, known attacks often leverage 2D patches and target mostly monocular perception. Therefore, the effectiveness of Physical Adversarial Examples (PAEs) on stereo-based binocular depth estimation remains largely unexplored. To this end, we propose the first texture-enabled physical adversarial attack against stereo matching models in the context of autonomous driving. Our method employs a 3D PAE with global camouflage texture rather than a local 2D patch-based one, ensuring both visual consistency and attack effectiveness across different viewpoints of stereo cameras. To cope with the disparity effect of these cameras, we also propose a new 3D stereo matching rendering module that allows the PAE to be aligned with real-world positions and headings in binocular vision. We further propose a novel merging attack that seamlessly blends the target into the environment through fine-grained PAE optimization. It has significantly enhanced stealth and lethality upon existing hiding attacks that fail to get seamlessly merged into the background. Extensive evaluations show that our PAEs can successfully fool the stereo models into producing erroneous depth information.

TL;DR: TLS-Assist adds a modular redundancy layer to LLM-based autonomous driving that injects explicit traffic light and sign detections as natural-language prompts, improving driving performance and reducing infractions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-driven driving agents lack explicit mechanisms to enforce traffic rules and struggle to reliably detect small, safety-critical objects like traffic lights and signs, risking unsafe decisions.

Method: A plug-and-play, model-agnostic redundancy layer that converts detections into structured natural language messages injected into the LLM input. Supports both single-view and multi-view cameras and evaluates on CARLA's LangAuto benchmark.

Result: Driving performance improvements up to 14% over LMDrive and 7% over BEVDriver, with consistent reductions in traffic light and sign infractions.

Conclusion: TLS-Assist demonstrates that explicit, language-based incorporation of perception cues can enhance safety and performance of LLM-based autonomous driving systems, in a modular and cross-view-compatible manner; code and models released.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used for decision-making and planning in autonomous driving, showing promising reasoning capabilities and potential to generalize across diverse traffic situations. However, current LLM-based driving agents lack explicit mechanisms to enforce traffic rules and often struggle to reliably detect small, safety-critical objects such as traffic lights and signs. To address this limitation, we introduce TLS-Assist, a modular redundancy layer that augments LLM-based autonomous driving agents with explicit traffic light and sign recognition. TLS-Assist converts detections into structured natural language messages that are injected into the LLM input, enforcing explicit attention to safety-critical cues. The framework is plug-and-play, model-agnostic, and supports both single-view and multi-view camera setups. We evaluate TLS-Assist in a closed-loop setup on the LangAuto benchmark in CARLA. The results demonstrate relative driving performance improvements of up to 14% over LMDrive and 7% over BEVDriver, while consistently reducing traffic light and sign infractions. We publicly release the code and models on https://github.com/iis-esslingen/TLS-Assist.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BEDLAM2.0 extends BEDLAM with richer camera motions, varied body shapes, clothing, hair, environments, and adds shoes, providing ground-truth parameters and assets to improve training for world-coordinate 3D human motion; it yields better accuracy than BEDLAM on world-coordinate tasks and is released with extensive resources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Inferring 3D human motion in world coordinates is challenging, especially with concurrent camera motion, and existing datasets lack diverse realism and ground-truth for world-coordinate estimates (e.g., missing shoes). A richer, well-annotated dataset is needed to train robust regressor models.

Method: Dataset creation and release: extend BEDLAM with more diverse cameras and motions, broader body shapes, clothing, hair, and 3D environments; add shoes; render videos; provide ground-truth body parameters and camera motions; supply 3D assets and links; evaluate across state-of-the-art methods.

Result: BEDLAM2.0 significantly improves accuracy over BEDLAM for training methods that estimate humans in world coordinates; the paper demonstrates this by comparing state-of-the-art models trained on both datasets and showing gains; resources including rendered videos, ground-truth parameters, and camera motions are released.

Conclusion: BEDLAM2.0 is a superior resource for training 3D human pose and motion regressors, especially for world-coordinate estimation, addressing data diversity gaps and enabling broader research through data and asset releases.

Abstract: Inferring 3D human motion from video remains a challenging problem with many applications. While traditional methods estimate the human in image coordinates, many applications require human motion to be estimated in world coordinates. This is particularly challenging when there is both human and camera motion. Progress on this topic has been limited by the lack of rich video data with ground truth human and camera movement. We address this with BEDLAM2.0, a new dataset that goes beyond the popular BEDLAM dataset in important ways. In addition to introducing more diverse and realistic cameras and camera motions, BEDLAM2.0 increases diversity and realism of body shape, motions, clothing, hair, and 3D environments. Additionally, it adds shoes, which were missing in BEDLAM. BEDLAM has become a key resource for training 3D human pose and motion regressors today and we show that BEDLAM2.0 is significantly better, particularly for training methods that estimate humans in world coordinates. We compare state-of-the art methods trained on BEDLAM and BEDLAM2.0, and find that BEDLAM2.0 significantly improves accuracy over BEDLAM. For research purposes, we provide the rendered videos, ground truth body parameters, and camera motions. We also provide the 3D assets to which we have rights and links to those from third parties.

### [99] [Language as an Anchor: Preserving Relative Visual Geometry for Domain Incremental Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14401)
*Shuyi Geng,Tao Zhou,Yi Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LAVA introduces a language-anchored visual alignment for domain incremental learning, using a text-based anchor to preserve relative geometry across domains, addressing both inter-domain interference and knowledge fragmentation, with strong empirical gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In domain incremental learning, distributions shift across domains. Projecting all domains into a single space risks semantic distortion and interference, while isolating domain-specific parameters causes knowledge fragmentation. A method is needed to preserve cross-domain semantic relationships and enable knowledge reuse.

Method: LAVA replaces direct feature alignment with relative alignment driven by a text-based reference anchor. It uses class-name semantics to define pairwise similarities and enforces the visual representations of each domain to maintain a consistent relative geometry that mirrors these semantic relations, serving as a bridge for cross-domain knowledge transfer and robust feature aggregation.

Result: Extensive experiments on standard DIL benchmarks show significant performance improvements over state-of-the-art methods, validating the effectiveness of the language-anchored alignment approach. The authors provide public code for reproducibility.

Conclusion: Language-anchored visual alignment provides a principled way to bridge domains in DIL by preserving relative semantic structure through a text-based anchor, enabling knowledge reuse and reducing forgetting across domains.

Abstract: A key challenge in Domain Incremental Learning (DIL) is to continually learn under shifting distributions while preserving knowledge from previous domains. Existing methods face a fundamental dilemma. On one hand, projecting all domains into a single unified visual space leads to inter-domain interference and semantic distortion, as large shifts may vary with not only visual appearance but also underlying semantics. On the other hand, isolating domain-specific parameters causes knowledge fragmentation, creating "knowledge islands" that hamper knowledge reuse and exacerbate forgetting. To address this issue, we propose LAVA (Language-Anchored Visual Alignment), a novel DIL framework that replaces direct feature alignment with relative alignment driven by a text-based reference anchor. LAVA guides the visual representations of each incoming domain to preserve a consistent relative geometry, which is defined by mirroring the pairwise semantic similarities between the class names. This anchored geometric structure acts as a bridge across domains, enabling the retrieval of class-aware prior knowledge and facilitating robust feature aggregation. Extensive experiments on standard DIL benchmarks demonstrate that LAVA achieves significant performance improvements over state-of-the-arts. Code is available at https://github.com/ShuyiGeng/LAVA.

*Ravi Shankar Prasad,Nandani Sharma,Dinesh Singh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A framework Cranio-ID for automatic landmark annotation on 2D skull X-rays and cross-modal skull-to-face/ sketch-to-face matching using YOLO-pose, graph representations, cross-attention, and optimal transport, validated on S2F and CUHK datasets, showing improved reliability and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Craniometric landmarking is important in forensic and biomedical contexts but current manual methods are slow and specialized; automatic methods lack robust large-scale validation and cross-domain reliability.

Method: Automatic landmark annotation on 2D skulls using YOLO-pose models linked to optical images; represent landmarks as graphs; perform cross-modal matching via cross-attention and optimal transport to establish semantic correspondences between skull and face/sketch modalities.

Result: Validated on S2F and CUHK datasets with extensive experiments showing significant improvements in reliability and accuracy; effective in cross-domain skull-to-face and sketch-to-face matching in forensic applications.

Conclusion: Cranio-ID advances automatic landmark labeling and cross-modal matching in forensic craniofacial identification, enabling more reliable skull-to-face and sketch-to-face matching; further work needed on robustness, generalizability, and reproducibility.

Abstract: In forensic craniofacial identification and in many biomedical applications, craniometric landmarks are important. Traditional methods for locating landmarks are time-consuming and require specialized knowledge and expertise. Current methods utilize superimposition and deep learning-based methods that employ automatic annotation of landmarks. However, these methods are not reliable due to insufficient large-scale validation studies. In this paper, we proposed a novel framework Cranio-ID: First, an automatic annotation of landmarks on 2D skulls (which are X-ray scans of faces) with their respective optical images using our trained YOLO-pose models. Second, cross-modal matching by formulating these landmarks into graph representations and then finding semantic correspondence between graphs of these two modalities using cross-attention and optimal transport framework. Our proposed framework is validated on the S2F and CUHK datasets (CUHK dataset resembles with S2F dataset). Extensive experiments have been conducted to evaluate the performance of our proposed framework, which demonstrates significant improvements in both reliability and accuracy, as well as its effectiveness in cross-domain skull-to-face and sketch-to-face matching in forensic science.

*Hong Gao,Yiming Bao,Xuezhen Tu,Yutong Xu,Yue Jin,Yiyang Mu,Bin Zhong,Linan Yue,Min-Ling Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AVI is a training-free framework for video understanding that adds iterative, human-like reasoning (Retrieve-Perceive-Review) and a structured asset—entity-graph based knowledge base with multi-granularity tools—implemented via an open-source ensemble of reasoning LLMs and lightweight CV/VL models. It claims competitive results and improved interpretability without proprietary APIs or RL training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Video understanding benefits from iterative evidence gathering and reasoning beyond single-pass VLMs. Existing agent-based approaches either rely on expensive proprietary models or require costly RL training, limiting accessibility and reproducibility.

Method: Introduce a three-phase reasoning process (Retrieve-Perceive-Review); build a structured video knowledge base using entity graphs and integrated tools; assemble an open-source model ensemble combining reasoning LLMs with lightweight base CV models and VLMs; run training-free experiments across standard benchmarks.

Result: Competitive performance on LVBench, VideoMME-Long, LongVideoBench, and Charades-STA; enhanced interpretability due to explicit reasoning phases and transparent tool usage; no reliance on proprietary APIs or RL training.

Conclusion: AVI offers a flexible, training-free, and interpretable framework for video intelligence that can achieve competitive results by leveraging a modular, human-inspired reasoning protocol and an open-source ensemble of models.

Abstract: Video understanding requires not only visual recognition but also complex reasoning. While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) demonstrate impressive capabilities, they typically process videos largely in a single-pass manner with limited support for evidence revisit and iterative refinement. While recently emerging agent-based methods enable long-horizon reasoning, they either depend heavily on expensive proprietary models or require extensive agentic RL training. To overcome these limitations, we propose Agentic Video Intelligence (AVI), a flexible and training-free framework that can mirror human video comprehension through system-level design and optimization. AVI introduces three key innovations: (1) a human-inspired three-phase reasoning process (Retrieve-Perceive-Review) that ensures both sufficient global exploration and focused local analysis, (2) a structured video knowledge base organized through entity graphs, along with multi-granularity integrated tools, constituting the agent's interaction environment, and (3) an open-source model ensemble combining reasoning LLMs with lightweight base CV models and VLM, eliminating dependence on proprietary APIs or RL training. Experiments on LVBench, VideoMME-Long, LongVideoBench, and Charades-STA demonstrate that AVI achieves competitive performance while offering superior interpretability.

*Yusen Cai,Bhargava Satya Nunna,Qing Lin,Mengmi Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A self-supervised learning pipeline inspired by infant vision (CATDiet and CombDiet) improves robustness and depth perception by training on staged visual diets derived from object-centric videos; results show developmental-like neural and behavioral patterns and strong out-of-domain generalization; code will be released.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Explore whether infant-like staged visual input (grayscale→color, blur→sharp, maintained temporal continuity) can guide SSL to develop robust, human-like visual understanding, and whether combining such diets (CombDiet) further enhances transfer and depth cues.

Method: Train SSL models on object-centric videos using three constraints simultaneously (C: grayscale-to-color, A: blur-to-sharp, T: preserved temporal continuity) to form CATDiet. Evaluate across ten datasets on clean/corrupted recognition, texture-shape cues, silhouette/depth tasks, and visual cliff. Build CombDiet by initializing SSL with CATDiet and continuing standard training, using either object-centric or head-mounted infant videos.

Result: CATDiet variants improve robustness in object recognition though trained only on object-centric videos. Models exhibit development-like neural plasticity patterns and infant-like visual cliff behaviors. CombDiet initializes from CATDiet and outperforms standard SSL on in-domain/out-of-domain recognition and depth perception, across data sources.

Conclusion: The developmental progression of early infant visual experience offers a powerful reverse-engineering framework for robust visual intelligence in machines, with potential practical benefits and a commitment to releasing code, data, and models.

Abstract: Newborns perceive the world with low-acuity, color-degraded, and temporally continuous vision, which gradually sharpens as infants develop. To explore the ecological advantages of such staged "visual diets", we train self-supervised learning (SSL) models on object-centric videos under constraints that simulate infant vision: grayscale-to-color (C), blur-to-sharp (A), and preserved temporal continuity (T)-collectively termed CATDiet. For evaluation, we establish a comprehensive benchmark across ten datasets, covering clean and corrupted image recognition, texture-shape cue conflict tests, silhouette recognition, depth-order classification, and the visual cliff paradigm. All CATDiet variants demonstrate enhanced robustness in object recognition, despite being trained solely on object-centric videos. Remarkably, models also exhibit biologically aligned developmental patterns, including neural plasticity changes mirroring synaptic density in macaque V1 and behaviors resembling infants' visual cliff responses. Building on these insights, CombDiet initializes SSL with CATDiet before standard training while preserving temporal continuity. Trained on object-centric or head-mounted infant videos, CombDiet outperforms standard SSL on both in-domain and out-of-domain object recognition and depth perception. Together, these results suggest that the developmental progression of early infant visual experience offers a powerful reverse-engineering framework for understanding the emergence of robust visual intelligence in machines. All code, data, and models will be publicly released.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DIR-TIR uses a dialog-driven, two-module approach to interactive image retrieval, progressively refining target searches via a Dialog Refiner and an Image Refiner, outperforming description-only baselines through multi-turn dialogue.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance controllability and fault tolerance in interactive image retrieval by leveraging multi-turn dialogue to reduce the visual-semantic gap between user intent and retrieved images, addressing limitations of single-query methods.

Method: DIR-TIR comprises two specialized modules: (1) Dialog Refiner, which actively queries the user to extract essential information and produce increasingly precise target-image descriptions, and (2) Image Refiner, which detects perceptual gaps between generated images and user intent and guides refinement. The system uses multi-turn dialogues to progressively narrow the search.

Result: Empirical evaluation on diverse image datasets shows substantial improvements over initial-description-only baselines. The integrated dialog and image refinement modules yield higher retrieval precision and a more engaging interactive experience.

Conclusion: DIR-TIR achieves superior controllability and fault tolerance, delivering higher target image hit accuracy by systematically refining the search through dialogue-based interaction.

Abstract: This paper addresses the task of interactive, conversational text-to-image retrieval.
  Our DIR-TIR framework progressively refines the target image search through two specialized modules: the Dialog Refiner Module and the Image Refiner Module.
  The Dialog Refiner actively queries users to extract essential information and generate increasingly precise descriptions of the target image.
  Complementarily, the Image Refiner identifies perceptual gaps between generated images and user intentions, strategically reducing the visual-semantic discrepancy. By leveraging multi-turn dialogues, DIR-TIR provides superior controllability and fault tolerance compared to conventional single-query methods, significantly improving target image hit accuracy.
  Comprehensive experiments across diverse image datasets demonstrate our dialogue-based approach substantially outperforms initial-description-only baselines, while the synergistic module integration achieves both higher retrieval precision and enhanced interactive experience.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A complex-valued, end-to-end fusion framework (CompEvent) for low-light video deblurring using event cameras and RGB frames, featuring a Complex Temporal Alignment GRU and a Complex Space-Frequency Learning module for holistic spatiotemporal fusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address severe low-light and motion-blur in video deblurring by leveraging event cameras. Existing fusion methods are staged and limited, lacking holistic full-process fusion across modalities.

Method: Two components: (1) Complex Temporal Alignment GRU with complex-valued convolutions that iteratively align and fuse video and event streams; (2) Complex Space-Frequency Learning module performing unified complex-valued processing in spatial and frequency domains to enable deep fusion.

Result: CompEvent outperforms state-of-the-art methods on low-light video deblurring tasks; code is available at the provided GitHub link.

Conclusion: Holistic, complex-valued fusion enables stronger joint restoration by maximizing complementary learning between RGB frames and event data, validating full-process fusion for low-light deblurring.

Abstract: Low-light video deblurring poses significant challenges in applications like nighttime surveillance and autonomous driving due to dim lighting and long exposures. While event cameras offer potential solutions with superior low-light sensitivity and high temporal resolution, existing fusion methods typically employ staged strategies, limiting their effectiveness against combined low-light and motion blur degradations. To overcome this, we propose CompEvent, a complex neural network framework enabling holistic full-process fusion of event data and RGB frames for enhanced joint restoration. CompEvent features two core components: 1) Complex Temporal Alignment GRU, which utilizes complex-valued convolutions and processes video and event streams iteratively via GRU to achieve temporal alignment and continuous fusion; and 2) Complex Space-Frequency Learning module, which performs unified complex-valued signal processing in both spatial and frequency domains, facilitating deep fusion through spatial structures and system-level characteristics. By leveraging the holistic representation capability of complex-valued neural networks, CompEvent achieves full-process spatiotemporal fusion, maximizes complementary learning between modalities, and significantly strengthens low-light video deblurring capability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CompEvent outperforms SOTA methods in addressing this challenging task. The code is available at https://github.com/YuXie1/CompEvent.

*Bayu Adhi Tama,Jianwu Wang,Vandana Janeja,Mostafa Cham*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A physics-guided residual learning framework improves subglacial bed thickness reconstruction by predicting residuals over a BedMachine prior using a DeepLabV3+-based decoder with physics-informed losses; it shows strong generalization and outperforms standard CNN baselines in Greenland subregions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Radar-derived subglacial bed topography is sparse and uneven, hindering ice-sheet modeling. A method that leverages a reliable prior (BedMachine) together with physics-based constraints can produce accurate, coherent beds, robust to domain shifts.

Method: A DeepLabV3+ decoder over a ResNet-50 backbone predicts bed-thickness residuals relative to a BedMachine prior. Training uses lightweight physics terms: multi-scale mass conservation, flow-aligned total variation, Laplacian damping, non-negativity of thickness, ramped prior-consistency, and a masked Huber fit to radar picks modulated by a confidence map. Evaluation employs leakage-safe blockwise hold-outs (vertical/horizontal) with safety buffers, reporting metrics on held-out cores. Experiments on two Greenland sub-regions compare against U-Net, Attention U-Net, FPN, and a plain CNN.

Result: The proposed approach achieves strong test-core accuracy and high structural fidelity, outperforming the listed baselines. The residual-over-prior design, when combined with physics, yields spatially coherent, physically plausible bed reconstructions suitable for operational mapping under domain shifts.

Conclusion: Physics-guided residual learning over a BedMachine prior is effective for subglacial bed reconstruction, delivering robust generalization and superior performance while maintaining spatial coherence and physical plausibility.

Abstract: Accurate subglacial bed topography is essential for ice sheet modeling, yet radar observations are sparse and uneven. We propose a physics-guided residual learning framework that predicts bed thickness residuals over a BedMachine prior and reconstructs bed from the observed surface. A DeepLabV3+ decoder over a standard encoder (e.g.,ResNet-50) is trained with lightweight physics and data terms: multi-scale mass conservation, flow-aligned total variation, Laplacian damping, non-negativity of thickness, a ramped prior-consistency term, and a masked Huber fit to radar picks modulated by a confidence map. To measure real-world generalization, we adopt leakage-safe blockwise hold-outs (vertical/horizontal) with safety buffers and report metrics only on held-out cores. Across two Greenland sub-regions, our approach achieves strong test-core accuracy and high structural fidelity, outperforming U-Net, Attention U-Net, FPN, and a plain CNN. The residual-over-prior design, combined with physics, yields spatially coherent, physically plausible beds suitable for operational mapping under domain shift.

*Miao Shang,Xiaopeng Hong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GST introduces Gaussian Spatial Transport to map image-space probabilities to annotation maps using Gaussian splatting; avoids iterative transport computation; improves efficiency; validated on crowd counting and landmark detection; code released.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current optimal-transport-based transport in computer vision tasks often requires iterative computation of a transport plan, which is computationally expensive and difficult to integrate into standard network training. There's a need for a faster, end-to-end-compatible transport mechanism between image probability measures and annotation maps.

Method: Use Gaussian splatting to estimate pixel-annotation correspondence and derive a transport plan from Bayesian probability. Incorporate the resulting transport plan into network optimization via a loss function that measures discrepancy after transport, thereby avoiding iterative transport plan computation during training.

Result: GST eliminates iterative transport plan computation and significantly improves training efficiency while maintaining effectiveness. Extensive experiments on crowd counting and landmark detection validate the approach.

Conclusion: GST provides a practical, efficient framework to transport probability measures from image spaces to annotation spaces within standard CV training loops and can be readily applied to tasks like crowd counting and landmark detection; code is available at the project URL.

Abstract: This paper introduces Gaussian Spatial Transport (GST), a novel framework that leverages Gaussian splatting to facilitate transport from the probability measure in the image coordinate space to the annotation map. We propose a Gaussian splatting-based method to estimate pixel-annotation correspondence, which is then used to compute a transport plan derived from Bayesian probability. To integrate the resulting transport plan into standard network optimization in typical computer vision tasks, we derive a loss function that measures discrepancy after transport. Extensive experiments on representative computer vision tasks, including crowd counting and landmark detection, validate the effectiveness of our approach. Compared to conventional optimal transport schemes, GST eliminates iterative transport plan computation during training, significantly improving efficiency.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SEED-SR introduces a segmentation-aware, diffusion-based Ref-SR framework that operates in a latent space to deliver high-factor (20x) segmentation of farms using multi-source HR/LR satellite data, outperforming existing Ref-SR methods in both instance and semantic segmentation on two real datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Delineating farm boundaries is essential but challenging for smallholder farms due to HR imagery's low revisit frequency. To enable frequent monitoring, the authors seek to fuse high-res references with high-frequency low-res data without sacrificing segmentation accuracy, addressing drawbacks of perceptual SR loss and two-step SR+seg pipelines.

Method: Proposes SEED-SR which combines conditional latent diffusion models with large-scale multispectral geo-spatial foundation models. Instead of pixel-space SR, it performs SR in a segmentation-aware latent space to output segmentation maps at 20x scale factor, effectively integrating diverse satellite sources.

Result: Experimental results on two large real datasets show relative improvements of up to 25.5% (instance) and 12.9% (semantic) over state-of-the-art Ref-SR baselines.

Conclusion: The approach enables unprecedented large-scale factor segmentation for frequent monitoring, demonstrating robustness across datasets and highlighting the value of latent-space SR with multi-source data for agricultural segmentation tasks.

Abstract: Delineating farm boundaries through segmentation of satellite images is a fundamental step in many agricultural applications. The task is particularly challenging for smallholder farms, where accurate delineation requires the use of high resolution (HR) imagery which are available only at low revisit frequencies (e.g., annually). To support more frequent (sub-) seasonal monitoring, HR images could be combined as references (ref) with low resolution (LR) images -- having higher revisit frequency (e.g., weekly) -- using reference-based super-resolution (Ref-SR) methods. However, current Ref-SR methods optimize perceptual quality and smooth over crucial features needed for downstream tasks, and are unable to meet the large scale-factor requirements for this task. Further, previous two-step approaches of SR followed by segmentation do not effectively utilize diverse satellite sources as inputs. We address these problems through a new approach, $\textbf{SEED-SR}$, which uses a combination of conditional latent diffusion models and large-scale multi-spectral, multi-source geo-spatial foundation models. Our key innovation is to bypass the explicit SR task in the pixel space and instead perform SR in a segmentation-aware latent space. This unique approach enables us to generate segmentation maps at an unprecedented 20$\times$ scale factor, and rigorous experiments on two large, real datasets demonstrate up to $\textbf{25.5}$ and $\textbf{12.9}$ relative improvement in instance and semantic segmentation metrics respectively over approaches based on state-of-the-art Ref-SR methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Regional WMH quantification via deep learning improves diagnostic performance beyond global WMH burden, achieving high AUC and revealing region-specific vulnerability in AD.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing WMH segmentation often reports only total lesion load, neglecting spatial patterns that may help diagnosis and stratification in AD and related dementias.

Method: A deep learning framework for robust WMH segmentation and localization; evaluate on public datasets and an independent ADNI cohort; quantify WMH load within anatomically defined regions and combine with brain structure volumes; assess diagnostic value.

Result: Regional WMH loads outperform global lesion burden for disease classification; AUC up to 0.97 when combined with atrophy metrics; multiple anterior white matter regions reproducibly linked to diagnostic status.

Conclusion: Regional WMH quantification adds diagnostic value and may improve early diagnosis and stratification; combining regional lesion metrics with atrophy measures enhances performance in neurodegenerative disorder assessment.

Abstract: White matter hyperintensities (WMH) are key imaging markers in cognitive aging, Alzheimer's disease (AD), and related dementias. Although automated methods for WMH segmentation have advanced, most provide only global lesion load and overlook their spatial distribution across distinct white matter regions. We propose a deep learning framework for robust WMH segmentation and localization, evaluated across public datasets and an independent Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort. Our results show that the predicted lesion loads are in line with the reference WMH estimates, confirming the robustness to variations in lesion load, acquisition, and demographics. Beyond accurate segmentation, we quantify WMH load within anatomically defined regions and combine these measures with brain structure volumes to assess diagnostic value. Regional WMH volumes consistently outperform global lesion burden for disease classification, and integration with brain atrophy metrics further improves performance, reaching area under the curve (AUC) values up to 0.97. Several spatially distinct regions, particularly within anterior white matter tracts, are reproducibly associated with diagnostic status, indicating localized vulnerability in AD. These results highlight the added value of regional WMH quantification. Incorporating localized lesion metrics alongside atrophy markers may enhance early diagnosis and stratification in neurodegenerative disorders.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A decoupled video VAE (DeCo-VAE) uses separate encoders for keyframe, motion, and residual, with a shared 3D decoder and a sequential freezing training strategy to achieve compact, high-quality video reconstructions by reducing cross-component interference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Video frames are highly similar across time, causing redundant latent representations in standard VAEs. Decoupling static and dynamic content aims to produce a more compact latent space and improve reconstruction fidelity.

Method: Decompose video content into three components (keyframe, motion, residual). Train dedicated encoders for each component and use a shared 3D decoder for spatiotemporal reconstruction. Employ a decoupled adaptation strategy that freezes subsets of encoders during training to learn static and dynamic features stably.

Result: Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate superior video reconstruction performance compared to baselines, validating the effectiveness of component decoupling and the proposed training strategy.

Conclusion: Decoupling content into keyframe, motion, and residual with dedicated encoders and a shared decoder yields compact latent representations and stable, high-quality reconstructions, mitigating cross-component interference.

Abstract: Existing video Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) generally overlook the similarity between frame contents, leading to redundant latent modeling. In this paper, we propose decoupled VAE (DeCo-VAE) to achieve compact latent representation. Instead of encoding RGB pixels directly, we decompose video content into distinct components via explicit decoupling: keyframe, motion and residual, and learn dedicated latent representation for each. To avoid cross-component interference, we design dedicated encoders for each decoupled component and adopt a shared 3D decoder to maintain spatiotemporal consistency during reconstruction. We further utilize a decoupled adaptation strategy that freezes partial encoders while training the others sequentially, ensuring stable training and accurate learning of both static and dynamic features. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate that DeCo-VAE achieves superior video reconstruction performance.

TL;DR: A decoder-based multi-task dense prediction framework (PAMM) uses dual state-space parameter experts and S4 priors with Multi-Directional Hilbert Scanning to model task interactions, achieving effective results on NYUD-v2 and PASCAL-Context.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods rely on convolutions and attention to model task interactions; there is a need for scalable, structured priors and sequence-based modeling for 2D data in multi-task dense prediction.

Method: PAMM is a decoder-based framework with two state-space parameter experts to set task-specific priors; global integration via S4; Multi-Directional Hilbert Scanning to form multi-angle sequences for 2D data; applied to multi-task dense prediction.

Result: Extensive experiments on NYUD-v2 and PASCAL-Context demonstrate the method's effectiveness.

Conclusion: PAMM offers a novel, effective way to model inter-task relations in multi-task dense prediction using state-space models and Hilbert-scan sequences, complementing or offering an alternative to Transformers; code released.

Abstract: Understanding the inter-relations and interactions between tasks is crucial for multi-task dense prediction. Existing methods predominantly utilize convolutional layers and attention mechanisms to explore task-level interactions. In this work, we introduce a novel decoder-based framework, Parameter Aware Mamba Model (PAMM), specifically designed for dense prediction in multi-task learning setting. Distinct from approaches that employ Transformers to model holistic task relationships, PAMM leverages the rich, scalable parameters of state space models to enhance task interconnectivity. It features dual state space parameter experts that integrate and set task-specific parameter priors, capturing the intrinsic properties of each task. This approach not only facilitates precise multi-task interactions but also allows for the global integration of task priors through the structured state space sequence model (S4). Furthermore, we employ the Multi-Directional Hilbert Scanning method to construct multi-angle feature sequences, thereby enhancing the sequence model's perceptual capabilities for 2D data. Extensive experiments on the NYUD-v2 and PASCAL-Context benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method. Our code is available at https://github.com/CQC-gogopro/PAMM.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Single-stream CNNs struggle to capture multi-scale forgery artifacts across spatial, texture, and frequency domains, limiting robustness and generalization. A multi-branch, attention-guided fusion should improve detection.

Method: ForensicFlow uses three branches: RGB (ConvNeXt-tiny), texture (Swin Transformer-tiny), and frequency (CNN+SE). It employs attention-based temporal pooling and adaptive attention fusion. Trained on Celeb-DF (v2) using Focal Loss.

Result: Achieves AUC 0.9752, F1 0.9408, accuracy 0.9208, outperforming single-stream baselines. Ablation validates branch synergy; Grad-CAM confirms forensic focus.

Conclusion: Multi-branch feature fusion with temporal attention provides superior resilience against subtle forgeries in video Deepfakes.

Abstract: Deepfakes generated by advanced GANs and autoencoders severely threaten information integrity and societal stability. Single-stream CNNs fail to capture multi-scale forgery artifacts across spatial, texture, and frequency domains, limiting robustness and generalization. We introduce the ForensicFlow, a tri-modal forensic framework that synergistically fuses RGB, texture, and frequency evidence for video Deepfake detection. The RGB branch (ConvNeXt-tiny) extracts global visual inconsistencies; the texture branch (Swin Transformer-tiny) detects fine-grained blending artifacts; the frequency branch (CNN + SE) identifies periodic spectral noise. Attention-based temporal pooling dynamically prioritizes high-evidence frames, while adaptive attention fusion balances branch contributions.Trained on Celeb-DF (v2) with Focal Loss, ForensicFlow achieves AUC 0.9752, F1-Score 0.9408, and accuracy 0.9208, outperforming single-stream baselines. Ablation validates branch synergy; Grad-CAM confirms forensic focus. This comprehensive feature fusion provides superior resilience against subtle forgeries.

TL;DR: A Cross-Modal Compositional Self-Distillation (CCSD) framework for robust brain tumor segmentation with arbitrary missing MRI modalities, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world clinical settings often have incomplete multi-modal MRI data, which degrades performance and generalizability of deep learning segmentation models; a flexible approach is needed to handle missing modalities.

Method: CCSD uses a shared-specific encoder–decoder architecture. It introduces two self-distillation strategies: (1) hierarchical modality self-distillation to transfer knowledge across modality hierarchies and reduce semantic gaps, and (2) progressive modality combination distillation to simulate gradual modality dropout during training and enhance robustness to missing modalities.

Result: CCSD achieves state-of-the-art performance across various missing-modality scenarios on public brain tumor segmentation benchmarks, with strong generalization and stability.

Conclusion: CCSD effectively addresses arbitrary modality absence in multi-modal brain tumor segmentation, offering robust performance and potential applicability to other multi-modal tasks.

Abstract: The accurate segmentation of brain tumors from multi-modal MRI is critical for clinical diagnosis and treatment planning. While integrating complementary information from various MRI sequences is a common practice, the frequent absence of one or more modalities in real-world clinical settings poses a significant challenge, severely compromising the performance and generalizability of deep learning-based segmentation models. To address this challenge, we propose a novel Cross-Modal Compositional Self-Distillation (CCSD) framework that can flexibly handle arbitrary combinations of input modalities. CCSD adopts a shared-specific encoder-decoder architecture and incorporates two self-distillation strategies: (i) a hierarchical modality self-distillation mechanism that transfers knowledge across modality hierarchies to reduce semantic discrepancies, and (ii) a progressive modality combination distillation approach that enhances robustness to missing modalities by simulating gradual modality dropout during training. Extensive experiments on public brain tumor segmentation benchmarks demonstrate that CCSD achieves state-of-the-art performance across various missing-modality scenarios, with strong generalization and stability.

TL;DR: D-PerceptCT enhances LDCT by integrating semantic priors and long-range features with a perceptual loss to better preserve diagnostically relevant structures while reducing smoothing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LDCT often yields noisy, low-detail images due to low radiation dose; existing denoising methods can over-smooth and mis-estimate noise, risking loss of critical details. A perceptually guided enhancement aims to preserve clinically important features.

Method: Proposes D-PerceptCT with two main blocks: ViDex (Visual Dual-path Extractor) that fuses semantic priors from a pretrained DINOv2 with local features; a Global-Local State-Space block for long-range and multiscale information; introduces Deep Perceptual Relevancy Loss Function (DPRLF) inspired by human contrast sensitivity.

Result: Evaluated on Mayo2016 LDCT data, D-PerceptCT shows superior preservation of structural and textural information and outperforms state-of-the-art methods in experiments.

Conclusion: The architecture, inspired by human visual system principles and leveraging semantic priors and perceptual loss, effectively enhances LDCT by preserving perceptually important features without excessive smoothing, potentially improving diagnostic utility.

Abstract: Low Dose Computed Tomography (LDCT) is widely used as an imaging solution to aid diagnosis and other clinical tasks. However, this comes at the price of a deterioration in image quality due to the low dose of radiation used to reduce the risk of secondary cancer development. While some efficient methods have been proposed to enhance LDCT quality, many overestimate noise and perform excessive smoothing, leading to a loss of critical details. In this paper, we introduce D-PerceptCT, a novel architecture inspired by key principles of the Human Visual System (HVS) to enhance LDCT images. The objective is to guide the model to enhance or preserve perceptually relevant features, thereby providing radiologists with CT images where critical anatomical structures and fine pathological details are perceptu- ally visible. D-PerceptCT consists of two main blocks: 1) a Visual Dual-path Extractor (ViDex), which integrates semantic priors from a pretrained DINOv2 model with local spatial features, allowing the network to incorporate semantic-awareness during enhancement; (2) a Global-Local State-Space block that captures long-range information and multiscale features to preserve the important structures and fine details for diagnosis. In addition, we propose a novel deep perceptual loss, designated as the Deep Perceptual Relevancy Loss Function (DPRLF), which is inspired by human contrast sensitivity, to further emphasize perceptually important features. Extensive experiments on the Mayo2016 dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of D-PerceptCT method for LDCT enhancement, showing better preservation of structural and textural information within LDCT images compared to SOTA methods.

*Sriram Srinivasan,Srinivasan Aruchamy,Siva Ram Krisha Vadali*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A deep learning framework (HyMAD) for multi-label seismic activity detection in border surveillance, fusing SincNet spectral features with RNN-based temporal modeling, augmented by self-attention and cross-modal fusion to separate overlapping events (humans, animals, vehicles) in real-world field recordings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Seismic sensors are covert and robust but produce noisy signals; overlapping activities (humans, animals, vehicles) are hard to separate, risking misdetection. A reliable, modular approach for simultaneous event recognition is needed for border surveillance.

Method: HyMAD architecture using SincNet spectral features, an RNN for temporal dependencies, self-attention layers for intra-modal enhancement, and a cross-modal fusion module for robust multi-label classification; evaluated on real-field border surveillance recordings.

Result: Shows generalization to complex, simultaneous activity scenarios with humans, animals, and vehicles; achieves competitive performance; provides a modular framework for extending seismic-based activity recognition in security contexts.

Conclusion: HyMAD offers effective multi-label seismic event detection under noisy, overlapped conditions and is adaptable for real-world security deployments.

Abstract: Seismic sensing has emerged as a promising solution for border surveillance and monitoring; the seismic sensors that are often buried underground are small and cannot be noticed easily, making them difficult for intruders to detect, avoid, or vandalize. This significantly enhances their effectiveness compared to highly visible cameras or fences. However, accurately detecting and distinguishing between overlapping activities that are happening simultaneously, such as human intrusions, animal movements, and vehicle rumbling, remains a major challenge due to the complex and noisy nature of seismic signals. Correctly identifying simultaneous activities is critical because failing to separate them can lead to misclassification, missed detections, and an incomplete understanding of the situation, thereby reducing the reliability of surveillance systems. To tackle this problem, we propose HyMAD (Hybrid Multi-Activity Detection), a deep neural architecture based on spatio-temporal feature fusion. The framework integrates spectral features extracted with SincNet and temporal dependencies modeled by a recurrent neural network (RNN). In addition, HyMAD employs self-attention layers to strengthen intra-modal representations and a cross-modal fusion module to achieve robust multi-label classification of seismic events. e evaluate our approach on a dataset constructed from real-world field recordings collected in the context of border surveillance and monitoring, demonstrating its ability to generalize to complex, simultaneous activity scenarios involving humans, animals, and vehicles. Our method achieves competitive performance and offers a modular framework for extending seismic-based activity recognition in real-world security applications.

*Nathaniel Putera,Daniel Vilet Rodríguez,Noah Videcrantz,Julia Machnio,Mostafa Mehdipour Ghazi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Transformer-based MRI embeddings complement tabular features; clinical data best for extreme progression, MRI embeddings better for identifying stability; results support multimodal fusion for AD progression.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Alzheimer's disease progression is heterogeneous and subtle brain changes are not fully captured by tabular predictors; need effective representations from MRI and trajectory-aware labeling.

Method: Trajectory-aware labeling using Dynamic Time Warping clustering; train a 3D Vision Transformer via unsupervised reconstruction on harmonized and augmented MRI data to obtain anatomy-preserving embeddings without progression labels; evaluate embeddings with traditional ML classifiers and deep learning heads; compare against tabular representations and CNN baselines.

Result: Clinical and volumetric features achieved the highest AUCs (~0.70) for predicting mild and severe progression; MRI embeddings from the ViT achieved AUC ~0.71 for distinguishing cognitively stable individuals; the moderate progression group was challenging for all approaches; results indicate complementary strengths across modalities.

Conclusion: Clinical features are strong for identifying high-risk extremes, whereas transformer-based MRI embeddings are more sensitive to subtle markers of stability; multimodal fusion is motivated for robust AD progression modeling.

Abstract: Accurate modeling of cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease is essential for early stratification and personalized management. While tabular predictors provide robust markers of global risk, their ability to capture subtle brain changes remains limited. In this study, we evaluate the predictive contributions of tabular and imaging-based representations, with a focus on transformer-derived Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) embeddings. We introduce a trajectory-aware labeling strategy based on Dynamic Time Warping clustering to capture heterogeneous patterns of cognitive change, and train a 3D Vision Transformer (ViT) via unsupervised reconstruction on harmonized and augmented MRI data to obtain anatomy-preserving embeddings without progression labels. The pretrained encoder embeddings are subsequently assessed using both traditional machine learning classifiers and deep learning heads, and compared against tabular representations and convolutional network baselines. Results highlight complementary strengths across modalities. Clinical and volumetric features achieved the highest AUCs of around 0.70 for predicting mild and severe progression, underscoring their utility in capturing global decline trajectories. In contrast, MRI embeddings from the ViT model were most effective in distinguishing cognitively stable individuals with an AUC of 0.71. However, all approaches struggled in the heterogeneous moderate group. These findings indicate that clinical features excel in identifying high-risk extremes, whereas transformer-based MRI embeddings are more sensitive to subtle markers of stability, motivating multimodal fusion strategies for AD progression modeling.

### [116] [A Generative Data Framework with Authentic Supervision for Underwater Image Restoration and Enhancement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14521)
*Yufeng Tian,Yifan Chen,Zhe Sun,Libang Chen,Mingyu Dou,Jijun Lu,Ye Zheng,Xuelong Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a synthetic data framework to train underwater image restoration/enhancement models by translating in-air natural images into underwater-degraded versions, creating a large-scale, well-labeled dataset across six degradation types. Models trained on this data achieve competitive or superior color restoration and generalization, validating the approach. The dataset is publicly released.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Underwater restoration research suffers from scarce high-quality paired data and unreliable reference images. Existing benchmarks rely on hand-picked results which harm supervision quality and global color consistency. A scalable, authentic supervision signal is needed to improve color restoration, enhancement, and generalization.

Method: An unpaired image-to-image translation pipeline is used to convert in-air natural images into underwater-degraded counterparts, generating a synthetic dataset that covers six representative degradation types with precise ground-truth labels. This framework facilitates learning a mapping from degraded underwater images to pristine appearances and is validated across multiple architectures and test sets.

Result: Extensive experiments across six network architectures and three independent test sets show that models trained on the proposed synthetic data achieve comparable or superior color restoration and generalization performance relative to models trained on existing benchmarks.

Conclusion: The work provides a reliable, scalable data-driven solution for underwater image restoration and enhancement. The publicly released dataset enables broader research and benchmarking.

Abstract: Underwater image restoration and enhancement are crucial for correcting color distortion and restoring image details, thereby establishing a fundamental basis for subsequent underwater visual tasks. However, current deep learning methodologies in this area are frequently constrained by the scarcity of high-quality paired datasets. Since it is difficult to obtain pristine reference labels in underwater scenes, existing benchmarks often rely on manually selected results from enhancement algorithms, providing debatable reference images that lack globally consistent color and authentic supervision. This limits the model's capabilities in color restoration, image enhancement, and generalization. To overcome this limitation, we propose using in-air natural images as unambiguous reference targets and translating them into underwater-degraded versions, thereby constructing synthetic datasets that provide authentic supervision signals for model learning. Specifically, we establish a generative data framework based on unpaired image-to-image translation, producing a large-scale dataset that covers 6 representative underwater degradation types. The framework constructs synthetic datasets with precise ground-truth labels, which facilitate the learning of an accurate mapping from degraded underwater images to their pristine scene appearances. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments across 6 representative network architectures and 3 independent test sets show that models trained on our synthetic data achieve comparable or superior color restoration and generalization performance to those trained on existing benchmarks. This research provides a reliable and scalable data-driven solution for underwater image restoration and enhancement. The generated dataset is publicly available at: https://github.com/yftian2025/SynUIEDatasets.git.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Vision ARC reframes ARC as image-to-image translation using a canvas-based input processed by a Vision Transformer, trained from scratch, achieving 60.4% on ARC-1 and nearing average human performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ARC puzzles are inherently visual yet are commonly tackled as language problems; this work argues for a vision-centric approach to leverage visual priors and improve generalization.

Method: VARC framework: represent ARC inputs on a canvas and apply a vanilla ViT to perform image-to-image translation; trained from scratch on ARC data with test-time training to adapt to unseen tasks.

Result: 60.4% accuracy on ARC-1, outperforming existing scratch-trained methods; competitive with leading LLMs and approaching average human performance.

Conclusion: Demonstrates the viability of vision-centric architectures for ARC; visual priors and test-time adaptation enable generalization to unseen tasks, closing the gap toward human-level performance.

Abstract: The Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC) is designed to promote research on abstract reasoning, a fundamental aspect of human intelligence. Common approaches to ARC treat it as a language-oriented problem, addressed by large language models (LLMs) or recurrent reasoning models. However, although the puzzle-like tasks in ARC are inherently visual, existing research has rarely approached the problem from a vision-centric perspective. In this work, we formulate ARC within a vision paradigm, framing it as an image-to-image translation problem. To incorporate visual priors, we represent the inputs on a "canvas" that can be processed like natural images. It is then natural for us to apply standard vision architectures, such as a vanilla Vision Transformer (ViT), to perform image-to-image mapping. Our model is trained from scratch solely on ARC data and generalizes to unseen tasks through test-time training. Our framework, termed Vision ARC (VARC), achieves 60.4% accuracy on the ARC-1 benchmark, substantially outperforming existing methods that are also trained from scratch. Our results are competitive with those of leading LLMs and close the gap to average human performance.

### [118] [Learning Compact Latent Space for Representing Neural Signed Distance Functions with High-fidelity Geometry Details](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14539)
*Qiang Bai,Bojian Wu,Xi Yang,Zhizhong Han*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A framework to unify multiple neural SDFs into a shared latent space to enhance detail fidelity with compact representations, aided by a new training-query sampling strategy; outperforming state-of-the-art methods on standard benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SDFs encode limited information in their latent spaces when modeling multiple shapes/scenes, leading to loss of high-frequency geometry details. An effective multi-SDF representation in a common space is needed to preserve fidelity while remaining compact.

Method: Represent multiple SDFs in a common latent space by combining generalization-based and overfitting-based learning strategies. Introduce a novel sampling strategy for training queries to improve efficiency and suppress artifacts caused by cross-SDF interference.

Result: Numerical and visual evaluations on standard benchmarks demonstrate improved representational capacity and more compact latent representations, outperforming recent methods.

Conclusion: The proposed multi-SDF common-space framework enables high-fidelity geometry with compact codes, aided by an efficient sampling strategy to reduce training artifacts, with broad applicability to multi-SDF modeling.

Abstract: Neural signed distance functions (SDFs) have been a vital representation to represent 3D shapes or scenes with neural networks. An SDF is an implicit function that can query signed distances at specific coordinates for recovering a 3D surface. Although implicit functions work well on a single shape or scene, they pose obstacles when analyzing multiple SDFs with high-fidelity geometry details, due to the limited information encoded in the latent space for SDFs and the loss of geometry details. To overcome these obstacles, we introduce a method to represent multiple SDFs in a common space, aiming to recover more high-fidelity geometry details with more compact latent representations. Our key idea is to take full advantage of the benefits of generalization-based and overfitting-based learning strategies, which manage to preserve high-fidelity geometry details with compact latent codes. Based on this framework, we also introduce a novel sampling strategy to sample training queries. The sampling can improve the training efficiency and eliminate artifacts caused by the influence of other SDFs. We report numerical and visual evaluations on widely used benchmarks to validate our designs and show advantages over the latest methods in terms of the representative ability and compactness.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduces interaction-aware hand-object Gaussians within dynamic 3D Gaussian Splatting to jointly model geometry and appearance of hand-object interactions without object priors; uses piecewise-linear hypotheses, hand-informed deformation fields, and a progressive optimization with regularizations to achieve state-of-the-art reconstruction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle simultaneous modeling of hand-object geometry/appearance under mutual occlusion and blur without relying on object priors, addressing limitations of existing dynamic 3D Gaussian Splatting approaches.

Method: Proposes interaction-aware hand-object Gaussians with optimizable parameters for piecewise linear structure; incorporates hand information into the object deformation field to form interaction-aware dynamic fields; uses a progressive optimization strategy to handle dynamic regions and static background; includes explicit regularizations to stabilize motion, physical realism, and lighting coherence.

Result: Experiments show the method surpasses existing dynamic 3D-GS-based methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance in reconstructing dynamic hand-object interactions.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively handles mutual occlusion, edge blur, and tight hand-object coupling during interaction dynamics without object priors, delivering accurate, stable, and photorealistic reconstructions.

Abstract: This paper focuses on a challenging setting of simultaneously modeling geometry and appearance of hand-object interaction scenes without any object priors. We follow the trend of dynamic 3D Gaussian Splatting based methods, and address several significant challenges. To model complex hand-object interaction with mutual occlusion and edge blur, we present interaction-aware hand-object Gaussians with newly introduced optimizable parameters aiming to adopt piecewise linear hypothesis for clearer structural representation. Moreover, considering the complementarity and tightness of hand shape and object shape during interaction dynamics, we incorporate hand information into object deformation field, constructing interaction-aware dynamic fields to model flexible motions. To further address difficulties in the optimization process, we propose a progressive strategy that handles dynamic regions and static background step by step. Correspondingly, explicit regularizations are designed to stabilize the hand-object representations for smooth motion transition, physical interaction reality, and coherent lighting. Experiments show that our approach surpasses existing dynamic 3D-GS-based methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance in reconstructing dynamic hand-object interaction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Leverage temporal richness of Doppler holography to improve artery-vein segmentation, addressing limitations of purely spatial methods.

Method: Incorporate features from a dedicated pulse analysis pipeline into conventional segmentation architectures (e.g., U-Net) to exploit temporal dynamics in time-resolved holograms.

Result: The temporally augmented model attains performance comparable to more complex attention- or iteration-based models.

Conclusion: Time-resolved preprocessing can unlock the full potential of deep learning for Doppler holography, enabling more accurate retinal hemodynamics studies; dataset is publicly available.

Abstract: Doppler holography is an emerging retinal imaging technique that captures the dynamic behavior of blood flow with high temporal resolution, enabling quantitative assessment of retinal hemodynamics. This requires accurate segmentation of retinal arteries and veins, but traditional segmentation methods focus solely on spatial information and overlook the temporal richness of holographic data. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective approach for artery-vein segmentation in temporal Doppler holograms using standard segmentation architectures. By incorporating features derived from a dedicated pulse analysis pipeline, our method allows conventional U-Nets to exploit temporal dynamics and achieve performance comparable to more complex attention- or iteration-based models. These findings demonstrate that time-resolved preprocessing can unlock the full potential of deep learning for Doppler holography, opening new perspectives for quantitative exploration of retinal hemodynamics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional saliency methods focus on per-slide regions and local explanations; clinicians need a global, stable, interpretable view of model behavior to trust and adopt AI in pathology.

Method: Introduce a clustering-based technique that analyzes model representations/outputs to form clusters representing global behavioral patterns; clusters are visualizable to convey model understanding; compared or evaluated with an existing prostate cancer detection model.

Result: Clusters enable global interpretation and increased confidence in the model; demonstration on a prostate cancer detector shows usefulness; may improve adoption in clinical practice.

Conclusion: Clustering-based explainability offers a global, potentially finer-grained alternative to saliency maps in digital pathology, aiding interpretability and uptake; applicable beyond the tested model.

Abstract: We present a clustering-based explainability technique for digital pathology models based on convolutional neural networks. Unlike commonly used methods based on saliency maps, such as occlusion, GradCAM, or relevance propagation, which highlight regions that contribute the most to the prediction for a single slide, our method shows the global behaviour of the model under consideration, while also providing more fine-grained information. The result clusters can be visualised not only to understand the model, but also to increase confidence in its operation, leading to faster adoption in clinical practice. We also evaluate the performance of our technique on an existing model for detecting prostate cancer, demonstrating its usefulness.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Image resolution has a strong, consistent effect on age-estimation accuracy for DeepFace and InsightFace. Both peak at 224x224 input, with InsightFace being more accurate and faster (MAE 7.46 vs 10.83 for DeepFace). Very high or very low resolutions degrade performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine how input resolution affects the reliability of automated age estimation in real-world scenarios where image quality varies, informing preprocessing and model deployment choices.

Method: Dataset: 1000 images from IMDB-Clean, total test samples 7000 across seven resolutions. Models: DeepFace and InsightFace. Metrics: Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Standard Deviation (SD), Median Absolute Error (MedAE).

Result: Resolution materially affects accuracy for both models. Optimal performance at 224×224. DeepFace MAE 10.83 years; InsightFace MAE 7.46 years. Low resolutions significantly raise MAE; very high resolutions also degrade accuracy. InsightFace is consistently faster than DeepFace across all tested resolutions.

Conclusion: Input image resolution is a critical factor in age estimation. Use 224×224 input for best results; prefer InsightFace for better accuracy and speed. Further work should test generalization across more datasets and analyze the causes of degradation at very high resolutions.

Abstract: Automatic age estimation is widely used for age verification, where input images often vary considerably in resolution. This study evaluates the effect of image resolution on age estimation accuracy using DeepFace and InsightFace. A total of 1000 images from the IMDB-Clean dataset were processed in seven resolutions, resulting in 7000 test samples. Performance was evaluated using Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Standard Deviation (SD), and Median Absolute Error (MedAE). Based on this study, we conclude that input image resolution has a clear and consistent impact on the accuracy of age estimation in both DeepFace and InsightFace. Both frameworks achieve optimal performance at 224x224 pixels, with an MAE of 10.83 years (DeepFace) and 7.46 years (InsightFace). At low resolutions, MAE increases substantially, while very high resolutions also degrade accuracy. InsightFace is consistently faster than DeepFace across all resolutions.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OmniZip is a training-free audio-guided multimodal token compression framework for OmniLLMs that prunes video tokens guided by audio salience, achieving speedups and memory reductions while preserving performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the computational bottleneck of processing joint audio–video tokens in omnidirectional LLMs; existing token compression methods do not jointly compress multimodal tokens and a training-free approach leveraging audio cues is desirable.

Method: Identify salient audio tokens; compute an audio retention score for each time window to capture information density; dynamically guide video token pruning using this score and cross-modal similarity; compress video tokens per time window with an interleaved spatio-temporal scheme; no training required.

Result: 3.42× inference speedup and 1.4× memory reduction over top-performing counterparts, with performance preserved without any training.

Conclusion: OmniZip effectively accelerates multimodal inference in OmniLLMs by audio-guided, training-free video token pruning that preserves important cues through audio anchors and cross-modal alignment.

Abstract: Omnimodal large language models (OmniLLMs) have attracted increasing research attention of late towards unified audio-video understanding, wherein processing audio-video token sequences creates a significant computational bottleneck, however. Existing token compression methods have yet to accommodate this emerging need of jointly compressing multimodal tokens. To bridge this gap, we present OmniZip, a training-free, audio-guided audio-visual token-compression framework that optimizes multimodal token representation and accelerates inference. Specifically, OmniZip first identifies salient audio tokens, then computes an audio retention score for each time group to capture information density, thereby dynamically guiding video token pruning and preserving cues from audio anchors enhanced by cross-modal similarity. For each time window, OmniZip compresses the video tokens using an interleaved spatio-temporal scheme. Extensive empirical results demonstrate the merits of OmniZip - it achieves 3.42X inference speedup and 1.4X memory reduction over other top-performing counterparts, while maintaining performance with no training.

TL;DR: Multimodal ECG-LGE MRI segmentation with Temporal Aware Feature Fusion improves myocardial scar segmentation, surpassing image-only baselines (Dice 0.846 vs 0.615; precision 0.911; sensitivity 0.904).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Scar segmentation from LGE-MRI is hard due to variable contrast and artifacts; ECG provides physiological cues to localize scar; need physiologically informed segmentation.

Method: Develop a multimodal framework combining ECG-derived electrophysiology with AHA-17 atlas anatomical priors. Introduce Temporal Aware Feature Fusion (TAFF) that dynamically weights/fuses features based on the time difference between ECG and LGE-MRI acquisitions. Evaluate on clinical dataset.

Result: Dice score for scars improved from 0.6149 to 0.8463; precision 0.9115; sensitivity 0.9043; beats image-only baseline (nnU-Net).

Conclusion: Integrating physiological and anatomical knowledge enables more robust, physiologically grounded cardiac scar segmentation; approach shows a path toward 'seeing beyond the image' in cardiac imaging.

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of myocardial scar from late gadolinium enhanced (LGE) cardiac MRI is essential for evaluating tissue viability, yet remains challenging due to variable contrast and imaging artifacts. Electrocardiogram (ECG) signals provide complementary physiological information, as conduction abnormalities can help localize or suggest scarred myocardial regions. In this work, we propose a novel multimodal framework that integrates ECG-derived electrophysiological information with anatomical priors from the AHA-17 atlas for physiologically consistent LGE-based scar segmentation. As ECGs and LGE-MRIs are not acquired simultaneously, we introduce a Temporal Aware Feature Fusion (TAFF) mechanism that dynamically weights and fuses features based on their acquisition time difference. Our method was evaluated on a clinical dataset and achieved substantial gains over the state-of-the-art image-only baseline (nnU-Net), increasing the average Dice score for scars from 0.6149 to 0.8463 and achieving high performance in both precision (0.9115) and sensitivity (0.9043). These results show that integrating physiological and anatomical knowledge allows the model to "see beyond the image", setting a new direction for robust and physiologically grounded cardiac scar segmentation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Zero-shot diffusion-video approach that enhances synthetic video realism by conditioning the denoising/generation process on structure-guided information (depth, semantic, edge maps) from an auxiliary model, achieving better structural consistency and photorealism without fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bridge the gap between synthetic and real video by preserving multi-level structure while achieving photorealism, without requiring simulator-derived data during inference.

Method: Use a diffusion video foundation model; modify denoising to be conditioned on estimated structure-aware maps (depth, semantic, edge) generated by an auxiliary model rather than extracting from the simulator; zero-shot; preserve spatial-temporal structure.

Result: Outperforms baselines in structural consistency with the original video while maintaining state-of-the-art photorealism in experiments.

Conclusion: The proposed structure-guided, zero-shot diffusion approach offers a general, simple, and effective path to enhancing synthetic video realism, likely applicable beyond this specific setup.

Abstract: We propose an approach to enhancing synthetic video realism, which can re-render synthetic videos from a simulator in photorealistic fashion. Our realism enhancement approach is a zero-shot framework that focuses on preserving the multi-level structures from synthetic videos into the enhanced one in both spatial and temporal domains, built upon a diffusion video foundational model without further fine-tuning. Specifically, we incorporate an effective modification to have the generation/denoising process conditioned on estimated structure-aware information from the synthetic video, such as depth maps, semantic maps, and edge maps, by an auxiliary model, rather than extracting the information from a simulator. This guidance ensures that the enhanced videos are consistent with the original synthetic video at both the structural and semantic levels. Our approach is a simple yet general and powerful approach to enhancing synthetic video realism: we show that our approach outperforms existing baselines in structural consistency with the original video while maintaining state-of-the-art photorealism quality in our experiments.

Result: Outperforms baselines in regression generalization and robustness. Cross-attention fusion reduces MSE by 16.7%, MAE by 6.03%, and increases R2 by 16.4% compared to naive concatenation. Demonstrates potential for real-world screening at clinically relevant BMD thresholds.

Conclusion: Multimodal cross-attention effectively integrates imaging and metadata to estimate femoral neck BMD, improving regression accuracy and screening readiness, with ablations validating the approach.

Abstract: Poor bone health is a significant public health concern, and low bone mineral density (BMD) leads to an increased fracture risk, a key feature of osteoporosis. We present XAttn-BMD (Cross-Attention BMD), a multimodal deep learning framework that predicts femoral neck BMD from hip X-ray images and structured clinical metadata. It utilizes a novel bidirectional cross-attention mechanism to dynamically integrate image and metadata features for cross-modal mutual reinforcement. A Weighted Smooth L1 loss is tailored to address BMD imbalance and prioritize clinically significant cases. Extensive experiments on the data from the Hertfordshire Cohort Study show that our model outperforms the baseline models in regression generalization and robustness. Ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of both cross-attention fusion and the customized loss function. Experimental results show that the integration of multimodal data via cross-attention outperforms naive feature concatenation without cross-attention, reducing MSE by 16.7%, MAE by 6.03%, and increasing the R2 score by 16.4%, highlighting the effectiveness of the approach for femoral neck BMD estimation. Furthermore, screening performance was evaluated using binary classification at clinically relevant femoral neck BMD thresholds, demonstrating the model's potential in real-world scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A 3D-aware, scalable generative framework (HoloTea) imputes spot-level gene expression in spatial transcriptomics by leveraging adjacent sections; it uses cross-section retrieval, a ControlNet conditioning, a 3D-consistent ZINB prior, and a global attention block to scale with spots, achieving improved 3D accuracy and generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome neglect of 3D structure in 2D ST models and limitations of existing non-generative 3D methods, enabling accurate 3D tissue reconstruction and biomarker discovery.

Method: Proposes HoloTea, a 3D-aware flow-matching model that retrieves morphologically corresponding spots across neighboring slides in a shared feature space, fuses cross-section context into a lightweight ControlNet for anatomical-continuity conditioning, and uses a 3D-consistent prior (learned ZINB + spatial-empirical) for flow matching. Includes a global attention block enabling 3D H&E scaling with number of spots.

Result: Outperforms 2D and 3D baselines across three spatial transcriptomics datasets, improving 3D expression accuracy and generalization.

Conclusion: HoloTea enables accurate 3D virtual tissues, accelerating biomarker discovery and deepening understanding of disease.

Abstract: A scalable and robust 3D tissue transcriptomics profile can enable a holistic understanding of tissue organization and provide deeper insights into human biology and disease. Most predictive algorithms that infer ST directly from histology treat each section independently and ignore 3D structure, while existing 3D-aware approaches are not generative and do not scale well. We present Holographic Tissue Expression Inpainting and Analysis (HoloTea), a 3D-aware flow-matching framework that imputes spot-level gene expression from H&E while explicitly using information from adjacent sections. Our key idea is to retrieve morphologically corresponding spots on neighboring slides in a shared feature space and fuse this cross section context into a lightweight ControlNet, allowing conditioning to follow anatomical continuity. To better capture the count nature of the data, we introduce a 3D-consistent prior for flow matching that combines a learned zero-inflated negative binomial (ZINB) prior with a spatial-empirical prior constructed from neighboring sections. A global attention block introduces 3D H&E scaling linearly with the number of spots in the slide, enabling training and inference on large 3D ST datasets. Across three spatial transcriptomics datasets spanning different tissue types and resolutions, HoloTea consistently improves 3D expression accuracy and generalization compared to 2D and 3D baselines. We envision HoloTea advancing the creation of accurate 3D virtual tissues, ultimately accelerating biomarker discovery and deepening our understanding of disease.

### [128] [Fusing Biomechanical and Spatio-Temporal Features for Fall Prediction: Characterizing and Mitigating the Simulation-to-Reality Gap](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14620)
*Md Fokhrul Islam,Sajeda Al-Hammouri,Christopher J. Arellano,Kavan Hazeli,Heman Shakeri*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A dual-stream BioST-GCN fuses pose and biomechanical cues for vision-based fall prediction, delivering better F1 than ST-GCN on simulated data but suffering a large sim-to-real gap; personalization and privacy-preserving pipelines are needed for real-world validation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Falls are a leading cause of injury among older adults and data for modeling falls is scarce. Vision-based systems are non-invasive but must generalize to diverse real-world kinematics, especially in vulnerable groups (e.g., diabetes, frailty). There is a critical simulation-to-reality gap due to biases in synthetic data.

Method: Proposes BioST-GCN, a dual-stream spatio-temporal graph convolutional network that integrates pose and biomechanical information via a cross-attention fusion mechanism. Includes spatio-temporal attention in the ST-GCN stream for interpretability. Evaluated on simulated MCF-UA stunt-actor and MUVIM datasets against vanilla ST-GCN.

Result: BioST-GCN outperforms ST-GCN by 5.32% and 2.91% F1-score on the two datasets. With full supervision on simulated data, F1 reaches 89.0%; zero-shot generalization to unseen subjects drops to 35.9%, highlighting a simulation-reality gap likely due to biases such as intent-to-fall cues. Interpretability is aided by attention highlighting critical joints and temporal phases.

Conclusion: Personalization strategies and privacy-preserving data pipelines are needed to enable real-world validation, and bridging the simulated–real-world data gap is urgent to develop effective fall prediction systems for vulnerable elderly populations.

Abstract: Falls are a leading cause of injury and loss of independence among older adults. Vision-based fall prediction systems offer a non-invasive solution to anticipate falls seconds before impact, but their development is hindered by the scarcity of available fall data. Contributing to these efforts, this study proposes the Biomechanical Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Network (BioST-GCN), a dual-stream model that combines both pose and biomechanical information using a cross-attention fusion mechanism. Our model outperforms the vanilla ST-GCN baseline by 5.32% and 2.91% F1-score on the simulated MCF-UA stunt-actor and MUVIM datasets, respectively. The spatio-temporal attention mechanisms in the ST-GCN stream also provide interpretability by identifying critical joints and temporal phases. However, a critical simulation-reality gap persists. While our model achieves an 89.0% F1-score with full supervision on simulated data, zero-shot generalization to unseen subjects drops to 35.9%. This performance decline is likely due to biases in simulated data, such as `intent-to-fall' cues. For older adults, particularly those with diabetes or frailty, this gap is exacerbated by their unique kinematic profiles. To address this, we propose personalization strategies and advocate for privacy-preserving data pipelines to enable real-world validation. Our findings underscore the urgent need to bridge the gap between simulated and real-world data to develop effective fall prediction systems for vulnerable elderly populations.

*Meiying Gu,Jiawei Zhang,Jiahe Li,Xiaohan Yu,Haonan Luo,Jin Zheng,Xiao Bai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Dual-constraint approach for Gaussian Splatting under sparse views, combining Stereo Geometry-Texture Alignment and Pseudo-Feature Enhanced Geometry Consistency to achieve state-of-the-art surface reconstruction and novel-view synthesis on standard datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sparse input views cause overfitting and geometric-visual inconsistencies when optimizing Gaussian primitives; flattened Gaussians increase anisotropy, worsening surface fitting and rendering under limited viewpoints. A method that aligns geometry and texture while enforcing multi-view geometry on unseen views is needed.

Method: Introduce Stereo Geometry-Texture Alignment to jointly optimize surface geometry and rendering; propose Pseudo-Feature Enhanced Geometry Consistency to enforce multi-view geometric consistency by leveraging both training and unseen views; apply to Gaussian Splatting-based reconstruction; comprehensive evaluation on DTU, BlendedMVS, Mip-NeRF360.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on the targeted datasets, with improved surface detail and higher fidelity novel-view rendering under sparse view conditions.

Conclusion: Bridging rendering quality and geometry estimation via stereo alignment and pseudo-feature consistency effectively mitigates overfitting due to sparse supervision, offering robust geometry and view synthesis improvements; the approach generalizes to standard multi-view datasets.

Abstract: Recent advances in optimizing Gaussian Splatting for scene geometry have enabled efficient reconstruction of detailed surfaces from images. However, when input views are sparse, such optimization is prone to overfitting, leading to suboptimal reconstruction quality. Existing approaches address this challenge by employing flattened Gaussian primitives to better fit surface geometry, combined with depth regularization to alleviate geometric ambiguities under limited viewpoints. Nevertheless, the increased anisotropy inherent in flattened Gaussians exacerbates overfitting in sparse-view scenarios, hindering accurate surface fitting and degrading novel view synthesis performance. In this paper, we propose \net{}, a method that reconstructs more accurate and detailed surfaces while preserving high-quality novel view rendering. Our key insight is to introduce Stereo Geometry-Texture Alignment, which bridges rendering quality and geometry estimation, thereby jointly enhancing both surface reconstruction and view synthesis. In addition, we present a Pseudo-Feature Enhanced Geometry Consistency that enforces multi-view geometric consistency by incorporating both training and unseen views, effectively mitigating overfitting caused by sparse supervision. Extensive experiments on the DTU, BlendedMVS, and Mip-NeRF360 datasets demonstrate that our method achieves the state-of-the-art performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Slide-Label-Aware Multitask pretraining (SLAM-AGS) with adaptive gradient surgery improves downstream cytology tasks under low witness rates, outperforming baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Instance-level labels are unreliable and costly; witness rates in cytology are very low; need robust pretraining that leverages slide-level cues.

Method: Joint weakly supervised similarity on slide-negative patches and self-supervised contrastive learning on slide-positive patches; Adaptive Gradient Surgery to mitigate conflicting gradients; integrate pretrained encoder into attention-based MIL for bag prediction and attention-guided retrieval of abnormal instances.

Result: On a bone-marrow cytology dataset with simulated witness rates 10% to 0.5%, SLAM-AGS yields higher bag-level F1 and Top-400 positive cell retrieval compared with other pretraining methods, with the largest gains at lower witness rates.

Conclusion: Resolving gradient interference enables stable pretraining and better downstream performance; code and evaluation framework released for reproducibility.

Abstract: Computational cytology faces two major challenges: i) instance-level labels are unreliable and prohibitively costly to obtain, ii) witness rates are extremely low. We propose SLAM-AGS, a Slide-Label-Aware Multitask pretraining framework that jointly optimizes (i) a weakly supervised similarity objective on slide-negative patches and (ii) a self-supervised contrastive objective on slide-positive patches, yielding stronger performance on downstream tasks. To stabilize learning, we apply Adaptive Gradient Surgery to tackle conflicting task gradients and prevent model collapse. We integrate the pretrained encoder into an attention-based Multiple Instance Learning aggregator for bag-level prediction and attention-guided retrieval of the most abnormal instances in a bag. On a publicly available bone-marrow cytology dataset, with simulated witness rates from 10% down to 0.5%, SLAM-AGS improves bag-level F1-Score and Top 400 positive cell retrieval over other pretraining methods, with the largest gains at low witness rates, showing that resolving gradient interference enables stable pretraining and better performance on downstream tasks. To facilitate reproducibility, we share our complete implementation and evaluation framework as open source: https://github.com/Ace95/SLAM-AGS.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RepAir is a 3-stage framework for robust 3D airway segmentation that combines an nnU-Net-based segmentation with topology-aware corrections to fix disconnected components.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual annotation of airways is impractical and many 3D U-Net methods produce fragmented, topologically inconsistent segmentations, hindering reliable biomarker extraction — a method that ensures anatomical coherence is needed.

Method: Three-stage pipeline: (1) an nnU-Net-based segmentation network produces an initial airway mask; (2) a skeleton-based algorithm detects discontinuities and proposes reconnections; (3) a 1D convolutional classifier decides which candidate links are true anatomical branches versus false/blocked paths. Evaluation on ATM'22 (mostly healthy) and AeroPath (pathology) datasets, compared against Bronchinet and NaviAirway.

Result: RepAir outperforms existing 3D U-Net-based methods on both voxel-level and topological metrics across both datasets, yielding more complete and anatomically consistent airway trees while maintaining high segmentation accuracy.

Conclusion: RepAir provides a robust, topology-aware 3D airway segmentation solution that improves anatomical fidelity and usefulness for quantitative lung analysis across healthy and diseased cohorts.

Abstract: Accurate airway segmentation from chest computed tomography (CT) scans is essential for quantitative lung analysis, yet manual annotation is impractical and many automated U-Net-based methods yield disconnected components that hinder reliable biomarker extraction. We present RepAir, a three-stage framework for robust 3D airway segmentation that combines an nnU-Net-based network with anatomically informed topology correction. The segmentation network produces an initial airway mask, after which a skeleton-based algorithm identifies potential discontinuities and proposes reconnections. A 1D convolutional classifier then determines which candidate links correspond to true anatomical branches versus false or obstructed paths. We evaluate RepAir on two distinct datasets: ATM'22, comprising annotated CT scans from predominantly healthy subjects and AeroPath, encompassing annotated scans with severe airway pathology. Across both datasets, RepAir outperforms existing 3D U-Net-based approaches such as Bronchinet and NaviAirway on both voxel-level and topological metrics, and produces more complete and anatomically consistent airway trees while maintaining high segmentation accuracy.

### [132] [FreeSwim: Revisiting Sliding-Window Attention Mechanisms for Training-Free Ultra-High-Resolution Video Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14712)
*Yunfeng Wu,Jiayi Song,Zhenxiong Tan,Zihao He,Songhua Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A training-free framework to upscale ultra-high-resolution videos by repurposing pretrained video Diffusion Transformers with inward sliding window attention, a cross-attention override pathway to maintain global coherence, and cross-attention caching for efficiency; achieves high fidelity and competitive performance on VBench.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The attention mechanism in modern Transformers has quadratic time/memory complexity, making end-to-end training for ultra-high-resolution videos prohibitively expensive. A training-free method that leverages pretrained models to synthesize higher-resolution content is desirable.

Method: Use inward sliding window attention to preserve each query's receptive field at the training scale. To avoid repetition and lack of global coherence from local attention, employ a dual-path pipeline with a cross-attention override that guides local-attention semantics using a second branch with a full receptive field. Introduce a cross-attention caching strategy for this branch to avoid frequent full 3D attention. The approach is training-free: no additional training or adaptation of pretrained models.

Result: Extensive experiments show ultra-high-resolution videos with fine-grained details and high efficiency. On VBench, the method achieves superior performance compared to training-based alternatives, with competitive or improved efficiency. Code is released at the provided repository.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates that training-free ultra-high-resolution video synthesis is viable by carefully designing attention mechanisms (inward sliding window with cross-attention override) and caching, enabling high-fidelity results with pretrained diffusion transformers without additional training.

Abstract: The quadratic time and memory complexity of the attention mechanism in modern Transformer based video generators makes end-to-end training for ultra high resolution videos prohibitively expensive. Motivated by this limitation, we introduce a training-free approach that leverages video Diffusion Transformers pretrained at their native scale to synthesize higher resolution videos without any additional training or adaptation. At the core of our method lies an inward sliding window attention mechanism, which originates from a key observation: maintaining each query token's training scale receptive field is crucial for preserving visual fidelity and detail. However, naive local window attention, unfortunately, often leads to repetitive content and exhibits a lack of global coherence in the generated results. To overcome this challenge, we devise a dual-path pipeline that backs up window attention with a novel cross-attention override strategy, enabling the semantic content produced by local attention to be guided by another branch with a full receptive field and, therefore, ensuring holistic consistency. Furthermore, to improve efficiency, we incorporate a cross-attention caching strategy for this branch to avoid the frequent computation of full 3D attention. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method delivers ultra-high-resolution videos with fine-grained visual details and high efficiency in a training-free paradigm. Meanwhile, it achieves superior performance on VBench, even compared to training-based alternatives, with competitive or improved efficiency.

*Xiyuan Wang,Muhan Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Unifies encoder, decoder, and diffusion into a single end-to-end network via Diffusion as Self-Distillation (DSD); stabilizes latent space to avoid latent collapse; achieves competitive ImageNet 256x256 conditional generation with small to large models without classifier-free guidance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Provide end-to-end trainable architecture by removing modular three-part diffusion pipeline; address instability (latent collapse) in naive joint training; leverage self-distillation analogy to stabilize latent representations and diffusion training.

Method: DSD framework with modified objective to stabilize latent space; single network learns to encode, decode, and perform diffusion; treats diffusion as self-distillation, aligning unsupervised learning with diffusion training; no classifier-free guidance.

Result: On ImageNet 256x256 conditional generation, achieves FID of 13.44/6.38/4.25 with 42M/118M/205M parameters after 50 training epochs; no classifier-free guidance.

Conclusion: Demonstrates stable end-to-end training of a unified diffusion model in a single network; achieves strong conditional generation performance with varying model sizes and modest training epochs; reduces architectural and training complexity compared to modular latent diffusion.

Abstract: Standard Latent Diffusion Models rely on a complex, three-part architecture consisting of a separate encoder, decoder, and diffusion network, which are trained in multiple stages. This modular design is computationally inefficient, leads to suboptimal performance, and prevents the unification of diffusion with the single-network architectures common in vision foundation models. Our goal is to unify these three components into a single, end-to-end trainable network. We first demonstrate that a naive joint training approach fails catastrophically due to ``latent collapse'', where the diffusion training objective interferes with the network's ability to learn a good latent representation. We identify the root causes of this instability by drawing a novel analogy between diffusion and self-distillation based unsupervised learning method. Based on this insight, we propose Diffusion as Self-Distillation (DSD), a new framework with key modifications to the training objective that stabilize the latent space. This approach enables, for the first time, the stable end-to-end training of a single network that simultaneously learns to encode, decode, and perform diffusion. DSD achieves outstanding performance on the ImageNet $256\times 256$ conditional generation task: FID=13.44/6.38/4.25 with only 42M/118M/205M parameters and 50 training epochs on ImageNet, without using classifier-free-guidance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A neural-field, view-centric framework for efficient 3D urban data exploration that encodes camera viewpoints as a field and supports fast view queries and occlusion-aware view search; validated on visibility, solar exposure, and visual-impact tasks with public code.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D urban datasets are large and complex; occlusions and manual viewpoint tuning hinder scalable exploration.

Method: Proposes a neural field-based implicit representation of the 3D environment; constructs a vector field encoding views; enables direct (querying view indices) and inverse (finding views to satisfy data patterns and avoid occlusion) queries; supports visibility, solar exposure, and visual impact tasks; validation via quantitative experiments, real-world case studies, expert feedback; code and data released.

Result: Shows effectiveness in finding desirable viewpoints, analyzing building facade visibility, and evaluating views from outdoor spaces; code publicly available.

Conclusion: View-based neural representations enable faster exploration and targeted urban analyses; beneficial for planning and assessment tasks.

Abstract: Despite the growing availability of 3D urban datasets, extracting insights remains challenging due to computational bottlenecks and the complexity of interacting with data. In fact, the intricate geometry of 3D urban environments results in high degrees of occlusion and requires extensive manual viewpoint adjustments that make large-scale exploration inefficient. To address this, we propose a view-based approach for 3D data exploration, where a vector field encodes views from the environment. To support this approach, we introduce a neural field-based method that constructs an efficient implicit representation of 3D environments. This representation enables both faster direct queries, which consist of the computation of view assessment indices, and inverse queries, which help avoid occlusion and facilitate the search for views that match desired data patterns. Our approach supports key urban analysis tasks such as visibility assessments, solar exposure evaluation, and assessing the visual impact of new developments. We validate our method through quantitative experiments, case studies informed by real-world urban challenges, and feedback from domain experts. Results show its effectiveness in finding desirable viewpoints, analyzing building facade visibility, and evaluating views from outdoor spaces.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Subjectivity and noise in engagement labels limit model performance; VLMs can refine annotations and provide uncertainty-aware supervision, while curriculum-based training helps incorporate ambiguous samples.

Method: Use a questionnaire to extract behavioral cues, split data into high- and low-reliability subsets, and apply a training strategy that combines curriculum learning with soft label refinement. Train classical computer vision models on refined high-reliability data while gradually incorporating ambiguous samples and adjusting supervision to reflect uncertainty.

Result: Improvements on engagement benchmarks: EngageNet (up to +1.21% in three of six feature settings); DREAMS +0.22 F1; PAFE +0.06 F1.

Conclusion: Addressing label subjectivity with VLM-guided annotation refinement and a curriculum, uncertainty-aware training strategy yields state-of-the-art gains on engagement benchmarks compared to prior methods.

Abstract: Engagement recognition in video datasets, unlike traditional image classification tasks, is particularly challenged by subjective labels and noise limiting model performance. To overcome the challenges of subjective and noisy engagement labels, we propose a framework leveraging Vision Large Language Models (VLMs) to refine annotations and guide the training process. Our framework uses a questionnaire to extract behavioral cues and split data into high- and low-reliability subsets. We also introduce a training strategy combining curriculum learning with soft label refinement, gradually incorporating ambiguous samples while adjusting supervision to reflect uncertainty. We demonstrate that classical computer vision models trained on refined high-reliability subsets and enhanced with our curriculum strategy show improvements, highlighting benefits of addressing label subjectivity with VLMs. This method surpasses prior state of the art across engagement benchmarks such as EngageNet (three of six feature settings, maximum improvement of +1.21%), and DREAMS / PAFE with F1 gains of +0.22 / +0.06.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A system-level MAPF framework that unifies planning and execution via Finite-Horizon Closed-Loop Factorization (FICO). It enables real-time, scalable, uncertainty-aware MAPF by receding-horizon factorization, outperforming open-loop baselines in computation and throughput.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional MAPF approaches separate planning from execution and struggle to handle uncertainties and large-scale scenarios. There is a need for a unified, scalable, and uncertainty-aware framework that operates in closed-loop fashion.

Method: Define a MAPF system as a control-design problem and introduce FICO, a factorization-based algorithm inspired by receding-horizon control. Exploit compositional structure to enable real-time operation and adaptability to execution-time uncertainties, allowing thousands of agents.

Result: Real-time responses within milliseconds; scalable to thousands of agents; two orders of magnitude faster than open-loop baselines; higher throughput under stochastic delays and arrivals.

Conclusion: A principled foundation for MAPF analysis and advancement through system-level modeling, factorization, and closed-loop design; supports generalization across variants and uncertainty-aware execution.

Abstract: Multi-Agent Path Finding is a fundamental problem in robotics and AI, yet most existing formulations treat planning and execution separately and address variants of the problem in an ad hoc manner. This paper presents a system-level framework for MAPF that integrates planning and execution, generalizes across variants, and explicitly models uncertainties. At its core is the MAPF system, a formal model that casts MAPF as a control design problem encompassing classical and uncertainty-aware formulations. To solve it, we introduce Finite-Horizon Closed-Loop Factorization (FICO), a factorization-based algorithm inspired by receding-horizon control that exploits compositional structure for efficient closed-loop operation. FICO enables real-time responses -- commencing execution within milliseconds -- while scaling to thousands of agents and adapting seamlessly to execution-time uncertainties. Extensive case studies demonstrate that it reduces computation time by up to two orders of magnitude compared with open-loop baselines, while delivering significantly higher throughput under stochastic delays and agent arrivals. These results establish a principled foundation for analyzing and advancing MAPF through system-level modeling, factorization, and closed-loop design.

*Jan Quenzel,Sven Behnke*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A LiDAR–IMU odometry system (LIO-MARS) that fuses LiDAR surfels with an IMU-informed continuous-time B-spline trajectory, using non-uniform scan windows, Kronecker-based acceleration for covariance/GMM, unscented deskewing, intra-scan motion segmentation, and soft pose constraints to achieve state-of-the-art LIO performance across handheld, ground, and aerial platforms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autonomous search & rescue demands robust real-time perception; LiDAR provides accurate geometry while IMU constrains motion. Existing LIO methods struggle with scan-induced delays, computational bottlenecks, and motion distortion; there is a need for a tighter coupling of LiDAR and IMU with continuous-time modeling to improve robustness and accuracy.

Method: Extend LiDAR odometry MARS by estimating a continuous-time trajectory with a B-spline; align multi-resolution surfel maps with a Gaussian mixture model; implement non-uniform temporal knot placement in the scan window to ensure trajectory continuity without extra delay; accelerate covariance and GMM computations using Kronecker sums/products; deskew surfels via unscented transform; split scans into intra-scan segments for motion compensation during spline optimization; add soft relative-pose constraints and preintegrated IMU pseudo-measurements; evaluate on diverse datasets.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art quality compared with recent LIO systems on handheld, ground, and aerial datasets; accelerates key computations by up to ~3.3x; demonstrates robustness and accuracy improvements.

Conclusion: LIO-MARS provides robust, real-time LiDAR–IMU odometry with continuous-time trajectory modeling and enhanced computational efficiency, enabling better navigation for search & rescue in challenging environments across multiple platforms.

Abstract: Autonomous robotic systems heavily rely on environment knowledge to safely navigate. For search & rescue, a flying robot requires robust real-time perception, enabled by complementary sensors. IMU data constrains acceleration and rotation, whereas LiDAR measures accurate distances around the robot. Building upon the LiDAR odometry MARS, our LiDAR-inertial odometry (LIO) jointly aligns multi-resolution surfel maps with a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) using a continuous-time B-spline trajectory. Our new scan window uses non-uniform temporal knot placement to ensure continuity over the whole trajectory without additional scan delay. Moreover, we accelerate essential covariance and GMM computations with Kronecker sums and products by a factor of 3.3. An unscented transform de-skews surfels, while a splitting into intra-scan segments facilitates motion compensation during spline optimization. Complementary soft constraints on relative poses and preintegrated IMU pseudo-measurements further improve robustness and accuracy. Extensive evaluation showcases the state-of-the-art quality of our LIO-MARS w.r.t. recent LIO systems on various handheld, ground and aerial vehicle-based datasets.

TL;DR: A unified SpatioTemporal Active Retrieval (STAR) framework enables robots to perform object search in dynamic, open-world settings by combining long-term non-parametric memory with a working memory and a vision-language decision model. It unifies spatial and temporal search in a single loop, introduces STARBench for benchmarking, and demonstrates improved performance over scene-graph and memory-only baselines on simulated/real robots like Tiago.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Service robots must understand and ground references that involve attributes, spatial context, and past states in open-world, dynamic environments. Existing approaches either capture spatial relations but ignore temporal grounding, model dynamics but lack embodied interaction, or handle dynamics with fixed vocabularies. A unified approach is needed to bridge spatial and temporal grounding with embodied action.

Method: STAR constructs a loop where non-parametric long-term memory and a working memory support efficient recall. A vision-language model selects at each step whether to perform temporal or spatial actions, enabling embodied interaction while grounding queries in both space and time. The framework is evaluated with STARBench—a benchmark of spatiotemporal object search tasks across simulated and real environments—and on a Tiago robot.

Result:  STAR consistently outperforms scene-graph and memory-only baselines in STARBench and Tiago robot experiments, demonstrating the advantage of treating search in time and search in space as a unified problem.

Conclusion: Treating spatiotemporal search as a single decision problem with integrated memory and embodied action improves robustness and effectiveness for object retrieval in dynamic settings. STARBench provides a compelling benchmark for future work in spatiotemporal grounding and embodied retrieval.

Abstract: Service robots must retrieve objects in dynamic, open-world settings where requests may reference attributes ("the red mug"), spatial context ("the mug on the table"), or past states ("the mug that was here yesterday"). Existing approaches capture only parts of this problem: scene graphs capture spatial relations but ignore temporal grounding, temporal reasoning methods model dynamics but do not support embodied interaction, and dynamic scene graphs handle both but remain closed-world with fixed vocabularies. We present STAR (SpatioTemporal Active Retrieval), a framework that unifies memory queries and embodied actions within a single decision loop. STAR leverages non-parametric long-term memory and a working memory to support efficient recall, and uses a vision-language model to select either temporal or spatial actions at each step. We introduce STARBench, a benchmark of spatiotemporal object search tasks across simulated and real environments. Experiments in STARBench and on a Tiago robot show that STAR consistently outperforms scene-graph and memory-only baselines, demonstrating the benefits of treating search in time and search in space as a unified problem.

### [140] [FACA: Fair and Agile Multi-Robot Collision Avoidance in Constrained Environments with Dynamic Priorities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14024)
*Jaskirat Singh,Rohan Chandra*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A fair and agile collision avoidance approach (FACA) enables multi-robot teams to navigate constrained spaces safely and efficiently by using natural-language communication and a novel artificial potential field that creates a roundabout-like conflict resolution, achieving large speedups while maintaining safety.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In crowded, high-speed, constrained environments, multiple heterogeneous robots with urgent and changing priorities must coordinate safely. Existing methods struggle with dynamic role changes and proactive communication, leading to inefficiencies and safety risks.

Method: Introduce FACA, where robots coordinate via natural language messaging and employ an artificial potential field that produces a roundabout-like behavior during conflicts to balance safety and agility.

Result: Empirical results show FACA completes missions more than 3.5 times faster than baselines and reduces mission time by over 70%, while maintaining robust safety margins.

Conclusion: FACA offers a novel, practical means to balance safety and agility in multi-robot coordination under dynamic priorities, combining NL communication with a roundabout-inspired potential field to improve efficiency without compromising safety.

Abstract: Multi-robot systems are increasingly being used for critical applications such as rescuing injured people, delivering food and medicines, and monitoring key areas. These applications usually involve navigating at high speeds through constrained spaces such as small gaps. Navigating such constrained spaces becomes particularly challenging when the space is crowded with multiple heterogeneous agents all of which have urgent priorities. What makes the problem even harder is that during an active response situation, roles and priorities can quickly change on a dime without informing the other agents. In order to complete missions in such environments, robots must not only be safe, but also agile, able to dodge and change course at a moment's notice. In this paper, we propose FACA, a fair and agile collision avoidance approach where robots coordinate their tasks by talking to each other via natural language (just as people do). In FACA, robots balance safety with agility via a novel artificial potential field algorithm that creates an automatic ``roundabout'' effect whenever a conflict arises. Our experiments show that FACA achieves a improvement in efficiency, completing missions more than 3.5X faster than baselines with a time reduction of over 70% while maintaining robust safety margins.

*Hesam Mojtahedi,Reza Akhavian*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: BIM-prior–guided active sensing with risk-aware UAV-UGV fusion improves dynamic construction navigation by triggering re-scans to reduce uncertainty and enable safe replanning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Construction sites are dynamic and heterogeneous; static BIM priors and limited onboard sensing can lead to unsafe or inefficient navigation. Integrating BIM discrepancies with real-time LiDAR data aims to maintain an up-to-date occupancy map and quantify corridor risk for safer autonomy.

Method: A framework that continuously fuses aerial and ground LiDAR with BIM priors to build an evolving 2D occupancy map, and computes a unified corridor-risk metric combining occupancy uncertainty, BIM-map discrepancy, and clearance. When risk exceeds thresholds, the UAV performs risk-triggered re-scans to reduce uncertainty and enable replanning.

Result: Risk-triggered re-scanning reduced mean corridor risk by 58% and map entropy by 43% vs static BIM navigation; maintained clearance above 0.4 m. Relative to frontier-based exploration, achieved similar uncertainty reduction in half the mission time.

Conclusion: Integrating BIM priors with risk-adaptive aerial sensing yields scalable, uncertainty-aware autonomy for construction robotics.

Abstract: This paper presents a BIM-discrepancy-driven active sensing framework for cooperative navigation between unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) in dynamic construction environments. Traditional navigation approaches rely on static Building Information Modeling (BIM) priors or limited onboard perception. In contrast, our framework continuously fuses real-time LiDAR data from aerial and ground robots with BIM priors to maintain an evolving 2D occupancy map. We quantify navigation safety through a unified corridor-risk metric integrating occupancy uncertainty, BIM-map discrepancy, and clearance. When risk exceeds safety thresholds, the UAV autonomously re-scans affected regions to reduce uncertainty and enable safe replanning. Validation in PX4-Gazebo simulation with Robotec GPU LiDAR demonstrates that risk-triggered re-scanning reduces mean corridor risk by 58% and map entropy by 43% compared to static BIM navigation, while maintaining clearance margins above 0.4 m. Compared to frontier-based exploration, our approach achieves similar uncertainty reduction in half the mission time. These results demonstrate that integrating BIM priors with risk-adaptive aerial sensing enables scalable, uncertainty-aware autonomy for construction robotics.

*Yuhua Jiang,Shuang Cheng,Yan Ding,Feifei Gao,Biqing Qi*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: AsyncVLA introduces asynchronous flow matching for Vision-Language-Action models, enabling action-context awareness and self-correction via a confidence rater, with a unified SFM/AFM training scheme that improves data efficiency and achieves state-of-the-art results on robotic benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SFM-based VLA models rely on rigid, uniform time schedules and lack action context awareness, causing instability and error cascades in long-horizon tasks. There is a need for temporal flexibility, self-correction, and better cache utilization.

Method: Propose AsyncVLA with asynchronous flow matching (AFM) that generates action tokens on a non-uniform time schedule and is context-aware. Introduce a confidence rater to estimate the reliability of the initially generated actions and selectively refine inaccurate tokens before execution. Provide a unified training procedure that supports both SFM and AFM in a single model to improve KV-cache utilization.

Result: Extensive experiments on robotic manipulation benchmarks show AsyncVLA is data-efficient and exhibits self-correction. AFM’s asynchronous generation yields state-of-the-art results across general embodied evaluations.

Conclusion: Temporal flexibility and self-correction in VLA models can significantly improve stability and performance in long-horizon tasks. A unified SFM/AFM training paradigm enables efficient reuse of model components and resources, making AsyncVLA a strong, practical approach for general embodied AI.

Abstract: Vision-language-action (VLA) models have recently emerged as a powerful paradigm for building generalist robots. However, traditional VLA models that generate actions through flow matching (FM) typically rely on rigid and uniform time schedules, i.e., synchronous FM (SFM). Without action context awareness and asynchronous self-correction, SFM becomes unstable in long-horizon tasks, where a single action error can cascade into failure. In this work, we propose asynchronous flow matching VLA (AsyncVLA), a novel framework that introduces temporal flexibility in asynchronous FM (AFM) and enables self-correction in action generation. AsyncVLA breaks from the vanilla SFM in VLA models by generating the action tokens in a non-uniform time schedule with action context awareness. Besides, our method introduces the confidence rater to extract confidence of the initially generated actions, enabling the model to selectively refine inaccurate action tokens before execution. Moreover, we propose a unified training procedure for SFM and AFM that endows a single model with both modes, improving KV-cache utilization. Extensive experiments on robotic manipulation benchmarks demonstrate that AsyncVLA is data-efficient and exhibits self-correction ability. AsyncVLA achieves state-of-the-art results across general embodied evaluations due to its asynchronous generation in AFM. Our code is available at https://github.com/YuhuaJiang2002/AsyncVLA.

Conclusion: VLA-Pilot enables practical zero-shot deployment of pre-trained VLA models by eliminating the need for fine-tuning or extra data, enhancing real-world robustness and generalization.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have demonstrated significant potential in real-world robotic manipulation. However, pre-trained VLA policies still suffer from substantial performance degradation during downstream deployment. Although fine-tuning can mitigate this issue, its reliance on costly demonstration collection and intensive computation makes it impractical in real-world settings. In this work, we introduce VLA-Pilot, a plug-and-play inference-time policy steering method for zero-shot deployment of pre-trained VLA without any additional fine-tuning or data collection. We evaluate VLA-Pilot on six real-world downstream manipulation tasks across two distinct robotic embodiments, encompassing both in-distribution and out-of-distribution scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that VLA-Pilot substantially boosts the success rates of off-the-shelf pre-trained VLA policies, enabling robust zero-shot generalization to diverse tasks and embodiments.

*Felipe Ballen-Moreno,Pasquale Ferrentino,Milan Amighi,Bram Vanderborght,Tom Verstraten*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Dual-variable characterization (normal and tangential forces) for cuff–tissue interaction in wearable robots improves parameter identification and force/torque prediction beyond single-variable models, enabling more realistic simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding cuff-tissue interaction is essential for safety and comfort in wearable robots. Current single-variable fits oversimplify multi-DOF interactions and non-linear soft tissue behavior, limiting modeling accuracy.

Method: Introduce a dual-variable characterization using normal and tangential forces to identify material parameters and assess the impact of single-variable fitting. Analyze NMSE across scenarios and material models for cuff and limb interaction.

Result: Demonstrates that incorporating two variables reduces NMSE and yields more accurate force/torque responses compared to single-variable fits, providing a solid basis for near-realistic simulation of cuff–limb interactions.

Conclusion: Two-variable characterization is important for accurate cuff–limb interaction modeling in wearable robotics, enabling better safety/comfort-oriented cuff design and more faithful simulations.

Abstract: Understanding the physical interaction with wearable robots is essential to ensure safety and comfort. However, this interaction is complex in two key aspects: (1) the motion involved, and (2) the non-linear behaviour of soft tissues. Multiple approaches have been undertaken to better understand this interaction and to improve the quantitative metrics of physical interfaces or cuffs. As these two topics are closely interrelated, finite modelling and soft tissue characterisation offer valuable insights into pressure distribution and shear stress induced by the cuff. Nevertheless, current characterisation methods typically rely on a single fitting variable along one degree of freedom, which limits their applicability, given that interactions with wearable robots often involve multiple degrees of freedom. To address this limitation, this work introduces a dual-variable characterisation method, involving normal and tangential forces, aimed at identifying reliable material parameters and evaluating the impact of single-variable fitting on force and torque responses. This method demonstrates the importance of incorporating two variables into the characterisation process by analysing the normalized mean square error (NMSE) across different scenarios and material models, providing a foundation for simulation at the closest possible level, with a focus on the cuff and the human limb involved in the physical interaction between the user and the wearable robot.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A DRL-based MA-SLAM using a structured map and a global planner for efficient exploration in large-scale environments; validated in simulations and on a real UGV, achieving reduced exploration time and distance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Active SLAM methods struggle to scale to large, diverse environments, with long exploration times and suboptimal discovery paths; there is a need for compact map representations and planning that can guide long-range exploration.

Method: Introduce MA-SLAM with a structured map by discretizing space and fusing boundary points with the historical trajectory. Use a deep RL decision module fed by this map, and replace step-by-step action prediction with a global planner that targets long-range goals for exploration.

Result: Experiments in three simulation environments and deployment on a real unmanned ground vehicle show significant reductions in exploration duration and traveled distance compared with state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: MA-SLAM demonstrates that combining a compact, boundary-and-history based map with a long-range planning strategy improves exploration efficiency in large-scale environments, with successful real-world deployment; future work may address generalization and computation-related trade-offs.

Abstract: Active Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (Active SLAM) involves the strategic planning and precise control of a robotic system's movement in order to construct a highly accurate and comprehensive representation of its surrounding environment, which has garnered significant attention within the research community. While the current methods demonstrate efficacy in small and controlled settings, they face challenges when applied to large-scale and diverse environments, marked by extended periods of exploration and suboptimal paths of discovery. In this paper, we propose MA-SLAM, a Map-Aware Active SLAM system based on Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), designed to address the challenge of efficient exploration in large-scale environments. In pursuit of this objective, we put forward a novel structured map representation. By discretizing the spatial data and integrating the boundary points and the historical trajectory, the structured map succinctly and effectively encapsulates the visited regions, thereby serving as input for the deep reinforcement learning based decision module. Instead of sequentially predicting the next action step within the decision module, we have implemented an advanced global planner to optimize the exploration path by leveraging long-range target points. We conducted experiments in three simulation environments and deployed in a real unmanned ground vehicle (UGV), the results demonstrate that our approach significantly reduces both the duration and distance of exploration compared with state-of-the-art methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Monocular SLAM faces scale ambiguity and a trade-off between sparse geometric accuracy and dense mapping. Sparse methods lack detail, dense learning-based methods are computationally heavy, and lack of global loop closure limits robustness. A lightweight, edge-aware approach aims to deliver real-time, geometry-rich mapping on resource-constrained platforms.

Method: Edge-aware fusion of sparse keypoint-based pose estimation with dense edge reconstruction. Utilizes deep-learning depth prediction and edge detection, followed by optimization to align keypoints and edges for geometric consistency. Avoids global loop closures and heavy neural nets. Integrates inertial data with vision through an extended Kalman filter (EKF) to resolve scale ambiguity. Demonstrates real-time performance on low-power platforms (DJI Tello) with monocular camera and IMU, and validates navigation/obstacle avoidance indoors and on the TUM RGBD dataset.

Result: The system runs in real time on a DJI Tello drone with a monocular camera and inertial sensors, enabling robust autonomous navigation and obstacle avoidance in indoor corridors. It is also evaluated on the TUM RGBD dataset, supporting its practicality for real-time mapping and navigation in resource-constrained environments.

Conclusion: The proposed edge-aware monocular SLAM provides a practical, resource-efficient solution that combines sparse geometry with dense edge information and EKF-based scale fusion to enable real-time mapping and navigation without heavy loop-closure or large neural components. It demonstrates viability for low-power platforms and indoor exploration.

Abstract: Monocular simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) algorithms estimate drone poses and build a 3D map using a single camera. Current algorithms include sparse methods that lack detailed geometry, while learning-driven approaches produce dense maps but are computationally intensive. Monocular SLAM also faces scale ambiguities, which affect its accuracy. To address these challenges, we propose an edge-aware lightweight monocular SLAM system combining sparse keypoint-based pose estimation with dense edge reconstruction. Our method employs deep learning-based depth prediction and edge detection, followed by optimization to refine keypoints and edges for geometric consistency, without relying on global loop closure or heavy neural computations. We fuse inertial data with vision by using an extended Kalman filter to resolve scale ambiguity and improve accuracy. The system operates in real time on low-power platforms, as demonstrated on a DJI Tello drone with a monocular camera and inertial sensors. In addition, we demonstrate robust autonomous navigation and obstacle avoidance in indoor corridors and on the TUM RGBD dataset. Our approach offers an effective, practical solution to real-time mapping and navigation in resource-constrained environments.

Conclusion: The proposed pipeline enables practical autonomous multi-UAV exploration on consumer drones by combining depth-aware viewpoint selection, odometry-friendly trajectory planning, and balanced semi-distributed coordination, with demonstrated robustness in simulation.

Abstract: In our work, we extend the current state-of-the-art approach for autonomous multi-UAV exploration to consumer-level UAVs, such as the DJI Mini 3 Pro. We propose a pipeline that selects viewpoint pairs from which the depth can be estimated and plans the trajectory that satisfies motion constraints necessary for odometry estimation. For the multi-UAV exploration, we propose a semi-distributed communication scheme that distributes the workload in a balanced manner. We evaluate our model performance in simulation for different numbers of UAVs and prove its ability to safely explore the environment and reconstruct the map even with the hardware limitations of consumer-grade UAVs.

*Xiuxiu Qi,Yu Yang,Jiannong Cao,Luyao Bai,Chongshan Fan,Chengtai Cao,Hongpeng Wang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: CCoL is a continuous vision-language-action co-learning framework for language-conditioned manipulation that aligns semantic language with visuomotor representations to produce temporally smooth, robust actions and mitigate compounding errors in behavior cloning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Behavior cloning (BC) for manipulation suffers from compounding errors in sequential decisions, as well as physical discontinuities and semantic-physical misalignment between language, vision, and proprioception. Existing fixes (data augmentation, representation, or temporal abstraction) are insufficient.

Method: Continuous co-learning across vision, language, and proprioception, with bidirectional cross-attention to anchor language semantics to visuomotor representations. The approach produces smooth action trajectories and aligns semantics with the robot's visuomotor state, demonstrated across simulation suites and real-world 7-DoF experiments.

Result: Reported average 8.0% relative improvement across three simulation suites, up to 19.2% relative gain in human-demonstrated bimanual insertion tasks; real-world tests on a 7-DoF robot show generalization under unseen and noisy object states.

Conclusion: CCoL effectively mitigates semantic-physical misalignment and compounding errors by continuous multimodal co-learning and semantic grounding, delivering robust, temporally consistent manipulation with strong sim-to-real generalization.

Abstract: Language-conditioned manipulation facilitates human-robot interaction via behavioral cloning (BC), which learns control policies from human demonstrations and serves as a cornerstone of embodied AI. Overcoming compounding errors in sequential action decisions remains a central challenge to improving BC performance. Existing approaches mitigate compounding errors through data augmentation, expressive representation, or temporal abstraction. However, they suffer from physical discontinuities and semantic-physical misalignment, leading to inaccurate action cloning and intermittent execution. In this paper, we present Continuous vision-language-action Co-Learning with Semantic-Physical Alignment (CCoL), a novel BC framework that ensures temporally consistent execution and fine-grained semantic grounding. It generates robust and smooth action execution trajectories through continuous co-learning across vision, language, and proprioceptive inputs (e.g., robot internal states). Meanwhile, we anchor language semantics to visuomotor representations by a bidirectional cross-attention to learn contextual information for action generation, successfully overcoming the problem of semantic-physical misalignment. Extensive experiments show that CCoL achieves an average 8.0% relative improvement across three simulation suites, with up to 19.2% relative gain in human-demonstrated bimanual insertion tasks. Real-world tests on a 7-DoF robot further confirm CCoL's generalization under unseen and noisy object states.

Motivation: To enable robust multisensory manipulation by integrating vision, force, and proprioception, addressing RL difficulties under sensor noise and dynamics.

Method: Pretrain a transformer encoder with masked autoencoding to reconstruct multisensory observations from a subset of sensor embeddings; freeze the embeddings; employ an asymmetric policy architecture where the critic uses cross-attention to extract dynamic task-specific features from the frozen embeddings, while the actor receives a stable pooled representation for action.

Result: Faster learning and robust performance under sensor noise and dynamic changes; demonstrated in simulation and real-world contact-rich manipulation; succeeds with as few as ~6,000 online interactions.

Conclusion: MSDP provides a simple, effective framework for learning expressive multisensory representations that support robust, sample-efficient policy learning in complex robotic control tasks, leveraging cross-modal prediction and an asymmetric policy architecture.

Abstract: Effective contact-rich manipulation requires robots to synergistically leverage vision, force, and proprioception. However, Reinforcement Learning agents struggle to learn in such multisensory settings, especially amidst sensory noise and dynamic changes. We propose MultiSensory Dynamic Pretraining (MSDP), a novel framework for learning expressive multisensory representations tailored for task-oriented policy learning. MSDP is based on masked autoencoding and trains a transformer-based encoder by reconstructing multisensory observations from only a subset of sensor embeddings, leading to cross-modal prediction and sensor fusion. For downstream policy learning, we introduce a novel asymmetric architecture, where a cross-attention mechanism allows the critic to extract dynamic, task-specific features from the frozen embeddings, while the actor receives a stable pooled representation to guide its actions. Our method demonstrates accelerated learning and robust performance under diverse perturbations, including sensor noise, and changes in object dynamics. Evaluations in multiple challenging, contact-rich robot manipulation tasks in simulation and the real world showcase the effectiveness of MSDP. Our approach exhibits strong robustness to perturbations and achieves high success rates on the real robot with as few as 6,000 online interactions, offering a simple yet powerful solution for complex multisensory robotic control.

### [153] [Mutation Testing for Industrial Robotic Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14432)
*Marcela Gonçalves dos Santos,Sylvain Hallé,Fábio Petrillo*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Adapts mutation testing to industrial robotic systems (IRS) via domain-specific operators for high-level actions, enabling more informative mutants and fewer invalid/equivalent mutants.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional mutation operators miss the semantics of robot actions and sensor interactions in IRS, risking ineffective test evaluation and safety-critical failures; there is a need for mutation operators tailored to the robotic domain and its message-based control.

Method: Define domain-specific mutation operators at high-level read/write operations (e.g., movement, gripper actions, sensor readings, and sensor noise injection); generate meaningful mutants by mutating these operations; apply to a pick-and-place scenario; compare against conventional operators in terms of informativeness and invalid/equivalent mutants.

Result: The domain-specific mutants are more informative and yield fewer invalid or equivalent mutants than conventional operators, indicating improved test suite quality for IRS.

Conclusion: Domain-specific mutation operators for IRS can enhance test effectiveness and safety by better reflecting robot semantics; this approach holds promise for improving reliability in industrial robotic software.

Abstract: Industrial robotic systems (IRS) are increasingly deployed in diverse environments, where failures can result in severe accidents and costly downtime. Ensuring the reliability of the software controlling these systems is therefore critical. Mutation testing, a technique widely used in software engineering, evaluates the effectiveness of test suites by introducing small faults, or mutants, into the code. However, traditional mutation operators are poorly suited to robotic programs, which involve message-based commands and interactions with the physical world. This paper explores the adaptation of mutation testing to IRS by defining domain-specific mutation operators that capture the semantics of robot actions and sensor readings. We propose a methodology for generating meaningful mutants at the level of high-level read and write operations, including movement, gripper actions, and sensor noise injection. An empirical study on a pick-and-place scenario demonstrates that our approach produces more informative mutants and reduces the number of invalid or equivalent cases compared to conventional operators. Results highlight the potential of mutation testing to enhance test suite quality and contribute to safer, more reliable industrial robotic systems.

### [154] [Achieving Safe Control Online through Integration of Harmonic Control Lyapunov-Barrier Functions with Unsafe Object-Centric Action Policies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14434)
*Marlow Fawn,Matthias Scheutz*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A method to enforce formal safety on RL-based robot policies by using Harmonic Control Lyapunov-Barrier Functions (HCLBFs) derived from STL to generate safety certificates that modify policy commands, ensuring safety while preserving task goals; demonstrated on a simple, object-centric, force-based RL policy for a stationary robot arm to avoid table-top obstacles; generalizable to more complex specs and dynamic tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide formal safety guarantees for robot policies learned via reinforcement learning, especially in environments with obstacles and safety constraints, by embedding STL-based safety specifications into a safety-certifying layer.

Method: Combine HCLBF-derived safety certificates with an arbitrary robot policy (e.g., RL-based). The certificates constrain the policy to satisfy STL-specified safety requirements, producing safety-preserving commands without destroying task-driven behavior. Demonstrated via a proof-of-concept: an object-centric force-based RL policy for a stationary robot arm that avoids collisions with obstacles on a tabletop.

Result: The integrated approach enables the policy to avoid collisions while pursuing the movement task, as demonstrated in a proof-of-concept implementation.

Conclusion: The method can be extended to more complex STL specifications and dynamic task scenarios, offering a general framework for safety guarantees for policy-guided robotic control.

Abstract: We propose a method for combining Harmonic Control Lyapunov-Barrier Functions (HCLBFs) derived from Signal Temporal Logic (STL) specifications with any given robot policy to turn an unsafe policy into a safe one with formal guarantees.  The two components are combined via HCLBF-derived safety certificates, thus producing commands that preserve both safety and task-driven behavior.  We demonstrate with a simple proof-of-concept implementation for an object-centric force-based policy trained through reinforcement learning for a movement task of a stationary robot arm that is able to avoid colliding with obstacles on a table top after combining the policy with the safety constraints.  The proposed method can be generalized to more complex specifications and dynamic task settings.

TL;DR: Magnetically actuated flexible endoscope with teleoperation/semi-autonomy and real-time mosaics enables fetoscopic laser coagulation in open spaces; validated in vivo in sheep.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MIS in open cavities lacks anatomical constraints and has poor visualization; flexible endoscopes promise dexterity but are hard to control; need enhanced situational awareness and safe tissue interaction.

Method: Developed a magnetically actuated flexible endoscope with teleoperated and semi-autonomous navigation; real-time endoscopic scene mosaicking for augmented visualization; validated through fetoscopic laser coagulation in an ovine model.

Result: Feasibility demonstrated: platform enables targeted laser ablations with enhanced visualization; in vivo ovine validation supports applicability to complex MIS in open spaces.

Conclusion: The platform addresses core MIS limitations in open spaces (dexterity, control, visualization, safety) and shows promise for expanding fetoscopic MIS; further clinical and experimental validation is warranted.

Abstract: Flexible robots hold great promise for enhancing minimally invasive surgery (MIS) by providing superior dexterity, precise control, and safe tissue interaction. Yet, translating these advantages into endoscopic interventions within open cavities remains challenging. The lack of anatomical constraints and the inherent flexibility of such devices complicate their control, while the limited field of view of endoscopes restricts situational awareness. We present a robotic platform designed to overcome these challenges and demonstrate its potential in fetoscopic laser coagulation, a complex MIS procedure typically performed only by highly experienced surgeons. Our system combines a magnetically actuated flexible endoscope with teleoperated and semi-autonomous navigation capabilities for performing targeted laser ablations. To enhance surgical awareness, the platform reconstructs real-time mosaics of the endoscopic scene, providing an extended and continuous visual context. The ability of this system to address the key limitations of MIS in open spaces is validated in vivo in an ovine model.

*Jan Quenzel,Valerij Sekin,Daniel Schleich,Alexander Miller,Merlin Stampa,Norbert Pahlke,Christof Röhrig,Sven Behnke*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: An automated firefighting assistance system combines a motorized fire monitor on a ladder with an autonomous UAV that localizes heat sources and guides a water jet, improving targeting in large industrial fires.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fires in large industrial facilities create visual obstructions and location uncertainty, leading to increased damage and prolonged operations; an automated localization and targeting aid could enhance accuracy and efficiency.

Method: A UAV operates within a geodata-derived obstacle-free flight funnel to autonomously detect heat sources. An operator selects a fire target on a handheld controller; the UAV then triangulates between two poses to refine localization, while the system steers the motorized fire monitor so the water jet reaches the detected heat source.

Result: In preliminary tests, the system successfully localized multiple heat sources and directed the water jet toward the fires.

Conclusion: The approach shows promise for improving targeting accuracy and firefighting efficiency in large facilities, but requires broader testing and real-world validation.

Abstract: Fires in industrial facilities pose special challenges to firefighters, e.g., due to the sheer size and scale of the buildings. The resulting visual obstructions impair firefighting accuracy, further compounded by inaccurate assessments of the fire's location. Such imprecision simultaneously increases the overall damage and prolongs the fire-brigades operation unnecessarily.
  We propose an automated assistance system for firefighting using a motorized fire monitor on a turntable ladder with aerial support from an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). The UAV flies autonomously within an obstacle-free flight funnel derived from geodata, detecting and localizing heat sources. An operator supervises the operation on a handheld controller and selects a fire target in reach. After the selection, the UAV automatically plans and traverses between two triangulation poses for continued fire localization. Simultaneously, our system steers the fire monitor to ensure the water jet reaches the detected heat source. In preliminary tests, our assistance system successfully localized multiple heat sources and directed a water jet towards the fires.

### [157] [Masked IRL: LLM-Guided Reward Disambiguation from Demonstrations and Language](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14565)
*Minyoung Hwang,Alexandra Forsey-Smerek,Nathaniel Dennler,Andreea Bobu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Masked IRL combines demonstrations and language to infer state-relevance masks via LLMs, improving sample efficiency and robustness in reward learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overfitting in reward models due to limited demonstrations; language can specify what matters, but naive conditioning fails; ambiguity in language; need a method that fuses both inputs effectively.

Method: Use Masked IRL framework; LLMs infer state-relevance masks from language; enforce invariance to irrelevant state components; when language is ambiguous, LLM reasoning clarifies within demonstration context.

Result: Outperforms prior language-conditioned IRL by up to 15% and uses up to 4.7x less data; improves sample efficiency, generalization, and robustness to ambiguous language, demonstrated in simulation and on real robot.

Conclusion: Shows complementary information in demonstrations and language; demonstrates practical efficacy of masked IRL; potential for broader adoption and extension to more tasks; future work could explore other modalities, scaling, and real-world deployment.

Abstract: Robots can adapt to user preferences by learning reward functions from demonstrations, but with limited data, reward models often overfit to spurious correlations and fail to generalize. This happens because demonstrations show robots how to do a task but not what matters for that task, causing the model to focus on irrelevant state details. Natural language can more directly specify what the robot should focus on, and, in principle, disambiguate between many reward functions consistent with the demonstrations. However, existing language-conditioned reward learning methods typically treat instructions as simple conditioning signals, without fully exploiting their potential to resolve ambiguity. Moreover, real instructions are often ambiguous themselves, so naive conditioning is unreliable. Our key insight is that these two input types carry complementary information: demonstrations show how to act, while language specifies what is important. We propose Masked Inverse Reinforcement Learning (Masked IRL), a framework that uses large language models (LLMs) to combine the strengths of both input types. Masked IRL infers state-relevance masks from language instructions and enforces invariance to irrelevant state components. When instructions are ambiguous, it uses LLM reasoning to clarify them in the context of the demonstrations. In simulation and on a real robot, Masked IRL outperforms prior language-conditioned IRL methods by up to 15% while using up to 4.7 times less data, demonstrating improved sample-efficiency, generalization, and robustness to ambiguous language.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: DSBench is a comprehensive driving-safety benchmark for Vision-Language Models, covering external environmental risks and in-cabin driving behavior across 10 categories (28 subcategories), with 98K instances; it reveals safety gaps and shows that fine-tuning improves safety; tools and checkpoints will be public.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address safety concerns in VLM-driven autonomous driving by lacking benchmarks that jointly assess external and in-cabin safety.

Method: Define DSBench with two risk areas, 10 categories/28 subcategories; compile a 98K-instance dataset; evaluate open/closed-source VLMs; fine-tune on the dataset; release toolkit, code, and model checkpoints.

Result: VLMs exhibit degraded performance in safety-critical scenarios; fine-tuning DSBench data significantly improves safety performance; dataset enables progress in safety for autonomous driving.

Conclusion: DSBench provides a unified, large-scale benchmark and dataset for driving safety in VLMs, guiding safer deployment; public release of resources will foster advancement.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) show great promise for autonomous driving, but their suitability for safety-critical scenarios is largely unexplored, raising safety concerns. This issue arises from the lack of comprehensive benchmarks that assess both external environmental risks and in-cabin driving behavior safety simultaneously. To bridge this critical gap, we introduce DSBench, the first comprehensive Driving Safety Benchmark designed to assess a VLM's awareness of various safety risks in a unified manner. DSBench encompasses two major categories: external environmental risks and in-cabin driving behavior safety, divided into 10 key categories and a total of 28 sub-categories. This comprehensive evaluation covers a wide range of scenarios, ensuring a thorough assessment of VLMs' performance in safety-critical contexts. Extensive evaluations across various mainstream open-source and closed-source VLMs reveal significant performance degradation under complex safety-critical situations, highlighting urgent safety concerns. To address this, we constructed a large dataset of 98K instances focused on in-cabin and external safety scenarios, showing that fine-tuning on this dataset significantly enhances the safety performance of existing VLMs and paves the way for advancing autonomous driving technology. The benchmark toolkit, code, and model checkpoints will be publicly accessible.

*Qingwei Ben,Botian Xu,Kailin Li,Feiyu Jia,Wentao Zhang,Jingping Wang,Jingbo Wang,Dahua Lin,Jiangmiao Pang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Gallant introduces a voxel-grid LiDAR perception approach with a z-grouped 2D CNN to drive a single end-to-end policy for humanoid locomotion in 3D environments, supported by a LiDAR simulator for scalable training and strong real-world transfer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing perception pipelines rely on depth images or elevation maps that provide partial, locally flattened views and struggle to capture full 3D structure needed for robust locomotion in complex terrains; there is a need for global 3D perception and end-to-end optimization for humanoid robots.

Method: Represent the scene with a voxel grid derived from LiDAR data; use a z-grouped 2D CNN to map this 3D-structured representation to a control policy; train end-to-end with a high-fidelity LiDAR simulator that generates realistic, diverse observations to support scalable LiDAR-based training and sim-to-real consistency.

Result: The approach broadens perceptual coverage beyond ground-level obstacles to include lateral clutter, overhead constraints, multi-level structures, and narrow passages; a single policy achieves near 100% success in challenging tasks like stair climbing and stepping onto elevated platforms, demonstrating improved end-to-end optimization.

Conclusion: Gallant demonstrates that voxelized LiDAR perception coupled with a z-grouped CNN can enable robust, globally-aware humanoid locomotion in 3D constrained terrains with strong sim-to-real performance, highlighting the importance of comprehensive 3D perception and end-to-end optimization in locomotion systems.

Abstract: Robust humanoid locomotion requires accurate and globally consistent perception of the surrounding 3D environment. However, existing perception modules, mainly based on depth images or elevation maps, offer only partial and locally flattened views of the environment, failing to capture the full 3D structure. This paper presents Gallant, a voxel-grid-based framework for humanoid locomotion and local navigation in 3D constrained terrains. It leverages voxelized LiDAR data as a lightweight and structured perceptual representation, and employs a z-grouped 2D CNN to map this representation to the control policy, enabling fully end-to-end optimization. A high-fidelity LiDAR simulation that dynamically generates realistic observations is developed to support scalable, LiDAR-based training and ensure sim-to-real consistency. Experimental results show that Gallant's broader perceptual coverage facilitates the use of a single policy that goes beyond the limitations of previous methods confined to ground-level obstacles, extending to lateral clutter, overhead constraints, multi-level structures, and narrow passages. Gallant also firstly achieves near 100% success rates in challenging scenarios such as stair climbing and stepping onto elevated platforms through improved end-to-end optimization.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: NORA-1.5 enhances a pre-trained NORA VLA model with a flow-matching action expert and reward-guided post-training, yielding robust improvements in simulation and real-world benchmarks across embodiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-language-action models struggle with reliability and cross-embodiment generalization; enhancing architectural inductive biases and aligning policies via rewards can improve real-world deployment.

Method: Extend NORA with a flow-matching-based action expert (NORA-1.5); develop reward models combining an action-conditioned world model and a deviation-from-ground-truth heuristic; create preference datasets and apply direct preference optimization (DPO) to adapt to different embodiments; evaluate in simulated and real-robot settings.

Result: NORA-1.5 outperforms NORA and several state-of-the-art VLA models on both simulated and real benchmarks; reward-guided post-training consistently improves task success in both domains.

Conclusion: NORA-1.5 plus reward-guided post-training offer a practical path to more dependable embodied agents suitable for real-world deployment.

Abstract: Vision--language--action (VLA) models have recently shown promising performance on a variety of embodied tasks, yet they still fall short in reliability and generalization, especially when deployed across different embodiments or real-world environments. In this work, we introduce NORA-1.5, a VLA model built from the pre-trained NORA backbone by adding to it a flow-matching-based action expert. This architectural enhancement alone yields substantial performance gains, enabling NORA-1.5 to outperform NORA and several state-of-the-art VLA models across both simulated and real-world benchmarks. To further improve robustness and task success, we develop a set of reward models for post-training VLA policies. Our rewards combine (i) an action-conditioned world model (WM) that evaluates whether generated actions lead toward the desired goal, and (ii) a deviation-from-ground-truth heuristic that distinguishes good actions from poor ones. Using these reward signals, we construct preference datasets and adapt NORA-1.5 to target embodiments through direct preference optimization (DPO). Extensive evaluations show that reward-driven post-training consistently improves performance in both simulation and real-robot settings, demonstrating significant VLA model-reliability gains through simple yet effective reward models. Our findings highlight NORA-1.5 and reward-guided post-training as a viable path toward more dependable embodied agents suitable for real-world deployment.

### [161] [Robust Verification of Controllers under State Uncertainty via Hamilton-Jacobi Reachability Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14755)
*Albert Lin,Alessandro Pinto,Somil Bansal*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: RoVer-CoRe is an HJ reachability-based framework for verifying perception-based controllers under perceptual uncertainty by composing controller, observation, and state estimation into a closed-loop; demonstrates safety guarantees in aircraft taxiing and NN-based rover navigation; code released.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Perception-based controllers pose formal verification challenges due to perceptual uncertainty and complex, nonlinear/learning-based components. Existing verification methods rely on approximate reachability and are often overly conservative or restrictive. Hamilton-Jacobi reachability offers worst-case guarantees for nonlinear systems, but has been underutilized for perception-based systems.

Method: RoVer-CoRe concatenates the system controller, observation function, and state estimation into an equivalent closed-loop system that is compatible with existing HJ reachability frameworks. It develops formal safety verification and robust controller design methods within this closed-loop, and validates the approach on case studies.

Result: Case studies on aircraft taxiing and neural-network-based rover navigation demonstrate the framework’s efficacy in providing safety guarantees and enabling robust control design; code is available.

Conclusion: RoVer-CoRe is the first Hamilton-Jacobi reachability-based framework specifically for verification of perception-based systems under perceptual uncertainty, enabling formal safety verification and robust controller design with potential broad applicability in perception-guided autonomous systems.

Abstract: As perception-based controllers for autonomous systems become increasingly popular in the real world, it is important that we can formally verify their safety and performance despite perceptual uncertainty. Unfortunately, the verification of such systems remains challenging, largely due to the complexity of the controllers, which are often nonlinear, nonconvex, learning-based, and/or black-box. Prior works propose verification algorithms that are based on approximate reachability methods, but they often restrict the class of controllers and systems that can be handled or result in overly conservative analyses. Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability analysis is a popular formal verification tool for general nonlinear systems that can compute optimal reachable sets under worst-case system uncertainties; however, its application to perception-based systems is currently underexplored. In this work, we propose RoVer-CoRe, a framework for the Robust Verification of Controllers via HJ Reachability. To the best of our knowledge, RoVer-CoRe is the first HJ reachability-based framework for the verification of perception-based systems under perceptual uncertainty. Our key insight is to concatenate the system controller, observation function, and the state estimation modules to obtain an equivalent closed-loop system that is readily compatible with existing reachability frameworks. Within RoVer-CoRe, we propose novel methods for formal safety verification and robust controller design. We demonstrate the efficacy of the framework in case studies involving aircraft taxiing and NN-based rover navigation. Code is available at the link in the footnote.

TL;DR: HMC enables learning-based loco-manipulation by blending multiple control modalities (position, impedance, force-position) via a heterogeneous meta-controller and policy, achieving robust real-world performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Purely positional controllers struggle with contact dynamics and payload variability; leveraging heterogeneous control and large-scale data improves robustness in real-world manipulation.

Method: Introduce HMC-Controller to blend actions in torque space; HMC-Policy to combine controllers via mixture-of-experts; train on large-scale position-only data and force-aware demonstrations; validate on a real humanoid robot.

Result: Achieved over 50% relative improvement over baselines on tasks like compliant table wiping and drawer opening.

Conclusion: HMC provides effective, robust loco-manipulation by jointly leveraging multiple control modalities and meta-learning to handle contact-rich dynamics in real-world tasks.

Abstract: Learning from real-world robot demonstrations holds promise for interacting with complex real-world environments. However, the complexity and variability of interaction dynamics often cause purely positional controllers to struggle with contacts or varying payloads. To address this, we propose a Heterogeneous Meta-Control (HMC) framework for Loco-Manipulation that adaptively stitches multiple control modalities: position, impedance, and hybrid force-position. We first introduce an interface, HMC-Controller, for blending actions from different control profiles continuously in the torque space. HMC-Controller facilitates both teleoperation and policy deployment. Then, to learn a robust force-aware policy, we propose HMC-Policy to unify different controllers into a heterogeneous architecture. We adopt a mixture-of-experts style routing to learn from large-scale position-only data and fine-grained force-aware demonstrations. Experiments on a real humanoid robot show over 50% relative improvement vs. baselines on challenging tasks such as compliant table wiping and drawer opening, demonstrating the efficacy of HMC.

### [163] [Automated proving in planar geometry based on the complex number identity method and elimination](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14728)
*Zoltán Kovács,Xicheng Peng*

Main category: cs.CG

TL;DR: An automated procedure for proving complex-number identities using elimination ideals; translates each real-relational hypothesis into h_i - r_i and the thesis t into t - r, clears denominators, adds a slack variable, and forms an elimination ideal I in Q[r, r_i]. By eliminating free and relational point variables, I yields a conclusive decision criterion; if r_1, r_2, ... are real and a linear polynomial p(r) in I exists, then r must be real (barring division-by-zero in expressions for r). Implemented in Mathematica, Maple, Giac, with a prototype in GeoGebra.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To automate the verification of complex-number identities and reduce manual symbolic manipulation, leveraging elimination ideals to derive realness and existence constraints from polynomial relations.

Method: Rewrite h_i as h_i - r_i and t as t - r, clear denominators, introduce a slack variable, form the elimination ideal I in Q[r, r_1, r_2, ...], and eliminate all free and relational point variables. Analyze linear polynomials in I to deduce realness constraints on r when r_i are known real.

Result: A fully automated, algebraic proof procedure for complex-number identities. The approach yields conclusive results from I and is demonstrated in Mathematica, Maple, Giac; a GeoGebra prototype showcases an experimental integration.

Conclusion: The framework provides a declarative, automated method for complex-number identity proofs with potential integration into dynamic geometry tools; it also clarifies the realness consequences given real-relational parameters and highlights practical caveats such as division-by-zero handling.

Abstract: We improve the complex number identity proving method to a fully automated procedure, based on elimination ideals. By using declarative equations or rewriting each real-relational hypothesis $h_i$ to $h_i-r_i$, and the thesis $t$ to $t-r$, clearing the denominators and introducing an extra expression with a slack variable, we eliminate all free and relational point variables. From the obtained ideal $I$ in $\mathbb{Q}[r,r_1,r_2,\ldots]$ we can find a conclusive result. It plays an important role that if $r_1,r_2,\ldots$ are real, $r$ must also be real if there is a linear polynomial $p(r)\in I$, unless division by zero occurs when expressing $r$. Our results are presented in Mathematica, Maple and in a new version of the Giac computer algebra system. Finally, we present a prototype of the automated procedure in an experimental version of the dynamic geometry software GeoGebra.

*Saif Ur Rehman,Wajid Yousuf*

TL;DR: XPINN with space-time domain decomposition and Rankine-Hugoniot coupling solves Buckley-Leverett nonlinear hyperbolic PDEs with shocks more efficiently than PINNs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need to accurately resolve steep gradients and discontinuities in nonlinear hyperbolic PDEs without prohibitive computational cost; PINNs struggle with such features.

Method: Decompose domain into evolving pre-shock and post-shock regions; train region-specific subnetworks; enforce flux continuity across shock via Rankine-Hugoniot conditions; apply XPINN to Buckley-Leverett with nonconvex flux; avoid artificial diffusion.

Result: Accurate capture of discontinuous saturation fronts and wave interactions; improved stability, faster convergence, higher resolution with smaller models and fewer parameters; outperforms standard PINNs.

Conclusion: XPINN is effective and scalable for challenging hyperbolic PDEs in multiphase flow; code available on GitHub.

Abstract: The accurate solution of nonlinear hyperbolic partial differential equations (PDEs) remains a central challenge in computational science due to the presence of steep gradients, discontinuities, and multiscale structures that make conventional discretization-based solvers computationally demanding. Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) embed the governing equations into the learning process, enabling mesh-free solution of PDEs, yet they often struggle to capture steep gradients, discontinuities, and complex nonlinear wave interactions. To address these limitations, this study employs the Extended Physics-Informed Neural Network (XPINN) framework to solve the nonlinear Buckley-Leverett equation with a nonconvex flux function, which models immiscible two-phase flow in porous media. The computational domain is dynamically decomposed in space and time into evolving pre-shock and post-shock regions, allowing localized subnetworks to efficiently learn distinct flow behaviors. Coupling between subnetworks is achieved through the Rankine-Hugoniot jump condition, which enforces physically consistent flux continuity across the moving shock interface. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed XPINN approach accurately captures discontinuous saturation fronts and compound wave interactions without requiring artificial diffusion or entropy corrections. Compared to standard PINNs, the XPINN framework achieves superior stability, faster convergence, and enhanced resolution of nonlinear wave dynamics using smaller, domain-specific models with fewer trainable parameters, establishing it as an effective and scalable tool for solving challenging hyperbolic PDEs in multiphase flow problems. The code of this work is available on github.com/saifkhanengr/XPINN-for-Buckley-Leverett.

### [165] [Blurred Encoding for Trajectory Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13741)
*Silin Zhou,Yao Chen,Shuo Shang,Lisi Chen,Bingsheng He,Ryosuke Shibasaki*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: BLUE (BLUrred Encoding) is a hierarchical trajectory representation method that uses multi-level GPS patches to preserve fine-grained spatio-temporal details while capturing high-level travel patterns, implemented as an encoder-decoder Transformer pyramid trained on trajectory reconstruction, and it outperforms 8 SOTA TRL methods across 3 tasks by ~30.9%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional TRL methods compress GPS data into grid or road-level representations, which loses fine-grained spatial-temporal details. BLUE aims to retain both fine-grained and coarse-grained information via a progressive, multi-level encoding with a pyramid Transformer.

Method: Construct hierarchical patches by gradually reducing GPS precision. At each patch level, use a Transformer to learn the trajectory embedding. The encoder uses pooling to build higher-level representations; the decoder uses up-resolution to inform lower levels. The model is trained with a trajectory reconstruction objective using MSE.

Result: BLUE consistently outperforms 8 SOTA TRL methods on 3 downstream tasks, with an average improvement of 30.90%. Code is released at the provided GitHub link.

Conclusion: A hierarchical, pyramid Transformer-based encoding with multi-level patches effectively preserves fine-grained details and captures global travel patterns, yielding strong TRL performance gains.

Abstract: Trajectory representation learning (TRL) maps trajectories to vector embeddings and facilitates tasks such as trajectory classification and similarity search. State-of-the-art (SOTA) TRL methods transform raw GPS trajectories to grid or road trajectories to capture high-level travel semantics, i.e., regions and roads. However, they lose fine-grained spatial-temporal details as multiple GPS points are grouped into a single grid cell or road segment. To tackle this problem, we propose the BLUrred Encoding method, dubbed BLUE, which gradually reduces the precision of GPS coordinates to create hierarchical patches with multiple levels. The low-level patches are small and preserve fine-grained spatial-temporal details, while the high-level patches are large and capture overall travel patterns. To complement different patch levels with each other, our BLUE is an encoder-decoder model with a pyramid structure. At each patch level, a Transformer is used to learn the trajectory embedding at the current level, while pooling prepares inputs for the higher level in the encoder, and up-resolution provides guidance for the lower level in the decoder. BLUE is trained using the trajectory reconstruction task with the MSE loss. We compare BLUE with 8 SOTA TRL methods for 3 downstream tasks, the results show that BLUE consistently achieves higher accuracy than all baselines, outperforming the best-performing baselines by an average of 30.90%.

*Ci Lin,Tet Yeap,Iluju Kiringa,Biwei Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DeepDefense uses cross-layer Gradient-Feature Alignment regularization to align input gradients with internal features, smoothing tangential directions and reducing adversarial sensitivity. It yields strong robustness gains on CIFAR-10, including significantly improved resistance to both gradient-based and optimization-based attacks; the method is architecture-agnostic and simple to implement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Adversarial perturbations reveal that deep networks have highly sensitive decision boundaries. A defense that reduces gradient sensitivity and flattens the loss landscape, particularly in tangential directions where attacks are effective, is needed.

Method: Apply Gradient-Feature Alignment (GFA) regularization across multiple network layers to align input gradients with internal feature representations, promoting a smoother loss landscape in tangential directions. The paper provides a theoretical decomposition of perturbations into radial and tangential components and shows that alignment suppresses tangential loss variation.

Result: Empirically, on CIFAR-10, CNNs trained with DeepDefense outperform standard adversarial training by up to 15.2% under APGD attacks and 24.7% under FGSM attacks. Against optimization-based attacks like DeepFool and EADEN, the method requires 20–30× larger perturbations to cause misclassification. The approach is architecture-agnostic and simple to implement, delivering strong robustness improvements.

Conclusion: Gradient-Feature Alignment regularization yields stronger adversarial robustness by flattening the loss landscape in critical tangential directions, offering a practical and effective defense applicable across architectures.

Abstract: Deep neural networks are known to be vulnerable to adversarial perturbations, which are small and carefully crafted inputs that lead to incorrect predictions. In this paper, we propose DeepDefense, a novel defense framework that applies Gradient-Feature Alignment (GFA) regularization across multiple layers to suppress adversarial vulnerability. By aligning input gradients with internal feature representations, DeepDefense promotes a smoother loss landscape in tangential directions, thereby reducing the model's sensitivity to adversarial noise.
  We provide theoretical insights into how adversarial perturbation can be decomposed into radial and tangential components and demonstrate that alignment suppresses loss variation in tangential directions, where most attacks are effective. Empirically, our method achieves significant improvements in robustness across both gradient-based and optimization-based attacks. For example, on CIFAR-10, CNN models trained with DeepDefense outperform standard adversarial training by up to 15.2% under APGD attacks and 24.7% under FGSM attacks. Against optimization-based attacks such as DeepFool and EADEN, DeepDefense requires 20 to 30 times higher perturbation magnitudes to cause misclassification, indicating stronger decision boundaries and a flatter loss landscape. Our approach is architecture-agnostic, simple to implement, and highly effective, offering a promising direction for improving the adversarial robustness of deep learning models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current bias analysis methods in diffusion models are either limited to predefined categories or rely on manually interpreted latent directions, hindering scalability and discovery of subtle or unexpected patterns.

Method: SCALEX extracts semantically meaningful directions in H-space using only natural-language prompts, enabling zero-shot interpretation without retraining or labeling.

Conclusion: SCALEX makes bias analysis in diffusion models more scalable, interpretable, and extensible, enabling large-scale discovery of internal associations and facilitating cross-concept comparisons.

Abstract: Image generation models frequently encode social biases, including stereotypes tied to gender, race, and profession. Existing methods for analyzing these biases in diffusion models either focus narrowly on predefined categories or depend on manual interpretation of latent directions. These constraints limit scalability and hinder the discovery of subtle or unanticipated patterns.

TL;DR: Region-based channel selection with multi-domain feature fusion for motor imagery EEG improves SVM classification; regional grouping reduces dimensionality; CSP, FCM, and TSM features per region are fused.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce data dimensionality and improve physiologically relevant feature extraction in BCI by selecting region-specific channels for motor imagery tasks.

Method: Group EEG channels by brain regions, select region-relevant channels for MI; extract CSP (spatial patterns), Fuzzy C-means clustering features, and Tangent Space Mapping features for each region; concatenate into a single feature vector and classify with SVM for tasks left hand, right hand, and right foot; validated on IVA and I datasets from BCI Competition III/IV.

Result: Achieves classification accuracies of 90.77% on IVA and 84.50% on I, outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: Region-based channel selection combined with multi-domain feature fusion enhances MI-EEG classification accuracy and reduces dimensionality, offering a more computationally efficient and neurophysiologically relevant BCI pipeline.

Abstract: A Brain Computer Interface (BCI) connects the human brain to the outside world, providing a direct communication channel. Electroencephalography (EEG) signals are commonly used in BCIs to reflect cognitive patterns related to motor function activities. However, due to the multichannel nature of EEG signals, explicit information processing is crucial to lessen computational complexity in BCI systems. This study proposes an innovative method based on brain region-specific channel selection and multi-domain feature fusion to improve classification accuracy. The novelty of the proposed approach lies in region-based channel selection, where EEG channels are grouped according to their functional relevance to distinct brain regions. By selecting channels based on specific regions involved in motor imagery (MI) tasks, this technique eliminates irrelevant channels, reducing data dimensionality and improving computational efficiency. This also ensures that the extracted features are more reflective of the brain actual activity related to motor tasks. Three distinct feature extraction methods Common Spatial Pattern (CSP), Fuzzy C-means clustering, and Tangent Space Mapping (TSM), are applied to each group of channels based on their brain region. Each method targets different characteristics of the EEG signal: CSP focuses on spatial patterns, Fuzzy C means identifies clusters within the data, and TSM captures non-linear patterns in the signal. The combined feature vector is used to classify motor imagery tasks (left hand, right hand, and right foot) using Support Vector Machine (SVM). The proposed method was validated on publicly available benchmark EEG datasets (IVA and I) from the BCI competition III and IV. The results show that the approach outperforms existing methods, achieving classification accuracies of 90.77% and 84.50% for datasets IVA and I, respectively.

### [169] [Robustness of LLM-enabled vehicle trajectory prediction under data security threats](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13753)
*Feilong Wang,Fuqiang Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LLM-based vehicle trajectory predictors are vulnerable to adversarial prompts; a one-feature differential evolution attack on a single kinematic input feature can significantly disrupt predictions in a black-box setting, revealing a critical robustness gap for safety-critical ITS.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Assess adversarial vulnerability and trustworthiness of LLM-enabled trajectory prediction in automated driving, addressing a gap in robustness understanding for safety-critical ITS deployments.

Method: Black-box attack using a one-feature differential evolution (DE) to perturb a single kinematic feature of surrounding-vehicle data fed as prompts to an LLM-based predictor; evaluation on the highD dataset; analysis of failure modes and potential mitigations.

Result: Small, physically plausible perturbations can cause substantial degradation or misprediction of trajectories and lane-change intentions; demonstrates a trade-off between accuracy and robustness and reveals failure mechanisms.

Conclusion: First insights into adversarial vulnerabilities of LLM-driven automated vehicle models; underscores need for robustness-oriented design and defense strategies in future LLM-based intelligent transportation systems.

Abstract: The integration of large language models (LLMs) into automated driving systems has opened new possibilities for reasoning and decision-making by transforming complex driving contexts into language-understandable representations. Recent studies demonstrate that fine-tuned LLMs can accurately predict vehicle trajectories and lane-change intentions by gathering and transforming data from surrounding vehicles. However, the robustness of such LLM-based prediction models for safety-critical driving systems remains unexplored, despite the increasing concerns about the trustworthiness of LLMs. This study addresses this gap by conducting a systematic vulnerability analysis of LLM-enabled vehicle trajectory prediction. We propose a one-feature differential evolution attack that perturbs a single kinematic feature of surrounding vehicles within the LLM's input prompts under a black-box setting. Experiments on the highD dataset reveal that even minor, physically plausible perturbations can significantly disrupt model outputs, underscoring the susceptibility of LLM-based predictors to adversarial manipulation. Further analyses reveal a trade-off between accuracy and robustness, examine the failure mechanism, and explore potential mitigation solutions. The findings provide the very first insights into adversarial vulnerabilities of LLM-driven automated vehicle models in the context of vehicular interactions and highlight the need for robustness-oriented design in future LLM-based intelligent transportation systems.

### [170] [Adaptive Redundancy Regulation for Balanced Multimodal Information Refinement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13755)
*Zhe Yang,Wenrui Li,Hongtao Chen,Penghong Wang,Ruiqin Xiong,Xiaopeng Fan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RedReg tackles modality bias in multimodal learning by adaptive redundancy regulation and cross-modal gating, canceling dominant gradient when redundancy is high and projecting onto the orthogonal gradient space to balance optimization, achieving improved performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Joint multimodal training often lets an advantaged modality dominate backpropagation, causing imbalanced optimization and accumulating redundant information; existing methods do not adequately address long-term dominance or cross-modal semantics.

Method: Adaptive Redundancy Regulation (RedReg) with (1) redundancy phase monitor using effective gain growth rate + redundancy to trigger intervention; (2) co-information gating to estimate the dominant modality’s contribution based on cross-modal semantics; (3) if task relies on a single modality, suppression disabled; (4) gradient projection of dominant modality onto orthogonal complement of joint gradient space and suppression scaled by redundancy.

Result: Empirical experiments show RedReg outperforms current major methods in most scenarios; ablation studies validate components; code available at GitHub.

Conclusion: RedReg provides a principled, information-bottleneck-inspired approach to balanced multimodal refinement by content-aware gradient modulation and redundancy control, improving representation-output coupling and reducing redundant information.

Abstract: Multimodal learning aims to improve performance by leveraging data from multiple sources. During joint multimodal training, due to modality bias, the advantaged modality often dominates backpropagation, leading to imbalanced optimization. Existing methods still face two problems: First, the long-term dominance of the dominant modality weakens representation-output coupling in the late stages of training, resulting in the accumulation of redundant information. Second, previous methods often directly and uniformly adjust the gradients of the advantaged modality, ignoring the semantics and directionality between modalities. To address these limitations, we propose Adaptive Redundancy Regulation for Balanced Multimodal Information Refinement (RedReg), which is inspired by information bottleneck principle. Specifically, we construct a redundancy phase monitor that uses a joint criterion of effective gain growth rate and redundancy to trigger intervention only when redundancy is high. Furthermore, we design a co-information gating mechanism to estimate the contribution of the current dominant modality based on cross-modal semantics. When the task primarily relies on a single modality, the suppression term is automatically disabled to preserve modality-specific information. Finally, we project the gradient of the dominant modality onto the orthogonal complement of the joint multimodal gradient subspace and suppress the gradient according to redundancy. Experiments show that our method demonstrates superiority among current major methods in most scenarios. Ablation experiments verify the effectiveness of our method.

### [171] [Multi-Horizon Time Series Forecasting of non-parametric CDFs with Deep Lattice Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13756)
*Niklas Erdmann,Lars Bentsen,Roy Stenbro,Heine Nygard Riise,Narada Dilp Warakagoda,Paal E. Engelstad*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A monotonic, nonparametric CDF-forecasting method for time series using an adapted deep lattice network (DLN) with LSTM embedding, yielding competitive day-ahead solar irradiance forecasts while ensuring valid CDFs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Probabilistic forecasting benefits from CDFs that capture sudden changes; traditional CDF modeling is parametric and limited. Bridging probabilistic forecasting with monotonic neural networks enables implicit, nonparametric CDF forecasts with monotonic guarantees to prevent quantile crossovers.

Method: Adapt a deep lattice network (DLN) with monotonic constraints for simultaneous/implicit quantile regression in time series. Use an LSTM as the embedding layer and spread quantile inputs across all sub-lattices with an extended output size to produce multi-horizon forecasts of an implicit CDF that remains valid due to monotonicity.

Result: Empirical evaluation on day-ahead, hourly solar irradiance forecasting shows the DLN adaptation performs as well as or better than unconstrained approaches and outperforms a scalable monotonic neural network.

Conclusion: The proposed DLN adaptation advances probabilistic forecasting and monotonic neural networks, promoting cross-disciplinary exploration and nonparametric CDF forecasting in time series.

Abstract: Probabilistic forecasting is not only a way to add more information to a prediction of the future, but it also builds on weaknesses in point prediction. Sudden changes in a time series can still be captured by a cumulative distribution function (CDF), while a point prediction is likely to miss it entirely. The modeling of CDFs within forecasts has historically been limited to parametric approaches, but due to recent advances, this no longer has to be the case. We aim to advance the fields of probabilistic forecasting and monotonic networks by connecting them and propose an approach that permits the forecasting of implicit, complete, and nonparametric CDFs. For this purpose, we propose an adaptation to deep lattice networks (DLN) for monotonically constrained simultaneous/implicit quantile regression in time series forecasting. Quantile regression usually produces quantile crossovers, which need to be prevented to achieve a legitimate CDF. By leveraging long short term memory units (LSTM) as the embedding layer, and spreading quantile inputs to all sub-lattices of a DLN with an extended output size, we can produce a multi-horizon forecast of an implicit CDF due to the monotonic constraintability of DLNs that prevent quantile crossovers. We compare and evaluate our approach's performance to relevant state of the art within the context of a highly relevant application of time series forecasting: Day-ahead, hourly forecasts of solar irradiance observations. Our experiments show that the adaptation of a DLN performs just as well or even better than an unconstrained approach. Further comparison of the adapted DLN against a scalable monotonic neural network shows that our approach performs better. With this adaptation of DLNs, we intend to create more interest and crossover investigations in techniques of monotonic neural networks and probabilistic forecasting.

*Jun-Hyoung Park,Ho-Jun Song,Seong-Whan Lee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ChemFixer is a transformer-based correction framework that converts invalid generated molecules into valid ones, improving validity while preserving chemistry and enabling downstream tasks like DTI, especially in data-limited settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DL-based molecular generators often produce invalid molecules, which limits usable chemical space and practical drug discovery applications. A correction mechanism could unlock more of the chemical space and improve downstream performance.

Method: A transformer architecture pre-trained with masking; fine-tuned on a large-scale dataset of valid/invalid molecular pairs constructed by the authors; evaluated across diverse generative models; extended to drug-target interaction prediction with limited data.

Result: ChemFixer increased molecular validity while preserving the original distribution of chemical/biological properties; could recover molecules previously unattainable by generation; expanded accessible chemical space; improved ligand validity and discovered ligand-protein pairs in DTI tasks under data-limited conditions.

Conclusion: ChemFixer shows promise as a practical, extensible tool for deep learning-driven drug discovery, enhancing molecular validity and expanding usable chemical space across stages and data regimes.

Abstract: Deep learning-based molecular generation models have shown great potential in efficiently exploring vast chemical spaces by generating potential drug candidates with desired properties. However, these models often produce chemically invalid molecules, which limits the usable scope of the learned chemical space and poses significant challenges for practical applications. To address this issue, we propose ChemFixer, a framework designed to correct invalid molecules into valid ones. ChemFixer is built on a transformer architecture, pre-trained using masking techniques, and fine-tuned on a large-scale dataset of valid/invalid molecular pairs that we constructed. Through comprehensive evaluations across diverse generative models, ChemFixer improved molecular validity while effectively preserving the chemical and biological distributional properties of the original outputs. This indicates that ChemFixer can recover molecules that could not be previously generated, thereby expanding the diversity of potential drug candidates. Furthermore, ChemFixer was effectively applied to a drug-target interaction (DTI) prediction task using limited data, improving the validity of generated ligands and discovering promising ligand-protein pairs. These results suggest that ChemFixer is not only effective in data-limited scenarios, but also extensible to a wide range of downstream tasks. Taken together, ChemFixer shows promise as a practical tool for various stages of deep learning-based drug discovery, enhancing molecular validity and expanding accessible chemical space.

*Han Wang,Deyi Ji,Junyu Lu,Lanyun Zhu,Hailong Zhang,Haiyang Wu,Liqun Liu,Peng Shu,Roy Ka-Wei Lee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A self-training framework using collaborative pseudo-labeling with multi-agent vision-language models (MA-VLMs) and a Positive-Negative-Unlabeled loss to boost offensive-content detection under scarce labeled data, by iteratively labeling unlabeled data and filtering via agreement between a light classifier and MA-VLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Labeled data for offensive content detection is scarce due to the rarity of offensive instances and high annotation costs. The approach aims to exploit abundant unlabeled data and model diversity (MA-VLMs) to improve performance under low supervision.

Method: Train a lightweight classifier on limited labeled data. Iteratively label unlabeled data with MA-VLMs. Agreement between the classifier and MA-VLMs defines the Agreed-Unknown set; disagreements form the Disagreed-Unknown set. MA-VLMs simulate moderator and user perspectives to capture regulatory and subjective viewpoints. Use a Positive-Negative-Unlabeled (PNU) loss that leverages labeled, Agreed-Unknown, and Disagreed-Unknown data while mitigating pseudo-label noise.

Result: Experiments on benchmark datasets show substantial improvement over baselines under limited supervision and performance approaching that of large-scale models.

Conclusion: The proposed collaborative pseudo-labeling framework with dual-perspective MA-VLMs and PNU loss effectively leverages unlabeled data to enhance offensive-content detection when labeled data is scarce, reducing reliance on large labeled datasets.

Abstract: Accurate detection of offensive content on social media demands high-quality labeled data; however, such data is often scarce due to the low prevalence of offensive instances and the high cost of manual annotation. To address this low-resource challenge, we propose a self-training framework that leverages abundant unlabeled data through collaborative pseudo-labeling. Starting with a lightweight classifier trained on limited labeled data, our method iteratively assigns pseudo-labels to unlabeled instances with the support of Multi-Agent Vision-Language Models (MA-VLMs). Un-labeled data on which the classifier and MA-VLMs agree are designated as the Agreed-Unknown set, while conflicting samples form the Disagreed-Unknown set. To enhance label reliability, MA-VLMs simulate dual perspectives, moderator and user, capturing both regulatory and subjective viewpoints. The classifier is optimized using a novel Positive-Negative-Unlabeled (PNU) loss, which jointly exploits labeled, Agreed-Unknown, and Disagreed-Unknown data while mitigating pseudo-label noise. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our framework substantially outperforms baselines under limited supervision and approaches the performance of large-scale models

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MoETTA: an entropy-based TTA framework using a Mixture-of-Experts to handle heterogeneous test-time shifts; introduces potpourri and potpourri+ benchmarks; reports state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world deployments face mixed distribution shifts across domains; single unified adaptation paths struggle due to diverse gradient directions; need mechanisms to model multiple directions and more realistic benchmarks.

Method: MoETTA combines entropy-based test-time adaptation with a Mixture-of-Experts architecture, using multiple structurally decoupled experts to enable adaptation along diverse gradient directions. Introduces two benchmarks, potpourri and potpourri+, to simulate realistic mixed-domain shifts; potpourri+ includes source-domain samples to assess forgetting.

Result: Across three mixed-shift settings, MoETTA consistently outperforms strong baselines, achieving state-of-the-art performance and highlighting the advantages of expert-level diversity in adaptation directions; potpourri+ also demonstrates robustness against catastrophic forgetting.

Conclusion: Modeling multiple adaptation directions via expert diversity yields improved TTA under heterogeneous shifts; the proposed benchmarks offer more realistic evaluation and MoETTA sets a new SOTA benchmark for mixed distribution shifts.

Abstract: Test-Time adaptation (TTA) has proven effective in mitigating performance drops under single-domain distribution shifts by updating model parameters during inference. However, real-world deployments often involve mixed distribution shifts, where test samples are affected by diverse and potentially conflicting domain factors, posing significant challenges even for SOTA TTA methods. A key limitation in existing approaches is their reliance on a unified adaptation path, which fails to account for the fact that optimal gradient directions can vary significantly across different domains. Moreover, current benchmarks focus only on synthetic or homogeneous shifts, failing to capture the complexity of real-world heterogeneous mixed distribution shifts. To address this, we propose MoETTA, a novel entropy-based TTA framework that integrates the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture. Rather than enforcing a single parameter update rule for all test samples, MoETTA introduces a set of structurally decoupled experts, enabling adaptation along diverse gradient directions. This design allows the model to better accommodate heterogeneous shifts through flexible and disentangled parameter updates. To simulate realistic deployment conditions, we introduce two new benchmarks: potpourri and potpourri+. While classical settings focus solely on synthetic corruptions, potpourri encompasses a broader range of domain shifts--including natural, artistic, and adversarial distortions--capturing more realistic deployment challenges. Additionally, potpourri+ further includes source-domain samples to evaluate robustness against catastrophic forgetting. Extensive experiments across three mixed distribution shifts settings show that MoETTA consistently outperforms strong baselines, establishing SOTA performance and highlighting the benefit of modeling multiple adaptation directions via expert-level diversity.

TL;DR: A study on gene incremental learning in single-cell transcriptomics that adapts class-incremental methods to mitigate forgetting of genes, and provides a complete benchmark for this setting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Incremental learning for tokens is underexplored, and genes in single-cell data act as growth-like tokens. There is a gaps in frameworks and evaluations for gene-level incremental learning; forgetting occurs, necessitating adaptation of existing methods and a standardized benchmark.

Method: Formulates a pipeline for gene incremental learning in single-cell transcriptomics and adapts existing class-incremental learning methods to address gene forgetting. Conducts extensive experiments to validate the framework and the effectiveness of the adaptations, culminating in a full benchmark.

Result: Demonstrates that forgetting exists in gene incremental learning, shows that adapting class-incremental methods mitigates forgetting, and provides validated framework design and evaluations. Delivers a complete benchmark for gene IL in single-cell transcriptomics.

Conclusion: Presents the first complete benchmark for gene incremental learning in single-cell transcriptomics and establishes a reusable pipeline and method adaptations that can guide future research in gene IL.

Abstract: Classes, as fundamental elements of Computer Vision, have been extensively studied within incremental learning frameworks. In contrast, tokens, which play essential roles in many research fields, exhibit similar characteristics of growth, yet investigations into their incremental learning remain significantly scarce. This research gap primarily stems from the holistic nature of tokens in language, which imposes significant challenges on the design of incremental learning frameworks for them. To overcome this obstacle, in this work, we turn to a type of token, gene, for a large-scale biological dataset--single-cell transcriptomics--to formulate a pipeline for gene incremental learning and establish corresponding evaluations. We found that the forgetting problem also exists in gene incremental learning, thus we adapted existing class incremental learning methods to mitigate the forgetting of genes. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrated the soundness of our framework design and evaluations, as well as the effectiveness of our method adaptations. Finally, we provide a complete benchmark for gene incremental learning in single-cell transcriptomics.

### [177] [Library Liberation: Competitive Performance Matmul Through Compiler-composed Nanokernels](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13764)
*Arun Thangamani,Md Asghar Ahmad Shahid,Adam Siemieniuk,Rolf Morel,Renato Golin,Alexander Heinecke*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: An MLIR-based compiler automatically generates scalable nanokernels that bridge domain operations and processor capabilities, delivering near-peak performance without hand-crafted kernels or low-level libraries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a persistent gap between high-level ML workload descriptions and efficient hardware utilization. Achieving near-peak performance typically requires hand-tuned kernels (e.g., DeepSeek) or specialized libraries (e.g., CUTLASS), which are hard to scale and demand deep hardware expertise.

Method: The paper proposes a compilation scheme that uses MLIR dialects to compose nanokernels from low-level IR constructs, optimizing register usage to tailor microkernels to each target. The implementation targets an MLIR-based compiler that supports vector and tile-based CPU instructions.

Result: Empirical evaluation shows the generated nanokernels are production-quality and competitive with state-of-the-art microkernel libraries.

Conclusion: Automating microkernel generation via MLIR reduces dependence on hand-tuned code and libraries, enabling scalable, portable high-performance ML workloads with near-optimal performance across targets.

Abstract: The rapidly evolving landscape of AI and machine learning workloads has widened the gap between high-level domain operations and efficient hardware utilization. Achieving near-peak performance still demands deep hardware expertise-experts either handcraft target-specific kernels (e.g., DeepSeek) or rely on specialized libraries (e.g., CUTLASS)-both of which add complexity and limit scalability for most ML practitioners.
  This paper introduces a compilation scheme that automatically generates scalable, high-performance microkernels by leveraging the MLIR dialects to bridge domain-level operations and processor capabilities. Our approach removes dependence on low-level libraries by enabling the compiler to auto-generate near-optimal code directly. At its core is a mechanism for composing nanokernels from low-level IR constructs with near-optimal register utilization, forming efficient microkernels tailored to each target. We implement this technique in an MLIR-based compiler supporting both vector and tile based CPU instructions. Experiments show that the generated nanokernels are of production-quality, and competitive with state-of-the-art microkernel libraries.

### [178] [PROF: An LLM-based Reward Code Preference Optimization Framework for Offline Imitation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13765)
*Shengjie Sun,Jiafei Lyu,Runze Liu,Mengbei Yan,Bo Liu,Deheng Ye,Xiu Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PROF leverages LLMs to generate executable reward functions from natural language descriptions and a single expert trajectory, uses Reward Preference Ranking to rank these rewards without environment interactions, and iteratively optimizes via text-based gradient steps, achieving strong offline IL results on D4RL.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Offline IL suffers from simplistic reward proxies that tie trajectory similarity to reward; there is a need for an automated, data-efficient method to discover and refine reward functions that align with expert preferences without relying on explicit reward labels or costly RL training.

Method: Use LLMs to produce executable reward-function code from natural language cues plus one expert trajectory; introduce Reward Preference Ranking (RPR) to assess reward-function quality via dominance scores without environment interaction; alternate between RPR evaluation and text-based gradient optimization to refine rewards; integrate into offline IL pipeline for policy learning.

Result: On D4RL, PROF matches or surpasses recent strong baselines across multiple datasets and domains, indicating effective reward discovery and policy learning.

Conclusion: Automating reward discovery with LLM-driven code and RPR enables robust offline imitation learning without environment interaction, showcasing the potential of combining language models with reward design for imitation learning.

Abstract: Offline imitation learning (offline IL) enables training effective policies without requiring explicit reward annotations. Recent approaches attempt to estimate rewards for unlabeled datasets using a small set of expert demonstrations. However, these methods often assume that the similarity between a trajectory and an expert demonstration is positively correlated with the reward, which oversimplifies the underlying reward structure. We propose PROF, a novel framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to generate and improve executable reward function codes from natural language descriptions and a single expert trajectory. We propose Reward Preference Ranking (RPR), a novel reward function quality assessment and ranking strategy without requiring environment interactions or RL training. RPR calculates the dominance scores of the reward functions, where higher scores indicate better alignment with expert preferences. By alternating between RPR and text-based gradient optimization, PROF fully automates the selection and refinement of optimal reward functions for downstream policy learning. Empirical results on D4RL demonstrate that PROF surpasses or matches recent strong baselines across numerous datasets and domains, highlighting the effectiveness of our approach.

### [179] [Credal Ensemble Distillation for Uncertainty Quantification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13766)
*Kaizheng Wang,Fabio Cuzzolin,David Moens,Hans Hallez*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Reduces the computational burden of deep ensembles by distilling them into a single model (CREDIT) that outputs probability intervals (a credal set) for uncertainty quantification instead of a single softmax distribution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep ensembles deliver strong predictive uncertainty estimates but are costly in computation and memory at inference; there is a need for efficient, reliable uncertainty estimation suitable for deployment.

Method: Distill a deep ensemble into a single model (CREDIT) that predicts class-wise probability intervals forming a credal set, enabling uncertainty quantification without computing multiple ensemble predictions.

Result: On out-of-distribution detection benchmarks, CREDIT achieves superior or comparable uncertainty estimation to baselines while substantially reducing inference overhead compared to deep ensembles.

Conclusion: Credal ensemble distillation (CED) offers a practical path to compress deep ensembles into a single, efficient model that preserves uncertainty quality by predicting credal sets instead of point probability estimates.

Abstract: Deep ensembles (DE) have emerged as a powerful approach for quantifying predictive uncertainty and distinguishing its aleatoric and epistemic components, thereby enhancing model robustness and reliability. However, their high computational and memory costs during inference pose significant challenges for wide practical deployment. To overcome this issue, we propose credal ensemble distillation (CED), a novel framework that compresses a DE into a single model, CREDIT, for classification tasks. Instead of a single softmax probability distribution, CREDIT predicts class-wise probability intervals that define a credal set, a convex set of probability distributions, for uncertainty quantification. Empirical results on out-of-distribution detection benchmarks demonstrate that CED achieves superior or comparable uncertainty estimation compared to several existing baselines, while substantially reducing inference overhead compared to DE.

### [180] [Dynamic Temperature Scheduler for Knowledge Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13767)
*Sibgat Ul Islam,Jawad Ibn Ahad,Fuad Rahman,Mohammad Ruhul Amin,Nabeel Mohammed,Shafin Rahman*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A dynamic temperature scheduler for knowledge distillation that adapts the softmax temperature based on the divergence between teacher and student, improving performance over fixed-temperature baselines across vision and NLP tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional KD uses a fixed temperature, which is suboptimal when teacher–student architectural gaps cause mismatched logit magnitudes. Students benefit from softer probabilities early in training but need sharper targets later. A temperature that adapts to the divergence between distributions can better guide learning.

Method: Introduce Dynamic Temperature Scheduler (DTS) that adjusts the KD temperature online by monitoring the cross-entropy loss gap between teacher and student. The temperature is updated as a function of this divergence, enabling softer targets early and sharper targets later. DTS is designed to integrate with existing KD frameworks and is claimed to be the first method to adapt temperature based on distribution divergence across teacher and student.

Result: DTS consistently outperforms static-temperature KD baselines across multiple strategies and datasets, including vision (CIFAR-100, Tiny-ImageNet) and NLP (GLUE, Dolly, SelfIns, UnNI, S-NI). The authors also provide code for reproducibility.

Conclusion: DTS offers a simple, architecture-agnostic, and effective improvement to KD by making temperature a dynamic, data-driven hyperparameter, enabling better alignment between teacher and student throughout training.

Abstract: Knowledge Distillation (KD) trains a smaller student model using a large, pre-trained teacher model, with temperature as a key hyperparameter controlling the softness of output probabilities. Traditional methods use a fixed temperature throughout training, which is suboptimal. Moreover, architectural differences between teacher and student often result in mismatched logit magnitudes. We demonstrate that students benefit from softer probabilities early in training but require sharper probabilities in later stages. We introduce Dynamic Temperature Scheduler (DTS), which adjusts temperature dynamically based on the cross-entropy loss gap between teacher and student. To our knowledge, this is the first temperature scheduling method that adapts based on the divergence between teacher and student distributions. Our method integrates seamlessly with existing KD frameworks. We validate DTS across multiple KD strategies on vision (CIFAR-100, Tiny-ImageNet) and NLP tasks (GLUE, Dolly, SelfIns, UnNI, S-NI), consistently outperforming static-temperature baselines.

### [181] [Compiling to linear neurons](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13769)
*Joey Velez-Ginorio,Nada Amin,Konrad Kording,Steve Zdancewic*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A new language Cajal enables direct-style programming of neural networks by compiling discrete algorithms into differentiable linear neurons, enabling better integration of learning and discrete computation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Indirect gradient-based learning lacks discrete structure; there is a desire to express discrete algorithms in a differentiable form that can be used within neural networks.

Method: Introduce Cajal, a typed, higher-order, linear programming language; prove that Cajal programs compile to linear neurons; implement and link these neurons with traditional networks; run experiments showing improved learning efficiency and debuggability when using linked linear components.

Result: Linking linear neurons with neural networks improves data efficiency and learning speed, and enhances interpretability/debuggability; demonstrates that linear programming languages can directly influence neural network behavior.

Conclusion: Linear programming languages offer a promising path for directly programming neural networks, enabling a productive interplay between learning and discrete programming structures.

Abstract: We don't program neural networks directly. Instead, we rely on an indirect style where learning algorithms, like gradient descent, determine a neural network's function by learning from data. This indirect style is often a virtue; it empowers us to solve problems that were previously impossible. But it lacks discrete structure. We can't compile most algorithms into a neural network -- even if these algorithms could help the network learn. This limitation occurs because discrete algorithms are not obviously differentiable, making them incompatible with the gradient-based learning algorithms that determine a neural network's function. To address this, we introduce $\textsf{Cajal}$: a typed, higher-order and linear programming language intended to be a minimal vehicle for exploring a direct style of programming neural networks. We prove $\textsf{Cajal}$ programs compile to linear neurons, allowing discrete algorithms to be expressed in a differentiable form compatible with gradient-based learning. With our implementation of $\textsf{Cajal}$, we conduct several experiments where we link these linear neurons against other neural networks to determine part of their function prior to learning. Linking with these neurons allows networks to learn faster, with greater data-efficiency, and in a way that's easier to debug. A key lesson is that linear programming languages provide a path towards directly programming neural networks, enabling a rich interplay between learning and the discrete structures of ordinary programming.

### [182] [Self-Attention as Distributional Projection: A Unified Interpretation of Transformer Architecture](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13780)
*Nihal Mehta*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A principled derivation of self-attention and Transformer components from distributional semantics, showing that self-attention arises as a natural projection of corpus co-occurrence into sequence context, with query-key-value as a directional extension and positional encodings/multi-head as refinements; the Transformer’s algebraic form follows from these projection principles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To unify distributional semantics (e.g., GloVe) with the self-attention mechanism, explaining why Transformer architectures take their particular algebraic form rather than treating it as arbitrary design choices.

Method: Starting from the corpus-level co-occurrence matrix underlying GloVe, the authors show how projecting this statistical structure into sequence context yields self-attention. They derive the query-key-value mechanism as the natural asymmetric extension needed for modeling directional relationships, and then show how positional encodings and multi-head attention arise as structured refinements of the same projection principle.

Result: The analysis demonstrates that the Transformer’s algebraic form can be derived from fundamental projection principles applied to co-occurrence statistics, providing a mathematical interpretation of self-attention and validating the architectural choices (QKV, positional encodings, multi-head) as principled refinements rather than arbitrary design.

Conclusion: Transformer architecture is grounded in projection principles of distributional semantics, linking GloVe-like co-occurrence statistics to self-attention and sequence modeling, and explaining why its components (QKV, positional encodings, multi-head) naturally emerge.

Abstract: This paper presents a mathematical interpretation of self-attention by connecting it to distributional semantics principles. We show that self-attention emerges from projecting corpus-level co-occurrence statistics into sequence context. Starting from the co-occurrence matrix underlying GloVe embeddings, we demonstrate how the projection naturally captures contextual influence, with the query-key-value mechanism arising as the natural asymmetric extension for modeling directional relationships. Positional encodings and multi-head attention then follow as structured refinements of this same projection principle. Our analysis demonstrates that the Transformer architecture's particular algebraic form follows from these projection principles rather than being an arbitrary design choice.

*Huijie Guo,Jingyao Wang,Peizheng Guo,Xingchen Shen,Changwen Zheng,Wenwen Qiang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This work studies SSL transferability and introduces TC^2 to mitigate task conflicts and improve transferability by multi-task SSL within batches, factor and weight networks, and bi-level optimization, achieving better transfer performance across downstream tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SSL representations often transfer poorly across tasks due to task conflict; understanding transferability and modeling it explicitly can improve downstream performance.

Method: Construct multiple SSL tasks per training batch to capture transferability and analyze its effects. Propose Task Conflict Calibration (TC^2) that: (1) splits batches to create multiple SSL tasks to inject task-level information, (2) uses a factor extraction network to derive causal generative factors shared across tasks, (3) employs a weight extraction network to assign sample-specific weights, enforcing data reconstruction, orthogonality, and sparsity, (4) calibrates sample representations during SSL training within a two-stage bi-level optimization framework.

Result: Empirical experiments on multiple downstream tasks show consistent improvements in the transferability of SSL models when using TC^2.

Conclusion: Explicitly modeling and calibrating task conflict in SSL improves representation transferability; the TC^2 framework is effective and can be integrated into SSL pipelines.

Abstract: In this paper, we explore the transferability of SSL by addressing two central questions: (i) what is the representation transferability of SSL, and (ii) how can we effectively model this transferability? Transferability is defined as the ability of a representation learned from one task to support the objective of another.
  Inspired by the meta-learning paradigm, we construct multiple SSL tasks within each training batch to support explicitly modeling transferability. Based on empirical evidence and causal analysis, we find that although introducing task-level information improves transferability, it is still hindered by task conflict. To address this issue, we propose a Task Conflict Calibration (TC$^2$) method to alleviate the impact of task conflict. Specifically, it first splits batches to create multiple SSL tasks, infusing task-level information. Next, it uses a factor extraction network to produce causal generative factors for all tasks and a weight extraction network to assign dedicated weights to each sample, employing data reconstruction, orthogonality, and sparsity to ensure effectiveness. Finally, TC$^2$ calibrates sample representations during SSL training and integrates into the pipeline via a two-stage bi-level optimization framework to boost the transferability of learned representations. Experimental results on multiple downstream tasks demonstrate that our method consistently improves the transferability of SSL models.

### [184] [Scaling Patterns in Adversarial Alignment: Evidence from Multi-LLM Jailbreak Experiments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13788)
*Samuel Nathanson,Rebecca Williams,Cynthia Matuszek*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Larger attacker-target size disparities in multi-agent LLM settings correlate with more harmful outputs from smaller models; attacker alignment reduces harm, and results suggest attacker-side diversity drives adversarial outcomes more than target susceptibility. The study uses JailbreakBench across 6k exchanges and judges harm/refusal to quantify robustness gaps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how vulnerabilities scale when LLMs interact adversarially, and whether bigger models can jailbreak smaller ones despite alignment safeguards, with implications for safety and robustness in multi-agent systems.

Method: Over 6,000 multi-turn attacker–target exchanges across major LLM families and sizes (0.6B–120B params) using standardized JailbreakBench tasks. Harm and refusal scores were assigned by three independent LLM judges, enabling model-based evaluation of adversarial outcomes. Analyses include correlations (Pearson/Spearman) and variance comparisons across attackers and targets.

Result: Found a strong, statistically significant correlation between mean harm and the log of attacker-to-target size ratio (Pearson r=0.51, p<0.001; Spearman ρ=0.52, p<0.001). Harm variance is higher across attackers (0.18) than targets (0.10). Attacker refusal frequency is strongly negatively correlated with harm (ρ=-0.93, p<0.001), indicating attacker alignment mitigates harmful responses.

Conclusion: Size asymmetry influences robustness in adversarial LLM interactions; preliminary evidence for scaling patterns in adversarial vulnerability. The findings motivate more controlled investigations into inter-model alignment and safety across model families and scales.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly operate in multi-agent and safety-critical settings, raising open questions about how their vulnerabilities scale when models interact adversarially. This study examines whether larger models can systematically jailbreak smaller ones - eliciting harmful or restricted behavior despite alignment safeguards. Using standardized adversarial tasks from JailbreakBench, we simulate over 6,000 multi-turn attacker-target exchanges across major LLM families and scales (0.6B-120B parameters), measuring both harm score and refusal behavior as indicators of adversarial potency and alignment integrity. Each interaction is evaluated through aggregated harm and refusal scores assigned by three independent LLM judges, providing a consistent, model-based measure of adversarial outcomes. Aggregating results across prompts, we find a strong and statistically significant correlation between mean harm and the logarithm of the attacker-to-target size ratio (Pearson r = 0.51, p < 0.001; Spearman rho = 0.52, p < 0.001), indicating that relative model size correlates with the likelihood and severity of harmful completions. Mean harm score variance is higher across attackers (0.18) than across targets (0.10), suggesting that attacker-side behavioral diversity contributes more to adversarial outcomes than target susceptibility. Attacker refusal frequency is strongly and negatively correlated with harm (rho = -0.93, p < 0.001), showing that attacker-side alignment mitigates harmful responses. These findings reveal that size asymmetry influences robustness and provide exploratory evidence for adversarial scaling patterns, motivating more controlled investigations into inter-model alignment and safety.

*Emanuel Covaci,Fabian Galis,Radu Balan,Daniela Zaharie,Darian Onchis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A differentiable global explainability method integrated into model training using ScoresActivation, enabling fast, faithful feature rankings and improved accuracy, addressing the gap between interpretability and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Post hoc explanations are disconnected from training and can be faithfulness-limited; integrate feature importance into the learning process to obtain globally faithful, end-to-end trainable explanations.

Method: Introduce ScoresActivation, a differentiable feature-ranking mechanism embedded in the training pipeline to jointly optimize predictive performance and feature importance within a single model.

Result: Global feature rankings are faithful and stable, align with SHAP and ground-truth; high predictive performance maintained; feature scoring is ~150x faster than SHAP (2s vs 300s for ranking); accuracy gains of 11.24% (10 features, 5 relevant) and 29.33% (16 features, 5 relevant, 11 irrelevant).

Conclusion: Bridges accuracy and interpretability by design, offering a scalable, end-to-end trainable framework for inherently explainable machine learning.

Abstract: Understanding the decision of large deep learning models is a critical challenge for building transparent and trustworthy systems. Although the current post hoc explanation methods offer valuable insights into feature importance, they are inherently disconnected from the model training process, limiting their faithfulness and utility. In this work, we introduce a novel differentiable approach to global explainability by design, integrating feature importance estimation directly into model training. Central to our method is the ScoresActivation function, a feature-ranking mechanism embedded within the learning pipeline. This integration enables models to prioritize features according to their contribution to predictive performance in a differentiable and end-to-end trainable manner. Evaluations across benchmark datasets show that our approach yields globally faithful, stable feature rankings aligned with SHAP values and ground-truth feature importance, while maintaining high predictive performance. Moreover, feature scoring is 150 times faster than the classical SHAP method, requiring only 2 seconds during training compared to SHAP's 300 seconds for feature ranking in the same configuration. Our method also improves classification accuracy by 11.24% with 10 features (5 relevant) and 29.33% with 16 features (5 relevant, 11 irrelevant), demonstrating robustness to irrelevant inputs. This work bridges the gap between model accuracy and interpretability, offering a scalable framework for inherently explainable machine learning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DAS speeds up RL rollouts for LLM alignment by up to 50% without changing outputs, using a suffix-tree-based adaptive drafter and a length-aware speculation policy to exploit rollout history.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RL post-training is essential for aligning large language models but is bottlenecked by long-tail rollout lengths; a small subset of very long generations dominates wall-clock time, while historical rollouts reveal stable prompt-level patterns across epochs that can be exploited.

Method: Introduce DAS: Distribution Aware Speculative decoding. It uses an adaptive, nonparametric drafter built from recent rollouts via an incrementally maintained suffix tree, and a length-aware speculation policy that assigns larger draft budgets to long trajectories that dominate makespan, balancing base and token-level costs to preserve outputs.

Result: Empirical results on math and code reasoning tasks show up to 50% reduction in rollout time with identical training curves.

Conclusion: Distribution-aware speculative decoding is a viable approach to accelerate RL post-training for LLMs without sacrificing learning quality, by leveraging rollout-length distributions and historical prompt patterns.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning(RL) post-training has become essential for aligning large language models (LLMs), yet its efficiency is increasingly constrained by the rollout phase, where long trajectories are generated token by token. We identify a major bottleneck:the long-tail distribution of rollout lengths, where a small fraction of long generations dominates wall clock time and a complementary opportunity; the availability of historical rollouts that reveal stable prompt level patterns across training epochs. Motivated by these observations, we propose DAS, a Distribution Aware Speculative decoding framework that accelerates RL rollouts without altering model outputs. DAS integrates two key ideas: an adaptive, nonparametric drafter built from recent rollouts using an incrementally maintained suffix tree, and a length aware speculation policy that allocates more aggressive draft budgets to long trajectories that dominate makespan. This design exploits rollout history to sustain acceptance while balancing base and token level costs during decoding. Experiments on math and code reasoning tasks show that DAS reduces rollout time up to 50% while preserving identical training curves, demonstrating that distribution-aware speculative decoding can significantly accelerate RL post training without compromising learning quality.

*Saleh Momeni,Changnan Xiao,Bing Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AnaCP introduces Analytic Contrastive Projection for class-incremental learning, enabling feature adaptation with analytic (gradient-free) classifiers, achieving joint-training-level accuracy without gradient updates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CIL suffers catastrophic forgetting as methods update both features and classifier. While pre-trained models (PTMs) help as fixed feature extractors with analytic classifiers, they fail to adapt features to new tasks, limiting performance.

Method: AnaCP preserves the efficiency of analytic classifiers while enabling incremental feature adaptation without gradient-based training, via Analytic Contrastive Projection.

Result: Empirical results show AnaCP outperforms existing baselines and attains the accuracy level of joint training, the upper bound of CIL.

Conclusion: AnaCP closes the gap between fixed PTM-based CIL and fully trainable approaches by enabling gradient-free feature adaptation with strong performance at efficiency.

Abstract: This paper studies the problem of class-incremental learning (CIL), a core setting within continual learning where a model learns a sequence of tasks, each containing a distinct set of classes. Traditional CIL methods, which do not leverage pre-trained models (PTMs), suffer from catastrophic forgetting (CF) due to the need to incrementally learn both feature representations and the classifier. The integration of PTMs into CIL has recently led to efficient approaches that treat the PTM as a fixed feature extractor combined with analytic classifiers, achieving state-of-the-art performance. However, they still face a major limitation: the inability to continually adapt feature representations to best suit the CIL tasks, leading to suboptimal performance. To address this, we propose AnaCP (Analytic Contrastive Projection), a novel method that preserves the efficiency of analytic classifiers while enabling incremental feature adaptation without gradient-based training, thereby eliminating the CF caused by gradient updates. Our experiments show that AnaCP not only outperforms existing baselines but also achieves the accuracy level of joint training, which is regarded as the upper bound of CIL.

*Nicolas M. Cuadrado A.,Mohannad Takrouri,Jiří Němeček,Martin Takáč,Jakub Mareček*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes tractable probabilistic models, specifically sum-product networks (SPNs), to enable scalable, exact inference for power system planning under uncertainty, supporting robust scenario analysis and chance-constrained optimization with advantages over traditional scenario-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Forecasting energy mix and demand decades ahead is highly uncertain. Traditional scenario methods (finite Dirac mixtures) poorly reveal scenario-specific volatility and hinder robust decision-making.

Method: Adopt tractable probabilistic models (TPMs), particularly SPNs, to represent high-dimensional uncertainties. Enable exact inference of scenario likelihoods, marginals, and conditionals; embed chance-constrained optimization into investment planning; perform scenario analysis and volatility quantification; apply to a representative power system planning case study.

Result: SPNs provide exact, scalable inference for scenario likelihoods, marginals, and conditionals, enabling robust scenario expansion and risk assessment. Demonstrates computational and reliability advantages over traditional scenario-based models in a power system planning case study.

Conclusion: TPMs, especially SPNs, offer a scalable framework for robust, risk-informed investment planning under deep uncertainty by enabling exact inference and integrated chance constraints.

Abstract: Investment planning in power utilities, such as generation and transmission expansion, requires decade-long forecasts under profound uncertainty. Forecasting of energy mix and energy use decades ahead is nontrivial. Classical approaches focus on generating a finite number of scenarios (modeled as a mixture of Diracs in statistical theory terms), which limits insight into scenario-specific volatility and hinders robust decision-making. We propose an alternative using tractable probabilistic models (TPMs), particularly sum-product networks (SPNs). These models enable exact, scalable inference of key quantities such as scenario likelihoods, marginals, and conditional probabilities, supporting robust scenario expansion and risk assessment.
  This framework enables direct embedding of chance-constrained optimization into investment planning, enforcing safety or reliability with prescribed confidence levels. TPMs allow both scenario analysis and volatility quantification by compactly representing high-dimensional uncertainties. We demonstrate the approach's effectiveness through a representative power system planning case study, illustrating computational and reliability advantages over traditional scenario-based models.

*Kai Chen,Chen Gong,Tianhao Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MargNet blends neural networks with adaptive marginal selection to improve DP tabular data synthesis across dense and sparse correlations. It achieves near-best utility with significant speedups on sparse data and state-of-the-art fidelity on densely correlated data, with code released on GitHub.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The field split between statistical-model-based DP synthesis and neural-network-based approaches leaves performance gaps: statistical models struggle with densely correlated data, while existing NN methods may not fully capture complex dependencies. A hybrid approach aims to leverage NN flexibility while enforcing principled marginal constraints.

Method: MargNet introduces an adaptive marginal selection strategy and trains neural networks to generate data that conforms to the chosen marginals, effectively integrating successful statistical-model designs into neural-network training.

Result: For sparsely correlated data, MargNet achieves utility close to the best statistical method with an average 7× speedup. For densely correlated data, it delivers a new state-of-the-art by reducing fidelity error by up to 26% compared to prior best. Code is released on GitHub.

Conclusion: MargNet narrows the gap between NN-based and statistical-model-based DP synthesis, performing robustly across data regimes and offering substantial speedups and fidelity improvements, with reproducibility via open-source code.

Abstract: In differentially private (DP) tabular data synthesis, the consensus is that statistical models are better than neural network (NN)-based methods. However, we argue that this conclusion is incomplete and overlooks the challenge of densely correlated datasets, where intricate dependencies can overwhelm statistical models. In such complex scenarios, neural networks are more suitable due to their capacity to fit complex distributions by learning directly from samples. Despite this potential, existing NN-based algorithms still suffer from significant limitations. We therefore propose MargNet, incorporating successful algorithmic designs of statistical models into neural networks. MargNet applies an adaptive marginal selection strategy and trains the neural networks to generate data that conforms to the selected marginals. On sparsely correlated datasets, our approach achieves utility close to the best statistical method while offering an average 7$\times$ speedup over it. More importantly, on densely correlated datasets, MargNet establishes a new state-of-the-art, reducing fidelity error by up to 26\% compared to the previous best. We release our code on GitHub.\footnote{https://github.com/KaiChen9909/margnet}

TL;DR: A transformer-based renewable energy forecast method that treats hourly weather maps as tokens: CNN encodes maps into spatial tokens, then a transformer captures 45-hour temporal dynamics. It achieves large RMSE reductions versus ENTSO-E forecasts ( ~60% wind, ~20% solar ) and offers a live dashboard for daily forecasts.

Motivation: Current renewable energy forecasting struggles to integrate rich spatial weather context with temporal evolution. Incorporating both spatial patterns and their temporal progression could substantially improve forecast accuracy for wind and solar energy.

Method: Encode hourly weather maps with a lightweight CNN to produce spatial tokens, then feed these tokens into a transformer to model temporal dependencies across a 45-hour forecast horizon. Evaluation against ENTSO-E operational forecasts.

Result: RMSE reductions of about 60% for wind and 20% for solar compared with ENTSO-E operational forecasts. A live dashboard for daily forecasts is available at the provided URL.

Conclusion: Treating weather maps as transformer tokens is effective for renewable energy forecasting, yielding substantial RMSE improvements. The approach shows promise but notes disadvantages in input initialization and presents a practical tool via a live dashboard.

Abstract: Accurate renewable energy forecasting is essential to reduce dependence on fossil fuels and enabling grid decarbonization. However, current approaches fail to effectively integrate the rich spatial context of weather patterns with their temporal evolution. This work introduces a novel approach that treats weather maps as tokens in transformer sequences to predict renewable energy. Hourly weather maps are encoded as spatial tokens using a lightweight convolutional neural network, and then processed by a transformer to capture temporal dynamics across a 45-hour forecast horizon. Despite disadvantages in input initialization, evaluation against ENTSO-E operational forecasts shows a reduction in RMSE of about 60\% and 20\% for wind and solar respectively.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Over-smoothing and poor performance on heterophilic graphs limit GNNs; complex diffusion offers richer dynamics and higher expressiveness.

Method: Represent edges with complex weights; extend diffusion to complex domain; prove that with appropriate weights any node-classification task can be solved at steady state; implement CWCN that learns complex-weighted structures, includes learnable matrices and nonlinear activations; training uses standard GNN framework.

Result: Theoretical expressiveness result; CWCN achieves competitive performance on benchmark datasets; simple to implement; no extra hyperparameters beyond standard GNNs.

Conclusion: Complex-weighted diffusion is a principled, general mechanism to enhance GNN expressiveness and offers a fruitful avenue for theory-grounded, effective models.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable success across diverse applications, yet they remain limited by oversmoothing and poor performance on heterophilic graphs. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel framework that equips graphs with a complex-weighted structure, assigning each edge a complex number to drive a diffusion process that extends random walks into the complex domain. We prove that this diffusion is highly expressive: with appropriately chosen complex weights, any node-classification task can be solved in the steady state of a complex random walk. Building on this insight, we propose the Complex-Weighted Convolutional Network (CWCN), which learns suitable complex-weighted structures directly from data while enriching diffusion with learnable matrices and nonlinear activations. CWCN is simple to implement, requires no additional hyperparameters beyond those of standard GNNs, and achieves competitive performance on benchmark datasets. Our results demonstrate that complex-weighted diffusion provides a principled and general mechanism for enhancing GNN expressiveness, opening new avenues for models that are both theoretically grounded and practically effective.

*Michał Iwaniuk,Mateusz Jarosz,Bartłomiej Borycki,Bartosz Jezierski,Jan Cwalina,Stanisław Kaźmierczak,Jacek Mańdziuk*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Tuning the bootstrap rate (BR) in Random Forest regression can significantly improve performance over the default BR=1.0. Across 39 datasets and 16 RF configurations, optimal BRs vary: BR≤1.0 on 24 datasets, BR>1.0 on 15, BR=1.0 on 4. Dataset characteristics influence BR choice: strong global feature-target relationships favor higher BRs, while high local target variance favors lower BRs. Synthetic-noise experiments reproduce a bias-variance trade-off: high BR reduces bias in low-noise settings, while low BR reduces variance in high-noise settings. Conclusion: BR is a powerful hyperparameter that should be tuned for RF regression.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To challenge the conventional default BR=1.0 in Random Forests and determine whether varying BR can consistently improve regression performance across diverse datasets and RF configurations, and to understand how dataset characteristics influence the optimal BR.

Method: Empirical study: evaluate 39 heterogeneous regression datasets and 16 RF configurations. Vary bootstrap rate BR from 0.2 to 5.0. Use repeated two-fold cross-validation and mean squared error as the evaluation metric. Include experiments on synthetic datasets with controlled noise to explore bias-variance trade-offs.

Result: Brute-force BR tuning yields notable gains: best BR values occur both below and above 1.0; 24 datasets favor BR≤1.0, 15 datasets BR>1.0, 4 datasets BR=1.0. Higher BRs align with strong global feature-target relations; lower BRs with higher local target variance. In low-noise data, high BR reduces bias; in high-noise data, low BR reduces variance.

Conclusion: Bootstrap rate is a critical hyperparameter for RF regression and should be tuned to optimize performance, rather than defaulting to BR=1.0.

Abstract: Random Forests (RFs) typically train each tree on a bootstrap sample of the same size as the training set, i.e., bootstrap rate (BR) equals 1.0. We systematically examine how varying BR from 0.2 to 5.0 affects RF performance across 39 heterogeneous regression datasets and 16 RF configurations, evaluating with repeated two-fold cross-validation and mean squared error. Our results demonstrate that tuning the BR can yield significant improvements over the default: the best setup relied on BR \leq 1.0 for 24 datasets, BR > 1.0 for 15, and BR = 1.0 was optimal in 4 cases only. We establish a link between dataset characteristics and the preferred BR: datasets with strong global feature-target relationships favor higher BRs, while those with higher local target variance benefit from lower BRs. To further investigate this relationship, we conducted experiments on synthetic datasets with controlled noise levels. These experiments reproduce the observed bias-variance trade-off: in low-noise scenarios, higher BRs effectively reduce model bias, whereas in high-noise settings, lower BRs help reduce model variance. Overall, BR is an influential hyperparameter that should be tuned to optimize RF regression models.

### [193] [Efficient reconstruction of multidimensional random field models with heterogeneous data using stochastic neural networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13977)
*Mingtao Xia,Qijing Shen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Establishes generalization bounds for Wasserstein-based training of stochastic neural networks (SNNs) on multidimensional random field models; shows that heterogeneous noise across dimensions can reduce or remove explicit dependence on model dimensionality in the convergence rate; improves the training method and confirms robustness via experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable scalable learning of multidimensional random field models from limited data, addressing the curse of dimensionality in uncertainty quantification by leveraging Wasserstein-distance-based training for SNNs.

Method: Derives a generalization error bound for reconstructing multidimensional random field models using SNNs trained with a Wasserstein-distance objective; analyzes the impact of dimension-wise noise heterogeneity on the convergence rate; provides improvements to the Wasserstein-distance SNN training approach and demonstrates robustness through numerical experiments.

Result: A proven generalization error bound for SNN-based reconstruction with limited data; under heterogeneous noise across dimensions, the convergence rate may not explicitly depend on the model dimensionality, partially alleviating the curse of dimensionality. The authors also refine the Wasserstein-distance training method and show robustness via numerical experiments across multidimensional UQ tasks, where the approach successfully learns multidimensional uncertainty models.

Conclusion: Wasserstein-distance training of SNNs offers a scalable and robust means to learn multidimensional uncertainty models from finite data, mitigating dimensionality effects under certain noise conditions and confirming practical viability through empirical results.

Abstract: In this paper, we analyze the scalability of a recent Wasserstein-distance approach for training stochastic neural networks (SNNs) to reconstruct multidimensional random field models. We prove a generalization error bound for reconstructing multidimensional random field models on training stochastic neural networks with a limited number of training data. Our results indicate that when noise is heterogeneous across dimensions, the convergence rate of the generalization error may not depend explicitly on the model's dimensionality, partially alleviating the "curse of dimensionality" for learning multidimensional random field models from a finite number of data points. Additionally, we improve the previous Wasserstein-distance SNN training approach and showcase the robustness of the SNN. Through numerical experiments on different multidimensional uncertainty quantification tasks, we show that our Wasserstein-distance approach can successfully train stochastic neural networks to learn multidimensional uncertainty models.

TL;DR: RECAP: a reinforcement learning framework for vision-language-action models that uses advantage conditioning to fuse offline RL pretraining with on-robot demonstrations, on-policy data, and expert interventions, yielding robust real-world VLA agents that can perform complex tasks more quickly with fewer failures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bridge the gap between offline policies and real-world deployment for vision-language-action models by enabling learning from diverse data sources and corrections during autonomous execution.

Method: Propose RECAP: pretrain a generalist VLA via offline RL to obtain π*_0.6; then specialize via on-robot data collection using advantage-conditioned policies; integrate demonstrations, on-policy rollouts, and expert interventions to guide policy improvement.

Result: When trained with RECAP, the π*_0.6 model can fold laundry, assemble boxes, and brew espresso in real homes; on hardest tasks, RECAP more than doubles throughput and roughly halves failure rate.

Conclusion: RECAP provides a practical, data-efficient pathway to robust real-world VLA agents by combining offline pretraining with continued learning from diverse corrective signals during deployment.

Abstract: We study how vision-language-action (VLA) models can improve through real-world deployments via reinforcement learning (RL). We present a general-purpose method, RL with Experience and Corrections via Advantage-conditioned Policies (RECAP), that provides for RL training of VLAs via advantage conditioning. Our method incorporates heterogeneous data into the self-improvement process, including demonstrations, data from on-policy collection, and expert teleoperated interventions provided during autonomous execution. RECAP starts by pre-training a generalist VLA with offline RL, which we call $π^{*}_{0.6}$, that can then be specialized to attain high performance on downstream tasks through on-robot data collection. We show that the $π^{*}_{0.6}$ model trained with the full RECAP method can fold laundry in real homes, reliably assemble boxes, and make espresso drinks using a professional espresso machine. On some of the hardest tasks, RECAP more than doubles task throughput and roughly halves the task failure rate.

### [195] [Data Whitening Improves Sparse Autoencoder Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13981)
*Ashwin Saraswatula,David Klindt*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PCA whitening of SAE inputs improves interpretability and sparsity metrics by convexifying the optimization landscape, with small reconstruction loss, suggesting whitening as default preprocessing when interpretability is prioritized.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAEs struggle with optimization due to input correlations; want to enhance interpretability without sacrificing too much fidelity.

Method: Apply PCA whitening to input activations; theoretical analysis of optimization landscape; empirical evaluation across ReLU and Top-K SAEs, varied architectures;SAEBench benchmark.

Result: Whitening improves interpretability metrics (sparse probing accuracy, feature disentanglement) across settings; slight reduction in reconstruction quality; improvements observed across widths and sparsity regimes; supports shifting interpretability vs fidelity trade-off.

Conclusion: Whitening should be considered a default preprocessing step for SAE training when interpretability is prioritized; the interpretability gains may come at a modest reconstruction cost; challenges the assumption that optimal sparsity aligns with best interpretability.

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have emerged as a promising approach for learning interpretable features from neural network activations. However, the optimization landscape for SAE training can be challenging due to correlations in the input data. We demonstrate that applying PCA Whitening to input activations -- a standard preprocessing technique in classical sparse coding -- improves SAE performance across multiple metrics. Through theoretical analysis and simulation, we show that whitening transforms the optimization landscape, making it more convex and easier to navigate. We evaluate both ReLU and Top-K SAEs across diverse model architectures, widths, and sparsity regimes. Empirical evaluation on SAEBench, a comprehensive benchmark for sparse autoencoders, reveals that whitening consistently improves interpretability metrics, including sparse probing accuracy and feature disentanglement, despite minor drops in reconstruction quality. Our results challenge the assumption that interpretability aligns with an optimal sparsity--fidelity trade-off and suggest that whitening should be considered as a default preprocessing step for SAE training, particularly when interpretability is prioritized over perfect reconstruction.

### [196] [Node-Level Uncertainty Estimation in LLM-Generated SQL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13984)
*Hilaf Hasson,Ruocheng Guo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Node-level, AST-aware uncertainty estimation for LLM-generated SQL, enabling fine-grained error detection and targeted repair.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Token-level confidence is insufficient for SQL generation; need semantically aware, per-node diagnostics that handle structure and aliases and support actionable repair.

Method: Two-stage approach: (1) semantically aware labeling to assign per-node correctness relative to a gold reference without over-penalizing containers/aliases; (2) rich node representations (schema-aware and lexical features) fed into a supervised classifier to predict per-node error probabilities, interpreted as calibrated uncertainty.

Result: Across multiple databases and datasets, per-node uncertainty outperforms token log-probabilities, with average AUC increasing by 27.44 percentage points and showing robustness in cross-database evaluation.

Conclusion: Node-centric, semantically grounded uncertainty estimation provides a strong, interpretable alternative to aggregate sequence-level confidence, enabling targeted repair, human-in-the-loop review, and selective execution.

Abstract: We present a practical framework for detecting errors in LLM-generated SQL by estimating uncertainty at the level of individual nodes in the query's abstract syntax tree (AST). Our approach proceeds in two stages. First, we introduce a semantically aware labeling algorithm that, given a generated SQL and a gold reference, assigns node-level correctness without over-penalizing structural containers or alias variation. Second, we represent each node with a rich set of schema-aware and lexical features - capturing identifier validity, alias resolution, type compatibility, ambiguity in scope, and typo signals - and train a supervised classifier to predict per-node error probabilities. We interpret these probabilities as calibrated uncertainty, enabling fine-grained diagnostics that pinpoint exactly where a query is likely to be wrong. Across multiple databases and datasets, our method substantially outperforms token log-probabilities: average AUC improves by +27.44% while maintaining robustness under cross-database evaluation. Beyond serving as an accuracy signal, node-level uncertainty supports targeted repair, human-in-the-loop review, and downstream selective execution. Together, these results establish node-centric, semantically grounded uncertainty estimation as a strong and interpretable alternative to aggregate sequence level confidence measures.

### [197] [On the Gradient Complexity of Private Optimization with Private Oracles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13999)
*Michael Menart,Aleksandar Nikolov*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Derives lower bounds on oracle complexity for private empirical risk minimization with Lipschitz convex losses, showing dimension-dependent runtime penalties under differential privacy; establishes tightness with DP-SGD in various regimes, and extends to information-limited gradient channels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understand fundamental runtime limits for differentially private optimization in high-dimensional settings, focusing on first-order oracle complexity and gradient communication constraints, and compare private vs. non-private regimes.

Method: Information-theoretic lower bounds for non-smooth and smooth Lipschitz convex losses under private proxy oracles, with minibatch size constraints; extend to information-limited gradient channels with Γ bits; compare against DP-SGD upper bounds to identify regimes of tightness.

Result: Lower bounds for non-smooth private proxy setting: Ω(min{ sqrt(d)/α^2, d/log(1/α) }) for d ≥ 1/α^2; strengthened to Ω(min{ d/(m̄ α^2), d/log(1/α) }) for minibatch size m̄ < sqrt(d). For smooth losses: Ω( sqrt(d)/α + min{1/α^2, n} ) first-order calls (nearly tight with existing algorithms). Information-limited setting: Ω(min{ d/(α^2 Γ), d/log(1/α) }). DP optimizers incur dimension-dependent runtime penalties compared to non-private cases; results suggest near-optimality of DP-SGD in some regimes.

Conclusion: Differential privacy imposes fundamental, dimension-dependent costs on optimization runtime. Gradient quantization and information-limited channels further constrain progress, highlighting a gap between private and non-private regimes and establishing near-tight bounds for several DP settings.

Abstract: We study the running time, in terms of first order oracle queries, of differentially private empirical/population risk minimization of Lipschitz convex losses. We first consider the setting where the loss is non-smooth and the optimizer interacts with a private proxy oracle, which sends only private messages about a minibatch of gradients. In this setting, we show that expected running time $Ω(\min\{\frac{\sqrt{d}}{α^2}, \frac{d}{\log(1/α)}\})$ is necessary to achieve $α$ excess risk on problems of dimension $d$ when $d \geq 1/α^2$. Upper bounds via DP-SGD show these results are tight when $d>\tildeΩ(1/α^4)$. We further show our lower bound can be strengthened to $Ω(\min\{\frac{d}{\bar{m}α^2}, \frac{d}{\log(1/α)} \})$ for algorithms which use minibatches of size at most $\bar{m} < \sqrt{d}$. We next consider smooth losses, where we relax the private oracle assumption and give lower bounds under only the condition that the optimizer is private. Here, we lower bound the expected number of first order oracle calls by $\tildeΩ\big(\frac{\sqrt{d}}α + \min\{\frac{1}{α^2}, n\}\big)$, where $n$ is the size of the dataset. Modifications to existing algorithms show this bound is nearly tight. Compared to non-private lower bounds, our results show that differentially private optimizers pay a dimension dependent runtime penalty. Finally, as a natural extension of our proof technique, we show lower bounds in the non-smooth setting for optimizers interacting with information limited oracles. Specifically, if the proxy oracle transmits at most $Γ$-bits of information about the gradients in the minibatch, then $Ω\big(\min\{\frac{d}{α^2Γ}, \frac{d}{\log(1/α)}\}\big)$ oracle calls are needed. This result shows fundamental limitations of gradient quantization techniques in optimization.

### [198] [How to Marginalize in Causal Structure Learning?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14001)
*William Zhao,Guy Van den Broeck,Benjie Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Novel method uses tractable probabilistic circuits to enable fast, exact marginalization in Bayesian structure learning, outperforming DP-based approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Inferring BN structure requires marginalizing over distributions; dynamic programming (DP) methods often restrict the set of possible parents per node, leading to approximate or biased results. A scalable approach for exact marginals is needed.

Method: Train tractable probabilistic circuits on both the original distribution and marginal queries, leveraging the circuits' inherent ability to perform fast, exact marginalization. Integrate these circuits into Bayesian structure learners to answer marginals without restrictive parent-set assumptions.

Result: Empirical experiments show that using our circuit-based marginals improves the performance of Bayesian structure learners compared with current DP-based methods.

Conclusion: Probabilistic circuits offer a scalable, exact marginalization mechanism for BN structure learning, enabling improved inference and potentially broader applicability beyond current DP-based approaches.

Abstract: Bayesian networks (BNs) are a widely used class of probabilistic graphical models employed in numerous application domains. However, inferring the network's graphical structure from data remains challenging. Bayesian structure learners approach this problem by inferring a posterior distribution over the possible directed acyclic graphs underlying the BN. The inference process often requires marginalizing over probability distributions, which is typically done using dynamic programming methods that restrict the set of possible parents for each node. Instead, we present a novel method that utilizes tractable probabilistic circuits to circumvent this restriction. This method utilizes a new learning routine that trains these circuits on both the original distribution and marginal queries. The architecture of probabilistic circuits then inherently allows for fast and exact marginalization on the learned distribution. We then show empirically that utilizing our method to answer marginals allows Bayesian structure learners to improve their performance compared to current methods.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This work reveals vulnerabilities in probabilistic robustness certifications by showing attackers can craft imperceptible perturbations that trigger deceptive, oversized certified radii for adversarial inputs, effectively spoofing certificates and bypassing defenses like DensePure on ImageNet.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the limits and potential misuse of probabilistic certification frameworks, highlighting that guarantees may be manipulated to misclassify while still providing a deceptive robustness guarantee.

Method: Develop region-focused adversarial examples that minimize perturbations while steering inputs into regions that yield certificates for a target incorrect class; conduct large-scale experiments on ImageNet to test against state-of-the-art defenses.

Result: Demonstrated ability to bypass DensePure and inflate certifiable radii for target classes; perturbations can be small and imperceptible; proves the vulnerability of current certification approaches.

Conclusion: Robustness certification methods have nontrivial vulnerabilities; stronger, more reliable guarantees are needed and certification procedures should be redesigned to resist spoofing; calls for further research into the fundamental limits of certification.

Abstract: Certified defenses promise provable robustness guarantees. We study the malicious exploitation of probabilistic certification frameworks to better understand the limits of guarantee provisions. Now, the objective is to not only mislead a classifier, but also manipulate the certification process to generate a robustness guarantee for an adversarial input certificate spoofing. A recent study in ICLR demonstrated that crafting large perturbations can shift inputs far into regions capable of generating a certificate for an incorrect class. Our study investigates if perturbations needed to cause a misclassification and yet coax a certified model into issuing a deceptive, large robustness radius for a target class can still be made small and imperceptible. We explore the idea of region-focused adversarial examples to craft imperceptible perturbations, spoof certificates and achieve certification radii larger than the source class ghost certificates. Extensive evaluations with the ImageNet demonstrate the ability to effectively bypass state-of-the-art certified defenses such as Densepure. Our work underscores the need to better understand the limits of robustness certification methods.

### [200] [From Narrow Unlearning to Emergent Misalignment: Causes, Consequences, and Containment in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14017)
*Erum Mushtaq,Anil Ramakrishna,Satyapriya Krishna,Sattvik Sahai,Prasoon Goyal,Kai-Wei Chang,Tao Zhang,Rahul Gupta*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Targeted refusal unlearning in narrow domains can trigger emergent misalignment (EMA) that spreads to unrelated AI safety domains; cross-entropy loss with retained domain data can largely restore alignment; early-layer concept entanglement correlates with EMA susceptibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand EMA beyond insecure code data, investigating how narrow domain interventions (refusal unlearning) affect cross-domain harmful behavior and how to mitigate it.

Method: Conduct refusal unlearning on Cybersecurity and Safety concepts in two model families (Mistral-7b-0.3v and Qwen-7b-2.5). Monitor refusal scores across seven RAI domains (Cybersecurity, Safety, Toxicity, Bias, Sensitive Content, Medical/Legal, Privacy). Apply refusal unlearning augmented with cross-entropy loss on a small retain dataset from affected domains to restore alignment. Analyze concept vectors to study entanglement and susceptibility.

Result: Narrow domain unlearning yields compliance for the targeted concept but can propagate EMA to unrelated domains. Safety unlearning shows larger EMA impact, reducing refusal in domains like Bias. Effects are consistent across both model families. Adding cross-entropy loss with a retain dataset largely restores alignment on the affected domains while maintaining lower refusal on the unlearned concept. Concept-vector analysis reveals that concepts with higher representation similarity in earlier layers are more susceptible to EMA after targeted unlearning.

Conclusion: EMA can be induced by targeted, narrow-domain interventions and may spread across domains; mitigation via cross-entropy with retained-domain data can restore alignment. Early-layer concept entanglements predict EMA susceptibility, highlighting the need for robust safety interventions that account for cross-domain effects.

Abstract: Recent work has shown that fine-tuning on insecure code data can trigger an emergent misalignment (EMA) phenomenon, where models generate malicious responses even to prompts unrelated to the original insecure code-writing task. Such cross-domain generalization of harmful behavior underscores the need for a deeper understanding of the algorithms, tasks, and datasets that induce emergent misalignment. In this work, we extend this study by demonstrating that emergent misalignment can also arise from narrow refusal unlearning in specific domains. We perform refusal unlearning on Cybersecurity and Safety concept, and evaluate EMA by monitoring refusal scores across seven responsible AI (RAI) domains, Cybersecurity, Safety, Toxicity, Bias, Sensitive Content, Medical/Legal, and Privacy. Our work shows that narrow domain unlearning can yield compliance responses for the targeted concept, however, it may also propagate EMA to unrelated domains. Among the two intervened concepts, Cybersecurity and Safety, we find that the safety concept can have larger EMA impact, i.e, causing lower refusal scores, across other unrelated domains such as bias. We observe this effect consistently across two model families, Mistral-7b-0.3v, and Qwen-7b-2.5. Further, we show that refusal unlearning augmented with cross-entropy loss function on a small set of retain data from the affected domains can largely, if not fully, restore alignment across the impacted domains while having lower refusal rate on the concept we perform unlearning on. To investigate the underlying causes of EMA, we analyze concept entanglements at the representation level via concept vectors. Our analysis reveals that concepts with higher representation similarity in earlier layers are more susceptible to EMA after intervention when the refusal stream is altered through targeted refusal unlearning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SMEs (99.9% of US businesses) remain excluded from AI due to data scale requirements; democratizing AI for small data could unlock productivity and decision support for millions of SMEs.

Method: Three-layer architecture: Layer 1 SHAP-based transfer of priors from 22,673 public records to logistic regression; Layer 2 hierarchical pooling across J=5–50 SMEs with adaptive shrinkage; Layer 3 conformal prediction with finite-sample coverage.

Result: Validation on churn data: 96.7% +/- 4.2% AUC with 100 observations per business; +24.2 points vs independent LR (72.5% +/- 8.1%), p<0.000001. Conformal coverage 92% at 90% target. Training 33 minutes on CPU. Potential to cover 33 million SMEs.

Conclusion: SmallML demonstrates a practical blueprint for scalable, data-efficient AI for SMEs, potentially enabling broad democratization of ML-powered decisions; effectiveness across domains and long-term deployment require broader validation and monitoring.

Abstract: Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) represent 99.9% of U.S. businesses yet remain systematically excluded from AI due to a mismatch between their operational scale and modern machine learning's data requirements. This paper introduces SmallML, a Bayesian transfer learning framework achieving enterprise-level prediction accuracy with datasets as small as 50-200 observations.
  We develop a three-layer architecture integrating transfer learning, hierarchical Bayesian modeling, and conformal prediction. Layer 1 extracts informative priors from 22,673 public records using a SHAP-based procedure transferring knowledge from gradient boosting to logistic regression. Layer 2 implements hierarchical pooling across J=5-50 SMEs with adaptive shrinkage, balancing population patterns with entity-specific characteristics. Layer 3 provides conformal sets with finite-sample coverage guarantees P(y in C(x)) >= 1-alpha for distribution-free uncertainty quantification.
  Validation on customer churn data demonstrates 96.7% +/- 4.2% AUC with 100 observations per business -- a +24.2 point improvement over independent logistic regression (72.5% +/- 8.1%), with p < 0.000001. Conformal prediction achieves 92% empirical coverage at 90% target. Training completes in 33 minutes on standard CPU hardware. By enabling enterprise-grade predictions for 33 million U.S. SMEs previously excluded from machine learning, SmallML addresses a critical gap in AI democratization.

### [202] [Radial Compensation: Stable and Semantically Decoupled Generative Models on Riemannian Manifolds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14056)
*Marios Papamichals,Regina Ruane*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Radial Compensation (RC) decouples curvature from radial model parameters in manifold generative models by selecting a tangent-space base density so that likelihood depends only on geodesic distance; with the Balanced-Exponential (bExp) chart, RC preserves Fisher information and reduces gradient variance, enabling stable, high-likelihood models on curved spaces.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Curvature-model entanglement in charts (e.g., exponential maps, volume-preserving charts) inflates gradient variance and harms likelihoods; high-dimensional latent flows can blow radii beyond curvature scale, causing numerical instability and poor test likelihoods.

Method: Introduce RC: choose a base density in the tangent space so that the likelihood depends on the geodesic distance from a pole; extend RC to manifolds with known geodesic polar volume; prove RC is the unique construction yielding curvature-invariant Fisher information for geodesic-radial likelihoods; derive the Balanced-Exponential (bExp) chart family that balances volume distortion with geodesic error; show that under RC all bExp settings preserve manifold density and Fisher information; show smaller dial values reduce gradient variance and flow cost.

Result: RC yields stable generative models across densities, VAEs, flows on images and graphs, and protein models; improves likelihoods, restores clean geodesic radii, and prevents radius blow-ups in high-dimensional flows.

Conclusion: RC-bExp provides a robust default for likelihood-trained generative models on manifolds by decoupling curvature from radial parameters, preserving curvature-invariant Fisher information, and offering a tunable trade-off between volume distortion and geodesic accuracy that reduces gradient variance and computation while maintaining density.

Abstract: Generative models on curved spaces rely on charts to map Euclidean spaces to manifolds. Exponential maps preserve geodesics but have stiff, radius-dependent Jacobians, while volume-preserving charts maintain densities but distort geodesic distances. Both approaches entangle curvature with model parameters, inflating gradient variance. In high-dimensional latent normalizing flows, the wrapped exponential prior can stretch radii far beyond the curvature scale, leading to poor test likelihoods and stiff solvers. We introduce Radial Compensation (RC), an information-geometric method that selects the base density in the tangent space so that the likelihood depends only on geodesic distance from a pole, decoupling parameter semantics from curvature. RC lets radial parameters retain their usual meaning in geodesic units, while the chart can be tuned as a numerical preconditioner. We extend RC to manifolds with known geodesic polar volume and show that RC is the only construction for geodesic-radial likelihoods with curvature-invariant Fisher information. We derive the Balanced-Exponential (bExp) chart family, balancing volume distortion and geodesic error. Under RC, all bExp settings preserve the same manifold density and Fisher information, with smaller dial values reducing gradient variance and flow cost. Empirically, RC yields stable generative models across densities, VAEs, flows on images and graphs, and protein models. RC improves likelihoods, restores clean geodesic radii, and prevents radius blow-ups in high-dimensional flows, making RC-bExp a robust default for likelihood-trained generative models on manifolds.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A wearable-based multimodal ML framework for archery that jointly recognizes motion phases and estimates stress using accelerometer/PPG data; introduces SmoothDiff feature; achieves high motion accuracy and 80% stress classification; enables real-time feedback in precision sports.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional motion analysis is expensive and intrusive, limiting natural training; performance depends on biomechanical stability and psychological resilience; need integrated, accessible sensing in real-world practice.

Method: Developed a wrist-worn device with accelerometer and PPG; collect synchronized motion and HRV data; Motion: propose SmoothDiff feature; LSTM for motion phase recognition; Stress: extract HRV features from PPG; MLP classifier for high vs low stress.

Result: Motion recognition: 96.8% accuracy and 95.9% F1. Stress estimation: 80% accuracy in distinguishing high vs low stress.

Conclusion: Combining motion and physiological sensing yields actionable insights into technical and mental states; supports real-time feedback systems for training optimization in archery and other precision sports.

Abstract: In precision sports such as archery, athletes' performance depends on both biomechanical stability and psychological resilience. Traditional motion analysis systems are often expensive and intrusive, limiting their use in natural training environments. To address this limitation, we propose a machine learning-based multimodal framework that integrates wearable sensor data for simultaneous action recognition and stress estimation. Using a self-developed wrist-worn device equipped with an accelerometer and photoplethysmography (PPG) sensor, we collected synchronized motion and physiological data during real archery sessions. For motion recognition, we introduce a novel feature--Smoothed Differential Acceleration (SmoothDiff)--and employ a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model to identify motion phases, achieving 96.8% accuracy and 95.9% F1-score. For stress estimation, we extract heart rate variability (HRV) features from PPG signals and apply a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) classifier, achieving 80% accuracy in distinguishing high- and low-stress levels. The proposed framework demonstrates that integrating motion and physiological sensing can provide meaningful insights into athletes' technical and mental states. This approach offers a foundation for developing intelligent, real-time feedback systems for training optimization in archery and other precision sports.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CafeMed uses dynamic causal reasoning (CWG) and cross-modal attention (CHARM) to improve medication recommendations by modeling patient-state–dependent causal effects and diagnoses-procedures synergies, achieving higher accuracy and fewer drug–drug interactions on MIMIC-III/IV; code released.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Two fundamental gaps: (i) treating medical entities as isolated features without capturing synergistic effects, and (ii) relying on static causal relationships that don’t adapt to patient context. This limits personalization and safety in medication choice.

Method: Introduce the Causal Weight Generator (CWG) to transform static causal effects into dynamic, patient-state–driven modulation weights, and the Channel Harmonized Attention Refinement Module (CHARM) to capture complex interdependencies between diagnoses and procedures. Integrate these into a unified framework for safe, accurate medication recommendation and train end-to-end on MIMIC-III and MIMIC-IV.

Result: CafeMed outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on MIMIC-III and MIMIC-IV, with higher medication-prediction accuracy and reduced drug–drug interaction rates.

Conclusion: Dynamic causal reasoning combined with cross-modal synergy yields more clinically aligned and personalized medication recommendations; code is publicly available at the authors’ GitHub repository.

Abstract: Medication recommendation systems play a crucial role in assisting clinicians with personalized treatment decisions. While existing approaches have made significant progress in learning medication representations, they suffer from two fundamental limitations: (i) treating medical entities as independent features without modeling their synergistic effects on medication selection; (ii) employing static causal relationships that fail to adapt to patient-specific contexts and health states. To address these challenges, we propose CafeMed, a framework that integrates dynamic causal reasoning with cross-modal attention for safe and accurate medication recommendation. CafeMed introduces two key components: the Causal Weight Generator (CWG) that transforms static causal effects into dynamic modulation weights based on individual patient states, and the Channel Harmonized Attention Refinement Module (CHARM) that captures complex interdependencies between diagnoses and procedures. This design enables CafeMed to model how different medical conditions jointly influence treatment decisions while maintaining medication safety constraints. Extensive experiments on MIMIC-III and MIMIC-IV datasets demonstrate that CafeMed significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving superior accuracy in medication prediction while maintaining the lower drug--drug interaction rates. Our results indicate that incorporating dynamic causal relationships and cross-modal synergies leads to more clinically-aligned and personalized medication recommendations.

### [205] [CFG-EC: Error Correction Classifier-Free Guidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14075)
*Nakkyu Yang,Yechan Lee,SooJean Han*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CFG-EC introduces a correction scheme for classifier-free guidance (CFG) that refines unconditional noise predictions so they are orthogonal to conditional errors. This reduces interference between guidance components, tightens sampling error bounds, and improves prompt fidelity and generation quality, especially in low guidance regimes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the mismatch between training-time stochastic conditioning (conditional vs null prompts) and sampling-time usage (both null and conditional prompts) in CFG, which can cause inconsistent noise estimates and degraded generation quality.

Method: Augment CFG with a corrective mechanism (CFG-EC) that realigns the unconditional noise error component to be orthogonal to the conditional error component, effectively isolating their influences during sampling and reducing upper-bounds on sampling error. The scheme is designed to be compatible with any CFG-based method.

Result: Numerical experiments indicate CFG-EC handles the unconditional component more effectively than CFG and CFG++, yielding better performance in low guidance sampling and higher prompt alignment across settings.

Conclusion: CFG-EC provides a versatile, plug-in correction to CFG that improves stability and fidelity of generated images by decoupling and orthogonalizing unconditional and conditional noise errors.

Abstract: Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) has become a mainstream approach for simultaneously improving prompt fidelity and generation quality in conditional generative models. During training, CFG stochastically alternates between conditional and null prompts to enable both conditional and unconditional generation. However, during sampling, CFG outputs both null and conditional prompts simultaneously, leading to inconsistent noise estimates between the training and sampling processes. To reduce this error, we propose CFG-EC, a versatile correction scheme augmentable to any CFG-based method by refining the unconditional noise predictions. CFG-EC actively realigns the unconditional noise error component to be orthogonal to the conditional error component. This corrective maneuver prevents interference between the two guidance components, thereby constraining the sampling error's upper bound and establishing more reliable guidance trajectories for high-fidelity image generation. Our numerical experiments show that CFG-EC handles the unconditional component more effectively than CFG and CFG++, delivering a marked performance increase in the low guidance sampling regime and consistently higher prompt alignment across the board.

### [206] [Meta-SimGNN: Adaptive and Robust WiFi Localization Across Dynamic Configurations and Diverse Scenarios](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14076)
*Qiqi Xiao,Ziqi Ye,Yinghui He,Jianwei Liu,Guanding Yu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes Meta-SimGNN, a graph-neural-network and meta-learning framework for WiFi localization that remains robust to device-configuration changes (AP count, bandwidth, antennas) by using a CSI graph with amplitude-phase fusion and dimension-consistent features, guided by similarity-based meta-learning; shows improved generalization and accuracy on commodity hardware.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current meta-learning solutions for localization mostly address environmental layout variations but neglect changes in device configurations that alter CSI dimensionality, reducing neural-network usability across scenarios.

Method: Construct a fine-grained CSI graph with APs as nodes; apply amplitude-phase fusion to form CSI images and extract features that are dimension-consistent; develop a similarity-guided meta-learning strategy to initialize fine-tuning based on the similarity between new and historical scenarios; evaluate on commodity WiFi devices across diverse scenarios.

Result: Meta-SimGNN outperforms baseline methods in localization generalization and accuracy across different scenarios.

Conclusion: Integrating graph-based CSI modeling with similarity-guided meta-learning yields robust, scalable WiFi localization that adapts to device-configuration changes and practical hardware setups.

Abstract: To promote the practicality of deep learning-based localization, existing studies aim to address the issue of scenario dependence through meta-learning. However, these studies primarily focus on variations in environmental layouts while overlooking the impact of changes in device configurations, such as bandwidth, the number of access points (APs), and the number of antennas used. Unlike environmental changes, variations in device configurations affect the dimensionality of channel state information (CSI), thereby compromising neural network usability. To address this issue, we propose Meta-SimGNN, a novel WiFi localization system that integrates graph neural networks with meta-learning to improve localization generalization and robustness. First, we introduce a fine-grained CSI graph construction scheme, where each AP is treated as a graph node, allowing for adaptability to changes in the number of APs. To structure the features of each node, we propose an amplitude-phase fusion method and a feature extraction method. The former utilizes both amplitude and phase to construct CSI images, enhancing data reliability, while the latter extracts dimension-consistent features to address variations in bandwidth and the number of antennas. Second, a similarity-guided meta-learning strategy is developed to enhance adaptability in diverse scenarios. The initial model parameters for the fine-tuning stage are determined by comparing the similarity between the new scenario and historical scenarios, facilitating rapid adaptation of the model to the new localization scenario. Extensive experimental results over commodity WiFi devices in different scenarios show that Meta-SimGNN outperforms the baseline methods in terms of localization generalization and accuracy.

### [207] [Observational Auditing of Label Privacy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14084)
*Iden Kalemaj,Luca Melis,Maxime Boucher,Ilya Mironov,Saeed Mahloujifar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: An observational DP auditing framework that avoids modifying training data, extends auditing to protected attributes (including labels), and demonstrates effectiveness on Criteo and CIFAR-10 to enable practical privacy auditing in large systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DP auditing today often requires data interventions (e.g., canaries, sample removal), which is costly and hard at scale. There is a need for non-intrusive, distribution-based auditing that can operate in production, extending beyond membership inference to protected attributes.

Method: Develop an observational auditing approach that leverages inherent randomness in data distributions to assess privacy guarantees without changing the dataset; provides theoretical grounding; applies to protected attributes with labels treated as a special case; designed for large-scale deployment.

Result: Theoretical justification accompanied by empirical experiments on the Criteo and CIFAR-10 datasets demonstrating the framework’s ability to audit label privacy guarantees and, more broadly, protected attributes without data interventions.

Conclusion: Offers a practical, scalable privacy auditing tool suitable for large production systems; extends auditing beyond membership inference to protected attributes; reduces engineering overhead and facilitates deployment of DP guarantees.

Abstract: Differential privacy (DP) auditing is essential for evaluating privacy guarantees in machine learning systems. Existing auditing methods, however, pose a significant challenge for large-scale systems since they require modifying the training dataset -- for instance, by injecting out-of-distribution canaries or removing samples from training. Such interventions on the training data pipeline are resource-intensive and involve considerable engineering overhead. We introduce a novel observational auditing framework that leverages the inherent randomness of data distributions, enabling privacy evaluation without altering the original dataset. Our approach extends privacy auditing beyond traditional membership inference to protected attributes, with labels as a special case, addressing a key gap in existing techniques. We provide theoretical foundations for our method and perform experiments on Criteo and CIFAR-10 datasets that demonstrate its effectiveness in auditing label privacy guarantees. This work opens new avenues for practical privacy auditing in large-scale production environments.

### [208] [MoE-SpeQ: Speculative Quantized Decoding with Proactive Expert Prefetching and Offloading for Mixture-of-Experts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14102)
*Wenfeng Wang,Jiacheng Liu,Xiaofeng Hou,Xinfeng Xia,Peng Tang,Mingxuan Zhang,Chao Li,Minyi Guo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Co-design of speculative execution and expert offloading (MoE-SpeQ) to hide data movement latency in MoE inference by using an on-device draft model to forecast required experts and prefetch, guided by an Amortization Roofline Model, achieving up to 2.34x speedup on memory-constrained devices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The memory demand of large MoE models leads to I/O bottlenecks when offloading to host memory; data-dependent expert selection makes transfers on the critical path, limiting performance; need a solution enabling MoE inference on constrained hardware.

Method: Develop MoE-SpeQ: on-device draft model predicts the sequence of needed experts; runtime orchestrator prefetches from host memory; adaptive governor tunes speculation strategy using Amortization Roofline Model; co-design of speculative execution and offloading.

Result: On Phi-MoE, MoE-SpeQ achieves up to 2.34x speedup versus state-of-the-art offloading; demonstrates feasibility of data-movement hiding approach; improves accessibility on commodity hardware.

Conclusion: Speculative execution plus offloading with adaptive tuning provides a principled way to mitigate data-dependent memory bottlenecks in MoE inference on resource-limited devices, enabling more practical MoE deployment.

Abstract: The immense memory requirements of state-of-the-art Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models present a significant challenge for inference, often exceeding the capacity of a single accelerator. While offloading experts to host memory is a common solution, it introduces a severe I/O bottleneck over the PCIe bus, as the data-dependent nature of expert selection places these synchronous transfers directly on the critical path of execution, crippling performance.
  This paper argues that the I/O bottleneck can be overcome by trading a small amount of cheap, on-device computation to hide the immense cost of data movement. We present MoE-SpeQ, a new inference system built on a novel co-design of speculative execution and expert offloading. MoE-SpeQ employs a small, on-device draft model to predict the sequence of required experts for future tokens. This foresight enables a runtime orchestrator to prefetch these experts from host memory, effectively overlapping the expensive I/O with useful computation and hiding the latency from the critical path. To maximize performance, an adaptive governor, guided by an Amortization Roofline Model, dynamically tunes the speculation strategy to the underlying hardware. Our evaluation on memory-constrained devices shows that for the Phi-MoE model, MoE-SpeQ achieves at most 2.34x speedup over the state-of-the-art offloading framework. Our work establishes a new, principled approach for managing data-dependent memory access in resource-limited environments, making MoE inference more accessible on commodity hardware.

### [209] [Soft-Label Training Preserves Epistemic Uncertainty](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14117)
*Agamdeep Singh,Ashish Tiwari,Hosein Hasanbeig,Priyanshu Gupta*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Soft-label training treats annotation distributions as ground truth rather than collapsing to a single label, better aligning models with human uncertainty.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Subjectivity in labels: annotators provide varied labels, and collapsing to a point estimate misrepresents epistemic uncertainty in ambiguous data.

Method: Train models using soft labels (annotation distributions) as targets across vision and NLP tasks, comparing to hard-label training and evaluating epistemic uncertainty preservation.

Result: Soft-label training reduces KL divergence from human annotations by 32% and yields 61% stronger correlation between model entropy and annotation entropy, while maintaining accuracy comparable to hard-label training.

Conclusion: Annotation distributions should be regarded as faithful representations of epistemic uncertainty and learned by models, rather than noise to be collapsed away.

Abstract: Many machine learning tasks involve inherent subjectivity, where annotators naturally provide varied labels. Standard practice collapses these label distributions into single labels, aggregating diverse human judgments into point estimates. We argue that this approach is epistemically misaligned for ambiguous data--the annotation distribution itself should be regarded as the ground truth. Training on collapsed single labels forces models to express false confidence on fundamentally ambiguous cases, creating a misalignment between model certainty and the diversity of human perception. We demonstrate empirically that soft-label training, which treats annotation distributions as ground truth, preserves epistemic uncertainty. Across both vision and NLP tasks, soft-label training achieves 32% lower KL divergence from human annotations and 61% stronger correlation between model and annotation entropy, while matching the accuracy of hard-label training. Our work repositions annotation distributions from noisy signals to be aggregated away, to faithful representations of epistemic uncertainty that models should learn to reproduce.

### [210] [Synthetic Survival Control: Extending Synthetic Controls for "When-If" Decision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14133)
*Jessy Xinyi Han,Devavrat Shah*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Synthetic Survival Control (SSC) estimates counterfactual time-to-event hazard trajectories in panel data by weighting observed trajectories from others, enabling causal survival inference with staggered treatments in observational data; it comes with identification and finite-sample guarantees and is validated on multi-country cancer data showing improved survival with new therapies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Causal inference for time-to-event outcomes from observational data is hard due to censoring, non-random treatment assignment, limited sample sizes, and changing treatment adoption. There is a need to answer 'when-if' scenarios about how timing of events would change under interventions in heterogeneous, real-world settings.

Method: SSC constructs a counterfactual hazard trajectory for a unit as a weighted combination of other units' observed hazard trajectories in a panel with potentially different treatments over time. The authors formalize this within a low-rank panel framework for causal survival analysis, showing that such a structure arises under classical parametric survival models. They establish identification and finite-sample guarantees for SSC.

Result: Empirical validation on a multi-country cancer dataset with staggered introduction of new therapies demonstrates that access to novel treatments reduces post-intervention hazard trajectories relative to the synthetic (counterfactual) controls, indicating improved survival.

Conclusion: SSC offers a general, interpretable tool for counterfactual survival inference from observational data, with broad applicability across medicine, economics, and public policy, and provides formal identification and finite-sample guarantees within a low-rank panel survival framework.

Abstract: Estimating causal effects on time-to-event outcomes from observational data is particularly challenging due to censoring, limited sample sizes, and non-random treatment assignment. The need for answering such "when-if" questions--how the timing of an event would change under a specified intervention--commonly arises in real-world settings with heterogeneous treatment adoption and confounding. To address these challenges, we propose Synthetic Survival Control (SSC) to estimate counterfactual hazard trajectories in a panel data setting where multiple units experience potentially different treatments over multiple periods. In such a setting, SSC estimates the counterfactual hazard trajectory for a unit of interest as a weighted combination of the observed trajectories from other units. To provide formal justification, we introduce a panel framework with a low-rank structure for causal survival analysis. Indeed, such a structure naturally arises under classical parametric survival models. Within this framework, for the causal estimand of interest, we establish identification and finite sample guarantees for SSC. We validate our approach using a multi-country clinical dataset of cancer treatment outcomes, where the staggered introduction of new therapies creates a quasi-experimental setting. Empirically, we find that access to novel treatments is associated with improved survival, as reflected by lower post-intervention hazard trajectories relative to their synthetic counterparts. Given the broad relevance of survival analysis across medicine, economics, and public policy, our framework offers a general and interpretable tool for counterfactual survival inference using observational data.

*Promise Ekpo,Saesha Agarwal,Felix Grimm,Lekan Molu,Angelique Taylor*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Fair-GNE framework for self-enforcing fairness in MARL-based workload sharing in healthcare; uses constrained generalized Nash equilibrium to align policies; shows improved workload balance and high task success in a resuscitation simulator.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need for runtime, self-enforceable fairness among self-interested agents sharing resources in learning-enabled healthcare settings. Post hoc fairness shaping is not immutable at runtime, risking inconsistent performance.

Method: Formulate the problem as a constrained generalized Nash equilibrium (GNE) game, with adaptive constraint enforcement to guide group policy toward a safe and locally efficient equilibrium. Evaluate in a high-fidelity resuscitation simulator, comparing against fixed-penalty baselines.

Result: Significant improvement in workload balance (0.89 vs 0.33 JFI, p<0.01) and 86% task success, indicating fairness gains without sacrificing performance.

Conclusion: Proposes and validates Fair-GNE as an equilibrium-seeking framework for fair workload allocation in large MARL healthcare systems, with concrete formulations, metrics, and demonstration of principled fairness enforcement.

Abstract: Enforcing a fair workload allocation among multiple agents tasked to achieve an objective in learning enabled demand side healthcare worker settings is crucial for consistent and reliable performance at runtime. Existing multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) approaches steer fairness by shaping reward through post hoc orchestrations, leaving no certifiable self-enforceable fairness that is immutable by individual agents at runtime. Contextualized within a setting where each agent shares resources with others, we address this shortcoming with a learning enabled optimization scheme among self-interested decision makers whose individual actions affect those of other agents. This extends the problem to a generalized Nash equilibrium (GNE) game-theoretic framework where we steer group policy to a safe and locally efficient equilibrium, so that no agent can improve its utility function by unilaterally changing its decisions. Fair-GNE models MARL as a constrained generalized Nash equilibrium-seeking (GNE) game, prescribing an ideal equitable collective equilibrium within the problem's natural fabric. Our hypothesis is rigorously evaluated in our custom-designed high-fidelity resuscitation simulator. Across all our numerical experiments, Fair-GNE achieves significant improvement in workload balance over fixed-penalty baselines (0.89 vs.\ 0.33 JFI, $p < 0.01$) while maintaining 86\% task success, demonstrating statistically significant fairness gains through adaptive constraint enforcement. Our results communicate our formulations, evaluation metrics, and equilibrium-seeking innovations in large multi-agent learning-based healthcare systems with clarity and principled fairness enforcement.

*Fatima Kazi,Alex Young,Yash Inani,Setareh Rafatirad*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Study on bias detection and mitigation in LLMs; introduces an automated Bias-Identification Framework; shows mixed performance across bias types; data augmentation and prompting yield up to 20% gains on implicit-bias benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs inherit explicit and implicit biases from training data; biased outputs risk harm and misinformation. As generative AI scales, it is crucial to identify and mitigate biases across domains (e.g., gender, race, profession, religion).

Method: Evaluate bias benchmarks (StereoSet, CrowSPairs) on models including BERT and GPT-3.5; develop an automated Bias-Identification Framework to detect explicit and implicit biases; two-pronged approach (explicit vs implicit); Bag-of-Words analysis for implicit bias; fine-tune models via prompting techniques and data augmentation; assess cross-dataset generalization.

Result: Fine-tuned models show mixed results: gender biases harder to tackle; racial biases easier to avoid; models tend to over-rely on keywords; Bag-of-Woods reveals implicit stereotypes in vocabulary; prompting and data augmentation improve performance; up to 20% gains on implicit bias benchmarks and better cross-dataset adaptability.

Conclusion: Bias detection and mitigation in LLMs is feasible with targeted fine-tuning, prompting, and data augmentation, but complete elimination is challenging; robust, multi-faceted evaluation and continued refinement are needed to ensure fair outputs.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) inherit explicit and implicit biases from their training datasets. Identifying and mitigating biases in LLMs is crucial to ensure fair outputs, as they can perpetuate harmful stereotypes and misinformation. This study highlights the need to address biases in LLMs amid growing generative AI. We studied bias-specific benchmarks such as StereoSet and CrowSPairs to evaluate the existence of various biases in multiple generative models such as BERT and GPT 3.5. We proposed an automated Bias-Identification Framework to recognize various social biases in LLMs such as gender, race, profession, and religion. We adopted a two-pronged approach to detect explicit and implicit biases in text data. Results indicated fine-tuned models struggle with gender biases but excelled at identifying and avoiding racial biases. Our findings illustrated that despite having some success, LLMs often over-relied on keywords. To illuminate the capability of the analyzed LLMs in detecting implicit biases, we employed Bag-of-Words analysis and unveiled indications of implicit stereotyping within the vocabulary. To bolster the model performance, we applied an enhancement strategy involving fine-tuning models using prompting techniques and data augmentation of the bias benchmarks. The fine-tuned models exhibited promising adaptability during cross-dataset testing and significantly enhanced performance on implicit bias benchmarks, with performance gains of up to 20%.

### [213] [Certified Signed Graph Unlearning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14168)
*Junpeng Zhao,Lin Li,Kaixi Hu,Kaize Shi,Jingling Yuan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CSGU delivers certified unlearning for Signed Graph Neural Networks by (1) locating minimal affected neighborhoods through triangles, (2) using sociological node-importance to allocate privacy budget, and (3) applying importance-weighted updates, achieving strong privacy guarantees with minimal utility loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing graph unlearning methods target conventional GNNs and discard sign information, harming SGNN utility and unlearning effectiveness. There is a need for privacy-preserving unlearning that respects the heterogeneous, signed nature of real-world graphs.

Method: A three-stage pipeline: (1) efficient identification of minimal influenced neighborhoods via triangular structures, (2) sociological theory-based quantification of node importance to guide privacy budget allocation, (3) importance-weighted parameter updates to realize certified modifications with minimal utility degradation.

Result: Experiments demonstrate CSGU outperforms prior methods in both utility preservation and unlearning effectiveness on SGNNs.

Conclusion: CSGU provides provable privacy guarantees for SGNNs while preserving sociological principles, enabling effective, minimally invasive unlearning in signed graphs.

Abstract: Signed graphs model complex relationships through positive and negative edges, with widespread real-world applications. Given the sensitive nature of such data, selective removal mechanisms have become essential for privacy protection. While graph unlearning enables the removal of specific data influences from Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), existing methods are designed for conventional GNNs and overlook the unique heterogeneous properties of signed graphs. When applied to Signed Graph Neural Networks (SGNNs), these methods lose critical sign information, degrading both model utility and unlearning effectiveness. To address these challenges, we propose Certified Signed Graph Unlearning (CSGU), which provides provable privacy guarantees while preserving the sociological principles underlying SGNNs. CSGU employs a three-stage method: (1) efficiently identifying minimal influenced neighborhoods via triangular structures, (2) applying sociological theories to quantify node importance for optimal privacy budget allocation, and (3) performing importance-weighted parameter updates to achieve certified modifications with minimal utility degradation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CSGU outperforms existing methods, achieving superior performance in both utility preservation and unlearning effectiveness on SGNNs.

*Zheyu Lin,Jirui Yang,Hengqi Guo,Yubing Bao,Yao Guan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: N-GLARE is a non-generative, latent-representation safety evaluator that uses APT and JSS to predict LLM safety rankings, achieving real-time, low-cost evaluation that aligns with red-teaming results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable agile, post-training safety diagnostics for LLMs without the costs and latency of text generation-based red-teaming.

Method: Operate entirely on latent representations; analyze the Angular-Probabilistic Trajectory (APT) of hidden-layer dynamics and compute Jensen-Shannon Separability (JSS) to quantify safety-related separability between safe and unsafe representations.

Result: JSS rankings correlate strongly with Red Teaming safety rankings across 40 models and 20 strategies; reproduces discriminative trends of large-scale red-teaming at <1% of token and runtime cost, providing an efficient, output-free evaluation proxy.

Conclusion: N-GLARE offers a scalable, output-free proxy for real-time safety diagnostics, enabling rapid post-training safety evaluation with substantially reduced cost and latency.

Abstract: Evaluating the safety robustness of LLMs is critical for their deployment. However, mainstream Red Teaming methods rely on online generation and black-box output analysis. These approaches are not only costly but also suffer from feedback latency, making them unsuitable for agile diagnostics after training a new model. To address this, we propose N-GLARE (A Non-Generative, Latent Representation-Efficient LLM Safety Evaluator). N-GLARE operates entirely on the model's latent representations, bypassing the need for full text generation. It characterizes hidden layer dynamics by analyzing the APT (Angular-Probabilistic Trajectory) of latent representations and introducing the JSS (Jensen-Shannon Separability) metric. Experiments on over 40 models and 20 red teaming strategies demonstrate that the JSS metric exhibits high consistency with the safety rankings derived from Red Teaming. N-GLARE reproduces the discriminative trends of large-scale red-teaming tests at less than 1\% of the token cost and the runtime cost, providing an efficient output-free evaluation proxy for real-time diagnostics.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A hybrid Bayesian Deep Learning framework for ensemble weather forecasting that separates predictive uncertainty into epistemic (via variational inference) and aleatoric (via physics-informed stochastic perturbations) components, connecting BDL with EPS through a unified theory; validated on ERA5 data with improved accuracy, calibrated uncertainties, and superior efficiency versus diffusion models, with open-source code planned.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Weather prediction is chaotic, requiring reliable uncertainty quantification. Traditional ensemble prediction (EPS) is accurate but computationally intensive. Bayesian Deep Learning (BDL) offers probabilistic uncertainty estimates but is often disconnected from EPS. A unified hybrid BDL framework aims to combine the strengths of both approaches.

Method: Proposes a unified hybrid BDL framework that (i) decomposes predictive uncertainty into epistemic and aleatoric parts, (ii) uses variational inference to learn epistemic uncertainty, and (iii) applies a physics-informed stochastic perturbation scheme to model flow-dependent atmospheric dynamics for aleatoric uncertainty. Establishes a unified theoretical framework with theorems linking BDL and EPS and decomposing total uncertainty. Validation on ERA5 (1979-2019) at 0.25° resolution. Open-source code planned upon acceptance.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art probabilistic diffusion models in forecast accuracy and uncertainty calibration, while offering better computational efficiency.

Conclusion: Introduces a unified theory connecting BDL and EPS, demonstrates empirical gains on a large-scale reanalysis dataset, and commits to open-sourcing the code to foster reproducibility and adoption.

Abstract: Weather forecasting is fundamentally challenged by the chaotic nature of the atmosphere, necessitating probabilistic approaches to quantify uncertainty. While traditional ensemble prediction (EPS) addresses this through computationally intensive simulations, recent advances in Bayesian Deep Learning (BDL) offer a promising but often disconnected alternative. We bridge these paradigms through a unified hybrid Bayesian Deep Learning framework for ensemble weather forecasting that explicitly decomposes predictive uncertainty into epistemic and aleatoric components, learned via variational inference and a physics-informed stochastic perturbation scheme modeling flow-dependent atmospheric dynamics, respectively. We further establish a unified theoretical framework that rigorously connects BDL and EPS, providing formal theorems that decompose total predictive uncertainty into epistemic and aleatoric components under the hybrid BDL framework. We validate our framework on the large-scale 40-year ERA5 reanalysis dataset (1979-2019) with 0.25° spatial resolution. Experimental results show that our method not only improves forecast accuracy and yields better-calibrated uncertainty quantification but also achieves superior computational efficiency compared to state-of-the-art probabilistic diffusion models. We commit to making our code open-source upon acceptance of this paper.

*Yaniv Oren,Joery A. de Vries,Pascal R. van der Vaart,Matthijs T. J. Spaan,Wendelin Böhmer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduce Twice Sequential Monte Carlo Tree Search (TSMCTS), a two-stage SMC-based planning method for model-based RL that reduces variance and mitigates path degeneracy, achieving better scaling with sequential compute and outperforming SMC baselines and a modern MCTS variant across discrete and continuous tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SMC-based search is easy to parallelize and GPU-friendly but suffers from high variance and path degeneracy, limiting deep search; MCTS performs well but is less amenable to parallelization. There is a need for an approach that combines SMC’s parallelism with stable, scalable deep search.

Method: Propose Twice Sequential Monte Carlo Tree Search (TSMCTS), applying two sequential SMC processes within the tree search to reduce variance and address path degeneracy; includes mechanisms for variance reduction and maintaining diversity; evaluates on both discrete and continuous environments, comparing against an SMC baseline and a modern MCTS variant.

Result: TSMCTS outperforms both the SMC baseline and a popular modern MCTS variant across discrete and continuous environments, due to variance reduction and reduced path degeneracy; it scales more favorably with increased sequential compute while preserving the parallelizable advantages of SMC.

Conclusion: TSMCTS is a promising advancement for scalable, parallelizable planning in model-based RL; it combines the strengths of SMC with improved deep-search stability, suggesting broader applicability and potential for further refinements and real-world tasks.

Abstract: Model-based reinforcement learning (RL) methods that leverage search are responsible for many milestone breakthroughs in RL. Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) recently emerged as an alternative to the Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm which drove these breakthroughs. SMC is easier to parallelize and more suitable to GPU acceleration. However, it also suffers from large variance and path degeneracy which prevent it from scaling well with increased search depth, i.e., increased sequential compute. To address these problems, we introduce Twice Sequential Monte Carlo Tree Search (TSMCTS). Across discrete and continuous environments TSMCTS outperforms the SMC baseline as well as a popular modern version of MCTS. Through variance reduction and mitigation of path degeneracy, TSMCTS scales favorably with sequential compute while retaining the properties that make SMC natural to parallelize.

*Jim Broadbent,Felix Cohen,Frederik Hvilshøj,Eric Landau,Eren Sasoglu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: EBind is a data-centric, parameter-efficient method to bind embedding spaces across multi-modal models, achieving state-of-the-art results with a single 1.8B model trained on curated data sources. It introduces a three-source dataset, a new zero-shot benchmark, and will open-source code, weights, and data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce compute and data requirements for multimodal alignment by using a single per-modality encoder and high-quality data, making state-of-the-art training feasible on limited hardware.

Method: EBind trains a single 1.8B image-text-video-audio-3D model to bind embedding spaces. It relies on three data sources: (i) 6.7M fully-automated multimodal quintuples from SOTA retrieval models, (ii) 1M diverse, semi-automated triples annotated by humans as negative/partial/positive, and (iii) 3.4M pre-existing captioned items. The evaluation suite includes 13 tasks, plus a high-quality zero-shot classification benchmark between audio and PCs.

Result: The 1.8B model outperforms models 4–17x larger. Each data source contributes value, as shown across 13 evaluations. A new consensus-annotated zero-shot benchmark is introduced for audio-to-PC tasks, and the work will publish code, weights, and datasets.

Conclusion: Demonstrates that a data-centric, parameter-efficient approach can achieve state-of-the-art multimodal binding with far smaller models, enabling broader accessibility and reproducibility through open-sourcing.

Abstract: We simplify space binding by focusing on two core components, a single encoder per modality and high-quality data; enabling training state-of-the-art models on a single GPU in a few hours as opposed to multiple days. We present EBind, an Easy, data-centric, and parameter-efficient method to Bind the embedding spaces of multiple contrastive models. We demonstrate that a simple 1.8B-parameter image-text-video-audio-3D model can outperform models 4 to 17x the size. The key to achieving this is a carefully curated dataset of three complementary data sources: i) 6.7M fully-automated multimodal quintuples sourced via SOTA retrieval models, ii) 1M diverse, semi-automated triples annotated by humans as negative, partial, or positive matches, and iii) 3.4M pre-existing captioned data items. We use 13 different evaluations to demonstrate the value of each data source. Due to limitations with existing benchmarks, we further introduce the first high-quality, consensus-annotated zero-shot classification benchmark between audio and PCs.

*Yosuke Nishimoto,Takashi Matsubara*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: STICA uses object-centric transformers with causality-aware policy/value networks to improve sample efficiency and final performance in object-rich environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: World models struggle in high-dimensional, non-stationary, multi-object settings; humans reason by decomposing scenes into discrete objects, suggesting object-centric representations and causal reasoning can improve RL.

Method: Represent observations as a set of object-centric tokens plus action and reward tokens. The world model predicts token-level dynamics and interactions. Policy and value networks learn token-level causal relations and integrate them into attention mechanisms for causality-guided decision making.

Result: In object-rich benchmarks, STICA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art agents in both sample efficiency and final performance.

Conclusion: Object-centric, causality-aware transformer-based world models and policies enable more efficient and effective decision-making in complex environments, highlighting the value of decomposing scenes into objects and modeling token-level causality.

Abstract: World models have been developed to support sample-efficient deep reinforcement learning agents. However, it remains challenging for world models to accurately replicate environments that are high-dimensional, non-stationary, and composed of multiple objects with rich interactions since most world models learn holistic representations of all environmental components. By contrast, humans perceive the environment by decomposing it into discrete objects, facilitating efficient decision-making. Motivated by this insight, we propose \emph{Slot Transformer Imagination with CAusality-aware reinforcement learning} (STICA), a unified framework in which object-centric Transformers serve as the world model and causality-aware policy and value networks. STICA represents each observation as a set of object-centric tokens, together with tokens for the agent action and the resulting reward, enabling the world model to predict token-level dynamics and interactions. The policy and value networks then estimate token-level cause--effect relations and use them in the attention layers, yielding causality-guided decision-making. Experiments on object-rich benchmarks demonstrate that STICA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art agents in both sample efficiency and final performance.

*Pietro Sittoni,Francesco Tudisco*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A Transformer-based solver for ill-conditioned linear systems with end-to-end learning and scalable memory.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ill-conditioned linear systems are difficult to solve accurately and stably with traditional solvers, which often require careful parameter tuning, preconditioning, or domain-specific expertise. The work seeks a general-purpose neural approach to reduce engineering effort while maintaining accuracy and efficiency.

Conclusion: End-to-end neural solvers for ill-conditioned linear systems are viable and can integrate into scientific computing workflows, offering efficiency gains and reduced need for problem-specific tuning; future work may extend to broader problem classes and more challenging numerics.

Abstract: Recent work in deep learning has opened new possibilities for solving classical algorithmic tasks using end-to-end learned models. In this work, we investigate the fundamental task of solving linear systems, particularly those that are ill-conditioned. Existing numerical methods for ill-conditioned systems often require careful parameter tuning, preconditioning, or domain-specific expertise to ensure accuracy and stability. In this work, we propose Algebraformer, a Transformer-based architecture that learns to solve linear systems end-to-end, even in the presence of severe ill-conditioning. Our model leverages a novel encoding scheme that enables efficient representation of matrix and vector inputs, with a memory complexity of $O(n^2)$, supporting scalable inference. We demonstrate its effectiveness on application-driven linear problems, including interpolation tasks from spectral methods for boundary value problems and acceleration of the Newton method. Algebraformer achieves competitive accuracy with significantly lower computational overhead at test time, demonstrating that general-purpose neural architectures can effectively reduce complexity in traditional scientific computing pipelines.

### [220] [Unified Multimodal Vessel Trajectory Prediction with Explainable Navigation Intention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14265)
*Rui Zhang,Chao Li,Kezhong Liu,Chen Wang,Bolong Zheng,Hongbo Jiang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A unified, explainable MTP framework for vessels that separates sustained and transient navigation intents; sustained intents are built from history as intention trees, transient intents are modeled with a CVAE, and global consistency is maintained via non-local attention, achieving broad applicability and improved ADE/FDE with interpretable predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current vessel MTP methods suffer from limited scenario coverage and poor explainability. There is a need for models that (i) handle rapid behavioral changes across diverse maritime contexts and (ii) provide transparent navigational intents behind predictions.

Method: Construct sustained intention trees from historical AIS trajectories to capture long-horizon, stable plans. Use a Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) to model transient, rapid changes in intent. Employ a non-local attention mechanism to maintain global scene consistency across the prediction horizon. Classify intents into sustained vs transient to guide trajectory prediction.

Result: The approach demonstrates broad applicability across diverse AIS-based scenarios and yields significant improvements in ADE and FDE metrics compared to baselines. It also enhances explainability by explicitly revealing the navigational intentions underlying each predicted trajectory.

Conclusion: The unified, explainable MTP framework effectively handles both stable and rapid navigational changes, offering generalizable performance gains and interpretable predictions suitable for intelligent maritime systems.

Abstract: Vessel trajectory prediction is fundamental to intelligent maritime systems. Within this domain, short-term prediction of rapid behavioral changes in complex maritime environments has established multimodal trajectory prediction (MTP) as a promising research area. However, existing vessel MTP methods suffer from limited scenario applicability and insufficient explainability. To address these challenges, we propose a unified MTP framework incorporating explainable navigation intentions, which we classify into sustained and transient categories. Our method constructs sustained intention trees from historical trajectories and models dynamic transient intentions using a Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE), while using a non-local attention mechanism to maintain global scenario consistency. Experiments on real Automatic Identification System (AIS) datasets demonstrates our method's broad applicability across diverse scenarios, achieving significant improvements in both ADE and FDE. Furthermore, our method improves explainability by explicitly revealing the navigational intentions underlying each predicted trajectory.

### [221] [Comparing Task-Agnostic Embedding Models for Tabular Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14276)
*Frederik Hoppe,Lars Kleinemeier,Astrid Franz,Udo Göbel*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Task-agnostic embeddings from tabular foundation models (TabPFN, TabICL) do not consistently outperform simple feature engineering; TableVectorizer features match or exceed performance on ADBench and TabArena Lite while being ~1000x faster.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate whether transferable, task-agnostic representations from tabular foundation models offer practical benefits over classical features, given the heavy compute of end-to-end models.

Method: Systematic evaluation comparing task-agnostic representations from TabPFN and TabICL with TableVectorizer across tasks: outlier detection (ADBench) and supervised learning (TabArena Lite); measurements include predictive performance and computational efficiency.

Result: TableVectorizer features achieve comparable or superior predictive performance compared to TabPFN/TabICL representations, with up to 1000x faster inference/training times.

Conclusion: For representation learning in tabular data, simple, engineered features can rival or beat learned representations in both accuracy and efficiency; tabular foundation models may be less attractive when focusing on embeddings alone.

Abstract: Recent foundation models for tabular data achieve strong task-specific performance via in-context learning. Nevertheless, they focus on direct prediction by encapsulating both representation learning and task-specific inference inside a single, resource-intensive network. This work specifically focuses on representation learning, i.e., on transferable, task-agnostic embeddings. We systematically evaluate task-agnostic representations from tabular foundation models (TabPFN and TabICL) alongside with classical feature engineering (TableVectorizer) across a variety of application tasks as outlier detection (ADBench) and supervised learning (TabArena Lite). We find that simple TableVectorizer features achieve comparable or superior performance while being up to three orders of magnitude faster than tabular foundation models.

### [222] [Weight Variance Amplifier Improves Accuracy in High-Sparsity One-Shot Pruning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14282)
*Vincent-Daniel Yun,Junhyuk Jo,Sunwoo Lee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A variance-amplifying regularizer (VAR) trains networks to be pruning-robust by deliberately increasing weight variance, yielding better one-shot pruning performance with theoretical convergence insights and strong empirical gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extreme pruning often causes large accuracy drops; existing pruning-robust optimizers (e.g., SAM, CrAM) incur extra computation. Observing that higher-variance parameters tend to be more pruning-robust, VAR aims to induce such variance during training to improve post-pruning accuracy.

Method: Introduce VAR as a regularizer that increases parameter variance during training, integrated into the standard objective. Provide theoretical convergence analysis and validate with extensive experiments on one-shot pruning, comparing against baselines like SAM/CrAM.

Result: VAR achieves superior pruning robustness, reducing the accuracy drop after aggressive one-shot pruning compared to baselines, supported by convergence theory and extensive empirical results.

Conclusion: VAR offers a simple, effective approach to robust pruning by shaping the weight variance distribution, backed by theory and experiments, and may reduce the need for heavier pruning-robust optimizers.

Abstract: Deep neural networks achieve outstanding performance in visual recognition tasks, yet their large number of parameters makes them less practical for real-world applications. Recently, one-shot pruning has emerged as an effective strategy for reducing model size without additional training. However, models trained with standard objective functions often suffer a significant drop in accuracy after aggressive pruning. Some existing pruning-robust optimizers, such as SAM, and CrAM, mitigate this accuracy drop by guiding the model toward flatter regions of the parameter space, but they inevitably incur non-negligible additional computations. We propose a Variance Amplifying Regularizer (VAR) that deliberately increases the variance of model parameters during training. Our study reveals an intriguing finding that parameters with higher variance exhibit greater pruning robustness. VAR exploits this property by promoting such variance in the weight distribution, thereby mitigating the adverse effects of pruning. We further provide a theoretical analysis of its convergence behavior, supported by extensive empirical results demonstrating the superior pruning robustness of VAR.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Hierarchical Latent Diffusion Model (H-LDM) generates controllable PCG signals from metadata using a multi-scale VAE to disentangle rhythm, heart sounds, and murmurs; achieves state-of-the-art metrics and improves rare disease classification, enabling interpretable data augmentation for cardiology.


<details>

Motivation: Address the scarcity of labeled pathological PCG data and the need for clinically grounded generative models that leverage rich metadata for fine-grained control.

Method: 1) A multi-scale VAE learns a physiologically-disentangled latent space separating rhythm, heart sounds, and murmurs. 2) A hierarchical text-to-biosignal pipeline uses rich clinical metadata to control 17 distinct conditions. 3) A diffusion process guided by a novel Medical Attention module provides interpretable generation.

Result: Fréchet Audio Distance = 9.7; attribute disentanglement score = 92%; clinical validity confirmed by cardiologists = 87.1%; data augmentation with synthetic PCG improves rare disease classification accuracy by 11.3%.

Conclusion: H-LDM advances data augmentation in cardiac diagnostics by offering interpretable, metadata-driven PCG synthesis with strong quantitative/clinical validation and promising improvements for rare disease detection.

Abstract: Phonocardiogram (PCG) analysis is vital for cardiovascular disease diagnosis, yet the scarcity of labeled pathological data hinders the capability of AI systems. To bridge this, we introduce H-LDM, a Hierarchical Latent Diffusion Model for generating clinically accurate and controllable PCG signals from structured metadata. Our approach features: (1) a multi-scale VAE that learns a physiologically-disentangled latent space, separating rhythm, heart sounds, and murmurs; (2) a hierarchical text-to-biosignal pipeline that leverages rich clinical metadata for fine-grained control over 17 distinct conditions; and (3) an interpretable diffusion process guided by a novel Medical Attention module. Experiments on the PhysioNet CirCor dataset demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, achieving a Fréchet Audio Distance of 9.7, a 92% attribute disentanglement score, and 87.1% clinical validity confirmed by cardiologists. Augmenting diagnostic models with our synthetic data improves the accuracy of rare disease classification by 11.3\%. H-LDM establishes a new direction for data augmentation in cardiac diagnostics, bridging data scarcity with interpretable clinical insights.

### [224] [Intervention Efficiency and Perturbation Validation Framework: Capacity-Aware and Robust Clinical Model Selection under the Rashomon Effect](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14317)
*Yuwen Zhang,Viet Tran,Paul Weng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Two new tools for robust model assessment under the Rashomon effect in clinical ML: Intervention Efficiency (IE) and the Perturbation Validation Framework (PVF). They link predictive performance to clinical utility and stability under data perturbations, aiding selection of models that generalize under resource constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clinical machine learning often yields multiple models with similar performance (the Rashomon effect), especially with small, imbalanced, and noisy datasets and high-dimensional features. Conventional validation and metrics (e.g., F1) may fail to capture clinical utility or resource constraints, making model selection unreliable.

Method: Introduce Intervention Efficiency (IE), a capacity-aware metric that measures how efficiently a model identifies actionable true positives when only limited interventions are feasible, thereby tying predictive performance to clinical utility. Introduce Perturbation Validation Framework (PVF), a structured approach to evaluate model stability under data perturbations and distribution shifts to find models with invariant performance.

Result: Empirical results on synthetic and real-world healthcare datasets show that using IE and PVF facilitates selecting models that generalize more robustly and align with capacity constraints, offering a new direction for addressing the Rashomon Effect in clinical settings.

Conclusion: IE and PVF provide complementary tools for robust model assessment and selection in clinical ML, enabling better generalization under resource constraints and improving reliability of deployment in the presence of model multiplicity.

Abstract: In clinical machine learning, the coexistence of multiple models with comparable performance -- a manifestation of the Rashomon Effect -- poses fundamental challenges for trustworthy deployment and evaluation. Small, imbalanced, and noisy datasets, coupled with high-dimensional and weakly identified clinical features, amplify this multiplicity and make conventional validation schemes unreliable. As a result, selecting among equally performing models becomes uncertain, particularly when resource constraints and operational priorities are not considered by conventional metrics like F1 score. To address these issues, we propose two complementary tools for robust model assessment and selection: Intervention Efficiency (IE) and the Perturbation Validation Framework (PVF). IE is a capacity-aware metric that quantifies how efficiently a model identifies actionable true positives when only limited interventions are feasible, thereby linking predictive performance with clinical utility. PVF introduces a structured approach to assess the stability of models under data perturbations, identifying models whose performance remains most invariant across noisy or shifted validation sets. Empirical results on synthetic and real-world healthcare datasets show that using these tools facilitates the selection of models that generalize more robustly and align with capacity constraints, offering a new direction for tackling the Rashomon Effect in clinical settings.

### [225] [Learning with Statistical Equality Constraints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14320)
*Aneesh Barthakur,Luiz F. O. Chamon*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper develops a generalization theory for equality-constrained learning and proposes a practical algorithm that reduces constrained problems to a sequence of unconstrained empirical problems, enabling new formulations in fairness, interpolation, and boundary-value problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Beyond accuracy, ML needs to satisfy exact equality constraints (e.g., fairness, boundary conditions); existing penalty-based methods require tuning of weights and generalization guarantees do not apply to equalities, hindering reliable constrained learning.

Method: Derives a generalization theory for equality-constrained statistical learning and introduces a practical algorithm that solves a sequence of unconstrained empirical learning problems to approximate the constrained solution.

Result: The theory shows constrained solutions can be approximated from finite samples with rich parametrizations; empirical demonstrations show effectiveness and enable new equality-constrained formulations in fair learning, interpolating classifiers, and boundary value problems.

Conclusion: Equality constraints can be effectively integrated into ML via the proposed theory and algorithm, overcoming tuning challenges and broadening application domains.

Abstract: As machine learning applications grow increasingly ubiquitous and complex, they face an increasing set of requirements beyond accuracy. The prevalent approach to handle this challenge is to aggregate a weighted combination of requirement violation penalties into the training objective. To be effective, this approach requires careful tuning of these hyperparameters (weights), involving trial-and-error and cross-validation, which becomes ineffective even for a moderate number of requirements. These issues are exacerbated when the requirements involve parities or equalities, as is the case in fairness and boundary value problems. An alternative technique uses constrained optimization to formulate these learning problems. Yet, existing approximation and generalization guarantees do not apply to problems involving equality constraints. In this work, we derive a generalization theory for equality-constrained statistical learning problems, showing that their solutions can be approximated using samples and rich parametrizations. Using these results, we propose a practical algorithm based on solving a sequence of unconstrained, empirical learning problems. We showcase its effectiveness and the new formulations enabled by equality constraints in fair learning, interpolating classifiers, and boundary value problems.

*Nanxi Chen,Sifan Wang,Rujin Ma,Airong Chen,Chuanjie Cui*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: An irreversibility-regularized PINN framework that enforces the Second Law as a soft constraint, improving accuracy across diverse PDE benchmarks with minimal changes to existing PINNs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PINNs often ignore hidden irreversibility implied by the Second Law, risking unphysical solutions or training failures; there is a need to enforce irreversible physics during training.

Method: Introduce a simple, generalized irreversibility regularization term added to the PINN loss as a soft constraint, enforcing the one-way nature of irreversible processes; compatible with standard PINN architectures and applicable to a range of PDE problems.

Result: Across benchmarks including traveling wave propagation, steady combustion, ice melting, corrosion evolution, and crack propagation, the method reduces predictive error by more than an order of magnitude and requires only minimal modification to PINN frameworks.

Conclusion: The irreversibility-regularized PINN framework is broadly applicable to PDE-governed systems and is likely to have a significant impact in the scientific machine learning community.

Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) represent a new paradigm for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) by integrating physical laws into the learning process of neural networks. However, despite their foundational role, the hidden irreversibility implied by the Second Law of Thermodynamics is often neglected during training, leading to unphysical solutions or even training failures in conventional PINNs. In this paper, we identify this critical gap and introduce a simple, generalized, yet robust irreversibility-regularized strategy that enforces hidden physical laws as soft constraints during training. This approach ensures that the learned solutions consistently respect the intrinsic one-way nature of irreversible physical processes. Across a wide range of benchmarks spanning traveling wave propagation, steady combustion, ice melting, corrosion evolution, and crack propagation, we demonstrate that our regularization scheme reduces predictive errors by more than an order of magnitude, while requiring only minimal modification to existing PINN frameworks. We believe that the proposed framework is broadly applicable to a wide class of PDE-governed physical systems and will have significant impact within the scientific machine learning community.

*Bastien Vuillod,Pierre-Alain Moellic,Jean-Max Dutertre*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: First analysis of LoRA's impact on backdoor attacks in Federated Learning; lower LoRA rank increases backdoor persistence; highlights evaluation issues and provides code.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understand how a parameter-efficient fine-tuning technique (LoRA) influences security risks in FL backdoors to improve risk assessments for critical FL deployments.

Method: Empirical analysis of backdoor lifespan in FL with LoRA; vary LoRA rank and injection strategy; measure backdoor persistence after attack; analyze evaluation implications.

Result: Backdoor persistence is longer when LoRA rank is lower for optimally injected backdoors; identification of evaluation pitfalls in backdoor studies under FL; code released.

Conclusion: Calls for robust, fair evaluation protocols for FL backdoors and awareness of how LoRA settings shape threat models; enables more reliable risk assessment.

Abstract: Large models adaptation through Federated Learning (FL) addresses a wide range of use cases and is enabled by Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning techniques such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). However, this distributed learning paradigm faces several security threats, particularly to its integrity, such as backdoor attacks that aim to inject malicious behavior during the local training steps of certain clients. We present the first analysis of the influence of LoRA on state-of-the-art backdoor attacks targeting model adaptation in FL. Specifically, we focus on backdoor lifespan, a critical characteristic in FL, that can vary depending on the attack scenario and the attacker's ability to effectively inject the backdoor. A key finding in our experiments is that for an optimally injected backdoor, the backdoor persistence after the attack is longer when the LoRA's rank is lower. Importantly, our work highlights evaluation issues of backdoor attacks against FL and contributes to the development of more robust and fair evaluations of backdoor attacks, enhancing the reliability of risk assessments for critical FL systems. Our code is publicly available.

### [228] [Toward Robust and Harmonious Adaptation for Cross-modal Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14416)
*Haobin Li,Mouxing Yang,Xi Peng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces REST, a robust online adaptation framework for cross-modal retrieval under query shift, combining query refinement, QS-robust learning, and gradient decoupling to preserve general knowledge while adapting to online and diverse queries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional general-to-customized CMR assumes access to full target-domain data; query shift (online and diverse) breaks the common space and causes forgetting of general knowledge. Real-world online, diverse queries require online, harmonious adaptation.

Method: 1) Online shift handling by refining retrieval results to obtain query predictions; 2) QS-robust objective built on these predictions to maintain the established common space during online adaptation; 3) Gradient decoupling module to control gradient flow and prevent forgetting of general knowledge while fitting customized queries; evaluated on 20 benchmarks across 3 CMR tasks.

Result: Empirical results show REST outperforms baselines under QS, validating effectiveness in online and diverse shifts; demonstrates stable preservation of general knowledge and improved query-specific performance.

Conclusion: REST provides a practical, effective approach to online, harmonious adaptation for QS in CMR; encourages further exploration of online, knowledge-preserving adaptation in cross-modal systems.

Abstract: Recently, the general-to-customized paradigm has emerged as the dominant approach for Cross-Modal Retrieval (CMR), which reconciles the distribution shift problem between the source domain and the target domain. However, existing general-to-customized CMR methods typically assume that the entire target-domain data is available, which is easily violated in real-world scenarios and thus inevitably suffer from the query shift (QS) problem. Specifically, query shift embraces the following two characteristics and thus poses new challenges to CMR. i) Online Shift: real-world queries always arrive in an online manner, rendering it impractical to access the entire query set beforehand for customization approaches; ii) Diverse Shift: even with domain customization, the CMR models struggle to satisfy queries from diverse users or scenarios, leaving an urgent need to accommodate diverse queries. In this paper, we observe that QS would not only undermine the well-structured common space inherited from the source model, but also steer the model toward forgetting the indispensable general knowledge for CMR. Inspired by the observations, we propose a novel method for achieving online and harmonious adaptation against QS, dubbed Robust adaptation with quEry ShifT (REST). To deal with online shift, REST first refines the retrieval results to formulate the query predictions and accordingly designs a QS-robust objective function on these predictions to preserve the well-established common space in an online manner. As for tackling the more challenging diverse shift, REST employs a gradient decoupling module to dexterously manipulate the gradients during the adaptation process, thus preventing the CMR model from forgetting the general knowledge. Extensive experiments on 20 benchmarks across three CMR tasks verify the effectiveness of our method against QS.

*Xiaowei Xu,Justin Sonneck,Hongxiao Wang,Roman Burkard,Hendrik Wohrle,Anton Grabmasier,Matthias Gunzer,Jianxu Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FlowRoI is an optical-flow-based RoI extraction framework for high-throughput immune cell migration imaging, enabling RoI-aware JPEG2000 compression that increases compression efficiency while preserving critical cellular regions, achieving ~30 fps on a laptop.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-throughput imaging platforms like ComplexEye generate data at volumes that strain storage/transmission; need efficient, region-focused compression to retain migratory cell information.

Method: Compute optical flow between consecutive frames to derive RoI masks covering most migrating cells; jointly encode the raw image and RoI mask using JPEG2000 for RoI-aware compression; runtime ~30 fps on i7-1255U; aims for efficiency.

Result: FlowRoI yields higher PSNR in cellular regions and achieves 2.0-2.2x higher compression rates at matched PSNR compared to standard JPEG2000; throughput ~30 fps.

Conclusion: FlowRoI enables practical, high-throughput, RoI-guided image compression for immune cell migration studies, reducing storage/transmission burdens and aiding clinical translation.

Abstract: Autonomous migration is essential for the function of immune cells such as neutrophils and plays a pivotal role in diverse diseases. Recently, we introduced ComplexEye, a multi-lens array microscope comprising 16 independent aberration-corrected glass lenses arranged at the pitch of a 96-well plate, capable of capturing high-resolution movies of migrating cells. This architecture enables high-throughput live-cell video microscopy for migration analysis, supporting routine quantification of autonomous motility with strong potential for clinical translation. However, ComplexEye and similar high-throughput imaging platforms generate data at an exponential rate, imposing substantial burdens on storage and transmission. To address this challenge, we present FlowRoI, a fast optical-flow-based region of interest (RoI) extraction framework designed for high-throughput image compression in immune cell migration studies. FlowRoI estimates optical flow between consecutive frames and derives RoI masks that reliably cover nearly all migrating cells. The raw image and its corresponding RoI mask are then jointly encoded using JPEG2000 to enable RoI-aware compression. FlowRoI operates with high computational efficiency, achieving runtimes comparable to standard JPEG2000 and reaching an average throughput of about 30 frames per second on a modern laptop equipped with an Intel i7-1255U CPU. In terms of image quality, FlowRoI yields higher peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) in cellular regions and achieves 2.0-2.2x higher compression rates at matched PSNR compared to standard JPEG2000.

*Andrey Okhotin,Maksim Nakhodnov,Nikita Kazeev,Andrey E Ustyuzhanin,Dmitry Vetrov*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A diffusion-based MiAD model with mirage infusion enables changing atom counts during crystal generation, boosting quality (up to 2.5x) and achieving 8.2% S.U.N. rate on MP-20, surpassing prior methods; code released.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diffusion models for crystal generation fix the number of atoms, limiting sampling variability and potentially missing optimal structures; enabling atom addition/removal can improve S.U.N. properties.

Method: Introduce mirage infusion to toggle atom existence (existent ↔ mirage) and develop Mirage Atom Diffusion (MiAD), an equivariant joint diffusion model that can change atom counts during generation; evaluation on MP-20.

Result: Quality improves up to 2.5x vs baselines without mirage infusion; MiAD attains 8.2% S.U.N. rate on MP-20, surpassing state of the art.

Conclusion: Mirage infusion is a simple, effective mechanism to enable dynamic atom-count diffusion for de novo crystal generation; MiAD establishes a new benchmark and provides a public codebase.

Abstract: In recent years, diffusion-based models have demonstrated exceptional performance in searching for simultaneously stable, unique, and novel (S.U.N.) crystalline materials. However, most of these models don't have the ability to change the number of atoms in the crystal during the generation process, which limits the variability of model sampling trajectories. In this paper, we demonstrate the severity of this restriction and introduce a simple yet powerful technique, mirage infusion, which enables diffusion models to change the state of the atoms that make up the crystal from existent to non-existent (mirage) and vice versa. We show that this technique improves model quality by up to $\times2.5$ compared to the same model without this modification. The resulting model, Mirage Atom Diffusion (MiAD), is an equivariant joint diffusion model for de novo crystal generation that is capable of altering the number of atoms during the generation process. MiAD achieves an $8.2\%$ S.U.N. rate on the MP-20 dataset, which substantially exceeds existing state-of-the-art approaches.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A hybrid modeling approach uses hemodynamic simulations and unlabeled data to estimate noninvasively stroke volume and cardiac output from PPG by combining a CVAE trained on PPG-APW pairs with a conditional density estimator trained on simulated APW, achieving detection of biomarker fluctuations and outperforming a supervised baseline in tracking temporal changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Non-invasively estimating key cardiac biomarkers (stroke volume and cardiac output) from PPG is challenging due to reliance on invasive APW measurements and scarcity of annotated PPG data; leveraging simulations and unlabeled clinical data could bridge the gap.

Method: Train a conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE) on paired PPG-APW data to learn a latent representation linking PPG to APW, and train a conditional density estimator of cardiac biomarkers on labeled simulated APW segments; combine these components into a hybrid model that predicts biomarkers from PPG.

Result: Experiments show the hybrid approach can detect fluctuations in cardiac output and stroke volume and outperforms a supervised baseline for monitoring temporal changes in these biomarkers.

Conclusion: Integrating hemodynamic simulations with unlabeled data via a CVAE and a conditional density estimator provides an effective noninvasive pathway to monitor dynamic cardiovascular biomarkers from PPG, with improved tracking of temporal biomarker changes over supervised methods.

Abstract: Continuous cardiovascular monitoring can play a key role in precision health. However, some fundamental cardiac biomarkers of interest, including stroke volume and cardiac output, require invasive measurements, e.g., arterial pressure waveforms (APW). As a non-invasive alternative, photoplethysmography (PPG) measurements are routinely collected in hospital settings. Unfortunately, the prediction of key cardiac biomarkers from PPG instead of APW remains an open challenge, further complicated by the scarcity of annotated PPG measurements. As a solution, we propose a hybrid approach that uses hemodynamic simulations and unlabeled clinical data to estimate cardiovascular biomarkers directly from PPG signals. Our hybrid model combines a conditional variational autoencoder trained on paired PPG-APW data with a conditional density estimator of cardiac biomarkers trained on labeled simulated APW segments. As a key result, our experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach can detect fluctuations of cardiac output and stroke volume and outperform a supervised baseline in monitoring temporal changes in these biomarkers.

TL;DR: Conditional push-forward neural networks (CPFN) learn a stochastic map φ(x,u) so that φ(x,U) mimics Y|X=x, enabling efficient conditional sampling and Monte Carlo estimation without invertibility or adversarial training; trained with a KL-based objective, achieving near-asymptotic consistency and competitive performance while remaining lightweight.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need for efficient conditional distribution estimation and sampling that avoids heavy training, invertibility constraints, or adversarial training; seeks a simple, scalable framework compatible with standard estimators.

Method: Introduce φ(x,u) with a predefined latent U; train via a KL-based objective to align φ(x,U) with the conditional distribution Y|X=x; does not require invertibility or adversarial training; supports straightforward Monte Carlo estimation of conditional statistics.

Result: Establish near-asymptotic consistency; empirically CPFN matches or surpasses kernel estimators, tree-based methods, and popular deep learning techniques; remains lightweight and easy to train.

Conclusion: CPFN provides an efficient, scalable generative framework for conditional distribution estimation that enables easy conditional sampling and statistics estimation, with competitive performance and simple training.

Abstract: We introduce conditional push-forward neural networks (CPFN), a generative framework for conditional distribution estimation. Instead of directly modeling the conditional density $f_{Y|X}$, CPFN learns a stochastic map $\varphi=\varphi(x,u)$ such that $\varphi(x,U)$ and $Y|X=x$ follow approximately the same law, with $U$ a suitable random vector of pre-defined latent variables. This enables efficient conditional sampling and straightforward estimation of conditional statistics through Monte Carlo methods. The model is trained via an objective function derived from a Kullback-Leibler formulation, without requiring invertibility or adversarial training. We establish a near-asymptotic consistency result and demonstrate experimentally that CPFN can achieve performance competitive with, or even superior to, state-of-the-art methods, including kernel estimators, tree-based algorithms, and popular deep learning techniques, all while remaining lightweight and easy to train.

### [233] [nnterp: A Standardized Interface for Mechanistic Interpretability of Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14465)
*Clément Dumas*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: nnterp provides a unified, accurate, and test-validated wrapper around NNsight for transformer mechanistic interpretability across 50+ models, bridging the standardization gap without sacrificing HuggingFace fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mechanistic interpretability tools face a tradeoff: custom interfaces (e.g., TransformerLens) ensure consistency but require architecture-specific adaptations with possible numerical drift, while direct HuggingFace access via NNsight preserves exact behavior but lacks cross-model standardization. nnterp aims to bridge this gap.

Method: nnterp is a lightweight wrapper around NNsight that normalizes interfaces via automatic module renaming, includes comprehensive validation tests, and provides a unified API for transformer analysis. It ships built-in interpretability methods (logit lens, patchscope, activation steering) and grants direct access to attention probabilities for supported models. Validation tests are packaged with the library to verify compatibility with custom models locally.

Result: Researchers can write intervention code once and deploy it across 50+ model variants spanning 16 architecture families. The library enables consistent experimentation while preserving original HuggingFace implementations, and it standardizes tooling with onboard validation.

Conclusion:  nnterp bridges the gap between correctness and usability in mechanistic interpretability tooling, enabling scalable, cross-architecture transformer analysis without compromising fidelity.

Abstract: Mechanistic interpretability research requires reliable tools for analyzing transformer internals across diverse architectures. Current approaches face a fundamental tradeoff: custom implementations like TransformerLens ensure consistent interfaces but require coding a manual adaptation for each architecture, introducing numerical mismatch with the original models, while direct HuggingFace access through NNsight preserves exact behavior but lacks standardization across models. To bridge this gap, we develop nnterp, a lightweight wrapper around NNsight that provides a unified interface for transformer analysis while preserving original HuggingFace implementations. Through automatic module renaming and comprehensive validation testing, nnterp enables researchers to write intervention code once and deploy it across 50+ model variants spanning 16 architecture families. The library includes built-in implementations of common interpretability methods (logit lens, patchscope, activation steering) and provides direct access to attention probabilities for models that support it. By packaging validation tests with the library, researchers can verify compatibility with custom models locally. nnterp bridges the gap between correctness and usability in mechanistic interpretability tooling.

### [235] [Towards Stable and Structured Time Series Generation with Perturbation-Aware Flow Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14488)
*Jintao Zhang,Mingyue Cheng,Zirui Liu,Xianquan Wang,Yitong Zhou,Qi Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PAFM is a perturbation-aware flow matching framework for time-series generation that handles localized perturbations via perturbation-guided training, a dual-path velocity field, and a mixture-of-experts decoder, outperforming baselines on unconditional and conditional tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Flow-based time-series generation struggles with abrupt, localized perturbations because globally shared velocity fields can't capture local transitions, leading to structurally inconsistent sequences.

Method: PAFM introduces perturbation-guided training to simulate local disturbances, a dual-path velocity field to model trajectory deviations under perturbation, and a mixture-of-experts decoder with flow routing to adapt modeling capacity to different dynamics.

Result: Empirical results on both unconditional and conditional generation tasks show PAFM consistently outperforms strong baselines; code available.

Conclusion: Perturbation-aware flow matching with dynamic, mixture-based capacity improves structural coherence and expressiveness in perturbed time-series generation.

Abstract: Time series generation is critical for a wide range of applications, which greatly supports downstream analytical and decision-making tasks. However, the inherent temporal heterogeneous induced by localized perturbations present significant challenges for generating structurally consistent time series. While flow matching provides a promising paradigm by modeling temporal dynamics through trajectory-level supervision, it fails to adequately capture abrupt transitions in perturbed time series, as the use of globally shared parameters constrains the velocity field to a unified representation. To address these limitations, we introduce \textbf{PAFM}, a \textbf{P}erturbation-\textbf{A}ware \textbf{F}low \textbf{M}atching framework that models perturbed trajectories to ensure stable and structurally consistent time series generation. The framework incorporates perturbation-guided training to simulate localized disturbances and leverages a dual-path velocity field to capture trajectory deviations under perturbation, enabling refined modeling of perturbed behavior to enhance the structural coherence. In order to further improve sensitivity to trajectory perturbations while enhancing expressiveness, a mixture-of-experts decoder with flow routing dynamically allocates modeling capacity in response to different trajectory dynamics. Extensive experiments on both unconditional and conditional generation tasks demonstrate that PAFM consistently outperforms strong baselines.

### [236] [CLO: Efficient LLM Inference System with CPU-Light KVCache Offloading via Algorithm-System Co-Design](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14510)
*Jiawei Yi,Ping Gong,Youhui Bai,Jiaqi Ruan,Shengnan Wang,Pengcheng Wang,Haibo Wang,Weiguang Wang,Xia Zhu,Feng Wu,Cheng Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CLO is a CPU-light KVCache offloading system for LLM inference that achieves high throughput with minimal CPU overhead by using coarse-grained on-GPU caching, data prefetching, zero-copy PCIe transfers, and GPU-centric synchronization, maintaining accuracy while delivering 9.3–66.6% throughput gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Million-token LLMs expose scalability bottlenecks in KVCache memory and data transfer. Prior CPU-offloading with top-k attention reduces transfer but leaves three CPU bottlenecks unaddressed: (1) fine-grained dynamic cache management overhead on the CPU, (2) poor PCIe bandwidth utilization from CPU-side gathering, and (3) GPU runtime stalls due to coarse CPU-centric synchronization. An algorithm-system co-design is needed to tackle these bottlenecks.

Method: CLO introduces (1) a coarse-grained head-wise approximate on-GPU caching strategy with negligible cache-management cost, (2) a combination of data prefetching and on-GPU persistent caching to lower transfer overhead, (3) a zero-copy transfer engine to maximize PCIe bandwidth, and (4) a GPU-centric synchronization approach to eliminate GPU stalls. This embodies algorithm-system co-design for memory-constrained LLM inference.

Result: Evaluation on two widely-used LLMs shows CLO attains comparable accuracy to state-of-the-art systems, substantially reduces CPU overhead, fully utilizes PCIe bandwidth, and improves decoding throughput by 9.3%–66.6%. The work is open-sourced at the linked repository.

Conclusion: Algorithm-system co-design is essential for memory-constrained LLM inference on modern GPU platforms. CLO demonstrates that coordinating algorithms and system design yields substantial performance gains with maintained accuracy, and its release enables replication and further development.

Abstract: The growth of million-token LLMs exposes the scalability limits of inference systems, where the KVCache dominates memory usage and data transfer overhead. Recent offloading systems migrate the KVCache to CPU memory and incorporate top-k attention to reduce the volume of data transferred from the CPU, while further applying system-level optimizations such as on-GPU caching and prefetching to lower transfer overhead. However, they overlook the CPU bottleneck in three aspects: (1) substantial overhead of fine-grained dynamic cache management performed on the CPU side, (2) significant transfer overhead from poor PCIe bandwidth utilization caused by heavy gathering operations at the CPU side, and (3) GPU runtime bubbles introduced by coarse-grained CPU-centric synchronization. To address these challenges, we propose CLO, a CPU-light KVCache offloading system via algorithm-system co-design. CLO features: (1) a coarse-grained head-wise approximate on-GPU caching strategy with negligible cache management cost, (2) seamless combination of data prefetching and on-GPU persistent caching for lower transfer overhead, (3) a zero-copy transfer engine to fully exploit PCIe bandwidth, and a GPU-centric synchronization method to eliminate GPU stalls. Evaluation on two widely-used LLMs demonstrates that CLO achieves comparable accuracy to state-of-the-art systems, while substantially minimizing CPU overhead, fully utilizing PCIe bandwidth, thus improving decoding throughput by 9.3%-66.6%. Our results highlight that algorithm-system co-design is essential for memory-constrained LLM inference on modern GPU platforms. We open source CLO at https://github.com/CommediaJW/CLO.

### [237] [Full Atom Peptide Design via Riemannian Euclidean Bayesian Flow Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14516)
*Hao Qian,Shikui Tu,Lei Xu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PepBFN: a Bayesian flow network for full-atom peptide design that models continuous parameter distributions for residues, multimodal side-chain rotamers via Gaussian mixtures, and orientations on SO(3) via Matrix Fisher flow, enabling smooth Bayesian updates and improved design.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diffusion/flow-based peptide design uses categorical one-hot residue representations and unimodal torsion distributions, causing mismatched updates and limited accuracy.

Method: Introduce PepBFN with continuous distributions for discrete residues; Gaussian mixture Bayesian flow for side chains; Matrix Fisher Riemannian flow for SO(3) orientations; progressive Bayesian updates refine all parameters.

Result: Experiments on side chain packing, reverse folding, and binder design show strong potential and improved coherence of peptide generation under the continuous Bayesian framework.

Conclusion: PepBFN is the first Bayesian flow network for full-atom peptide design in continuous space, enabling joint, smooth updates across residues, conformations, and orientations, and addressing discretization and multimodality limitations.

Abstract: Diffusion and flow matching models have recently emerged as promising approaches for peptide binder design. Despite their progress, these models still face two major challenges. First, categorical sampling of discrete residue types collapses their continuous parameters into onehot assignments, while continuous variables (e.g., atom positions) evolve smoothly throughout the generation process. This mismatch disrupts the update dynamics and results in suboptimal performance. Second, current models assume unimodal distributions for side-chain torsion angles, which conflicts with the inherently multimodal nature of side chain rotameric states and limits prediction accuracy. To address these limitations, we introduce PepBFN, the first Bayesian flow network for full atom peptide design that directly models parameter distributions in fully continuous space. Specifically, PepBFN models discrete residue types by learning their continuous parameter distributions, enabling joint and smooth Bayesian updates with other continuous structural parameters. It further employs a novel Gaussian mixture based Bayesian flow to capture the multimodal side chain rotameric states and a Matrix Fisher based Riemannian flow to directly model residue orientations on the $\mathrm{SO}(3)$ manifold. Together, these parameter distributions are progressively refined via Bayesian updates, yielding smooth and coherent peptide generation. Experiments on side chain packing, reverse folding, and binder design tasks demonstrate the strong potential of PepBFN in computational peptide design.

### [238] [MissHDD: Hybrid Deterministic Diffusion for Hetrogeneous Incomplete Data Imputation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14543)
*Youran Zhou,Mohamed Reda Bouadjenek,Sunil Aryal*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A hybrid diffusion model for mixed-type tabular imputation using two complementary channels—continuous DDIM-based diffusion for numerical features and a discrete latent-path diffusion for categorical features—to achieve stable, accurate imputations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Incomplete tabular data with heterogeneous numerical, categorical, and discrete attributes suffer from diffusion-based methods assuming a homogeneous feature space, leading to conditional inconsistency and instability (e.g., information collapse for categoricals and unstable numerical updates). A single diffusion process is insufficient for mixed-type data.

Method: Introduce a two-channel framework: a continuous DDIM-based channel for numerical variables (deterministic denoising) and a discrete latent-path diffusion channel for categorical/discrete features (staying within valid sample manifolds). Train both channels under a unified conditional imputation objective to coherently reconstruct mixed-type incomplete data.

Result: Experiments on real-world datasets show higher imputation accuracy, more stable sampling trajectories, and improved robustness under MCAR, MAR, and MNAR settings compared with existing diffusion-based and classical imputation methods.

Conclusion: Structure-aware, two-channel diffusion processes are valuable for advancing deep learning approaches to incomplete tabular data, effectively handling mixed-type features and improving imputation quality and stability.

Abstract: Incomplete data are common in real-world tabular applications, where numerical, categorical, and discrete attributes coexist within a single dataset. This heterogeneous structure presents significant challenges for existing diffusion-based imputation models, which typically assume a homogeneous feature space and rely on stochastic denoising trajectories. Such assumptions make it difficult to maintain conditional consistency, and they often lead to information collapse for categorical variables or instability when numerical variables require deterministic updates. These limitations indicate that a single diffusion process is insufficient for mixed-type tabular imputation.
  We propose a hybrid deterministic diffusion framework that separates heterogeneous features into two complementary generative channels. A continuous DDIM-based channel provides efficient and stable deterministic denoising for numerical variables, while a discrete latent-path diffusion channel, inspired by loopholing-based discrete diffusion, models categorical and discrete features without leaving their valid sample manifolds. The two channels are trained under a unified conditional imputation objective, enabling coherent reconstruction of mixed-type incomplete data.
  Extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets show that the proposed framework achieves higher imputation accuracy, more stable sampling trajectories, and improved robustness across MCAR, MAR, and MNAR settings compared with existing diffusion-based and classical methods. These results demonstrate the importance of structure-aware diffusion processes for advancing deep learning approaches to incomplete tabular data.

*Jaume Ros,Alessio Arleo,Fernando Paulovich*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces the Warping Index, a metric for 2D DR projections that emphasizes preservation of empty regions to better reflect visual fidelity, addressing limitations of existing Projection Quality Metrics that overlook distortions visible in plots.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing DR quality metrics focus on global/local structure but ignore visual distortions such as empty-space distortion and artifacts that mislead visual analysis; a metric targeting visual fidelity is needed.

Method: Proposes Warping Index (WI) as a metric for 2D projections, grounded on the premise that preserving empty regions between projected points is crucial for faithful visualization; details not provided in the abstract.

Result: The abstract presents the WI concept and its intended purpose rather than empirical results or validations.

Conclusion: WI provides a new dimension to assessing DR projections by assessing distortion of empty spaces, potentially improving the interpretability of 2D projections.

Abstract: Dimensionality Reduction (DR) techniques are commonly used for the visual exploration and analysis of high-dimensional data due to their ability to project datasets of high-dimensional points onto the 2D plane. However, projecting datasets in lower dimensions often entails some distortion, which is not necessarily easy to recognize but can lead users to misleading conclusions. Several Projection Quality Metrics (PQMs) have been developed as tools to quantify the goodness-of-fit of a DR projection; however, they mostly focus on measuring how well the projection captures the global or local structure of the data, without taking into account the visual distortion of the resulting plots, thus often ignoring the presence of outliers or artifacts that can mislead a visual analysis of the projection. In this work, we introduce the Warping Index (WI), a new metric for measuring the quality of DR projections onto the 2D plane, based on the assumption that the correct preservation of empty regions between points is of crucial importance towards a faithful visual representation of the data.

*Adam Hazimeh,Alessandro Favero,Pascal Frossard*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Task addition extends to closed-vocabulary image classifiers, showing weight disentanglement from pre-training generalizes. Vision transformers pre-trained without language supervision can be edited with task arithmetic, with linear probing offering a competitive baseline. This broadens the applicability and efficiency of multi-task model deployment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Open-vocabulary task arithmetic enables editing pre-trained models cost-effectively. Closed-vocabulary models lack language supervision, leaving a gap in applying task arithmetic. Investigating whether weight disentanglement and task addition transfer to such models can expand practical editing capabilities.

Method: Deploy and study task addition in closed-vocabulary image classification models across different pre-training schemes. Analyze whether weight disentanglement emerges and if closed-vocabulary ViTs can be edited with task arithmetic. Compare results to simple linear probing as a baseline.

Result: Weight disentanglement appears as a general consequence of pre-training across closed-vocabulary models. Pre-trained closed-vocabulary Vision Transformers can be edited via task arithmetic, achieving high task addition performance. Simple linear probing is a competitive baseline for this setting.

Conclusion: Task arithmetic can be effectively applied to a broader class of pre-trained models, including closed-vocabulary ones, enabling more efficient multi-task model deployment. Linear probing remains a strong baseline, underscoring the need to compare new editing methods against simple transfer techniques.

Abstract: Task arithmetic has recently emerged as a promising method for editing pre-trained \textit{open-vocabulary} models, offering a cost-effective alternative to standard multi-task fine-tuning. However, despite the abundance of \textit{closed-vocabulary} models that are not pre-trained with language supervision, applying task arithmetic to these models remains unexplored. In this paper, we deploy and study task addition in closed-vocabulary image classification models. We consider different pre-training schemes and find that \textit{weight disentanglement} -- the property enabling task arithmetic -- is a general consequence of pre-training, as it appears in different pre-trained closed-vocabulary models. In fact, we find that pre-trained closed-vocabulary vision transformers can also be edited with task arithmetic, achieving high task addition performance and enabling the efficient deployment of multi-task models. Finally, we demonstrate that simple linear probing is a competitive baseline to task addition. Overall, our findings expand the applicability of task arithmetic to a broader class of pre-trained models and open the way for more efficient use of pre-trained models in diverse settings.

*Ankush Kadu,Ashwanth Krishnan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A three-component architecture—LLM-driven hierarchical planning, history-aware reflection of action patterns, and gradient-based optimization—enables true zero-shot generalization in RL, achieving 67% zero-shot success on the ALFWorld Trial 0 without prior task experience or demonstrations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Agents often struggle to generalize across diverse tasks without task-specific training. Previous work studied memory, prompt optimization, and hierarchical decomposition in isolation; their synergy could unlock robust zero-shot generalization.

Method: Proposes ReflexGrad: (1) LLM-based hierarchical TODO decomposition for strategic planning, (2) history-aware causal reflection to diagnose failure roots and enable within-trial learning, (3) gradient-based optimization for systematic improvement. Operates in zero-shot regime with pure LLM reasoning, no task-specific demos, fine-tuning, or hand-crafted similarity metrics. Evaluated on ALFWorld benchmarks, measuring zero-shot performance on first exposure.

Result: Achieves 67% zero-shot success on Trial 0 without prior task experience or demonstrations. Also identifies stable convergence mechanisms (avoiding zero-action loops) and cross-task transfer gains from 67% to 78%. Demonstrates that synergistic integration yields robust zero-shot generalization approaching few-shot baselines.

Conclusion: Synergistic integration of memory, reflection, and optimization enables robust zero-shot generalization across tasks, reducing the gap to few-shot baselines and suggesting broad applicability for zero-shot RL and decision-making.

Abstract: Enabling agents to learn from experience and generalize across diverse tasks without task-specific training remains a fundamental challenge in reinforcement learning and decision-making. While recent approaches have explored episodic memory (Reflexion), gradient-based prompt optimization (TextGrad),and hierarchical task decomposition independently, their potential for synergistic integration remains unexplored. We introduce ReflexGrad, a novel architecture that tightly couples three complementary mechanisms: (1) LLM-based hierarchical TODO decomposition for strategic planning, (2) history-aware causal reflection that analyzes recent action patterns to identify failure root causes and enable within-trial learning, and (3) gradient-based optimization for systematic improvement. Unlike prior work relying on few-shot demonstrations, our system achieves true zero-shot generalization through pure LLM semantic reasoning,requiring no task-specific examples, fine-tuning, or hardcoded similarity metrics. Evaluated on ALFWorld benchmark tasks, ReflexGrad demonstrates 67% zero-shot success rate on Trial 0 without any prior task experience or demonstrations, establishing effective performance on first exposure. Through empirical analysis, we identify the architectural mechanisms underlying stable convergence (zero action loops) and effective cross-task transfer (67% to 78% improvement).Our work demonstrates that synergistic integration of complementary learning mechanisms enables robust zero-shot generalization that approaches few-shot baselines from prior work.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: POMDP parameter learning is challenging with limited data; leveraging expert knowledge via fuzzy models can guide learning and yield MAP estimates.

Method: Augments the EM framework with fuzzy pseudo-counts derived from an expert-defined fuzzy model, effectively transforming EM into MAP estimation.

Result: Outperforms standard EM under low-data and high-noise conditions in synthetic medical simulations; recovers a clinically coherent POMDP in a Myasthenia Gravis case study; demonstrates data-efficient healthcare modeling potential.

Conclusion: Fuzzy MAP EM enables data-efficient POMDP parameter learning by integrating expert knowledge, improving robustness and interpretability in healthcare applications.

Abstract: Learning the parameters of Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) from limited data is a significant challenge. We introduce the Fuzzy MAP EM algorithm, a novel approach that incorporates expert knowledge into the parameter estimation process by enriching the Expectation Maximization (EM) framework with fuzzy pseudo-counts derived from an expert-defined fuzzy model. This integration naturally reformulates the problem as a Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) estimation, effectively guiding learning in environments with limited data. In synthetic medical simulations, our method consistently outperforms the standard EM algorithm under both low-data and high-noise conditions. Furthermore, a case study on Myasthenia Gravis illustrates the ability of the Fuzzy MAP EM algorithm to recover a clinically coherent POMDP, demonstrating its potential as a practical tool for data-efficient modeling in healthcare.

### [243] [Failure to Mix: Large language models struggle to answer according to desired probability distributions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14630)
*Ivy Yuqian Yang,David Yu Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LLMs fail to sample from simple target distributions, showing near-deterministic outputs governed by argmax rather than probabilistic exploration; training against benchmarks with fixed answers may suppress exploration needed for creative idea generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Scientific idea generation and selection require exploration of likelihoods across a distribution. If LLMs cannot follow probabilistic prompts, they may struggle to perform probabilistic search and creative generation, highlighting a gap between benchmarking goals and the needs of creative AI.

Method: Systematic experiments where LLMs are asked to produce outputs following simple probabilistic distributions (e.g., a binary choice with a specified probability). Multiple modern LLMs were tested with prompts enforcing distributional constraints to observe whether outputs follow the target probabilities.

Result: All tested modern LLMs failed to follow the specified distributions. Outputs were skewed toward the marginally highest-probability option, often producing '0' even when '1' was requested at 49% probability. The behavior resembled a step function, overriding built-in biases.

Conclusion: Current LLMs exhibit limited probabilistic sampling capabilities, potentially due to RL training against benchmarks with objectively correct answers. To enable probabilistic exploration for scientific idea generation, benchmarks and training strategies need to encourage sampling from target distributions rather than deterministic maximization.

Abstract: Scientific idea generation and selection requires exploration following a target probability distribution. In contrast, current AI benchmarks have objectively correct answers, and training large language models (LLMs) via reinforcement learning against these benchmarks discourages probabilistic exploration. Here, we conducted systematic experiments requesting LLMs to produce outputs following simple probabilistic distributions, and found that all modern LLMs tested grossly fail to follow the distributions. For example, requesting a binary output of "1" 49% of the time produces an answer of "0" nearly 100% of the time. This step function-like behavior of near-exclusively generating the output with marginally highest probability even overrules even strong in-built LLM biases.

### [244] [Adapformer: Adaptive Channel Management for Multivariate Time Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14632)
*Yuchen Luo,Xinyu Li,Liuhua Peng,Mingming Gong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Adapformer is a Transformer-based framework for multivariate time series forecasting that combines channel-independent and channel-dependent strategies via adaptive channel management. It introduces ACE (Adaptive Channel Enhancer) and ACF (Adaptive Channel Forecaster) in a dual-stage encoder-decoder to enrich embeddings and refine predictions, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MTSF approaches suffer from either ignoring inter-channel dependencies (channel-independent) or overfitting due to excessive channel information (channel-dependent). There is a need for a mechanism that adaptively harnesses inter-channel relations to improve forecasting while maintaining efficiency.

Method: Proposes a dual-stage encoder-decoder Transformer framework. ACE enriches token representations by selectively incorporating essential channel dependencies, and ACF refines the decoding by focusing on the most relevant covariates. Adaptive channel management blends CI and CD benefits to reduce noise and redundancy in predictions.

Result: Empirical evaluation on diverse datasets shows Adapformer achieves superior predictive accuracy and computational efficiency compared to existing models, establishing it as a state-of-the-art approach for MTSF.

Conclusion: Adaptive channel management via ACE and ACF effectively merges CI and CD advantages, yielding improved accuracy and efficiency in multivariate time series forecasting and offering a scalable, noise-resistant modeling paradigm.

Abstract: In multivariate time series forecasting (MTSF), accurately modeling the intricate dependencies among multiple variables remains a significant challenge due to the inherent limitations of traditional approaches. Most existing models adopt either \textbf{channel-independent} (CI) or \textbf{channel-dependent} (CD) strategies, each presenting distinct drawbacks. CI methods fail to leverage the potential insights from inter-channel interactions, resulting in models that may not fully exploit the underlying statistical dependencies present in the data. Conversely, CD approaches often incorporate too much extraneous information, risking model overfitting and predictive inefficiency. To address these issues, we introduce the Adaptive Forecasting Transformer (\textbf{Adapformer}), an advanced Transformer-based framework that merges the benefits of CI and CD methodologies through effective channel management. The core of Adapformer lies in its dual-stage encoder-decoder architecture, which includes the \textbf{A}daptive \textbf{C}hannel \textbf{E}nhancer (\textbf{ACE}) for enriching embedding processes and the \textbf{A}daptive \textbf{C}hannel \textbf{F}orecaster (\textbf{ACF}) for refining the predictions. ACE enhances token representations by selectively incorporating essential dependencies, while ACF streamlines the decoding process by focusing on the most relevant covariates, substantially reducing noise and redundancy. Our rigorous testing on diverse datasets shows that Adapformer achieves superior performance over existing models, enhancing both predictive accuracy and computational efficiency, thus making it state-of-the-art in MTSF.

*Vaskar Chakma,MD Jaheid Hasan Nerab,Abdur Rouf,Abu Sayed,Hossem MD Saim,Md. Nournabi Khan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A cross-sectional study compares Random Forest, XGBoost, and LightGBM to classify current smoking status from health screening biomarkers (n=55,691). Random Forest achieved the best performance (AUC 0.926). SHAP analysis identified blood pressure, triglycerides, liver enzymes, and creatinine as key predictors. The study prioritizes interpretability and practical deployment over novel algorithmic development; limitations include cross-sectional design and lack of external validation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The goal is to improve early health risk screening for smokers by leveraging machine learning to classify smoking status from routine health biomarkers, with a focus on clinical interpretability and feasible deployment in healthcare settings.

Method: Cross-sectional analysis of health screening data from 55,691 individuals. Compared three algorithms (Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM) for classifying current smoking status based on biomarkers. Evaluated performance with AUC and used SHAP to interpret feature contributions.

Result: Random Forest yielded the best AUC of 0.926 for differentiating high-risk from lower-risk individuals. SHAP analysis highlighted blood pressure, triglycerides, liver enzymes, and serum creatinine as the strongest signals of health decline in smokers.

Conclusion: ML can effectively classify smoking status from health screening biomarkers with high accuracy and interpretability. Emphasis on clinical deployment is appropriate, but results are cross-sectional and require external validation to assess generalizability and real-world impact.

Abstract: Smoking continues to be a major preventable cause of death worldwide, affecting millions through damage to the heart, metabolism, liver, and kidneys. However, current medical screening methods often miss the early warning signs of smoking-related health problems, leading to late-stage diagnoses when treatment options become limited. This study presents a systematic comparative evaluation of machine learning approaches for smoking-related health risk assessment, emphasizing clinical interpretability and practical deployment over algorithmic innovation. We analyzed health screening data from 55,691 individuals, examining various health indicators, including body measurements, blood tests, and demographic information. We tested three advanced prediction algorithms - Random Forest, XGBoost, and LightGBM - to determine which could most accurately identify people at high risk. This study employed a cross-sectional design to classify current smoking status based on health screening biomarkers, not to predict future disease development. Our Random Forest model performed best, achieving an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 0.926, meaning it could reliably distinguish between high-risk and lower-risk individuals. Using SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) analysis to understand what the model was detecting, we found that key health markers played crucial roles in prediction: blood pressure levels, triglyceride concentrations, liver enzyme readings, and kidney function indicators (serum creatinine) were the strongest signals of declining health in smokers.

### [246] [\textit{FLARE}: Adaptive Multi-Dimensional Reputation for Robust Client Reliability in Federated Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14715)
*Abolfazl Younesi,Leon Kiss,Zahra Najafabadi Samani,Juan Aznar Poveda,Thomas Fahringer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Adaptive reputation-based framework FLARE for federated learning that uses a multi-dimensional trust score, self-calibrating adaptive thresholds, reputation-weighted aggregation with soft exclusion, and local differential privacy to defend against Byzantine and adaptive attacks; introduces Statistical Mimicry (SM) attack and achieves strong robustness with minimal overhead in experiments on 100 clients (MNIST/CIFAR-10/SVHN).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Static threshold defenses in federated learning fail to adapt to evolving, sophisticated, and adaptive adversaries; there is a need for continuous, privacy-preserving, multi-dimensional trust assessment and dynamic defense adjustment to maintain model integrity.

Method: (i) Propose a multi-dimensional reputation score combining performance consistency, statistical anomaly indicators, and temporal behavior; (ii) implement a self-calibrating adaptive threshold that tunes security strictness based on convergence and recent attack intensity; (iii) use reputation-weighted aggregation with soft exclusion to proportionally limit suspicious contributions rather than outright removal; (iv) apply Local Differential Privacy to enable privatized reputation scoring; also introduce a Statistical Mimicry (SM) attack benchmark to test evasion resistance.

Result: FLARE maintains high model accuracy and faster convergence than Byzantine-robust baselines under diverse attacks (label flipping, gradient scaling, adaptive attacks, ALIE, and SM); robustness improvement up to 16%, convergence within 30% of non-attacked baseline, and strong malicious-client detection with minimal computational overhead.

Conclusion: An adaptive, privacy-preserving reputation framework can significantly improve FL robustness against evolving Byzantine and adaptive threats, enabling soft exclusion and dynamic defense while preserving efficiency; the SM attack highlights limitations of static defenses and validates FLARE's effectiveness.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training while preserving data privacy. However, it remains vulnerable to malicious clients who compromise model integrity through Byzantine attacks, data poisoning, or adaptive adversarial behaviors. Existing defense mechanisms rely on static thresholds and binary classification, failing to adapt to evolving client behaviors in real-world deployments. We propose FLARE, an adaptive reputation-based framework that transforms client reliability assessment from binary decisions to a continuous, multi-dimensional trust evaluation. FLARE integrates: (i) a multi-dimensional reputation score capturing performance consistency, statistical anomaly indicators, and temporal behavior, (ii) a self-calibrating adaptive threshold mechanism that adjusts security strictness based on model convergence and recent attack intensity, (iii) reputation-weighted aggregation with soft exclusion to proportionally limit suspicious contributions rather than eliminating clients outright, and (iv) a Local Differential Privacy (LDP) mechanism enabling reputation scoring on privatized client updates. We further introduce a highly evasive Statistical Mimicry (SM) attack, a benchmark adversary that blends honest gradients with synthetic perturbations and persistent drift to remain undetected by traditional filters. Extensive experiments with 100 clients on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and SVHN demonstrate that FLARE maintains high model accuracy and converges faster than state-of-the-art Byzantine-robust methods under diverse attack types, including label flipping, gradient scaling, adaptive attacks, ALIE, and SM. FLARE improves robustness by up to 16% and preserves model convergence within 30% of the non-attacked baseline, while achieving strong malicious-client detection performance with minimal computational overhead. https://github.com/Anonymous0-0paper/FLARE

### [247] [AdamHD: Decoupled Huber Decay Regularization for Language Model Pre-Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14721)
*Fu-Ming Guo,Yingfang Fan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces AdamHuberDecay, a drop-in replacement for AdamW that uses a decoupled smooth Huber regularizer instead of an L2 penalty, yielding bounded gradients, robustness to outliers, sparser weights, and improved efficiency for pre-training large transformers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In AdamW, the L2 weight penalty pulls all parameters toward the origin and is sensitive to rare extreme gradients, often over-penalizing well-conditioned coordinates. There is a need for a decoupled, robust regularizer that provides magnitude-based sparsity without destabilizing updates.

Method: Replace the L2 decay with a decoupled smooth Huber regularizer. The update exhibits quadratic decay when |w|<δ and linear (L1-like) decay when |w|>δ, producing bounded regularization gradients and invariance to per-coordinate second-moment rescaling. The closed-form decoupled Huber decay step is integrated into any Adam-family optimizer at O(1) additional cost.

Result: Empirical evaluations on GPT-2 and GPT-3 pre-training show: (a) 10-15% faster wall-clock convergence, (b) perplexity reduced by up to 4 points, (c) downstream task gains of 2.5-4.7%, and (d) visibly sparser weight histograms leading to 20-30% memory savings after magnitude pruning, without tuning beyond the default AdamW grid. Ablations indicate robustness to outliers and large-batch regimes; theoretical analyses bound expected parameter norm under noisy updates.

Conclusion: AdamHuberDecay offers a simple, principled approach to more efficient and resilient training of large generative transformers by substituting L2 weight decay with a decoupled Huber regularizer, achieving faster convergence, better performance, and memory savings while maintaining compatibility with existing Adam-family optimizers.

Abstract: Adaptive optimizers with decoupled weight decay, such as AdamW, are the de facto standard for pre-training large transformer-based generative models. Yet the quadratic nature of the $\ell_2$ penalty embedded in weight decay drives all parameters toward the origin at the same rate, making the update vulnerable to rare but extreme gradient directions and often over-penalizing well-conditioned coordinates. We propose AdamHuberDecay, a drop-in replacement for AdamW that substitutes the $\ell_2$ penalty with a decoupled smooth Huber regularizer. The resulting update decays parameters quadratically while their magnitude remains below a threshold $δ$, and linearly ($\ell_1$-like) once they exceed $δ$, yielding (i) bounded regularization gradients, (ii) invariance to per-coordinate second-moment rescaling, and (iii) stronger sparsity pressure on overgrown weights.
  We derive the closed-form decoupled Huber decay step and show how to integrate it with any Adam-family optimizer at $O(1)$ extra cost. Extensive experiments on GPT-2 and GPT-3 pre-training demonstrate that AdamHuberDecay (a) converges 10-15% faster in wall-clock time, (b) reduces validation perplexity by up to 4 points, (c) delivers performance improvements of 2.5-4.7% across downstream tasks, and (d) yields visibly sparser weight histograms that translate into 20-30% memory savings after magnitude pruning, without tuning the decay coefficient beyond the default grid used for AdamW. Ablations confirm robustness to outlier gradients and large-batch regimes, together with theoretical analyses that bound the expected parameter norm under noisy updates. AdamHuberDecay therefore provides a simple, principled path toward more efficient and resilient training of next-generation foundational generative transformers.

### [248] [LAUD: Integrating Large Language Models with Active Learning for Unlabeled Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14738)
*Tzu-Hsuan Chou,Chun-Nan Chou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LAUD combines LLMs with active learning to address unlabeled data; it starts with a zero-shot initialized label set and iteratively queries the unlabeled data, yielding better performance than zero-shot or few-shot baselines on commodity name classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world labeling scarcity hinders LLM-based performance. Prompt engineering is tedious and trial-and-error. A scalable approach is needed to bootstrap labels and leverage unlabeled data without extensive labeling.

Method: LAUD integrates LLMs with active learning. It mitigates cold-start by constructing an initial label set via zero-shot learning, then iteratively querying the most informative unlabeled samples and refining labels using LLMs.

Result: LLMs trained under LAUD outperform zero-shot or few-shot LLM baselines on commodity name classification tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness of the framework.

Conclusion: LAUD effectively leverages unlabeled data and active learning to improve LLM performance with limited labeled data, reducing reliance on extensive prompt engineering and labeled data.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown a remarkable ability to generalize beyond their pre-training data, and fine-tuning LLMs can elevate performance to human-level and beyond. However, in real-world scenarios, lacking labeled data often prevents practitioners from obtaining well-performing models, thereby forcing practitioners to highly rely on prompt-based approaches that are often tedious, inefficient, and driven by trial and error. To alleviate this issue of lacking labeled data, we present a learning framework integrating LLMs with active learning for unlabeled dataset (LAUD). LAUD mitigates the cold-start problem by constructing an initial label set with zero-shot learning. Experimental results show that LLMs derived from LAUD outperform LLMs with zero-shot or few-shot learning on commodity name classification tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness of LAUD.

### [249] [Beyond Means: A Dynamic Framework for Predicting Customer Satisfaction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14743)
*Christof Naumzik,Abdurahman Maarouf,Stefan Feuerriegel,Markus Weinmann*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A Gaussian process-based rating aggregator that models time dynamics and review heterogeneity outperforms the traditional mean in predicting future ratings, reducing MAE by 10.2% on Yelp data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard rating aggregation (e.g., the sample mean) ignores how ratings evolve over time and fails to account for heterogeneity among reviews (e.g., sentiment, helpfulness), potentially misinforming customers. An adaptive, heterogeneous-aware aggregator could provide more accurate, timely signals of customer satisfaction.

Method: Develop and apply a tailored Gaussian process (GP) model that (i) captures temporal dynamics in ratings and (ii) incorporates review-level heterogeneity. Compare GP-based aggregation against baselines (e.g., sample mean) using 121,123 Yelp ratings, evaluating predictive power for future ratings.

Result: The GP model is considerably more accurate than the sample mean, achieving a 10.2% reduction in mean absolute error (MAE) in predicting future ratings.

Conclusion: Moving beyond simple means to adaptive, heterogeneity-aware aggregators can yield more informative and accurate aggregated rating scores, benefiting both marketing practitioners and customers by better signaling expected customer satisfaction.

Abstract: Online ratings influence customer decision-making, yet standard aggregation methods, such as the sample mean, fail to adapt to quality changes over time and ignore review heterogeneity (e.g., review sentiment, a review's helpfulness). To address these challenges, we demonstrate the value of using the Gaussian process (GP) framework for rating aggregation. Specifically, we present a tailored GP model that captures the dynamics of ratings over time while additionally accounting for review heterogeneity. Based on 121,123 ratings from Yelp, we compare the predictive power of different rating aggregation methods in predicting future ratings, thereby finding that the GP model is considerably more accurate and reduces the mean absolute error by 10.2% compared to the sample mean. Our findings have important implications for marketing practitioners and customers. By moving beyond means, designers of online reputation systems can display more informative and adaptive aggregated rating scores that are accurate signals of expected customer satisfaction.

### [250] [Measuring AI Progress in Drug Discovery: A Reproducible Leaderboard for the Tox21 Challenge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14744)
*Antonia Ebner,Christoph Bartmann,Sonja Topf,Sohvi Luukkonen,Johannes Schimunek,Günter Klambauer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Reproducible Tox21 leaderboard shows little clear progress in toxicity prediction over a decade; original DeepTox and 2017 self-normalizing neural nets remain competitive; dataset changes in benchmarks hinder comparability; public baselines via Hugging Face Spaces.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clarify whether deep learning has substantially advanced toxicity/bioactivity prediction given benchmark manipulations and label imputation; promote reproducibility.

Method: Create a reproducible leaderboard on Hugging Face using the original Tox21 dataset; provide baselines and representative models; enable inference via standardized API (Hugging Face Spaces).

Result: The leaderboard indicates the original Tox21 winner DeepTox and the 2017 self-normalizing neural networks remain among top methods; overall progress over the past decade remains unclear due to data/label changes.

Conclusion: Without consistent benchmarking data, it's hard to claim progress; providing open baselines and reproducible evaluation helps interpret past decade's progress in toxicity prediction.

Abstract: Deep learning's rise since the early 2010s has transformed fields like computer vision and natural language processing and strongly influenced biomedical research. For drug discovery specifically, a key inflection - akin to vision's "ImageNet moment" - arrived in 2015, when deep neural networks surpassed traditional approaches on the Tox21 Data Challenge. This milestone accelerated the adoption of deep learning across the pharmaceutical industry, and today most major companies have integrated these methods into their research pipelines. After the Tox21 Challenge concluded, its dataset was included in several established benchmarks, such as MoleculeNet and the Open Graph Benchmark. However, during these integrations, the dataset was altered and labels were imputed or manufactured, resulting in a loss of comparability across studies. Consequently, the extent to which bioactivity and toxicity prediction methods have improved over the past decade remains unclear. To this end, we introduce a reproducible leaderboard, hosted on Hugging Face with the original Tox21 Challenge dataset, together with a set of baseline and representative methods. The current version of the leaderboard indicates that the original Tox21 winner - the ensemble-based DeepTox method - and the descriptor-based self-normalizing neural networks introduced in 2017, continue to perform competitively and rank among the top methods for toxicity prediction, leaving it unclear whether substantial progress in toxicity prediction has been achieved over the past decade. As part of this work, we make all baselines and evaluated models publicly accessible for inference via standardized API calls to Hugging Face Spaces.

### [251] [Look-Ahead Reasoning on Learning Platforms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14745)
*Haiqing Zhu,Tijana Zrnic,Celestine Mendler-Dünner*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper analyzes strategic and coordinated user behavior on learning platforms, showing that level-k thinking speeds convergence but leaves the equilibrium unchanged; collective action can improve alignment between learner and user utilities, with limits and broad connections to strategic classification, performative prediction, and algorithmic collective action.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how misalignment between platform objectives and user welfare leads users to act strategically, and how one-step look-ahead and collective optimization among users affect predictions and platform design.

Method: Formally define level-k thinking, analyze its impact on convergence to equilibrium and show the equilibrium is unchanged; compare selfish versus collective user behavior, characterize benefits and limits of coordination, and introduce a new alignment notion between learner and user utilities; connect framework to strategic classification, performative prediction, and algorithmic collective action.

Result: Level-k reasoning accelerates convergence to equilibrium but does not alter the long-run equilibrium; coordination among users can yield benefits by aligning learner and user utilities, though limits exist; a new alignment concept emerges; several connections to existing mathematical frameworks are highlighted.

Conclusion: The work highlights the importance of considering collective user behavior and alignment in the design of learning platforms, bridging ideas across strategic classification, performative prediction, and algorithmic collective action, and clarifying when and how coordination improves outcomes.

Abstract: On many learning platforms, the optimization criteria guiding model training reflect the priorities of the designer rather than those of the individuals they affect. Consequently, users may act strategically to obtain more favorable outcomes, effectively contesting the platform's predictions. While past work has studied strategic user behavior on learning platforms, the focus has largely been on strategic responses to a deployed model, without considering the behavior of other users. In contrast, look-ahead reasoning takes into account that user actions are coupled, and -- at scale -- impact future predictions. Within this framework, we first formalize level-$k$ thinking, a concept from behavioral economics, where users aim to outsmart their peers by looking one step ahead. We show that, while convergence to an equilibrium is accelerated, the equilibrium remains the same, providing no benefit of higher-level reasoning for individuals in the long run. Then, we focus on collective reasoning, where users take coordinated actions by optimizing through their joint impact on the model. By contrasting collective with selfish behavior, we characterize the benefits and limits of coordination; a new notion of alignment between the learner's and the users' utilities emerges as a key concept. We discuss connections to several related mathematical frameworks, including strategic classification, performative prediction, and algorithmic collective action.

### [252] [SparseST: Exploiting Data Sparsity in Spatiotemporal Modeling and Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14753)
*Junfeng Wu,Hadjer Benmeziane,Kaoutar El Maghraoui,Liu Liu,Yinan Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SparseST introduces a data-sparsity driven framework for efficient spatiotemporal modeling, and a multi-objective loss to approximate the Pareto front between accuracy and computation, guiding edge-deployment trade-offs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ConvLSTM and its variants are effective for STDM but computationally expensive, hindering edge deployment. STDM naturally contains data and feature redundancy at the data level, not just model capacity, suggesting that exploiting data sparsity can reduce compute without sacrificing performance.

Method: Propose SparseST, a framework that leverages data sparsity to build an efficient spatiotemporal model. Develop a multi-objective composite loss to approximate the Pareto frontier between performance and computational cost, offering a practical tool for tuning models under resource constraints.

Result: The abstract claims novelty in exploiting data sparsity and presents a framework plus a Pareto-front guided loss, but does not report specific experimental results or quantitative metrics in the abstract.

Conclusion: SparseST provides a path to efficient STDM by leveraging data sparsity rather than reducing model capacity, and supplies practitioners with a Pareto-front information source to balance accuracy and compute for edge deployment.

Abstract: Spatiotemporal data mining (STDM) has a wide range of applications in various complex physical systems (CPS), i.e., transportation, manufacturing, healthcare, etc. Among all the proposed methods, the Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (ConvLSTM) has proved to be generalizable and extendable in different applications and has multiple variants achieving state-of-the-art performance in various STDM applications. However, ConvLSTM and its variants are computationally expensive, which makes them inapplicable in edge devices with limited computational resources. With the emerging need for edge computing in CPS, efficient AI is essential to reduce the computational cost while preserving the model performance. Common methods of efficient AI are developed to reduce redundancy in model capacity (i.e., model pruning, compression, etc.). However, spatiotemporal data mining naturally requires extensive model capacity, as the embedded dependencies in spatiotemporal data are complex and hard to capture, which limits the model redundancy. Instead, there is a fairly high level of data and feature redundancy that introduces an unnecessary computational burden, which has been largely overlooked in existing research. Therefore, we developed a novel framework SparseST, that pioneered in exploiting data sparsity to develop an efficient spatiotemporal model. In addition, we explore and approximate the Pareto front between model performance and computational efficiency by designing a multi-objective composite loss function, which provides a practical guide for practitioners to adjust the model according to computational resource constraints and the performance requirements of downstream tasks.

*Xiaoxing Lian,Aidong Yang,Jun Zhu,Peng Wang,Yue Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SpatiaLite introduces a synthetic benchmark to evaluate spatial reasoning in vision-language models, revealing that current models rely on linguistic cues rather than perceptual spatial understanding, are inefficient as transformation complexity grows, and can be guided toward improvement via an Imagery Driven Framework (IDF) to build an internal world model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in robust, perceptually grounded spatial reasoning benchmarks for VLMs and to understand the cognitive mechanisms (imagination vs. language) these models use when performing spatial tasks.

Method: Develop SpatiaLite, a fully synthetic benchmark that jointly measures spatial reasoning accuracy and reasoning efficiency. Conduct comprehensive experiments on advanced VLMs (e.g., DeepSeek R1, OpenAI o3, Gemini 2.5 Pro) to assess performance on perceptual spatial relations and 3D geometry transformations, and analyze token usage as transformation complexity grows. Propose Imagery Driven Framework (IDF) for data synthesis and training to implicitly construct an internal spatial world model.

Result: Three key findings: (1) Advanced VLMs rely predominantly on linguistic representations for spatial reasoning, leading to poor performance on visual-centric tasks requiring perceptual spatial relations and 3D transformations; (2) These models show severe inefficiency in spatial reasoning, with token usage increasing rapidly with task complexity; (3) Introduction of the Imagery Driven Framework (IDF) for data synthesis/training that can help build an internal world model critical for spatial reasoning.

Conclusion: SpatiaLite delineates the limits and patterns of spatial reasoning in current VLMs, identifies core shortcomings driven by reliance on language over perception, and points to the Imagery Driven Framework as a promising pathway to enhance visuospatial reasoning in future models.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) and vision language models (VLMs), such as DeepSeek R1,OpenAI o3, and Gemini 2.5 Pro, have demonstrated remarkable reasoning capabilities across logical inference, problem solving, and decision making. However, spatial reasoning:a fundamental component of human cognition that includes mental rotation, navigation, and spatial relationship comprehension remains a significant challenge for current advanced VLMs. We hypothesize that imagination, the internal simulation of spatial states, is the dominant reasoning mechanism within a spatial world model. To test this hypothesis and systematically probe current VLM spatial reasoning mechanisms, we introduce SpatiaLite, a fully synthetic benchmark that jointly measures spatial reasoning accuracy and reasoning efficiency. Comprehensive experiments reveal three key findings. First, advanced VLMs predominantly rely on linguistic representations for reasoning and imagination, resulting in significant deficiencies on visual centric tasks that demand perceptual spatial relations and 3D geometry transformations such as mental rotation or projection prediction. Second, advanced VLMs exhibit severe inefficiency in their current spatial reasoning mechanisms, with token usage growing rapidly as transformation complexity increases. Third, we propose an Imagery Driven Framework (IDF) for data synthesis and training, which can implicitly construct an internal world model that is critical for spatial reasoning in VLMs. Building on SpatiaLite, this work delineates the spatial reasoning limits and patterns of advanced VLMs, identifies key shortcomings, and informs future advances

*Mohammad Reza Shafie,Morteza Hajiabadi,Hamed Khosravi,Mobina Noori,Imtiaz Ahmed*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes KANGURA, a Kolmogorov-Arnold Network–based geometry-aware learning framework for 3D modeling that disentangles geometry and uses unified attention; achieves state-of-the-art on ModelNet40 and 3D MFC anode problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D predictive models struggle to capture complex geometric dependencies in 3D structures like MFC anodes; a geometry-aware, interpretable framework is needed.

Method: Formulates prediction as a function decomposition problem; uses KAN-based representation learning to reconstruct geometric relations without traditional MLPs; introduces geometry-disentangled representation learning to separate structural variations into interpretable components; employs unified attention to emphasize critical geometric regions; evaluated on ModelNet40 and real-world MFC anode structure.

Result: Outperforms over 15 SOTA on ModelNet40 with 92.7% accuracy; achieves 97% accuracy on real-world MFC anode problem.

Conclusion: KANGURA is a robust 3D geometric modeling framework enabling optimized design of complex structures in advanced manufacturing and engineering applications.

Abstract: Microbial Fuel Cells (MFCs) offer a promising pathway for sustainable energy generation by converting organic matter into electricity through microbial processes. A key factor influencing MFC performance is the anode structure, where design and material properties play a crucial role. Existing predictive models struggle to capture the complex geometric dependencies necessary to optimize these structures. To solve this problem, we propose KANGURA: Kolmogorov-Arnold Network-Based Geometry-Aware Learning with Unified Representation Attention. KANGURA introduces a new approach to three-dimensional (3D) machine learning modeling. It formulates prediction as a function decomposition problem, where Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN)- based representation learning reconstructs geometric relationships without a conventional multi- layer perceptron (MLP). To refine spatial understanding, geometry-disentangled representation learning separates structural variations into interpretable components, while unified attention mechanisms dynamically enhance critical geometric regions. Experimental results demonstrate that KANGURA outperforms over 15 state-of-the-art (SOTA) models on the ModelNet40 benchmark dataset, achieving 92.7% accuracy, and excels in a real-world MFC anode structure problem with 97% accuracy. This establishes KANGURA as a robust framework for 3D geometric modeling, unlocking new possibilities for optimizing complex structures in advanced manufacturing and quality-driven engineering applications.

*Humza Nusrat,Omar Nusrat*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AI scientist KOSMOS produced one well-supported discovery, one plausible but uncertain result, and one false hypothesis across three radiation biology benchmarks, highlighting the need for rigorous null-model auditing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Evaluate the reliability of autonomous AI-driven hypothesis generation in bioscience and the necessity of null-model benchmarking to prevent misleading conclusions.

Method: KOSMOS applied to three radiation biology problems using simple random-gene null benchmarks across datasets GSE30240, GSE59732, and GSE116918. Assessed associations via Spearman correlations (and p-values), empirical p-values for CDO1, and a concordance index (CI) for a 12-gene signature. Classified outcomes as well-supported, plausible but uncertain, or false.

Result: DDR-p53: Spearman rho = -0.40, p = 0.76 (weak, not different from random five-gene scores). OGT: r = 0.23, p = 0.34 (weak). CDO1: r = 0.70, empirical p = 0.0039 (strong outlier). 12-gene signature CI = 0.61, p = 0.017 (modest discrimination but non-unique effect size). Overall: one well-supported discovery, one plausible but uncertain result, one false hypothesis.

Conclusion: Autonomous AI can generate useful ideas but requires rigorous auditing against appropriate null models and transparent validation pipelines. Improvements should focus on stronger null-benchmarks, cross-dataset replication, and clear reporting of uncertainties to prevent spurious findings.

Abstract: Agentic AI "scientists" now use language models to search the literature, run analyses, and generate hypotheses. We evaluate KOSMOS, an autonomous AI scientist, on three problems in radiation biology using simple random-gene null benchmarks. Hypothesis 1: baseline DNA damage response (DDR) capacity across cell lines predicts the p53 transcriptional response after irradiation (GSE30240). Hypothesis 2: baseline expression of OGT and CDO1 predicts the strength of repressed and induced radiation-response modules in breast cancer cells (GSE59732). Hypothesis 3: a 12-gene expression signature predicts biochemical recurrence-free survival after prostate radiotherapy plus androgen deprivation therapy (GSE116918). The DDR-p53 hypothesis was not supported: DDR score and p53 response were weakly negatively correlated (Spearman rho = -0.40, p = 0.76), indistinguishable from random five-gene scores. OGT showed only a weak association (r = 0.23, p = 0.34), whereas CDO1 was a clear outlier (r = 0.70, empirical p = 0.0039). The 12-gene signature achieved a concordance index of 0.61 (p = 0.017) but a non-unique effect size. Overall, KOSMOS produced one well-supported discovery, one plausible but uncertain result, and one false hypothesis, illustrating that AI scientists can generate useful ideas but require rigorous auditing against appropriate null models.

*Anna Rodum Bjøru,Rafael Cabañas,Helge Langseth,Antonio Salmerón*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Extends a divide-and-conquer bounding method for counterfactual probabilities from Markovian to semi-Markovian SCMs; identifies challenges, proposes alternative strategies, and evaluates them theoretically and computationally.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable tight counterfactual bounds in semi-Markovian structural causal models where exogenous variables can influence multiple endogenous variables and thus introduce confounding, extending prior work that relied on low-card exogenous marginals in Markovian settings.

Method: The paper analyzes the extension by presenting a minimal example that reveals the core challenges, and then proposes multiple alternative solution strategies. It provides theoretical analysis of the strategies and conducts a computational study to compare their performance.

Result: The strategies exhibit different theoretical properties and trade-offs; the example clarifies why the straightforward extension fails, and the study highlights promising directions and limitations for semi-Markovian bounding methods.

Conclusion: Extending the divide-and-conquer bounding approach to semi-Markovian SCMs is nontrivial due to shared exogenous influences. The work clarifies the challenges, proposes alternative strategies, and lays groundwork for future research with theoretical and computational evaluation.

Abstract: Recently, Bjøru et al. proposed a novel divide-and-conquer algorithm for bounding counterfactual probabilities in structural causal models (SCMs). They assumed that the SCMs were learned from purely observational data, leading to an imprecise characterization of the marginal distributions of exogenous variables. Their method leveraged the canonical representation of structural equations to decompose a general SCM with high-cardinality exogenous variables into a set of sub-models with low-cardinality exogenous variables. These sub-models had precise marginals over the exogenous variables and therefore admitted efficient exact inference. The aggregated results were used to bound counterfactual probabilities in the original model. The approach was developed for Markovian models, where each exogenous variable affects only a single endogenous variable. In this paper, we investigate extending the methodology to \textit{semi-Markovian} SCMs, where exogenous variables may influence multiple endogenous variables. Such models are capable of representing confounding relationships that Markovian models cannot. We illustrate the challenges of this extension using a minimal example, which motivates a set of alternative solution strategies. These strategies are evaluated both theoretically and through a computational study.

### [257] [Jailbreaking Large Vision Language Models in Intelligent Transportation Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13892)
*Badhan Chandra Das,Md Tasnim Jawad,Md Jueal Mia,M. Hadi Amini,Yanzhao Wu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This work investigates jailbreaking vulnerabilities of LVLMs in Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) and proposes a dual-front defense: a novel typography-based, multi-turn jailbreaking attack and a multi-layered response-filtering defense, evaluated on CH LVLMs with GPT-4-based toxicity judgments and manual checks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LVLMs integrated in ITS could be safety-critical; adversaries may exploit jailbreaking to elicit harmful or unsafe responses, posing real-world risks in transportation contexts. Understanding vulnerabilities and defenses is essential for robust, trustworthy ITS deployments.

Method: 1) Build a transportation-specific harmful-query dataset aligned with OpenAI's prohibited categories. 2) Propose a jailbreaking attack leveraging image typography manipulation and multi-turn prompting. 3) Develop a multi-layered response-filtering defense to block inappropriate outputs. 4) Evaluate attack and defense on state-of-the-art LVLMs (open- and closed-source). 5) Use GPT-4 judgments and manual checks to assess toxicity; compare with existing jailbreaking techniques. 6) Discuss security implications and risks in ITS deployments.

Result: Attack demonstrates vulnerabilities of LVLMs under the proposed manipulation; defense offers partial mitigation through multi-layered filtering but may not fully neutralize jailbreaking, depending on implementation. Comparative analysis with existing jailbreaking methods underscores significant security risks in ITS-integrated LVLMs.

Conclusion: The study highlights strong security risks posed by jailbreaking LVLMs in ITS and emphasizes the need for robust, layered defenses and further research to prevent unsafe outputs in high-stakes transportation systems.

Abstract: Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) demonstrate strong capabilities in multimodal reasoning and many real-world applications, such as visual question answering. However, LVLMs are highly vulnerable to jailbreaking attacks. This paper systematically analyzes the vulnerabilities of LVLMs integrated in Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) under carefully crafted jailbreaking attacks. First, we carefully construct a dataset with harmful queries relevant to transportation, following OpenAI's prohibited categories to which the LVLMs should not respond. Second, we introduce a novel jailbreaking attack that exploits the vulnerabilities of LVLMs through image typography manipulation and multi-turn prompting. Third, we propose a multi-layered response filtering defense technique to prevent the model from generating inappropriate responses. We perform extensive experiments with the proposed attack and defense on the state-of-the-art LVLMs (both open-source and closed-source). To evaluate the attack method and defense technique, we use GPT-4's judgment to determine the toxicity score of the generated responses, as well as manual verification. Further, we compare our proposed jailbreaking method with existing jailbreaking techniques and highlight severe security risks involved with jailbreaking attacks with image typography manipulation and multi-turn prompting in the LVLMs integrated in ITS.

### [258] [CORGI: Efficient Pattern Matching With Quadratic Guarantees](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13942)
*Daniel Weitekamp*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CORGI is a graph-based, quadratic-time/space matching algorithm for rule-based systems that streams matches on demand, avoiding RETE-style conflict-set blowups.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-time matching requires bounded resources; pattern-matching can blow up in time and space; online AI rule generation can produce worst-case patterns that exhaust memory; anti-unification-based generalization can exacerbate these issues.

Method: Two-stage approach: (1) forward pass builds/maintains a graph of grounded relations; (2) an on-demand iterator traverses backward to generate matches, avoiding full conflict-set materialization; no traditional β-memory; quadratic guarantees for a single match; supports streaming of subsequent matches.

Result: Performance evaluation shows CORGI significantly outperforms RETE implementations from SOAR and OPS5 on a simple combinatorial matching task.

Conclusion: CORGI provides predictable, scalable matching for real-time AI and data querying, mitigating memory/time explosions and offering a practical alternative to RETE when generalization yields worst-case patterns.

Abstract: Rule-based systems must solve complex matching problems within tight time constraints to be effective in real-time applications, such as planning and reactive control for AI agents, as well as low-latency relational database querying. Pattern-matching systems can encounter issues where exponential time and space are required to find matches for rules with many underconstrained variables, or which produce combinatorial intermediate partial matches (but are otherwise well-constrained). When online AI systems automatically generate rules from example-driven induction or code synthesis, they can easily produce worst-case matching patterns that slow or halt program execution by exceeding available memory. In our own work with cognitive systems that learn from example, we've found that aggressive forms of anti-unification-based generalization can easily produce these circumstances. To make these systems practical without hand-engineering constraints or succumbing to unpredictable failure modes, we introduce a new matching algorithm called CORGI (Collection-Oriented Relational Graph Iteration). Unlike RETE-based approaches, CORGI offers quadratic time and space guarantees for finding single satisficing matches, and the ability to iteratively stream subsequent matches without committing entire conflict sets to memory. CORGI differs from RETE in that it does not have a traditional $β$-memory for collecting partial matches. Instead, CORGI takes a two-step approach: a graph of grounded relations is built/maintained in a forward pass, and an iterator generates matches as needed by working backward through the graph. This approach eliminates the high-latency delays and memory overflows that can result from populating full conflict sets. In a performance evaluation, we demonstrate that CORGI significantly outperforms RETE implementations from SOAR and OPS5 on a simple combinatorial matching task.

*Sanjay Acharjee,Abir Khan Ratul,Diego Patino,Md Nazmus Sakib*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A scene graph-guided generative AI pipeline synthesizes photorealistic hazardous-scene images from OSHA reports, using GPT-4o to build object-level scene graphs that guide diffusion models; evaluated with a VQA-based Graph Score that outperforms CLIP/BLIP under entropy-based validation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome lack of realistic unsafe-condition data for training vision models; safety-critical risk detection requires plentiful accurate synthetic data anchored in real accident narratives.

Method: Transform OSHA narratives via GPT-4o to extract structured hazard reasoning; convert to object-level scene graphs encoding spatial/contextual relations; guide text-to-image diffusion models to generate hazard-scene images; validate realism with a VQA framework; compare graphs across four generative models using entropy-based metric.

Result: The VQA Graph Score demonstrates higher discriminative sensitivity than CLIP and BLIP on realism/semantic fidelity, across multiple generative models.

Conclusion: Scene-graph-guided generation grounded in OSHA reports yields realistic hazard imagery suitable for hazard detection; the proposed VQA-based evaluation robustly estimates realism beyond existing metrics.

Abstract: Training vision models to detect workplace hazards accurately requires realistic images of unsafe conditions that could lead to accidents. However, acquiring such datasets is difficult because capturing accident-triggering scenarios as they occur is nearly impossible. To overcome this limitation, this study presents a novel scene graph-guided generative AI framework that synthesizes photorealistic images of hazardous scenarios grounded in historical Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) accident reports. OSHA narratives are analyzed using GPT-4o to extract structured hazard reasoning, which is converted into object-level scene graphs capturing spatial and contextual relationships essential for understanding risk. These graphs guide a text-to-image diffusion model to generate compositionally accurate hazard scenes. To evaluate the realism and semantic fidelity of the generated data, a visual question answering (VQA) framework is introduced. Across four state-of-the-art generative models, the proposed VQA Graph Score outperforms CLIP and BLIP metrics based on entropy-based validation, confirming its higher discriminative sensitivity.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ALEX is a lightweight knowledge editing framework with a hierarchical memory that clusters edits semantically to enable scalable, efficient updates for LLMs, augmented by an Inferential Query Synthesis (IQS) module and a Dynamic Evidence Adjudication (DEA) engine to support accurate multi-hop reasoning; it achieves strong MultiHop-ACC and HopWise-ACC on MQUAKE and reduces search space significantly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs have static knowledge that lags behind evolving information. Existing editing methods struggle with scalability and retrieval efficiency, especially for complex, multi-hop questions requiring multi-step reasoning.

Method: ALEX introduces a hierarchical memory architecture that groups knowledge updates into semantic clusters, reducing retrieval complexity from O(N) to O(K+N/C). It includes an Inferential Query Synthesis (IQS) module to bridge the semantic gap between queries and facts, and a Dynamic Evidence Adjudication (DEA) engine that performs a two-stage retrieval process.

Result: On the MQUAKE benchmark, ALEX significantly improves multi-hop answer accuracy (MultiHop-ACC) and the reliability of reasoning paths (HopWise-ACC), while reducing the search space by over 80%.

Conclusion: ALEX offers a scalable, efficient, and accurate knowledge editing approach for LLMs, presenting a promising direction for future knowledge editing systems.

Abstract: The static nature of knowledge within Large Language Models (LLMs) makes it difficult for them to adapt to evolving information, rendering knowledge editing a critical task. However, existing methods struggle with challenges of scalability and retrieval efficiency, particularly when handling complex, multi-hop questions that require multi-step reasoning. To address these challenges, this paper introduces ALEX (A Light Editing-knowledge Extractor), a lightweight knowledge editing framework. The core innovation of ALEX is its hierarchical memory architecture, which organizes knowledge updates (edits) into semantic clusters. This design fundamentally reduces retrieval complexity from a linear O(N) to a highly scalable O(K+N/C). Furthermore, the framework integrates an Inferential Query Synthesis (IQS) module to bridge the semantic gap between queries and facts , and a Dynamic Evidence Adjudication (DEA) engine that executes an efficient two-stage retrieval process. Experiments on the MQUAKE benchmark demonstrate that ALEX significantly improves both the accuracy of multi-hop answers (MultiHop-ACC) and the reliability of reasoning paths (HopWise-ACC). It also reduces the required search space by over 80% , presenting a promising path toward building scalable, efficient, and accurate knowledge editing systems.

### [262] [Syn-STARTS: Synthesized START Triage Scenario Generation Framework for Scalable LLM Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14023)
*Chiharu Hagiwara,Naoki Nonaka,Yuhta Hashimoto,Ryu Uchimido,Jun Seita*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A new framework Syn-STARTS uses LLMs to generate synthetic triage cases for mass casualty incidents (MCIs), producing data that closely matches manually curated TRIAGE datasets and showing stable accuracy across START categories, enabling AI development with synthetic data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MCIs are rare and real-world data for triage are scarce, creating a bottleneck for developing and evaluating AI triage models. Synthetic data can provide large, high-quality benchmarks to train and assess performance.

Method: Develop Syn-STARTS to generate triage scenarios with large language models. Compare generated cases to the TRIAGE open dataset derived from manual curation. Evaluate LLM accuracy on hundreds of cases across START categories (green, yellow, red, black). Assess qualitative indistinguishability and stability of results.

Result: The Syn-STARTS generated triage cases were qualitatively indistinguishable from the TRIAGE open dataset. LLM accuracy across START categories (green, yellow, red, black) was highly stable across hundreds of cases.

Conclusion: Synthetic data produced by LLM-based frameworks like Syn-STARTS can effectively support the development of high-performance AI models for severe and critical medical situations, addressing data scarcity in MCIs.

Abstract: Triage is a critically important decision-making process in mass casualty incidents (MCIs) to maximize victim survival rates. While the role of AI in such situations is gaining attention for making optimal decisions within limited resources and time, its development and performance evaluation require benchmark datasets of sufficient quantity and quality. However, MCIs occur infrequently, and sufficient records are difficult to accumulate at the scene, making it challenging to collect large-scale realworld data for research use. Therefore, we developed Syn-STARTS, a framework that uses LLMs to generate triage cases, and verified its effectiveness. The results showed that the triage cases generated by Syn-STARTS were qualitatively indistinguishable from the TRIAGE open dataset generated by manual curation from training materials. Furthermore, when evaluating the LLM accuracy using hundreds of cases each from the green, yellow, red, and black categories defined by the standard triage method START, the results were found to be highly stable. This strongly indicates the possibility of synthetic data in developing high-performance AI models for severe and critical medical situations.

### [263] [AISAC: An Integrated multi-agent System for Transparent, Retrieval-Grounded Scientific Assistance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14043)
*Chandrachur Bhattacharya,Sibendu Som*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AISAC is an Argonne-led integrated multi-agent system for scientific and engineering workflows that unifies LangGraph orchestration, FAISS vector search, and SQLite persistence into a transparent, provenance-aware, configurable platform with Router/Planner/Coordinator roles, optional Evaluator, and Gradio-based logging/visualization; demonstrated across waste-to-products and energy process safety and generalized scientific assistance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The growing complexity of scientific workflows requires transparent decision-making, reproducible provenance, and adaptable AI tooling that can coordinate heterogeneous modules and data stores while allowing researchers to customize tools and prompts without touching core code.

Method: Architecture centers on a Router-Planner-Coordinator workflow with an optional Evaluator. Roles are defined via custom system prompts that yield structured JSON. Agents coordinate via LangGraph's StateGraph and helper agents (e.g., Researcher). A hybrid memory combines FAISS for semantic retrieval with SQLite for structured history. Incremental indexing uses file hashing to minimize re-embedding. A configuration-driven bootstrap enables tool/prompt/data-source customization. All decisions, tool use, and retrievals are logged and visualized through a Gradio interface for episode-level transparency.

Result: AISAC has been applied to multiple Argonne research areas, including waste-to-products research and energy process safety, illustrating cross-domain applicability and the ability to provide general-purpose scientific assistance with transparent reasoning traces.

Conclusion: AISAC demonstrates a modular, transparent, and configurable AI-assisted scientific workflow platform with provenance tracking and cross-domain adaptability, offering a solid foundation for broader adoption in complex scientific workflows and prompting further evaluation, optimization, and domain-specific deployments.

Abstract: AI Scientific Assistant Core (AISAC) is an integrated multi-agent system developed at Argonne National Laboratory for scientific and engineering workflows. AISAC builds on established technologies - LangGraph for orchestration, FAISS for vector search, and SQLite for persistence - and integrates them into a unified system prototype focused on transparency, provenance tracking, and scientific adaptability.
  The system implements a Router-Planner-Coordinator workflow and an optional Evaluator role, using prompt-engineered agents coordinated via LangGraph's StateGraph and supported by helper agents such as a Researcher. Each role is defined through custom system prompts that enforce structured JSON outputs. A hybrid memory approach (FAISS + SQLite) enables both semantic retrieval and structured conversation history. An incremental indexing strategy based on file hashing minimizes redundant re-embedding when scientific corpora evolve. A configuration-driven project bootstrap layer allows research teams to customize tools, prompts, and data sources without modifying core code.
  All agent decisions, tool invocations, and retrievals are logged and visualized through a custom Gradio interface, providing step-by-step transparency for each reasoning episode. The authors have applied AISAC to multiple research areas at Argonne, including specialized deployments for waste-to-products research and energy process safety, as well as general-purpose scientific assistance, demonstrating its cross-domain applicability.

### [264] [Making Evidence Actionable in Adaptive Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14052)
*Amirreza Mehrabi,Jason W. Morphew,Breejha Quezada,N. Sanjay Rebello*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: An instructor-governed feedback loop converts diagnosis into vetted micro-interventions via an optimization-based adaptive system with safeguards (adequacy, attention, diversity) and multiple solvers, achieving full skill coverage with equitable, load-aware personalization at classroom scale.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Adaptive systems diagnose learners precisely but often deliver mis-timed or misaligned interventions. The study argues for an instructor-augmented loop that vets micro-interventions against goal concepts and constraints to ensure timely, relevant support.

Method: Intervention assignment is formalized as a binary integer program with constraints for coverage, time, and difficulty windows informed by ability estimates; prerequisites are encoded in a concept matrix; diversity enforces anti-redundancy. Solver strategies include greedy (low richness, low latency), gradient-based relaxation (rich repositories), and a hybrid approach along a richness-latency frontier. Slack variables identify missing content for targeted curation. Evaluation includes simulation and an introductory physics deployment with 1,204 students.

Result: All learners achieved full skill coverage within bounded watch time. The gradient-based method reduced redundant coverage by ~12 percentage points versus greedy and improved difficulty alignment across slates; greedy matched adequacy at lower computational cost in scarce settings. Slack variables localized missing content and supported targeted curation, sustaining sufficiency across subgroups.

Conclusion: The work yields a tractable, auditable controller that closes the diagnostic–pedagogical loop and delivers equitable, load-aware personalization at classroom scale.

Abstract: Adaptive learning often diagnoses precisely yet intervenes weakly, yielding help that is mistimed or misaligned. This study presents evidence supporting an instructor-governed feedback loop that converts concept-level assessment evidence into vetted micro-interventions. The adaptive learning algorithm contains three safeguards: adequacy as a hard guarantee of gap closure, attention as a budgeted constraint for time and redundancy, and diversity as protection against overfitting to a single resource. We formalize intervention assignment as a binary integer program with constraints for coverage, time, difficulty windows informed by ability estimates, prerequisites encoded by a concept matrix, and anti-redundancy enforced through diversity. Greedy selection serves low-richness and tight-latency regimes, gradient-based relaxation serves rich repositories, and a hybrid method transitions along a richness-latency frontier. In simulation and in an introductory physics deployment with one thousand two hundred four students, both solvers achieved full skill coverage for essentially all learners within bounded watch time. The gradient-based method reduced redundant coverage by approximately twelve percentage points relative to greedy and harmonized difficulty across slates, while greedy delivered comparable adequacy with lower computational cost in scarce settings. Slack variables localized missing content and supported targeted curation, sustaining sufficiency across subgroups. The result is a tractable and auditable controller that closes the diagnostic-pedagogical loop and delivers equitable, load-aware personalization at classroom scale.

*Adit Jain,Vikram Krishnamurthy,Yiming Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A generative model combining mean-field dynamics and randomized utility to study how interacting LLMs collaboratively QA can propagate or mitigate hallucinations, with fixed-point analysis and experiments on 100 open-source LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and mitigate hallucination contagion in networks of LLMs engaged in collaborative QA, by blending mean-field network dynamics with economic-style decision priors.

Method: Model LLMs with a latent truthfulness state; use mean-field dynamics on a directed network to describe information diffusion; employ a randomized utility model to set transition probabilities; derive conditions for existence/uniqueness of fixed points; analyze fixed-point behavior under varying incentives; perform experiments on 100 open-source LLMs across semi-synthetic datasets, exploring data heterogeneity, node capability, network structure, and framing effects.

Result: Identifies sufficient conditions for fixed-point existence and uniqueness; characterizes how incentives affect the fixed point and the spread of truthful vs. non-truthful states; empirically shows how data heterogeneity, node capabilities, network topology, and framing influence collaboration outcomes and hallucination diffusion.

Conclusion: Provides a tractable analytical framework to study collaborative QA among LLMs, linking incentive design to truthfulness and diffusion of information; offers insights for mitigating hallucinations in LLM networks and guiding robust system design.

Abstract: In this paper, we model and analyze how a network of interacting LLMs performs collaborative question-answering (CQA) in order to estimate a ground truth given a distributed set of documents. This problem is interesting because LLMs often hallucinate when direct evidence to answer a question is lacking, and these effects become more pronounced in a network of interacting LLMs. The hallucination spreads, causing previously accurate LLMs to hallucinate. We study interacting LLMs and their hallucination by combining novel ideas of mean-field dynamics (MFD) from network science and the randomized utility model from economics to construct a useful generative model. We model the LLM with a latent state that indicates if it is truthful or not with respect to the ground truth, and extend a tractable analytical model considering an MFD to model the diffusion of information in a directed network of LLMs. To specify the probabilities that govern the dynamics of the MFD, we propose a randomized utility model. For a network of LLMs, where each LLM has two possible latent states, we posit sufficient conditions for the existence and uniqueness of a fixed point and analyze the behavior of the fixed point in terms of the incentive (e.g., test-time compute) given to individual LLMs. We experimentally study and analyze the behavior of a network of $100$ open-source LLMs with respect to data heterogeneity, node capability, network structure, and sensitivity to framing on multiple semi-synthetic datasets.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: APD-agents: an LLM-driven multi-agent framework for automated mobile page design that coordinates specialized agents to parse requirements, draft coarse layouts, retrieve examples, and recursively generate fine-grained components, achieving state-of-the-art on RICO.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Crafting mobile app page layouts is time-consuming for designers, requires extensive training on design tools, and faces collaboration bottlenecks for consistent styling. An automated, collaborative system could reduce design time and improve consistency.

Method: A multi-agent architecture with: OrchestratorAgent (coordinates tasks), SemanticParserAgent (translates user descriptions into structured data), PrimaryLayoutAgent (produces coarse page layouts), TemplateRetrievalAgent (fetches semantically relevant few-shot examples to guide layout), and RecursiveComponentAgent (generates fine-grained sub-elements recursively). The Orchestrator dynamically directs agents based on user descriptions. Evaluation on the RICO dataset shows state-of-the-art results.

Result: State-of-the-art performance on the RICO dataset for automated mobile page design, indicating effective automated layout generation and component recursion.

Conclusion: Demonstrates the viability of LLM-driven multi-agent systems for structured UI design tasks, potentially reducing design time, enabling scalable collaboration, and supporting future extensions to broader UI design domains.

Abstract: Layout design is a crucial step in developing mobile app pages. However, crafting satisfactory designs is time-intensive for designers: they need to consider which controls and content to present on the page, and then repeatedly adjust their size, position, and style for better aesthetics and structure. Although many design software can now help to perform these repetitive tasks, extensive training is needed to use them effectively. Moreover, collaborative design across app pages demands extra time to align standards and ensure consistent styling. In this work, we propose APD-agents, a large language model (LLM) driven multi-agent framework for automated page design in mobile applications. Our framework contains OrchestratorAgent, SemanticParserAgent, PrimaryLayoutAgent, TemplateRetrievalAgent, and RecursiveComponentAgent. Upon receiving the user's description of the page, the OrchestratorAgent can dynamically can direct other agents to accomplish users' design task. To be specific, the SemanticParserAgent is responsible for converting users' descriptions of page content into structured data. The PrimaryLayoutAgent can generate an initial coarse-grained layout of this page. The TemplateRetrievalAgent can fetch semantically relevant few-shot examples and enhance the quality of layout generation. Besides, a RecursiveComponentAgent can be used to decide how to recursively generate all the fine-grained sub-elements it contains for each element in the layout. Our work fully leverages the automatic collaboration capabilities of large-model-driven multi-agent systems. Experimental results on the RICO dataset show that our APD-agents achieve state-of-the-art performance.

TL;DR: PRISM is a training-free, prompts-and-ICL–driven multi-agent framework for financial information retrieval (FinAgentBench), achieving strong NDCG@5 and showing production viability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve extraction of task-relevant information from long financial filings by combining prompt engineering, ICL, and coordinated scoring.

Method: Develop PRISM: refine system prompts, apply in-context learning with few-shot examples, and deploy a lightweight multi-agent scoring system; analyze each component and their synergies; testing on FinAgentBench with NDCG@5 metric.

Result: Best configuration achieves NDCG@5 = 0.71818 on restricted validation; demonstrates feasibility and robustness for production-scale financial retrieval; modular, inference-only design; code released.

Conclusion: PRISM provides an effective, practical approach for financial information retrieval, leveraging prompt engineering, ICL, and multi-agent coordination; suitable for real-world deployment.

Abstract: With the rapid progress of large language models (LLMs), financial information retrieval has become a critical industrial application. Extracting task-relevant information from lengthy financial filings is essential for both operational and analytical decision-making. The FinAgentBench dataset formalizes this problem through two tasks: document ranking and chunk ranking. We present PRISM, a training-free framework that integrates refined system prompting, in-context learning (ICL), and a lightweight multi-agent system. Each component is examined extensively to reveal their synergies: prompt engineering provides precise task instructions, ICL supplies semantically relevant few-shot examples, and the multi-agent system models coordinated scoring behaviour. Our best configuration achieves an NDCG@5 of 0.71818 on the restricted validation split. We further demonstrate that PRISM is feasible and robust for production-scale financial retrieval. Its modular, inference-only design makes it practical for real-world use cases. The source code is released at https://bit.ly/prism-ailens.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: R3 is a dual-process VLN framework that combines a lightweight expert navigator with an LLM-based reasoning backbone, controlled by a regulator to switch thinking modes, achieving state-of-the-art gains on REVERIE.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs offer broad commonsense and reasoning but struggle with precise real-world spatial correlations in VLN, and bring high computation and latency costs. The work aims to bridge the gap to domain experts by jointly leveraging lightweight planning/navigation and LLM reasoning in a zero-shot setup.

Method: Three modules: Runner (a fast transformer-based expert for regular navigation), Ruminator (a multimodal LLM with chain-of-thought prompting for structured reasoning), and Regulator (monitors progress and toggles thinking modes to harmonize Runner and Ruminator). The system operates in a zero-shot manner, combining their strengths.

Result: Empirical results on the REVERIE benchmark show significant gains, with >3.28% improvement in SPL and >3.30% in RGSPL over state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The dual-process R3 framework effectively combines LLM-based reasoning with task-specific expertise, achieving notable performance boosts in VLN tasks while addressing latency concerns through mode switching.

Abstract: Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) requires an agent to dynamically explore complex 3D environments following human instructions. Recent research underscores the potential of harnessing large language models (LLMs) for VLN, given their commonsense knowledge and general reasoning capabilities. Despite their strengths, a substantial gap in task completion performance persists between LLM-based approaches and domain experts, as LLMs inherently struggle to comprehend real-world spatial correlations precisely. Additionally, introducing LLMs is accompanied with substantial computational cost and inference latency. To address these issues, we propose a novel dual-process thinking framework dubbed R3, integrating LLMs' generalization capabilities with VLN-specific expertise in a zero-shot manner. The framework comprises three core modules: Runner, Ruminator, and Regulator. The Runner is a lightweight transformer-based expert model that ensures efficient and accurate navigation under regular circumstances. The Ruminator employs a powerful multimodal LLM as the backbone and adopts chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting to elicit structured reasoning. The Regulator monitors the navigation progress and controls the appropriate thinking mode according to three criteria, integrating Runner and Ruminator harmoniously. Experimental results illustrate that R3 significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art methods, exceeding 3.28% and 3.30% in SPL and RGSPL respectively on the REVERIE benchmark. This pronounced enhancement highlights the effectiveness of our method in handling challenging VLN tasks.

### [269] [Beyond Accuracy: A Multi-Dimensional Framework for Evaluating Enterprise Agentic AI Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14136)
*Sushant Mehta*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Current agentic AI benchmarks focus on task accuracy and neglect enterprise needs like cost, reliability, and security. The paper identifies three limitations, proposes the CLEAR framework (Cost, Latency, Efficacy, Assurance, Reliability), and shows cost-aware evaluation yields better production outcomes and predicts success better than accuracy alone.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enterprises require cost control, reliability, latency, policy compliance, and assurance for deployment; existing benchmarks fail to capture these concerns.

Method: Systematic analysis of 12 benchmarks; empirical evaluation of six leading agents on 300 enterprise tasks; expert evaluation (N=15).

Result: Cost-aware evaluation reveals up to 50x cost variation for similar precision; reliability drops from 60% in a single run to 25% in 8-run consistency; cost-aware optimization yields 4.4-10.8x cheaper than accuracy-focused with similar performance; CLEAR correlates with production success ρ=0.83 versus ρ=0.41 for accuracy.

Conclusion: CLEAR provides a holistic enterprise-oriented evaluation framework that better predicts production success and enables cost-efficient, reliable agent deployment; optimizing for accuracy alone is insufficient.

Abstract: Current agentic AI benchmarks predominantly evaluate task completion accuracy, while overlooking critical enterprise requirements such as cost-efficiency, reliability, and operational stability. Through systematic analysis of 12 main benchmarks and empirical evaluation of state-of-the-art agents, we identify three fundamental limitations: (1) absence of cost-controlled evaluation leading to 50x cost variations for similar precision, (2) inadequate reliability assessment where agent performance drops from 60\% (single run) to 25\% (8-run consistency), and (3) missing multidimensional metrics for security, latency, and policy compliance. We propose \textbf{CLEAR} (Cost, Latency, Efficacy, Assurance, Reliability), a holistic evaluation framework specifically designed for enterprise deployment. Evaluation of six leading agents on 300 enterprise tasks demonstrates that optimizing for accuracy alone yields agents 4.4-10.8x more expensive than cost-aware alternatives with comparable performance. Expert evaluation (N=15) confirms that CLEAR better predicts production success (correlation $ρ=0.83$) compared to accuracy-only evaluation ($ρ=0.41$).

Result: Compared to state-of-the-art heterogeneous FL methods, average F1 score improves by ~13%. Compared to existing LLM-FL frameworks, increasing the number of participating clients yields up to ~5% higher average F1, while training costs drop by ~87%.

Conclusion: HFL-FlowLLM demonstrates the potential and practical value of applying LLMs to network traffic flow classification in heterogeneous FL, offering improved performance, robustness, and cost efficiency for modern network security.

Abstract: In modern communication networks driven by 5G and the Internet of Things (IoT), effective network traffic flow classification is crucial for Quality of Service (QoS) management and security. Traditional centralized machine learning struggles with the distributed data and privacy concerns in these heterogeneous environments, while existing federated learning approaches suffer from high costs and poor generalization. To address these challenges, we propose HFL-FlowLLM, which to our knowledge is the first framework to apply large language models to network traffic flow classification in heterogeneous federated learning. Compared to state-of-the-art heterogeneous federated learning methods for network traffic flow classification, the proposed approach improves the average F1 score by approximately 13%, demonstrating compelling performance and strong robustness. When compared to existing large language models federated learning frameworks, as the number of clients participating in each training round increases, the proposed method achieves up to a 5% improvement in average F1 score while reducing the training costs by about 87%. These findings prove the potential and practical value of HFL-FlowLLM in modern communication networks security.

### [271] [Do Large Language Models (LLMs) Understand Chronology?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14214)
*Pattaraphon Kenny Wongchamcharoen,Paul Glasserman*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs struggle with maintaining a single global chronological timeline as sequences grow, but explicit reasoning budgets (Extended Thinking) and mid/high effort in GPT-5/Claude-3.7 Sonnet substantially improve ordering and conditional sorting; anachronism detection is easier but still challenged by overlapping timelines. Implication: cautious use of LLMs for real-time finance requires budgeting reasoning steps and awareness of limits on global chronology.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess whether modern LLMs can understand and apply chronology in finance/economics prompts, addressing look-ahead bias by testing ordered/filtered and anachronism tasks across several models and reasoning settings.

Method: A series of chronological tasks with increasing complexity: (1) chronological ordering, (2) conditional sorting (filter then order), (3) anachronism detection. Models evaluated: GPT-4.1, Claude-3.7 Sonnet, and GPT-5, with and without Extended Thinking (ET), across varying reasoning-effort settings. Metrics include exact match and rank correlation, across multiple sequence lengths. Focus on how performance degrades with length and where reasoning helps.

Result: Exact match drops sharply with longer sequences, while rank correlations stay relatively high; local order is preserved but global timeline becomes inconsistent. In conditional sorting, failures mainly in the filtering step; GPT-5 and Claude-3.7 Sonnet with Extended Thinking dramatically outperform normal models. Anachronism detection is easiest but worsens with overlapping timelines/entities. With medium/high reasoning effort, GPT-5 achieves near-perfect ordering at all lengths and perfect conditional sorting; low/minimal effort degrades with longer lists, aligning with earlier models.

Conclusion: Explicit reasoning budgets significantly improve chronological tasks; current LLMs have clear limits in maintaining global chronology, but targeted prompting (Extended Thinking) can unlock near-perfect performance for complex tasks in finance-relevant settings. The work informs task design and risk of look-ahead bias in real-time LLM applications; code/evaluation templates are released for reproducibility.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in finance and economics, where prompt-based attempts against look-ahead bias implicitly assume that models understand chronology. We test this fundamental question with a series of chronological ordering tasks with increasing complexities over facts the model already knows from pre-training. Our tasks cover (1) chronological ordering, (2) conditional sorting (filter, then order), and (3) anachronism detection. We evaluate GPT-4.1, Claude-3.7 Sonnet, with and without Extended Thinking (ET), and GPT-5 across multiple reasoning-effort settings. Across models, Exact match rate drops sharply as sequences lengthen even while rank correlations stay high as LLMs largely preserve local order but struggle to maintain a single globally consistent timeline. In conditional sorting, most failures stem from the filtering step rather than the ordering step, but GPT-5 and Claude-3.7 Sonnet with Extended Thinking outshine normal models significantly. Lastly, anachronism detection is found to be the easiest task for the LLMs but performance still declines with increasingly overlapping timelines or entities. Overall, our main contribution is showing that allocating explicit reasoning budget helps with chronological ordering with GPT-5 at medium/high reasoning effort achieving flawless ordering at all lengths and perfect conditional sorting (both self-filtered and given-subset), whereas low/minimal effort degrades with longer lists, mirroring earlier models. Our findings delineate limits of current LLMs on chronological tasks, providing insights into task complexity, and demonstrate scenarios in which reasoning helps. These patterns are important for the real-time application of LLMs in finance. We release all code and evaluation templates to support full reproducibility.

*Kumud Tripathi,Aditya Srinivas Menon,Aman Gaurav,Raj Prakash Gohil,Pankaj Wasnik*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Two-stage approach improves Whisper-style ASR under noisy conditions by enhancing encoder robustness with Adaptive Layer Attention (ALA) and suppressing hallucinations via multi-objective knowledge distillation (KD), yielding lower hallucinations and WER while maintaining clean-speech performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Whisper's open-source ASR is strong but prone to hallucinations in noisy environments; prior remedies focused on preprocessing or post-editing, not on modifying the model's internal representations.

Method: Stage 1: Adaptive Layer Attention (ALA) groups encoder layers into semantically coherent blocks using inter-layer correlation; a learnable multi-head attention module fuses block representations to leverage both low- and high-level features. Stage 2: Multi-objective knowledge distillation trains a student model on noisy audio to align its semantic and attention distributions with a teacher model that processes clean inputs.

Result: On noisy speech benchmarks, there are notable reductions in hallucinations and word error rate, while preserving performance on clean speech.

Conclusion: ALA and KD provide a principled framework to improve Whisper's reliability in real-world noisy conditions.

Abstract: The Whisper model, an open-source automatic speech recognition system, is widely adopted for its strong performance across multilingual and zero-shot settings. However, it frequently suffers from hallucination errors, especially under noisy acoustic conditions. Previous works to reduce hallucinations in Whisper-style ASR systems have primarily focused on audio preprocessing or post-processing of transcriptions to filter out erroneous content. However, modifications to the Whisper model itself remain largely unexplored to mitigate hallucinations directly. To address this challenge, we present a two-stage architecture that first enhances encoder robustness through Adaptive Layer Attention (ALA) and further suppresses hallucinations using a multi-objective knowledge distillation (KD) framework. In the first stage, ALA groups encoder layers into semantically coherent blocks via inter-layer correlation analysis. A learnable multi-head attention module then fuses these block representations, enabling the model to jointly exploit low- and high-level features for more robust encoding. In the second stage, our KD framework trains the student model on noisy audio to align its semantic and attention distributions with a teacher model processing clean inputs. Our experiments on noisy speech benchmarks show notable reductions in hallucinations and word error rates, while preserving performance on clean speech. Together, ALA and KD offer a principled strategy to improve Whisper's reliability under real-world noisy conditions.

*Yuxiang Wang,Siwen Wang,Haowei Han,Ao Wang,Boya Liu,Yong Zhao,Chengbo Wu,Bin Zhu,Bin Qin,Xiaokai Zhou,Xiao Yan,Jiawei Jiang,Bo Du*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DevPiolt is an LLM-based IoT operation recommender that infuses domain knowledge via continual pre-training and multi-task fine-tuning, then aligns with user preferences using direct preference optimization and mitigates poor suggestions via a confidence-based exposure control. It achieves large gains (69.5% overall) and shows strong production results (255k users, +21.6% coverage, +29.1% acceptance).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing IoT operation recommenders struggle with complex operation logic, heterogeneous user preferences, and sensitivity to suboptimal suggestions, which hurts user satisfaction and profits. There is a need for a domain-tailored, preference-aligned, and safe recommendation system for IoT device operations.

Method: 1) Continual pre-training and multi-task fine-tuning to imbue the LLM with fundamental IoT operation domain knowledge. 2) Direct preference optimization to align the fine-tuned LLM with specific user preferences. 3) Confidence-based exposure control to avoid low-quality recommendations and protect user experience.

Result: DevPiolt significantly outperforms baselines on all datasets with an average improvement of 69.5% across metrics. In real deployment (Xiaomi Home app), 255,000 users received daily operation recommendations; online metrics show +21.6% unique visitor device coverage and +29.1% page view acceptance rate.

Conclusion: The approach demonstrates strong effectiveness, practicality, and scalability of LLM-based IoT operation recommendation in production, suggesting a viable path for domain-specific, preference-aware, and safe recommendations in IoT ecosystems. Future work could explore long-term user satisfaction, robustness, and applicability to other IoT domains.

Abstract: Operation recommendation for IoT devices refers to generating personalized device operations for users based on their context, such as historical operations, environment information, and device status. This task is crucial for enhancing user satisfaction and corporate profits. Existing recommendation models struggle with complex operation logic, diverse user preferences, and sensitive to suboptimal suggestions, limiting their applicability to IoT device operations. To address these issues, we propose DevPiolt, a LLM-based recommendation model for IoT device operations. Specifically, we first equip the LLM with fundamental domain knowledge of IoT operations via continual pre-training and multi-task fine-tuning. Then, we employ direct preference optimization to align the fine-tuned LLM with specific user preferences. Finally, we design a confidence-based exposure control mechanism to avoid negative user experiences from low-quality recommendations. Extensive experiments show that DevPiolt significantly outperforms baselines on all datasets, with an average improvement of 69.5% across all metrics. DevPiolt has been practically deployed in Xiaomi Home app for one quarter, providing daily operation recommendations to 255,000 users. Online experiment results indicate a 21.6% increase in unique visitor device coverage and a 29.1% increase in page view acceptance rates.

### [274] [Enhancing Regional Airbnb Trend Forecasting Using LLM-Based Embeddings of Accessibility and Human Mobility](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14248)
*Hongju Lee,Youngjun Park,Jisun An,Dongman Lee*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A regional Airbnb forecasting framework using LLM-generated embeddings fed into RNN/LSTM/Transformer, achieving ~48% error reduction for Seoul data across Revenue, Reservation Days, and Number of Reservations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Global expansion of short-term rentals disrupts housing markets; accurate regional forecasts are needed for policy and urban planning to mitigate affordability impacts. Prior work focuses on individual listings; there is a gap for regional, multi-indicator forecasting with external context.

Method: Use a sliding-window time-series approach to predict Revenue, Reservation Days, and Number of Reservations 1–3 months ahead. Build regional representations by merging listing features with external context (urban accessibility, human mobility). Convert structured data into prompt-based inputs for a Large Language Model to generate regional embeddings, then feed these embeddings into RNN/LSTM/Transformer models to capture complex spatio-temporal dynamics.

Result: On Seoul's Airbnb dataset, the method reduces average RMSE and MAE by about 48% compared with conventional baselines (statistical and ML models).

Conclusion: The framework improves forecasting accuracy and yields practical insights for identifying oversupplied regions and informing data-driven urban policy decisions; the approach is adaptable to other regions and forecasting horizons.

Abstract: The expansion of short-term rental platforms, such as Airbnb, has significantly disrupted local housing markets, often leading to increased rental prices and housing affordability issues. Accurately forecasting regional Airbnb market trends can thus offer critical insights for policymakers and urban planners aiming to mitigate these impacts. This study proposes a novel time-series forecasting framework to predict three key Airbnb indicators -- Revenue, Reservation Days, and Number of Reservations -- at the regional level. Using a sliding-window approach, the model forecasts trends 1 to 3 months ahead. Unlike prior studies that focus on individual listings at fixed time points, our approach constructs regional representations by integrating listing features with external contextual factors such as urban accessibility and human mobility. We convert structured tabular data into prompt-based inputs for a Large Language Model (LLM), producing comprehensive regional embeddings. These embeddings are then fed into advanced time-series models (RNN, LSTM, Transformer) to better capture complex spatio-temporal dynamics. Experiments on Seoul's Airbnb dataset show that our method reduces both average RMSE and MAE by approximately 48% compared to conventional baselines, including traditional statistical and machine learning models. Our framework not only improves forecasting accuracy but also offers practical insights for detecting oversupplied regions and supporting data-driven urban policy decisions.

*Yu Liu,Xixun Lin,Yanmin Shang,Yangxi Li,Shi Wang,Yanan Cao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PathMind enhances LLM-based knowledge graph reasoning by selectively guiding the model with important reasoning paths, improving accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address noise from indiscriminately extracted reasoning paths and to reduce retrieval/LLM call costs while maintaining reasoning quality.

Method: Retrieve a subgraph; apply a semantic-aware path priority function that weighs accumulative cost and estimated future cost to reach the target; produce outputs via a dual-phase training: task-specific instruction tuning and path-wise preference alignment.

Result: Empirical results on benchmark datasets show PathMind outperforms competitive baselines, especially on complex tasks with fewer input tokens, by identifying essential reasoning paths.

Conclusion: Selective path-guided reasoning yields faithful, interpretable, and more efficient KGR with LLMs; demonstrates the value of prioritizing reasoning paths in LLM-guided knowledge graph reasoning.

Abstract: Knowledge graph reasoning (KGR) is the task of inferring new knowledge by performing logical deductions on knowledge graphs. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in complex reasoning tasks. Despite promising success, current LLM-based KGR methods still face two critical limitations. First, existing methods often extract reasoning paths indiscriminately, without assessing their different importance, which may introduce irrelevant noise that misleads LLMs. Second, while many methods leverage LLMs to dynamically explore potential reasoning paths, they require high retrieval demands and frequent LLM calls. To address these limitations, we propose PathMind, a novel framework designed to enhance faithful and interpretable reasoning by selectively guiding LLMs with important reasoning paths. Specifically, PathMind follows a "Retrieve-Prioritize-Reason" paradigm. First, it retrieves a query subgraph from KG through the retrieval module. Next, it introduces a path prioritization mechanism that identifies important reasoning paths using a semantic-aware path priority function, which simultaneously considers the accumulative cost and the estimated future cost for reaching the target. Finally, PathMind generates accurate and logically consistent responses via a dual-phase training strategy, including task-specific instruction tuning and path-wise preference alignment. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that PathMind consistently outperforms competitive baselines, particularly on complex reasoning tasks with fewer input tokens, by identifying essential reasoning paths.

*Xiaochuan Liu,Yuanfeng Song,Xiaoming Yin,Xing Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DataSage is a multi-agent, LLM-based framework for automated data insight discovery that uses external knowledge retrieval, multi-role debate, and multi-path reasoning to improve analytical depth and code accuracy, outperforming baselines on InsightBench.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In the data-driven era, fully automated end-to-end analytics is essential; existing data insight agents struggle due to underutilized domain knowledge, shallow analysis, and error-prone code generation; DataSage aims to address these gaps.

Method: DataSage introduces three features: (1) external knowledge retrieval to enrich analytical context; (2) a multi-role debating mechanism to simulate diverse analytical viewpoints and deepen analysis; (3) multi-path reasoning to enhance code and insight generation accuracy.

Result: Extensive experiments on InsightBench show DataSage consistently outperforms existing data insight agents across all difficulty levels.

Conclusion: DataSage offers an effective solution for automated data insight discovery, addressing core limitations and demonstrating strong performance; the approach shows promise for broader adoption in automated analytics.

Abstract: In today's data-driven era, fully automated end-to-end data analytics, particularly insight discovery, is critical for discovering actionable insights that assist organizations in making effective decisions. With the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs), LLM-driven agents have emerged as a promising paradigm for automating data analysis and insight discovery. However, existing data insight agents remain limited in several key aspects, often failing to deliver satisfactory results due to: (1) insufficient utilization of domain knowledge, (2) shallow analytical depth, and (3) error-prone code generation during insight generation. To address these issues, we propose DataSage, a novel multi-agent framework that incorporates three innovative features including external knowledge retrieval to enrich the analytical context, a multi-role debating mechanism to simulate diverse analytical perspectives and deepen analytical depth, and multi-path reasoning to improve the accuracy of the generated code and insights. Extensive experiments on InsightBench demonstrate that DataSage consistently outperforms existing data insight agents across all difficulty levels, offering an effective solution for automated data insight discovery.

### [277] [When Words Change the Model: Sensitivity of LLMs for Constraint Programming Modelling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14334)
*Alessio Pellegrino,Jacopo Mauro*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs can generate CP models from natural language but their performance is fragile to rewording; data contamination likely inflates apparent capability; robust evaluation is needed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Assess whether LLMs truly reason about constraint programming problems or mainly memorize data from training; test robustness to contextual and linguistic variation to avoid data leakage confounds.

Method: Rephrase and perturb CSPLib problems to preserve structure while changing context and adding misleading elements; compare three representative LLMs on original vs modified descriptions; perform qualitative analysis of generated models.

Result: LLMs produce syntactically valid and semantically plausible models, but performance drops sharply with contextual/linguistic variation, indicating shallow understanding and sensitivity to wording.

Conclusion: Claims that LLMs can reliably translate natural language to executable CP models may be overstated; data contamination likely contributes to success; robust, variation-aware evaluation is needed, and models show limited true compositional understanding.

Abstract: One of the long-standing goals in optimisation and constraint programming is to describe a problem in natural language and automatically obtain an executable, efficient model. Large language models appear to bring this vision closer, showing impressive results in automatically generating models for classical benchmarks. However, much of this apparent success may derive from data contamination rather than genuine reasoning: many standard CP problems are likely included in the training data of these models. To examine this hypothesis, we systematically rephrased and perturbed a set of well-known CSPLib problems to preserve their structure while modifying their context and introducing misleading elements. We then compared the models produced by three representative LLMs across original and modified descriptions. Our qualitative analysis shows that while LLMs can produce syntactically valid and semantically plausible models, their performance drops sharply under contextual and linguistic variation, revealing shallow understanding and sensitivity to wording.

### [278] [Operationalizing Pluralistic Values in Large Language Model Alignment Reveals Trade-offs in Safety, Inclusivity, and Model Behavior](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14476)
*Dalia Ali,Dora Zhao,Allison Koenecke,Orestis Papakyriakopoulos*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Pluralistic value alignment shifts LLM behavior: demographic differences affect toxicity and emotional awareness; group-specific fine-tuning and design choices (disagreement handling, rating scale, optimization) significantly influence safety and fairness trade-offs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap where alignment methods assume homogeneous human values, this work investigates how demographic diversity and design choices shape LLM alignment outcomes.

Method: Participants from the US and Germany (N=1,095; 27,375 ratings) rated LLM responses on five dimensions (Toxicity, Emotional Awareness, Sensitivity, Stereotypical Bias, Helpfulness). The study fine-tuned multiple LLMs/LLMs with preferences from different social groups, varying rating scales, disagreement handling methods, and optimization techniques (e.g., DPO vs GRPO).

Result: Demographic effects emerged: male raters judged toxicity 18% lower; conservative and Black raters rated emotional awareness 27.9% and 44% higher than liberal and White raters, respectively. Group-specific fine-tuning produced distinct model behaviors. Design choices mattered: preserving rater disagreement yielded ~53% greater toxicity reduction than majority voting; 5-point scales yielded ~22% more reduction than binary; DPO outperformed GRPO in multi-value optimization.

Conclusion: The work pioneers balancing expert-driven and user-driven signals to achieve safety and fair representation in alignment, highlighting the importance of including social diversity and design choices in the alignment pipeline.

Abstract: Although large language models (LLMs) are increasingly trained using human feedback for safety and alignment with human values, alignment decisions often overlook human social diversity. This study examines how incorporating pluralistic values affects LLM behavior by systematically evaluating demographic variation and design parameters in the alignment pipeline. We collected alignment data from US and German participants (N = 1,095, 27,375 ratings) who rated LLM responses across five dimensions: Toxicity, Emotional Awareness (EA), Sensitivity, Stereotypical Bias, and Helpfulness. We fine-tuned multiple Large Language Models and Large Reasoning Models using preferences from different social groups while varying rating scales, disagreement handling methods, and optimization techniques. The results revealed systematic demographic effects: male participants rated responses 18% less toxic than female participants; conservative and Black participants rated responses 27.9% and 44% more emotionally aware than liberal and White participants, respectively. Models fine-tuned on group-specific preferences exhibited distinct behaviors. Technical design choices showed strong effects: the preservation of rater disagreement achieved roughly 53% greater toxicity reduction than majority voting, and 5-point scales yielded about 22% more reduction than binary formats; and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) consistently outperformed Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) in multi-value optimization. These findings represent a preliminary step in answering a critical question: How should alignment balance expert-driven and user-driven signals to ensure both safety and fair representation?

*Jiahao Wu,Shengwen Yu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Neuro-symbolic AI that propagates perception uncertainty into planning via a transformer front-end, GNN reasoning, and an uncertainty-aware planner, achieving strong tabletop manipulation results and theoretical guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bridge continuous perceptual signals and discrete symbolic reasoning under uncertainty, providing principled uncertainty propagation to planning to improve robustness and efficiency.

Method: A three-part pipeline: (1) a transformer-based perceptual front-end converts visual observations into probabilistic symbolic states; (2) a graph neural network performs relational reasoning to extract structured symbolic predicates with confidences; (3) an uncertainty-aware symbolic planner that actively gathers information when confidence is low. The system is validated on 10,047 PyBullet-scene images with 3–10 objects, outputting calibrated probabilistic predicates and planning within 15 ms.

Result: For the robotic-assembly domain, the approach yields probabilistic predicates with calibrated confidences (overall F1=0.68). When used to guide planning, it achieves 94%/90%/88% success on Simple Stack, Deep Stack, and Clear+Stack benchmarks (average 90.7%), outperforming the strongest POMDP baseline by 10–14 points and planning speed remains within 15 ms. A probabilistic graphical-model analysis links calibrated uncertainty to planning convergence and provides validated theoretical guarantees.

Conclusion: The framework is general-purpose and extensible to domains needing uncertainty-aware perception-to-planning reasoning. It demonstrates calibrated uncertainty can improve planning convergence and offers theoretical guarantees that align with empirical results.

Abstract: Bridging continuous perceptual signals and discrete symbolic reasoning is a fundamental challenge in AI systems that must operate under uncertainty. We present a neuro-symbolic framework that explicitly models and propagates uncertainty from perception to planning, providing a principled connection between these two abstraction levels. Our approach couples a transformer-based perceptual front-end with graph neural network (GNN) relational reasoning to extract probabilistic symbolic states from visual observations, and an uncertainty-aware symbolic planner that actively gathers information when confidence is low. We demonstrate the framework's effectiveness on tabletop robotic manipulation as a concrete application: the translator processes 10,047 PyBullet-generated scenes (3--10 objects) and outputs probabilistic predicates with calibrated confidences (overall F1=0.68). When embedded in the planner, the system achieves 94\%/90\%/88\% success on Simple Stack, Deep Stack, and Clear+Stack benchmarks (90.7\% average), exceeding the strongest POMDP baseline by 10--14 points while planning within 15\,ms. A probabilistic graphical-model analysis establishes a quantitative link between calibrated uncertainty and planning convergence, providing theoretical guarantees that are validated empirically. The framework is general-purpose and can be applied to any domain requiring uncertainty-aware reasoning from perceptual input to symbolic planning.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A rate-distortion guided framework to construct and refine knowledge graphs from lecture content using FGW alignments, yielding compact, informative KGs that generate higher-quality MCQs than raw notes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Converting unstructured lecture materials into pedagogically useful KGs is hard; there is a need for principled, information-theoretic methods to balance compactness with information preservation for AI-assisted education.

Method: Model lecture content as a metric-measure space; align candidate KGs with lecture content via Fused Gromov-Wasserstein (FGW) couplings to quantify semantic distortion; define a rate term as KG size; apply refinement operators (add, merge, split, remove, rewire) to minimize the rate-distortion Lagrangian, yielding refined KGs.

Result: Prototype applied to data science lectures yields interpretable RD curves; MCQs generated from refined KGs outperform those from raw notes across fifteen quality criteria.

Conclusion: Establishes a principled information-theoretic foundation for KG optimization in personalized and AI-assisted education, demonstrating improved content extraction and question generation.

Abstract: Task-oriented knowledge graphs (KGs) enable AI-powered learning assistant systems to automatically generate high-quality multiple-choice questions (MCQs). Yet converting unstructured educational materials, such as lecture notes and slides, into KGs that capture key pedagogical content remains difficult. We propose a framework for knowledge graph construction and refinement grounded in rate-distortion (RD) theory and optimal transport geometry. In the framework, lecture content is modeled as a metric-measure space, capturing semantic and relational structure, while candidate KGs are aligned using Fused Gromov-Wasserstein (FGW) couplings to quantify semantic distortion. The rate term, expressed via the size of KG, reflects complexity and compactness. Refinement operators (add, merge, split, remove, rewire) minimize the rate-distortion Lagrangian, yielding compact, information-preserving KGs. Our prototype applied to data science lectures yields interpretable RD curves and shows that MCQs generated from refined KGs consistently surpass those from raw notes on fifteen quality criteria. This study establishes a principled foundation for information-theoretic KG optimization in personalized and AI-assisted education.

### [281] [AutoTool: Efficient Tool Selection for Large Language Model Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14650)
*Jingyi Jia,Qinbin Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AutoTool: a graph-based framework that reduces LLM inference cost for tool selection by modeling tool usage inertia with a directed graph trained on historical trajectories, guiding tool choice and inputs with minimal LLM queries, achieving up to 30% cost savings while keeping competitive task completion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current agent frameworks like ReAct incur high inference costs due to repeated LLM calls for tool selection. There is a need to exploit predictable patterns in tool usage to improve efficiency without sacrificing performance.

Method: Construct a directed graph where nodes are tools and edges capture transition probabilities from historical agent trajectories; integrate parameter-level information to refine tool input generation; traverse the graph to select tools and their parameters with minimal LLM inference, effectively bypassing repeated LLM invocations.

Result: Empirical studies show up to 30% reduction in inference cost with competitive task completion rates across diverse agent tasks.

Conclusion: Leveraging the statistical structure of tool usage (inertia) offers a practical and scalable path to more efficient LLM agents without compromising performance.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents have emerged as powerful tools for automating complex tasks by leveraging the reasoning and decision-making abilities of LLMs. However, a major bottleneck in current agent frameworks lies in the high inference cost of tool selection, especially in approaches like ReAct that repeatedly invoke the LLM to determine which tool to use at each step. In this work, we propose AutoTool, a novel graph-based framework that bypasses repeated LLM inference by exploiting a key empirical observation: tool usage inertia - the tendency of tool invocations to follow predictable sequential patterns. AutoTool constructs a directed graph from historical agent trajectories, where nodes represent tools and edges capture transition probabilities, effectively modeling the inertia in tool selection. It further integrates parameter-level information to refine tool input generation. By traversing this structured representation, AutoTool efficiently selects tools and their parameters with minimal reliance on LLM inference. Extensive experiments across diverse agent tasks demonstrate that AutoTool reduces inference costs by up to 30% while maintaining competitive task completion rates, offering a practical and scalable enhancement for inference-heavy frameworks. Our work highlights the promise of integrating statistical structure into LLM agent design for greater efficiency without sacrificing performance.

*Ruomeng Ding,Wei Cheng,Minglai Shao,Chen Zhao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SkillGen is a skill-based in-context learning framework for structured sequential reasoning that builds an action-centric graph and uses temporal-difference credit assignment to retrieve step-wise skills, enabling fine-grained, context-aware prompts; it yields 5.9–16.5% progress-rate gains across ALFWorld, BabyAI, and ScienceWorld with both open-source and proprietary LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prompt quality heavily influences performance in in-context learning for sequential decision tasks, but three core principles (focus on decision-critical info, step-level granularity, and label-efficient prompts) are hard to satisfy simultaneously; existing methods underperform across these criteria.

Method: Construct an action-centric, domain-level graph from sampled trajectories; identify high-utility actions via temporal-difference credit assignment; retrieve and assemble step-wise skills to generate fine-grained, context-aware prompts; provide theoretical analysis showing improved task identifiability and prompt effectiveness.

Result: SkillGen yields consistent gains across models and environments, with progress rates rising by 5.9% to 16.5% on average; experiments on ALFWorld, BabyAI, and ScienceWorld using both open-source and proprietary LLMs.

Conclusion: A skill-based ICL framework that aligns prompts with decision-critical segments and step-level reasoning can improve structured sequential reasoning, offering label-efficient and more effective prompt design for LLMs in sequential tasks.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to sequential decision-making through in-context learning (ICL), yet their effectiveness is highly sensitive to prompt quality. Effective prompts should meet three principles: focus on decision-critical information, provide step-level granularity, and minimize reliance on expert annotations through label efficiency. However, existing ICL methods often fail to satisfy all three criteria simultaneously. Motivated by these challenges, we introduce SkillGen, a skill-based ICL framework for structured sequential reasoning. It constructs an action-centric, domain-level graph from sampled trajectories, identifies high-utility actions via temporal-difference credit assignment, and retrieves step-wise skills to generate fine-grained, context-aware prompts. We further present a theoretical analysis showing that focusing on high-utility segments supports task identifiability and informs more effective ICL prompt design. Experiments on ALFWorld, BabyAI, and ScienceWorld, using both open-source and proprietary LLMs, show that SkillGen achieves consistent gains, improving progress rate by 5.9%-16.5% on average across models.

Motivation: Post-outage power distribution restoration involves nonlinear constraints (power balance, voltage, thermal limits) and structural heterogeneity across microgrids, making traditional optimization and standard RL inefficient and hard to scale.

Method: Use a heterogeneous-agent RL framework instantiated as HAPPO. Decentralized actors control distinct microgrids with different loads/DER capacities/switch counts; centralized critic to compute advantage. Physics-informed OpenDSS environment provides full power-flow feedback and differentiable penalties for constraints (no hard action masking). DER generation capped at 2400 kW; each microgrid must meet local supply-demand feasibility. Evaluated on IEEE 123-bus and IEEE 8500-node systems; compared against DQN, PPO, MAES, MAGDPG, MADQN, Mean-Field RL, QMIX.

Result: HAPPO achieves faster convergence, higher restored power, and smoother multi-seed training than the listed baselines.

Conclusion: Incorporating microgrid-level heterogeneity within HARL delivers a scalable, stable, and constraint-aware solution for complex PDS restoration.

Abstract: Restoring power distribution systems (PDS) after large-scale outages requires sequential switching operations that reconfigure feeder topology and coordinate distributed energy resources (DERs) under nonlinear constraints such as power balance, voltage limits, and thermal ratings. These challenges make conventional optimization and value-based RL approaches computationally inefficient and difficult to scale. This paper applies a Heterogeneous-Agent Reinforcement Learning (HARL) framework, instantiated through Heterogeneous-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization (HAPPO), to enable coordinated restoration across interconnected microgrids. Each agent controls a distinct microgrid with different loads, DER capacities, and switch counts, introducing practical structural heterogeneity. Decentralized actor policies are trained with a centralized critic to compute advantage values for stable on-policy updates. A physics-informed OpenDSS environment provides full power flow feedback and enforces operational limits via differentiable penalty signals rather than invalid action masking. The total DER generation is capped at 2400 kW, and each microgrid must satisfy local supply-demand feasibility. Experiments on the IEEE 123-bus and IEEE 8500-node systems show that HAPPO achieves faster convergence, higher restored power, and smoother multi-seed training than DQN, PPO, MAES, MAGDPG, MADQN, Mean-Field RL, and QMIX. Results demonstrate that incorporating microgrid-level heterogeneity within the HARL framework yields a scalable, stable, and constraint-aware solution for complex PDS restoration.
