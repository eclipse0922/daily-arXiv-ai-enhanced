### [1] [Preventing Shortcuts in Adapter Training via Providing the Shortcuts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20887)
*Anujraaj Argo Goyal,Guocheng Gordon Qian,Huseyin Coskun,Aarush Gupta,Himmy Tam,Daniil Ostashev,Ju Hu,Dhritiman Sagar,Sergey Tulyakov,Kfir Aberman,Kuan-Chieh Jackson Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Shortcut-Rerouted Adapter Training: route confounding factors through auxiliary modules during training so the main adapter avoids learning them, then remove the auxiliaries at inference. This yields better identity injection with less entanglement and better prompt adherence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Adapters trained for single-image reconstruction tend to entangle the target attribute (e.g., identity) with incidental factors like pose, expression, and lighting, hurting generalization and alignment with text prompts.

Method: During training, route confounding factors through auxiliary modules (e.g., ControlNet or LoRA) so the adapter is not incentivized to learn them; at inference, remove these auxiliaries to keep the target attribute controlled by the input prompt.

Result: For facial and full-body identity injection, improves generation quality, diversity, and adherence to the text prompt.

Conclusion: A general principle for disentangled representations in large-model regimes: provide shortcuts for what should not be learned, rather than forcing the model to untangle everything internally.

Abstract: Adapter-based training has emerged as a key mechanism for extending the
capabilities of powerful foundation image generators, enabling personalized and
stylized text-to-image synthesis. These adapters are typically trained to
capture a specific target attribute, such as subject identity, using
single-image reconstruction objectives. However, because the input image
inevitably contains a mixture of visual factors, adapters are prone to entangle
the target attribute with incidental ones, such as pose, expression, and
lighting. This spurious correlation problem limits generalization and obstructs
the model's ability to adhere to the input text prompt. In this work, we
uncover a simple yet effective solution: provide the very shortcuts we wish to
eliminate during adapter training. In Shortcut-Rerouted Adapter Training,
confounding factors are routed through auxiliary modules, such as ControlNet or
LoRA, eliminating the incentive for the adapter to internalize them. The
auxiliary modules are then removed during inference. When applied to tasks like
facial and full-body identity injection, our approach improves generation
quality, diversity, and prompt adherence. These results point to a general
design principle in the era of large models: when seeking disentangled
representations, the most effective path may be to establish shortcuts for what
should NOT be learned.

### [2] [Video-As-Prompt: Unified Semantic Control for Video Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20888)
*Yuxuan Bian,Xin Chen,Zenan Li,Tiancheng Zhi,Shen Sang,Linjie Luo,Qiang Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Treats a reference video as a semantic prompt to guide a frozen Video Diffusion Transformer via a plug-in Mixture-of-Transformers; introduces VAP-Data and achieves strong open-source zero-shot generalization and high user preference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Unified, generalizable semantic control in video generation is hard: existing methods trade off quality vs. generality, rely on pixel-wise priors, finetuning, or task-specific architectures. A prompt-based, non-finetuned approach could enable broad, scalable control.

Method: Video-As-Prompt (VAP) reframes control as in-context generation: a reference video semantically prompts a frozen Video Diffusion Transformer through a plug-and-play Mixture-of-Transformers. A temporally biased position embedding mitigates spurious context mappings. VAP-Data (over 100K paired videos across 100 semantic conditions) supports a single unified model.

Result: VAP achieves state-of-the-art among open-source methods, with ~38.7% user preference, rivaling leading condition-specific commercial models. It exhibits strong zero-shot generalization and supports various downstream applications.

Conclusion: This approach advances toward general-purpose, controllable video generation, reducing artifacts from rigid priors and enabling broad applicability; the accompanying VAP-Data dataset provides a foundation for future research.

Abstract: Unified, generalizable semantic control in video generation remains a
critical open challenge. Existing methods either introduce artifacts by
enforcing inappropriate pixel-wise priors from structure-based controls, or
rely on non-generalizable, condition-specific finetuning or task-specific
architectures. We introduce Video-As-Prompt (VAP), a new paradigm that reframes
this problem as in-context generation. VAP leverages a reference video as a
direct semantic prompt, guiding a frozen Video Diffusion Transformer (DiT) via
a plug-and-play Mixture-of-Transformers (MoT) expert. This architecture
prevents catastrophic forgetting and is guided by a temporally biased position
embedding that eliminates spurious mapping priors for robust context retrieval.
To power this approach and catalyze future research, we built VAP-Data, the
largest dataset for semantic-controlled video generation with over 100K paired
videos across 100 semantic conditions. As a single unified model, VAP sets a
new state-of-the-art for open-source methods, achieving a 38.7% user preference
rate that rivals leading condition-specific commercial models. VAP's strong
zero-shot generalization and support for various downstream applications mark a
significant advance toward general-purpose, controllable video generation.

### [3] [Focal Modulation and Bidirectional Feature Fusion Network for Medical Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20933)
*Moin Safdar,Shahzaib Iqbal,Mehwish Mehmood,Mubeen Ghafoor,Tariq M. Khan,Imran Razzak*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FM-BFF-Net is a hybrid CNN–Transformer medical image segmentation network that uses focal modulation attention and bidirectional feature fusion to improve boundary delineation and robustness across diverse datasets, achieving state-of-the-art segmentation metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Convolutional nets have local receptive fields, which limits global context capture; transformers can model long-range dependencies, but integrating them with CNNs for segmentation and boundary precision remains challenging. A unified architecture that fuses encoder and decoder features across scales and refines context can address variations in lesion size, shape, and contrast.

Method: A hybrid architecture FM-BFF-Net combining CNN and transformer components, with a focal modulation attention mechanism to refine context and a bidirectional feature fusion module enabling efficient interaction between encoder and decoder representations across scales. Evaluated on eight public datasets (polyps, skin lesions, ultrasound) using segmentation metrics.

Result: FM-BFF-Net consistently surpasses recent state-of-the-art methods in Jaccard index and Dice coefficient across eight datasets, showing improved boundary precision and robustness to lesion size, shape, and contrast variations.

Conclusion: FM-BFF-Net demonstrates strong effectiveness and adaptability for diverse medical imaging segmentation tasks, validating the benefits of focal modulation and bidirectional feature fusion in hybrid CNN–Transformer architectures.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation is essential for clinical applications such as
disease diagnosis, treatment planning, and disease development monitoring
because it provides precise morphological and spatial information on anatomical
structures that directly influence treatment decisions. Convolutional neural
networks significantly impact image segmentation; however, since convolution
operations are local, capturing global contextual information and long-range
dependencies is still challenging. Their capacity to precisely segment
structures with complicated borders and a variety of sizes is impacted by this
restriction. Since transformers use self-attention methods to capture global
context and long-range dependencies efficiently, integrating transformer-based
architecture with CNNs is a feasible approach to overcoming these challenges.
To address these challenges, we propose the Focal Modulation and Bidirectional
Feature Fusion Network for Medical Image Segmentation, referred to as
FM-BFF-Net in the remainder of this paper. The network combines convolutional
and transformer components, employs a focal modulation attention mechanism to
refine context awareness, and introduces a bidirectional feature fusion module
that enables efficient interaction between encoder and decoder representations
across scales. Through this design, FM-BFF-Net enhances boundary precision and
robustness to variations in lesion size, shape, and contrast. Extensive
experiments on eight publicly available datasets, including polyp detection,
skin lesion segmentation, and ultrasound imaging, show that FM-BFF-Net
consistently surpasses recent state-of-the-art methods in Jaccard index and
Dice coefficient, confirming its effectiveness and adaptability for diverse
medical imaging scenarios.

### [4] [Generative Point Tracking with Flow Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20951)
*Mattie Tesfaldet,Adam W. Harley,Konstantinos G. Derpanis,Derek Nowrouzezahrai,Christopher Pal*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GenPT introduces a generative framework to model multi-modal point trajectories under uncertainty, improving occluded tracking by leveraging generative sampling and best-first inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Discriminative trackers excel at regression but collapse to a single mode under uncertainty; there is a need to capture multiple plausible trajectories for occluded/uncertain points.

Method: GenPT uses a flow-matching training objective that fuses iterative discriminative refinement, a window-dependent cross-window prior, and a variance schedule for coordinates; inference uses best-first search over generated samples guided by model confidence.

Result: GenPT achieves state-of-the-art tracking accuracy on occluded points across PointOdyssey, Dynamic Replica, and TAP-Vid benchmarks, and on a TAP-Vid variant with extra occlusions; it preserves competitive accuracy on visible points while explicitly modeling multi-modality.

Conclusion: A generative, multi-modal tracker for point trajectories can outperform discriminative methods in occlusion scenarios without sacrificing performance on visible points.

Abstract: Tracking a point through a video can be a challenging task due to uncertainty
arising from visual obfuscations, such as appearance changes and occlusions.
Although current state-of-the-art discriminative models excel in regressing
long-term point trajectory estimates -- even through occlusions -- they are
limited to regressing to a mean (or mode) in the presence of uncertainty, and
fail to capture multi-modality. To overcome this limitation, we introduce
Generative Point Tracker (GenPT), a generative framework for modelling
multi-modal trajectories. GenPT is trained with a novel flow matching
formulation that combines the iterative refinement of discriminative trackers,
a window-dependent prior for cross-window consistency, and a variance schedule
tuned specifically for point coordinates. We show how our model's generative
capabilities can be leveraged to improve point trajectory estimates by
utilizing a best-first search strategy on generated samples during inference,
guided by the model's own confidence of its predictions. Empirically, we
evaluate GenPT against the current state of the art on the standard
PointOdyssey, Dynamic Replica, and TAP-Vid benchmarks. Further, we introduce a
TAP-Vid variant with additional occlusions to assess occluded point tracking
performance and highlight our model's ability to capture multi-modality. GenPT
is capable of capturing the multi-modality in point trajectories, which
translates to state-of-the-art tracking accuracy on occluded points, while
maintaining competitive tracking accuracy on visible points compared to extant
discriminative point trackers.

### [5] [3DReasonKnee: Advancing Grounded Reasoning in Medical Vision Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20967)
*Sraavya Sambara,Sung Eun Kim,Xiaoman Zhang,Luyang Luo,Shreya Johri,Mohammed Baharoon,Du Hyun Ro,Pranav Rajpurkar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 3DReasonKnee introduces a large 3D-grounded reasoning dataset for knee MRI, with 494k quintuples including 3D volumes, diagnostic questions, bounding boxes, clinician reasoning steps, and severity assessments; plus ReasonKnee-Bench for evaluation and baselines from five SOTA VLMs; aims to enable 3D-grounded, clinically aligned decision-making.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Grounded reasoning in 3D medical images (localizing anatomical regions and providing stepwise diagnostic reasoning) is essential for trustworthy clinician-AI collaboration. Current 3D datasets lack grounding and causal reasoning capabilities, hindering alignment with real-world diagnostic workflows.

Method: Constructed 3DReasonKnee from 7,970 knee MRI volumes, producing 494,000 high-quality quintuples: (1) 3D MRI volume, (2) diagnostic question targeting a region, (3) 3D bounding box for the relevant anatomy, (4) clinician-generated diagnostic reasoning steps outlining 3D reasoning, (5) structured severity assessments. Over 450 hours of expert clinician time for segmentation and reasoning-chain generation. Introduced ReasonKnee-Bench to evaluate localization and diagnostic accuracy, and benchmarked five state-of-the-art VLMs.

Result: A large, richly annotated 3D medical reasoning dataset with grounding and stepwise reasoning annotations; a dedicated evaluation benchmark (ReasonKnee-Bench) and baseline performance for five VLMs. Demonstrates feasibility and value of 3D-grounded reasoning data; provides a resource for advancing clinically aligned, localized decision-making in multimodal medical AI.

Conclusion: 3DReasonKnee offers a unique, expert-annotated resource enabling 3D-grounded, region-specific diagnostic reasoning in medical AI. It supports trustworthy clinician–AI collaboration, aligns with clinical workflows, and serves as a testbed to push multimodal models toward 3D, clinically grounded decision-making.

Abstract: Current Vision-Language Models (VLMs) struggle to ground anatomical regions
in 3D medical images and reason about them in a step-by-step manner, a key
requirement of real-world diagnostic assessment. This ability is essential for
aligning model outputs with the diagnostic workflows clinicians use in
practice, enabling trustworthy clinician-AI collaboration. Existing 3D datasets
provide localization labels, but none support this "grounded reasoning"
ability. To address this gap, we introduce 3DReasonKnee, the first 3D grounded
reasoning dataset for medical images, which provides 494k high-quality
quintuples derived from 7,970 3D knee MRI volumes. Each quintuple includes: (1)
the 3D MRI volume, (2) a diagnostic question targeting a specific anatomical
region (3) a 3D bounding box localizing the relevant anatomical structures, (4)
clinician-generated diagnostic reasoning steps that explicitly detail the 3D
reasoning process, and (5) structured severity assessments for the relevant
anatomical region. The creation and validation of 3DReasonKnee, involving over
450 hours of expert clinician time for manually segmenting MRIs and generating
reasoning chains, ensures its superior quality and clinical relevance. We
establish ReasonKnee-Bench to evaluate localization and diagnostic accuracy,
providing insight into VLM ability to perform grounding and severity assessment
across anatomical regions and diagnostic inquiries. We benchmark five
state-of-the-art VLMs, providing baseline performance for ReasonKnee-Bench. By
providing this unique resource of expert-annotated 3D reasoning pathways,
3DReasonKnee serves as a repository of orthopedic surgeons' diagnostic
expertise and offers a vital testbed for advancing multimodal medical AI
systems towards 3D, clinically aligned, localized decision-making capabilities.

### [6] [Thermal Polarimetric Multi-view Stereo](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20972)
*Takahiro Kushida,Kenichiro Tanaka*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A new long-wave infrared (LWIR) polarimetric imaging method enables detailed 3D shape reconstruction that is robust to illumination and material properties, by leveraging a general polarization theory and multi-view data to recover fine details of challenging objects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Visible polarization analyses suffer from ambiguities due to material reflectance and lighting conditions. A polarization framework using LWIR aims to provide robust cues for 3D shape reconstruction across challenging materials (transparent, translucent, heterogeneous) by reducing or eliminating illumination/material dependencies.

Method: Formulate a general theory of polarization observation in LWIR, show its advantages over visible polarization, and develop a multi-view thermal-polarimetric reconstruction pipeline that recovers detailed 3D shapes from polarization cues across views.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate the method reconstructs fine geometric details in transparent, translucent, and heterogeneous objects and outperforms existing techniques that rely on visible polarization or conventional imaging.

Conclusion: LWIR polarimetric imaging offers a robust, illumination- and material-insensitive pathway for detailed 3D shape reconstruction, with a solid theoretical basis and empirical validation across challenging object classes.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel method for detailed 3D shape reconstruction
utilizing thermal polarization cues. Unlike state-of-the-art methods, the
proposed approach is independent of illumination and material properties. In
this paper, we formulate a general theory of polarization observation and show
that long-wave infrared (LWIR) polarimetric imaging is free from the
ambiguities that affect visible polarization analyses. Subsequently, we propose
a method for recovering detailed 3D shapes using multi-view thermal
polarimetric images. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach
effectively reconstructs fine details in transparent, translucent, and
heterogeneous objects, outperforming existing techniques.

### [7] [VESSA: Video-based objEct-centric Self-Supervised Adaptation for Visual Foundation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20994)
*Jesimon Barreto,Carlos Caetano,André Araujo,William Robson Schwartz*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes VESSA, a self-supervised, video-based domain adaptation method for vision foundation models that uses unlabeled, multi-view object-centric videos and self-distillation to adapt to new domains without annotations, improving downstream classification across multiple models and datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Foundation models struggle with distribution shifts and scarce labels in new domains; existing self-supervised adaptation for vision models is underdeveloped and annotation-free adaptation remains challenging. The work seeks to enable domain adaptation without labels using unlabeled, object-centric video data.

Method: VESSA uses a self-distillation framework with a carefully tuned prediction head and parameter-efficient adaptation to prevent forgetting. It leverages multi-view object observations from different frames in object-centric videos to learn robustness to varied capture conditions, without requiring annotations. Evaluation involves three vision foundation models and two datasets, comparing against base models and prior adaptation methods.

Result: VESSA yields consistent improvements in downstream classification over both the base models and previous adaptation strategies across the tested models and datasets. The authors provide publicly available code.

Conclusion: VESSA demonstrates that self-supervised, video-based, object-centric adaptation can effectively align vision foundation models to new domains without labels, by combining self-distillation with multi-view supervision and careful, memory-preserving fine-tuning.

Abstract: Foundation models have advanced computer vision by enabling strong
performance across diverse tasks through large-scale pretraining and supervised
fine-tuning. However, they may underperform in domains with distribution shifts
and scarce labels, where supervised fine-tuning may be infeasible. While
continued self-supervised learning for model adaptation is common for
generative language models, this strategy has not proven effective for
vision-centric encoder models. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel
formulation of self-supervised fine-tuning for vision foundation models, where
the model is adapted to a new domain without requiring annotations, leveraging
only short multi-view object-centric videos. Our method is referred to as
VESSA: Video-based objEct-centric Self-Supervised Adaptation for visual
foundation models. VESSA's training technique is based on a self-distillation
paradigm, where it is critical to carefully tune prediction heads and deploy
parameter-efficient adaptation techniques - otherwise, the model may quickly
forget its pretrained knowledge and reach a degraded state. VESSA benefits
significantly from multi-view object observations sourced from different frames
in an object-centric video, efficiently learning robustness to varied capture
conditions, without the need of annotations. Through comprehensive experiments
with 3 vision foundation models on 2 datasets, VESSA demonstrates consistent
improvements in downstream classification tasks, compared to the base models
and previous adaptation methods. Code is publicly available at
https://github.com/jesimonbarreto/VESSA.

### [8] [BioDet: Boosting Industrial Object Detection with Image Preprocessing Strategies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21000)
*Jiaqi Hu,Hongli Xu,Junwen Huang,Peter KT Yu,Slobodan Ilic,Benjamin Busam*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A plug-in 2D detection pipeline for unseen industrial objects that mitigates the bottleneck in 6D pose estimation by combining low-light image enhancement and background removal guided by open-vocabulary foundation models, yielding more reliable detections with negligible overhead on BOP bin-picking benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate 6D pose estimation hinges on robust 2D detection under clutter, poor lighting, and complex backgrounds; existing pipelines suffer from domain shift and background artifacts due to cropping around detectors; a standardized plug-in detection approach could alleviate these issues and improve downstream pose estimation.

Method: A standardized plug-in pipeline for 2D detection of unseen objects in industrial settings that applies low-light image enhancement and background removal guided by open-vocabulary detection using foundation models; aims to suppress false positives from raw SAM outputs and be compatible with current SOTA baselines, with minimal added computation.

Result: Experiments on real-world industrial bin-picking benchmarks from BOP show a significant boost in detection accuracy with negligible inference overhead, indicating improved reliability for downstream pose estimation.

Conclusion: The proposed detection pipeline enhances 2D detection of unseen industrial objects, addressing detection bottlenecks in challenging industrial environments and demonstrating practical effectiveness and compatibility with existing pose-estimation pipelines.

Abstract: Accurate 6D pose estimation is essential for robotic manipulation in
industrial environments. Existing pipelines typically rely on off-the-shelf
object detectors followed by cropping and pose refinement, but their
performance degrades under challenging conditions such as clutter, poor
lighting, and complex backgrounds, making detection the critical bottleneck. In
this work, we introduce a standardized and plug-in pipeline for 2D detection of
unseen objects in industrial settings. Based on current SOTA baselines, our
approach reduces domain shift and background artifacts through low-light image
enhancement and background removal guided by open-vocabulary detection with
foundation models. This design suppresses the false positives prevalent in raw
SAM outputs, yielding more reliable detections for downstream pose estimation.
Extensive experiments on real-world industrial bin-picking benchmarks from BOP
demonstrate that our method significantly boosts detection accuracy while
incurring negligible inference overhead, showing the effectiveness and
practicality of the proposed method.

### [9] [Deep learning-based automated damage detection in concrete structures using images from earthquake events](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21063)
*Abdullah Turer,Yongsheng Bai,Halil Sezen,Alper Yilmaz*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Hybrid deep learning framework using YOLO detectors to detect cracks, spalling, and exposed reinforcement in post-earthquake images; built on 2023 Turkey earthquake data to enable rapid automatic damage assessment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Timely, safe post-disaster assessment; exposed steel bars indicate significant damage; need automatic detection across diverse damage contexts.

Method: Labelled datasets of post-quake images; automated inside/outside building and component classification; train YOLOv11 to detect cracking, spalling, exposed bars; fine-tune another YOLO for damage level categories; integrate into a hybrid framework to estimate damage level from images; data augmentation; testing on public datasets.

Result: Demonstrates feasibility of rapid automated damage detection post-disaster across diverse contexts using image data and deep learning; enables automatic identification of interior/exterior components and damage categories, supporting timely decision making.

Conclusion: The framework enables timely, automated post-disaster damage assessment across varied contexts and could generalize to other earthquakes, aiding emergency response and risk management.

Abstract: Timely assessment of integrity of structures after seismic events is crucial
for public safety and emergency response. This study focuses on assessing the
structural damage conditions using deep learning methods to detect exposed
steel reinforcement in concrete buildings and bridges after large earthquakes.
Steel bars are typically exposed after concrete spalling or large flexural or
shear cracks. The amount and distribution of exposed steel reinforcement is an
indication of structural damage and degradation. To automatically detect
exposed steel bars, new datasets of images collected after the 2023 Turkey
Earthquakes were labeled to represent a wide variety of damaged concrete
structures. The proposed method builds upon a deep learning framework, enhanced
with fine-tuning, data augmentation, and testing on public datasets. An
automated classification framework is developed that can be used to identify
inside/outside buildings and structural components. Then, a YOLOv11 (You Only
Look Once) model is trained to detect cracking and spalling damage and exposed
bars. Another YOLO model is finetuned to distinguish different categories of
structural damage levels. All these trained models are used to create a hybrid
framework to automatically and reliably determine the damage levels from input
images. This research demonstrates that rapid and automated damage detection
following disasters is achievable across diverse damage contexts by utilizing
image data collection, annotation, and deep learning approaches.

### [10] [ZING-3D: Zero-shot Incremental 3D Scene Graphs via Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21069)
*Pranav Saxena,Jimmy Chiun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ZING-3D proposes zero-shot, open-vocabulary 3D scene graphs grounded in 3D space via depth, enabling incremental updates for robotics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need for structured, semantic, and spatial representations in 3D that support open-vocabulary recognition, incremental updates as new observations arrive, and explicit 3D grounding for embodied AI.

Method: Leverage pretrained vision-language models to generate a rich 2D scene graph and ground it in 3D using depth. Nodes are open-vocabulary objects with features, 3D locations, and semantic context; edges capture spatial and semantic relations with inter-object distances. The approach supports incremental updates and zero-shot recognition.

Result: Demonstrates effectiveness at capturing spatial and relational knowledge without task-specific training on scenes from Replica and HM3D datasets.

Conclusion: ZING-3D enables open-vocabulary, geometry-grounded, incrementally-updatable 3D scene understanding suitable for robotics and embodied applications.

Abstract: Understanding and reasoning about complex 3D environments requires structured
scene representations that capture not only objects but also their semantic and
spatial relationships. While recent works on 3D scene graph generation have
leveraged pretrained VLMs without task-specific fine-tuning, they are largely
confined to single-view settings, fail to support incremental updates as new
observations arrive and lack explicit geometric grounding in 3D space, all of
which are essential for embodied scenarios. In this paper, we propose, ZING-3D,
a framework that leverages the vast knowledge of pretrained foundation models
to enable open-vocabulary recognition and generate a rich semantic
representation of the scene in a zero-shot manner while also enabling
incremental updates and geometric grounding in 3D space, making it suitable for
downstream robotics applications. Our approach leverages VLM reasoning to
generate a rich 2D scene graph, which is grounded in 3D using depth
information. Nodes represent open-vocabulary objects with features, 3D
locations, and semantic context, while edges capture spatial and semantic
relations with inter-object distances. Our experiments on scenes from the
Replica and HM3D dataset show that ZING-3D is effective at capturing spatial
and relational knowledge without the need of task-specific training.

### [11] [WaveSeg: Enhancing Segmentation Precision via High-Frequency Prior and Mamba-Driven Spectrum Decomposition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21079)
*Guoan Xu,Yang Xiao,Wenjing Jia,Guangwei Gao,Guo-Jun Qi,Chia-Wen Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A wavelet-aware decoder (WaveSeg) improves semantic segmentation by joint spatial-wavelet refinement using high-frequency priors, DDO fusion, and Mamba-based Spectrum Decomposition Attention, achieving state-of-the-art results with efficient boundaries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard decoders for semantic segmentation rely on powerful encoders but use simplistic decoders, leading to a mismatch between semantic context and fine-grained boundary details. A decoder that leverages frequency-domain information and long-range modeling can better preserve boundaries while maintaining semantic integrity.

Method: Introduce WaveSeg: learn high-frequency priors from input to reinforce boundaries; apply a Dual Domain Operation (DDO) for multi-scale fusion across spatial and wavelet domains; employ Spectrum Decomposition Attention (SDA) based on Mamba’s linear-complexity long-range modeling to enhance high-frequency structures; use reparameterized convolutions to preserve low-frequency semantics in the wavelet domain; perform residual-guided fusion to produce boundary-aware, native-resolution feature maps.

Result: Empirical results on standard benchmarks show WaveSeg consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both quantitative metrics and qualitative assessments, with improved boundary preservation and overall segmentation quality, while maintaining efficiency.

Conclusion: WaveSeg demonstrates that combining wavelet-domain priors, SDA with Mamba attention, and residual multi-scale fusion yields superior decoder performance for semantic segmentation, offering a robust, efficient solution with enhanced boundary details and semantic fidelity.

Abstract: While recent semantic segmentation networks heavily rely on powerful
pretrained encoders, most employ simplistic decoders, leading to suboptimal
trade-offs between semantic context and fine-grained detail preservation. To
address this, we propose a novel decoder architecture, WaveSeg, which jointly
optimizes feature refinement in spatial and wavelet domains. Specifically,
high-frequency components are first learned from input images as explicit
priors to reinforce boundary details at early stages. A multi-scale fusion
mechanism, Dual Domain Operation (DDO), is then applied, and the novel Spectrum
Decomposition Attention (SDA) block is proposed, which is developed to leverage
Mamba's linear-complexity long-range modeling to enhance high-frequency
structural details. Meanwhile, reparameterized convolutions are applied to
preserve low-frequency semantic integrity in the wavelet domain. Finally, a
residual-guided fusion integrates multi-scale features with boundary-aware
representations at native resolution, producing semantically and structurally
rich feature maps. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate
that WaveSeg, leveraging wavelet-domain frequency prior with Mamba-based
attention, consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches both
quantitatively and qualitatively, achieving efficient and precise segmentation.

### [12] [Knowledge-Driven Vision-Language Model for Plexus Detection in Hirschsprung's Disease](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21083)
*Youssef Megahed,Atallah Madi,Dina El Demellawy,Adrian D. C. Chan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A CLIP-like vision-language model (QuiltNet) that injects expert-derived textual prompts into histopathology classification improves detection of myenteric plexus regions in Hirschsprung's disease, outperforming standard CNNs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the interpretability and decision-alignment gap in CNN-based histopathology classifiers by incorporating expert clinical knowledge into a multimodal, prompt-guided model.

Method: Develop a Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP)-style framework (QuiltNet) for plexus classification. Generate expert-derived prompts from textbooks and papers via large-language models, then have clinicians review them. Fuse these prompts with image features to guide classification, and compare against CNN baselines (VGG-19, ResNet-18, ResNet-50).

Result: The proposed model achieved higher discriminative performance than CNNs, with accuracies of 83.9%, precision 86.6%, and specificity 87.6%.

Conclusion: Incorporating expert textual cues into a multimodal model enhances clinically relevant outputs in histopathology and demonstrates the value of expert-guided prompts for interpretable, task-aligned AI.

Abstract: Hirschsprung's disease is defined as the congenital absence of ganglion cells
in some segment(s) of the colon. The muscle cannot make coordinated movements
to propel stool in that section, most commonly leading to obstruction. The
diagnosis and treatment for this disease require a clear identification of
different region(s) of the myenteric plexus, where ganglion cells should be
present, on the microscopic view of the tissue slide. While deep learning
approaches, such as Convolutional Neural Networks, have performed very well in
this task, they are often treated as black boxes, with minimal understanding
gained from them, and may not conform to how a physician makes decisions. In
this study, we propose a novel framework that integrates expert-derived textual
concepts into a Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training-based vision-language
model to guide plexus classification. Using prompts derived from expert sources
(e.g., medical textbooks and papers) generated by large language models and
reviewed by our team before being encoded with QuiltNet, our approach aligns
clinically relevant semantic cues with visual features. Experimental results
show that the proposed model demonstrated superior discriminative capability
across different classification metrics as it outperformed CNN-based models,
including VGG-19, ResNet-18, and ResNet-50; achieving an accuracy of 83.9%, a
precision of 86.6%, and a specificity of 87.6%. These findings highlight the
potential of multi-modal learning in histopathology and underscore the value of
incorporating expert knowledge for more clinically relevant model outputs.

TL;DR: Proposes HistRetinex, a histogram-domain Retinex for fast low-light enhancement. Introduces histogram location and count matrices, a two-level optimization to estimate illumination and reflectance histograms, followed by histogram matching. Claims faster processing (1.86s on 1000x664) and improved visibility metrics over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Retinex-based methods achieve good enhancement but are computationally heavy on large images. Shifting to the histogram domain aims to reduce complexity and enable faster processing while preserving quality.

Method: Define histogram location and histogram count matrices to relate histograms of illumination, reflectance, and the observed low-light image. Formulate a two-level optimization: level-1 updates illumination histogram; level-2 updates reflectance histogram; derive iterative formulas for both. Use histogram matching to produce the enhanced image aligned with HistRetinex statistics.

Result: HistRetinex outperforms existing enhancement methods in visibility and standard metrics. It runs in 1.86 seconds for 1000×664 images, achieving a minimum time saving of 6.67 seconds compared to baselines.

Conclusion: HistRetinex demonstrates that operating in the histogram domain can yield fast, high-quality low-light enhancement by jointly estimating illumination and reflectance histograms and then aligning the input histogram to the HistRetinex target.

Abstract: Retinex-based low-light image enhancement methods are widely used due to
their excellent performance. However, most of them are time-consuming for
large-sized images. This paper extends the Retinex model from the spatial
domain to the histogram domain, and proposes a novel histogram-based Retinex
model for fast low-light image enhancement, named HistRetinex. Firstly, we
define the histogram location matrix and the histogram count matrix, which
establish the relationship among histograms of the illumination, reflectance
and the low-light image. Secondly, based on the prior information and the
histogram-based Retinex model, we construct a novel two-level optimization
model. Through solving the optimization model, we give the iterative formulas
of the illumination histogram and the reflectance histogram, respectively.
Finally, we enhance the low-light image through matching its histogram with the
one provided by HistRetinex. Experimental results demonstrate that the
HistRetinex outperforms existing enhancement methods in both visibility and
performance metrics, while executing 1.86 seconds on 1000*664 resolution
images, achieving a minimum time saving of 6.67 seconds.

*Weijie Zhou,Xuantang Xiong,Yi Peng,Manli Tao,Chaoyang Zhao,Honghui Dong,Ming Tang,Jinqiao Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Active Visual Reasoning (AVR) extends visual reasoning to partially observable, interactive settings. It introduces CLEVR-AVR and AVR-152k with CoT annotations, and PhysVLM-AVR achieving state-of-the-art on multiple benchmarks, while highlighting gaps in current embodied MLLMs' ability to actively acquire and integrate information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world visual reasoning often faces occlusion and limited viewpoints. Humans mitigate this by actively exploring and manipulating the environment. This work motivates building benchmarks, data, and models to study active perception and information gathering within MLLMs.

Method: Define the AVR task for iterative, action-conditioned perception. Create CLEVR-AVR, a multi-round interactive environment; assemble AVR-152k with Chain-of-Thought annotations for uncertainty identification, information gain prediction, and information-maximizing action selection. Propose PhysVLM-AVR, an MLLM capable of embodied reasoning, and evaluate on CLEVR-AVR, OpenEQA, RoboVQA, GeoMath, Geometry30K.

Result: PhysVLM-AVR achieves state-of-the-art on CLEVR-AVR, embodied reasoning benchmarks (OpenEQA, RoboVQA), and passive visual reasoning benchmarks (GeoMath, Geometry30K). Analysis shows that while current embodied MLLMs detect information incompleteness, they struggle to actively acquire and integrate new information through interaction.

Conclusion: Active, information-seeking reasoning remains a key gap; AVR provides a pathway with a dedicated task, benchmarks, and a dataset to train models that perform iterative perception-action loops and higher-order reasoning in partially observable environments.

Abstract: Visual reasoning in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) has primarily
been studied in static, fully observable settings, limiting their effectiveness
in real-world environments where information is often incomplete due to
occlusion or limited field of view. Humans, in contrast, actively explore and
interact with their environment-moving, examining, and manipulating objects-to
gather information through a closed-loop process integrating perception,
reasoning, and action. Inspired by this human capability, we introduce the
Active Visual Reasoning (AVR) task, extending visual reasoning to partially
observable, interactive environments. AVR necessitates agents to: (1) actively
acquire information via sequential physical actions, (2) integrate observations
across multiple steps for coherent reasoning, and (3) dynamically adjust
decisions based on evolving visual feedback. To rigorously evaluate AVR, we
introduce CLEVR-AVR, a simulation benchmark featuring multi-round interactive
environments designed to assess both reasoning correctness and
information-gathering efficiency. We present AVR-152k, a large-scale dataset
that offers rich Chain-of-Thought (CoT) annotations detailing iterative
reasoning for uncertainty identification, action-conditioned information gain
prediction, and information-maximizing action selection, crucial for training
agents in a higher-order Markov Decision Process. Building on this, we develop
PhysVLM-AVR, an MLLM achieving state-of-the-art performance on CLEVR-AVR,
embodied reasoning (OpenEQA, RoboVQA), and passive visual reasoning (GeoMath,
Geometry30K). Our analysis also reveals that current embodied MLLMs, despite
detecting information incompleteness, struggle to actively acquire and
integrate new information through interaction, highlighting a fundamental gap
in active reasoning capabilities.

### [15] [Urban 3D Change Detection Using LiDAR Sensor for HD Map Maintenance and Smart Mobility](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21112)
*Hezam Albagami,Haitian Wang,Xinyu Wang,Muhammad Ibrahim,Zainy M. Malakan,Abdullah M. Alqamdi,Mohammed H. Alghamdi,Ajmal Mian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: An object-centric, uncertainty-aware change-detection framework for city-scale LiDAR that aligns epochs and resolves splits/merges with semantic/instance constraints, achieving strong results on Subiaco blocks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HD city-scale change detection for map maintenance requires robust cross-epoch associations despite geometric noise, ground slope, and partial overlap; traditional DSM/image or voxel-based methods struggle with object identity, splits/merges, and uncertainty handling.

Method: Epoch alignment via multi-resolution NDT and point-to-plane ICP; height normalization; per-location detection level derived from registration covariance and surface roughness; initial geometry seeds cross-epoch associations; refine with semantic and instance segmentation; class-constrained bipartite assignment with augmented dummies to handle splits/merges while preserving per-class counts; tiling to bound memory; instance-level decisions combine 3D overlap, normal displacement, height/volume differences, and histogram distance gated by local detection level.

Result: Evaluated on 15 Subiaco blocks: 95.2% accuracy, 90.4% mF1, 82.6% mIoU; surpasses Triplet KPConv by 0.2 points in accuracy, 0.2 in mF1, and 0.8 in IoU; largest gains on the Decreased category with IoU 74.8% (+7.6).

Conclusion: An effective, uncertainty-aware, object-centric LiDAR change-detection pipeline that maintains per-class counts, handles splits/merges, and remains robust under partial overlap and sampling variation, enabling reliable HD map maintenance and monitoring.

Abstract: High-definition 3D city maps underpin smart transportation, digital twins,
and autonomous driving, where object level change detection across bi temporal
LiDAR enables HD map maintenance, construction monitoring, and reliable
localization. Classical DSM differencing and image based methods are sensitive
to small vertical bias, ground slope, and viewpoint mismatch and yield cellwise
outputs without object identity. Point based neural models and voxel encodings
demand large memory, assume near perfect pre alignment, degrade thin
structures, and seldom enforce class consistent association, which leaves split
or merge cases unresolved and ignores uncertainty. We propose an object
centric, uncertainty aware pipeline for city scale LiDAR that aligns epochs
with multi resolution NDT followed by point to plane ICP, normalizes height,
and derives a per location level of detection from registration covariance and
surface roughness to calibrate decisions and suppress spurious changes.
Geometry only proxies seed cross epoch associations that are refined by
semantic and instance segmentation and a class constrained bipartite assignment
with augmented dummies to handle splits and merges while preserving per class
counts. Tiled processing bounds memory without eroding narrow ground changes,
and instance level decisions combine 3D overlap, normal direction displacement,
and height and volume differences with a histogram distance, all gated by the
local level of detection to remain stable under partial overlap and sampling
variation. On 15 representative Subiaco blocks the method attains 95.2%
accuracy, 90.4% mF1, and 82.6% mIoU, exceeding Triplet KPConv by 0.2 percentage
points in accuracy, 0.2 in mF1, and 0.8 in mIoU, with the largest gain on
Decreased where IoU reaches 74.8% and improves by 7.6 points.

### [16] [Controllable-LPMoE: Adapting to Challenging Object Segmentation via Dynamic Local Priors from Mixture-of-Experts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21114)
*Yanguang Sun,Jiawei Lian,Jian Yang,Lei Luo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A dynamic priors-based fine-tuning method for frozen foundation models, Controllable-LPMoE, uses a lightweight local priors extractor and a bidirectional adapter to enable efficient, high-performance segmentation without full parameter updates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fine-tuning large foundation models is computationally expensive due to updating vast numbers of parameters. Prompt-based tuning lacks semantic priors, limiting adaptation for segmentation tasks. A parameter-efficient approach using dynamic priors can improve task-specific performance while maintaining efficiency.

Method: Introduce Controllable-LPMoE: a lightweight dynamic mixed local priors extractor with heterogeneous convolutions and a gating network to output task-relevant expert priors; a bi-directional interaction adapter with cosine-aligned deformable attention and channel-oriented adaptive scale enhancement to bridge frozen and trainable features and reshape them for fine-tuning.

Result: Empirically outperforms 31 SOTA methods on multiple binary object segmentation tasks, showing strong segmentation performance and adaptability with reduced trainable parameters.

Conclusion: The proposed dynamic priors-based fine-tuning paradigm enables efficient adaptation of frozen foundation models for segmentation, achieving competitive or superior performance with fewer trainable parameters through dynamic local priors and feature interaction.

Abstract: Large-scale foundation models provide powerful feature representations for
downstream object segmentation tasks. However, when adapted to specific tasks
through the full-parameter fine-tuning, the enormous parameters being updated
often results in significant computational overhead, creating a bottleneck in
training efficiency. Although existing methods attempt to fine-tune frozen
models by directly embedding trainable prompts, these prompts lack inherent
semantic priors, limiting the adaptability of large-scale models. In this
paper, we propose a novel dynamic priors-based fine-tuning paradigm with fewer
trainable parameters, dubbed Controllable-LPMoE, which adaptively modulates
frozen foundation models by dynamically controlling local priors to enhance
fine-grained perception for specific segmentation tasks. More specifically, we
construct a lightweight dynamic mixed local priors extractor that captures
diverse local priors from input images through heterogeneous convolutions while
employing a gating network to dynamically output expert priors required for the
subsequent fine-tuning. Furthermore, we design a bi-directional interaction
adapter that employs cosine-aligned deformable attention and channel-oriented
adaptive scale enhancement to interact and restructure between frozen and
trainable features, achieving efficient fine-tuning. Extensive experiments
validate the superiority of our
\href{https://github.com/CSYSI/Controllable-LPMoE} {Controllable-LPMoE}
approach, demonstrating excellent segmentation performance compared to 31
state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods and adaptability to multiple binary object
segmentation tasks.

*Alec Helbling,Shruti Palaskar,Kundan Krishna,Polo Chau,Leon Gatys,Joseph Yitan Cheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SafetyPairs provides a scalable framework to generate counterfactual image pairs that flip safety labels by editing only safety-relevant features, plus a 3,020-image, 9-category benchmark for fine-grained image safety research; it aids evaluation of vision-language models and improves guard model training through data augmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current safety datasets are coarse and don't disentangle the features driving safety judgments, hindering understanding and robust safety assessment; need a systematic way to study fine-grained safety distinctions and improve guard models.

Method: Leverage image editing models to produce targeted changes that alter safety labels while preserving non-safety-related content; construct SafetyPairs counterfactuals; compile a benchmark with 3,020 images across 9 safety categories; evaluate VLMs and use as augmentation for lightweight guard models.

Result: Created a scalable counterfactual framework and a new safety benchmark; demonstrated weaknesses in vision-language models' ability to distinguish subtly different dangerous content; showed that SafetyPairs can improve sample efficiency in training guard models.

Conclusion: SafetyPairs enables fine-grained, controllable safety evaluation and data augmentation, providing a first systematic resource for studying subtle safety distinctions in images and enhancing safety-aware AI systems.

Abstract: What exactly makes a particular image unsafe? Systematically differentiating
between benign and problematic images is a challenging problem, as subtle
changes to an image, such as an insulting gesture or symbol, can drastically
alter its safety implications. However, existing image safety datasets are
coarse and ambiguous, offering only broad safety labels without isolating the
specific features that drive these differences. We introduce SafetyPairs, a
scalable framework for generating counterfactual pairs of images, that differ
only in the features relevant to the given safety policy, thus flipping their
safety label. By leveraging image editing models, we make targeted changes to
images that alter their safety labels while leaving safety-irrelevant details
unchanged. Using SafetyPairs, we construct a new safety benchmark, which serves
as a powerful source of evaluation data that highlights weaknesses in
vision-language models' abilities to distinguish between subtly different
images. Beyond evaluation, we find our pipeline serves as an effective data
augmentation strategy that improves the sample efficiency of training
lightweight guard models. We release a benchmark containing over 3,020
SafetyPair images spanning a diverse taxonomy of 9 safety categories, providing
the first systematic resource for studying fine-grained image safety
distinctions.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NoisyGRPO adds noise-based exploration and Bayesian advantage estimation to multimodal RL, improving generalization and robustness in chain-of-thought tasks, especially for small multimodal LLMs like Qwen2.5-VL 3B; validated on CoT quality, general capability, and hallucination benchmarks; project page provided.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RL methods for improving general CoT in multimodal LLMs often fail to generalize beyond training distribution; a robust framework is needed to encourage diverse visual experience and principled trajectory evaluation.

Method: 1) Noise-Injected Exploration Policy: perturb visual inputs with Gaussian noise to broaden exploration across visual scenarios. 2) Bayesian Advantage Estimation: formulate trajectory advantage as Bayesian inference with the injected noise level as prior and observed trajectory reward as likelihood; fuse information to obtain a robust posterior that guides preference for visually grounded trajectories.

Result: Empirical results show improved generalization and robustness on standard CoT quality, general capability, and hallucination benchmarks; notable gains for small-scale MLLMs such as Qwen2.5-VL 3B.

Conclusion: NoisyGRPO provides a systematic multimodal RL framework that enhances generalization and robustness by combining noise-based exploration with Bayesian advantage estimation; demonstrated effectiveness across benchmarks and effective for smaller models; project page link provided.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has shown promise in enhancing the general
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language
models (MLLMs). However, when applied to improve general CoT reasoning,
existing RL frameworks often struggle to generalize beyond the training
distribution. To address this, we propose NoisyGRPO, a systematic multimodal RL
framework that introduces controllable noise into visual inputs for enhanced
exploration and explicitly models the advantage estimation process via a
Bayesian framework. Specifically, NoisyGRPO improves RL training by: (1)
\textbf{Noise-Injected Exploration Policy}: Perturbing visual inputs with
Gaussian noise to encourage exploration across a wider range of visual
scenarios; and (2) \textbf{Bayesian Advantage Estimation}: Formulating
advantage estimation as a principled Bayesian inference problem, where the
injected noise level serves as a prior and the observed trajectory reward as
the likelihood. This Bayesian modeling fuses both sources of information to
compute a robust posterior estimate of trajectory advantage, effectively
guiding MLLMs to prefer visually grounded trajectories over noisy ones.
Experiments on standard CoT quality, general capability, and hallucination
benchmarks demonstrate that NoisyGRPO substantially improves generalization and
robustness, especially in RL settings with small-scale MLLMs such as Qwen2.5-VL
3B. The project page is available at

*Ying Ming,Yue Lin,Longfei Zhao,Gengwan Li,Zuopeng Tan,Bing Li,Sheng Xie,Wei Song,Qiqi Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A cascaded CycleGAN-based method generates digital-contrast CTPA from non-contrast CT, enabling vascular visualization and improved downstream tasks, validated on multi-center data with strong image fidelity and segmentation performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reduce risks of iodinated contrast (nephrotoxicity, allergy) in pulmonary angiography and enable vascular assessment for high-risk patients using synthetic imaging.

Method: A cascaded synthesizer built on CycleGANs to convert NCCT to DCCTPA, trained on 410 paired NCCT-CTPA scans from three centers (249 internal validation, 161 external test). Evaluated with MAE, PSNR, SSIM for image fidelity; downstream vessel segmentation (Dice, clDice, Recall) for arteries/veins; and ICC for vessel volume against true CTPA.

Result: DCCTPA achieved high fidelity (validation: MAE 156.28, PSNR 20.71, SSIM 0.98; test: MAE 165.12, PSNR 20.27, SSIM 0.98). Vessel segmentation improved over NCCT (artery Dice 0.70, clDice 0.71, clRecall 0.73; vein Dice 0.70, clDice 0.72, clRecall 0.75). ICC for vessel volume: 0.81 (DCCTPA vs CTPA) vs 0.70 (NCCT vs CTPA).

Conclusion: The proposed DCCTPA method provides effective vascular enhancement with high image fidelity and improved downstream quantification, suggesting potential as a contrast-free alternative or adjunct for diagnosing pulmonary vascular diseases; external validity supported by multi-center data but further prospective and diagnostic accuracy studies are warranted.

Abstract: Computed Tomography Pulmonary Angiography (CTPA) is the reference standard
for diagnosing pulmonary vascular diseases such as Pulmonary Embolism (PE) and
Chronic Thromboembolic Pulmonary Hypertension (CTEPH). However, its reliance on
iodinated contrast agents poses risks including nephrotoxicity and allergic
reactions, particularly in high-risk patients. This study proposes a method to
generate Digital Contrast CTPA (DCCTPA) from Non-Contrast CT (NCCT) scans using
a cascaded synthesizer based on Cycle-Consistent Generative Adversarial
Networks (CycleGAN). Totally retrospective 410 paired CTPA and NCCT scans were
obtained from three centers. The model was trained and validated internally on
249 paired images. Extra dataset that comprising 161 paired images was as test
set for model generalization evaluation and downstream clinical tasks
validation. Compared with state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, the proposed method
achieved the best comprehensive performance by evaluating quantitative metrics
(For validation, MAE: 156.28, PSNR: 20.71 and SSIM: 0.98; For test, MAE:
165.12, PSNR: 20.27 and SSIM: 0.98) and qualitative visualization,
demonstrating valid vessel enhancement, superior image fidelity and structural
preservation. The approach was further applied to downstream tasks of pulmonary
vessel segmentation and vascular quantification. On the test set, the average
Dice, clDice, and clRecall of artery and vein pulmonary segmentation was 0.70,
0.71, 0.73 and 0.70, 0.72, 0.75 respectively, all markedly improved compared
with NCCT inputs.\@ Inter-class Correlation Coefficient (ICC) for vessel volume
between DCCTPA and CTPA was significantly better than that between NCCT and
CTPA (Average ICC : 0.81 vs 0.70), indicating effective vascular enhancement in
DCCTPA, especially for small vessels.

TL;DR: PhysWorld builds a physics-consistent digital twin in an MPM simulator, uses part-aware property perturbations to synthesize diverse demonstrations, and trains a lightweight GNN world model embedded with physical properties to achieve fast, accurate deformable-object predictions, outperforming PhysTwin in speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Learning physics-consistent dynamics for deformable objects from limited real-world video is data-hungry and challenging; there is a need for diverse, plausible demonstrations and a model that generalizes to novel interactions.

Method: 1) Construct a physics-consistent digital twin by selecting constitutive models and performing global-to-local optimization of material properties in an MPM simulator. 2) Apply part-aware perturbations to physical properties to generate diverse motion patterns and demonstrations. 3) Train a lightweight graph neural network-based world model embedded with physical properties using these demonstrations. 4) Refine physical properties with real video data.

Result: The approach yields accurate and fast future predictions for deformable objects and generalizes to novel interactions, with inference speeds about 47× faster than the state-of-the-art PhysTwin while maintaining competitive accuracy.

Conclusion: Simulator-synthesized, physics-aware demonstrations enable efficient, data-effective world models for deformable objects, with the real video data available to further fine-tune the physical properties and extend generalization.

Abstract: Interactive world models that simulate object dynamics are crucial for
robotics, VR, and AR. However, it remains a significant challenge to learn
physics-consistent dynamics models from limited real-world video data,
especially for deformable objects with spatially-varying physical properties.
To overcome the challenge of data scarcity, we propose PhysWorld, a novel
framework that utilizes a simulator to synthesize physically plausible and
diverse demonstrations to learn efficient world models. Specifically, we first
construct a physics-consistent digital twin within MPM simulator via
constitutive model selection and global-to-local optimization of physical
properties. Subsequently, we apply part-aware perturbations to the physical
properties and generate various motion patterns for the digital twin,
synthesizing extensive and diverse demonstrations. Finally, using these
demonstrations, we train a lightweight GNN-based world model that is embedded
with physical properties. The real video can be used to further refine the
physical properties. PhysWorld achieves accurate and fast future predictions
for various deformable objects, and also generalizes well to novel
interactions. Experiments show that PhysWorld has competitive performance while
enabling inference speeds 47 times faster than the recent state-of-the-art
method, i.e., PhysTwin.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduces Spatial Intelligence Grid (SIG), a grid-based scene representation to assess and improve visual-spatial intelligence in foundation models, with SIG-informed metrics and SIGBench dataset; shows improvements over VQA-based approaches in few-shot multimodal LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VSI proxies rely on textual prompts and VQA-style scoring, which mask geometry, invite shortcuts, and entangle language priors with spatial ability. A faithful, compositional scene representation is needed for robust VSI evaluation and training.

Method: Proposes SIG: a structured, grid-based encoding of object layouts, relations, and priors; derives SIG-informed metrics to quantify intrinsic VSI; evaluates in few-shot in-context learning with state-of-the-art multimodal LLMs (GPT- and Gemini-family); releases SIGBench with 1.4K driving frames annotated with ground-truth SIG labels and human gaze traces.

Result: SIG yields larger, more stable, and more comprehensive gains across VSI metrics compared to VQA-only representations; demonstrates promise as a data-labeling and training schema for learning VSI; SIGBench supports grid-based machine VSI tasks and attention-driven, human-like VSI tasks in autonomous-driving scenarios.

Conclusion: SIG provides a faithful, compositional representation that better supports VSI evaluation and training; shows potential to decouple spatial reasoning from language priors and to improve driving-scene understanding. Further work needed on scalability, generalization to non-driving domains, and dynamic scenes.

Abstract: How to integrate and verify spatial intelligence in foundation models remains
an open challenge. Current practice often proxies Visual-Spatial Intelligence
(VSI) with purely textual prompts and VQA-style scoring, which obscures
geometry, invites linguistic shortcuts, and weakens attribution to genuinely
spatial skills. We introduce Spatial Intelligence Grid (SIG): a structured,
grid-based schema that explicitly encodes object layouts, inter-object
relations, and physically grounded priors. As a complementary channel to text,
SIG provides a faithful, compositional representation of scene structure for
foundation-model reasoning. Building on SIG, we derive SIG-informed evaluation
metrics that quantify a model's intrinsic VSI, which separates spatial
capability from language priors. In few-shot in-context learning with
state-of-the-art multimodal LLMs (e.g. GPT- and Gemini-family models), SIG
yields consistently larger, more stable, and more comprehensive gains across
all VSI metrics compared to VQA-only representations, indicating its promise as
a data-labeling and training schema for learning VSI. We also release SIGBench,
a benchmark of 1.4K driving frames annotated with ground-truth SIG labels and
human gaze traces, supporting both grid-based machine VSI tasks and
attention-driven, human-like VSI tasks in autonomous-driving scenarios.

*Dogyun Park,Taehoon Lee,Minseok Joo,Hyunwoo J. Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Blockwise Flow Matching (BFM) splits the generative trajectory into temporal blocks with specialized velocity blocks, complemented by semantic guidance and a residual-approximation strategy, achieving higher efficiency and competitive fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Single large flow-matching networks struggle to capture distinct signal characteristics across timesteps and incur high inference costs due to iterating the full model.

Method: Partition the generative trajectory into multiple temporal blocks, each modeled by a smaller velocity block; introduce Semantic Feature Guidance to condition blocks on pretrained semantic representations; apply a lightweight Feature Residual Approximation to preserve quality while reducing computation.

Result: On ImageNet 256x256, BFM attains a substantially improved Pareto frontier, delivering 2.1x to 4.9x faster inference with comparable generation performance; code available at the provided GitHub link.

Conclusion: Blockwise specialization with semantic conditioning improves efficiency and sample quality for flow-based generative models, representing a scalable approach to enhance Flow Matching.

Abstract: Recently, Flow Matching models have pushed the boundaries of high-fidelity
data generation across a wide range of domains. It typically employs a single
large network to learn the entire generative trajectory from noise to data.
Despite their effectiveness, this design struggles to capture distinct signal
characteristics across timesteps simultaneously and incurs substantial
inference costs due to the iterative evaluation of the entire model. To address
these limitations, we propose Blockwise Flow Matching (BFM), a novel framework
that partitions the generative trajectory into multiple temporal segments, each
modeled by smaller but specialized velocity blocks. This blockwise design
enables each block to specialize effectively in its designated interval,
improving inference efficiency and sample quality. To further enhance
generation fidelity, we introduce a Semantic Feature Guidance module that
explicitly conditions velocity blocks on semantically rich features aligned
with pretrained representations. Additionally, we propose a lightweight Feature
Residual Approximation strategy that preserves semantic quality while
significantly reducing inference cost. Extensive experiments on ImageNet
256x256 demonstrate that BFM establishes a substantially improved Pareto
frontier over existing Flow Matching methods, achieving 2.1x to 4.9x
accelerations in inference complexity at comparable generation performance.

TL;DR: MATrack is a three-module, multiscale adaptive tracker designed for nighttime UAV tracking, achieving improved accuracy while running in real time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Nighttime UAV tracking is hampered by low-light conditions, cluttered backgrounds, and viewpoint changes, causing drift; existing low-light enhancement and domain adaptation approaches have artifacts, high computation, or misuse dynamic information.

Method: The system comprises three core modules: Multiscale Hierarchy Blende (MHB) to align static and dynamic templates, Adaptive Key Token Gate to distinguish object information in complex backgrounds, and Nighttime Template Calibrator (NTC) to stabilize tracking over long sequences, enabling real-time operation (~81 FPS).

Result: On UAVDark135, MATrack improves precision, normalized precision, and AUC by 5.9%, 5.4%, and 4.2% respectively over SOTA methods, and is validated by real-world UAV platform experiments.

Conclusion: MATrack provides stable, reliable nighttime tracking for UAVs and shows strong potential for practical robotics applications such as nighttime search and rescue and border patrol.

Abstract: Nighttime UAV tracking faces significant challenges in real-world robotics
operations. Low-light conditions not only limit visual perception capabilities,
but cluttered backgrounds and frequent viewpoint changes also cause existing
trackers to drift or fail during deployment. To address these difficulties,
researchers have proposed solutions based on low-light enhancement and domain
adaptation. However, these methods still have notable shortcomings in actual
UAV systems: low-light enhancement often introduces visual artifacts, domain
adaptation methods are computationally expensive and existing lightweight
designs struggle to fully leverage dynamic object information. Based on an
in-depth analysis of these key issues, we propose MATrack-a multiscale adaptive
system designed specifically for nighttime UAV tracking. MATrack tackles the
main technical challenges of nighttime tracking through the collaborative work
of three core modules: Multiscale Hierarchy Blende (MHB) enhances feature
consistency between static and dynamic templates. Adaptive Key Token Gate
accurately identifies object information within complex backgrounds. Nighttime
Template Calibrator (NTC) ensures stable tracking performance over long
sequences. Extensive experiments show that MATrack achieves a significant
performance improvement. On the UAVDark135 benchmark, its precision, normalized
precision and AUC surpass state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods by 5.9%, 5.4% and
4.2% respectively, while maintaining a real-time processing speed of 81 FPS.
Further tests on a real-world UAV platform validate the system's reliability,
demonstrating that MATrack can provide stable and effective nighttime UAV
tracking support for critical robotics applications such as nighttime search
and rescue and border patrol.

Motivation: Single textual space alignment in CLIP-based anomaly detection struggles to capture the varied semantics of anomalies across diverse objects and domains; a token-level, adaptable alignment is needed to better model fine-grained anomalies.

Method: Expand the textual space into a set of orthogonal subspaces and dynamically assign visual tokens to subspaces through an optimal transport plan based on semantic similarity. Solve OT to obtain a token-to-subspace transport plan, apply a top-k mask to sparsify and specialize subspaces for distinct regions, enabling token-wise adaptation.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate TokenCLIP's superior performance over baselines in anomaly detection scenarios, including zero-shot/adaptation to unseen objects.

Conclusion: TokenCLIP provides a principled token-wise adaptive alignment framework that leverages OT to diversify semantics across textual subspaces, yielding improved fine-grained anomaly learning and better generalization to unseen objects.

Abstract: Adapting CLIP for anomaly detection on unseen objects has shown strong
potential in a zero-shot manner. However, existing methods typically rely on a
single textual space to align with visual semantics across diverse objects and
domains. The indiscriminate alignment hinders the model from accurately
capturing varied anomaly semantics. We propose TokenCLIP, a token-wise
adaptation framework that enables dynamic alignment between visual and
learnable textual spaces for fine-grained anomaly learning. Rather than mapping
all visual tokens to a single, token-agnostic textual space, TokenCLIP aligns
each token with a customized textual subspace that represents its visual
characteristics. Explicitly assigning a unique learnable textual space to each
token is computationally intractable and prone to insufficient optimization. We
instead expand the token-agnostic textual space into a set of orthogonal
subspaces, and then dynamically assign each token to a subspace combination
guided by semantic affinity, which jointly supports customized and efficient
token-wise adaptation. To this end, we formulate dynamic alignment as an
optimal transport problem, where all visual tokens in an image are transported
to textual subspaces based on semantic similarity. The transport constraints of
OT ensure sufficient optimization across subspaces and encourage them to focus
on different semantics. Solving the problem yields a transport plan that
adaptively assigns each token to semantically relevant subspaces. A top-k
masking is then applied to sparsify the plan and specialize subspaces for
distinct visual regions. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of
TokenCLIP.

### [25] [KBE-DME: Dynamic Multimodal Evaluation via Knowledge Enhanced Benchmark Evolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21182)
*Junzhe Zhang,Huixuan Zhang,Xiaojun Wan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Dynamic, knowledge-enhanced benchmark evolution (KBE) for multimodal LLM evaluation, using graph-based VQA representation to turn static benchmarks into controllable, evolving tests that mitigate data contamination and saturation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Static multimodal benchmarks risk data leakage and saturation, hindering reliable evaluation of MLLMs; a dynamic, knowledge-integrated framework is needed.

Method: Represent VQA samples with graphs; analyze a static benchmark; expand by integrating multimodal knowledge; reconstruct questions by re-selecting visual information; expand questions with external textual knowledge; enable difficulty control by varying question exploration; validate with experiments showing reduced contamination/saturation and richer assessment.

Result: KBE reduces data contamination and saturation and provides a more comprehensive, controllable evaluation of MLLMs, demonstrating improved reliability on benchmarks.

Conclusion: Graph-based, knowledge-enhanced benchmark evolution offers a robust, dynamic evaluation protocol for multimodal LLMs with controllable difficulty and mitigated data issues.

Abstract: The rapid progress of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) calls for more
reliable evaluation protocols. Existing static benchmarks suffer from the
potential risk of data contamination and saturation, leading to inflated or
misleading performance evaluations. To address these issues, we first apply
Graph formulation to represent a static or dynamic VQA sample. With the
formulation, we propose Knowledge-enhanced Benchmark Evolution(KBE), a dynamic
multimodal evaluation framework. KBE first analyzes the original static
benchmark, then expands it by integrating multimodal knowledge, transforming
the static benchmark into a controllable, dynamic evolving version. Crucially,
KBE can both reconstruct questions by Re-selecting visual information in the
original image and expand existing questions with external textual knowledge.
It enables difficulty-controllable evaluation by adjusting the degree of
question exploration. Extensive experiments demonstrate that KBE alleviates the
risk of data contamination, data saturation, and provides a more comprehensive
assessment of MLLM capabilities.

### [28] [Improved Training Technique for Shortcut Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21250)
*Anh Nguyen,Viet Nguyen,Duc Vu,Trung Dao,Chi Tran,Toan Tran,Anh Tran*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: iSM is a unified training framework for shortcut models that fixes five bottlenecks with four components—Intrinsic Guidance, Multi-Level Wavelet Loss, Scaling Optimal Transport, and Twin EMA—yielding substantial FID gains on ImageNet 256×256 across one-, few-, and multi-step sampling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Shortcut models promise flexible sampling (one-/few-/multi-step) from a single network but suffer five core issues: compounding guidance, inflexible guidance, a low-frequency bias from using direct-domain distances, divergence between EMA training and self-consistency, and curvy flow trajectories that hinder convergence.

Method: Four contributions: Intrinsic Guidance (dynamic guidance strength), Multi-Level Wavelet Loss (mitigate frequency bias and preserve high-frequency details), Scaling Optimal Transport (reduce training variance and straighten generative paths), and Twin EMA (reconcile training stability with self-consistency); evaluation on ImageNet 256×256 across one-/few-/multi-step generation with FID as primary metric.

Result: Substantial improvements in FID over baseline shortcut models across one-step, few-step, and multi-step generation on ImageNet 256×256.

Conclusion: iSM makes shortcut models a viable and competitive class of generative models by resolving key bottlenecks through a unified training framework.

Abstract: Shortcut models represent a promising, non-adversarial paradigm for
generative modeling, uniquely supporting one-step, few-step, and multi-step
sampling from a single trained network. However, their widespread adoption has
been stymied by critical performance bottlenecks. This paper tackles the five
core issues that held shortcut models back: (1) the hidden flaw of compounding
guidance, which we are the first to formalize, causing severe image artifacts;
(2) inflexible fixed guidance that restricts inference-time control; (3) a
pervasive frequency bias driven by a reliance on low-level distances in the
direct domain, which biases reconstructions toward low frequencies; (4)
divergent self-consistency arising from a conflict with EMA training; and (5)
curvy flow trajectories that impede convergence. To address these challenges,
we introduce iSM, a unified training framework that systematically resolves
each limitation. Our framework is built on four key improvements: Intrinsic
Guidance provides explicit, dynamic control over guidance strength, resolving
both compounding guidance and inflexibility. A Multi-Level Wavelet Loss
mitigates frequency bias to restore high-frequency details. Scaling Optimal
Transport (sOT) reduces training variance and learns straighter, more stable
generative paths. Finally, a Twin EMA strategy reconciles training stability
with self-consistency. Extensive experiments on ImageNet 256 x 256 demonstrate
that our approach yields substantial FID improvements over baseline shortcut
models across one-step, few-step, and multi-step generation, making shortcut
models a viable and competitive class of generative models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TSSR is a parallel DDM framework for high-quality 3D artist-style meshes, decoupling topology sculpting from refinement to achieve up to 10k faces at 1024^3.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To achieve highly accurate token prediction while enabling parallel generation, addressing the inefficiency of sequential autoregressive methods by allowing the model to see all mesh tokens concurrently for greater efficiency and control.

Method: 1) Decoupled Training and Hybrid Inference separating topology sculpting from shape refinement. 2) Improved Hourglass Architecture with bidirectional attention and face-vertex-sequence Rotational Positional Embeddings (RoPE). 3) Novel Connection Loss acting as a topological constraint.

Result: Extensive experiments on complex datasets show TSSR can generate high-quality 3D artist-style meshes, achieving up to 10,000 faces at a spatial resolution of 1024^3; code to be released at the provided GitHub link.

Conclusion: TSSR demonstrates effective parallel mesh generation with enhanced topology capture and realism, offering improved efficiency and control over traditional autoregressive methods.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce Topology Sculptor, Shape Refiner (TSSR), a novel
method for generating high-quality, artist-style 3D meshes based on Discrete
Diffusion Models (DDMs). Our primary motivation for TSSR is to achieve highly
accurate token prediction while enabling parallel generation, a significant
advantage over sequential autoregressive methods. By allowing TSSR to "see" all
mesh tokens concurrently, we unlock a new level of efficiency and control. We
leverage this parallel generation capability through three key innovations: 1)
Decoupled Training and Hybrid Inference, which distinctly separates the
DDM-based generation into a topology sculpting stage and a subsequent shape
refinement stage. This strategic decoupling enables TSSR to effectively capture
both intricate local topology and overarching global shape. 2) An Improved
Hourglass Architecture, featuring bidirectional attention enriched by
face-vertex-sequence level Rotational Positional Embeddings (RoPE), thereby
capturing richer contextual information across the mesh structure. 3) A novel
Connection Loss, which acts as a topological constraint to further enhance the
realism and fidelity of the generated meshes. Extensive experiments on complex
datasets demonstrate that TSSR generates high-quality 3D artist-style meshes,
capable of achieving up to 10,000 faces at a remarkable spatial resolution of
$1024^3$. The code will be released at:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SAGE-3D extends 3D Gaussian Splatting to be semantically and physically grounded for 3D navigation, introducing InteriorGS and SAGE-Bench; it improves VLN performance on unseen tasks and enables executable environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3DGS provides photorealistic 3D scenes for fast rendering but lacks fine-grained semantics and physical executability, which limits Visual-Language Navigation (VLN) and sim-to-real transfer.

Method: Introduce two components: (1) Object-Centric Semantic Grounding adding object-level annotations to 3DGS, and (2) Physics-Aware Execution Jointing embedding collision objects and rich physical interfaces. Release InteriorGS (1K object-annotated indoor scenes) and SAGE-Bench (a 3DGS-based VLN benchmark with 2M VLN data).

Result: 3DGS data are harder to converge but show strong generalizability; the approach improves baseline performance by 31% on the VLN-CE Unseen task.

Conclusion: The data and code will be released soon; SAGE-3D provides an executable, semantically aligned 3D navigation environment that bridges semantics and physics with 3DGS.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), a 3D representation method with photorealistic
real-time rendering capabilities, is regarded as an effective tool for
narrowing the sim-to-real gap. However, it lacks fine-grained semantics and
physical executability for Visual-Language Navigation (VLN). To address this,
we propose SAGE-3D (Semantically and Physically Aligned Gaussian Environments
for 3D Navigation), a new paradigm that upgrades 3DGS into an executable,
semantically and physically aligned environment. It comprises two components:
(1) Object-Centric Semantic Grounding, which adds object-level fine-grained
annotations to 3DGS; and (2) Physics-Aware Execution Jointing, which embeds
collision objects into 3DGS and constructs rich physical interfaces. We release
InteriorGS, containing 1K object-annotated 3DGS indoor scene data, and
introduce SAGE-Bench, the first 3DGS-based VLN benchmark with 2M VLN data.
Experiments show that 3DGS scene data is more difficult to converge, while
exhibiting strong generalizability, improving baseline performance by 31% on
the VLN-CE Unseen task. The data and code will be available soon.

### [31] [FineRS: Fine-grained Reasoning and Segmentation of Small Objects with Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21311)
*Lu Zhang,Jiazuo Yu,Haomiao Xiong,Ping Hu,Yunzhi Zhuge,Huchuan Lu,You He*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A two-stage reinforcement learning framework, FineRS, enables precise localization and segmentation of extremely small objects in high-resolution scenes by combining coarse global reasoning with local refinement, plus a new FineRS-4k dataset; it outperforms state-of-the-art MLLMs on instruction-guided segmentation and visual reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs struggle to understand and localize tiny objects in high-resolution images due to restricted input resolutions and cluttered contexts, limiting precise segmentation and attribute-level reasoning.

Method: FineRS employs a coarse-to-fine pipeline: Global Semantic Exploration (GSE) generates a text-based reasoning and a coarse target region; Localized Perceptual Refinement (LPR) refines this region to an accurate bounding box and segmentation mask. A locate-informed retrospective reward couples the stages by using LPR outputs to optimize GSE. A new dataset, FineRS-4k, evaluates attribute-level reasoning and pixel-level segmentation of subtle, small-scale targets in complex scenes.

Result: Experiments on FineRS-4k and public datasets show that FineRS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art MLLM-based approaches on both instruction-guided segmentation and visual reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed FineRS framework effectively addresses high-resolution object localization challenges in MLLMs, enabling accurate segmentation of extremely small objects and improved attribute-level reasoning in complex scenes, validated by strong results on FineRS-4k and public benchmarks.

Abstract: Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities
across a wide range of vision-language tasks. However, due to the restricted
input resolutions, MLLMs face significant challenges in precisely understanding
and localizing visual details in high-resolution images -- particularly when
dealing with extra-small objects embedded in cluttered contexts. To address
this issue, we propose \textsc{FineRS}, a two-stage MLLM-based reinforcement
learning framework for jointly reasoning and segmenting extremely small objects
within high-resolution scenes. \textsc{FineRS} adopts a coarse-to-fine pipeline
comprising Global Semantic Exploration (GSE) and Localized Perceptual
Refinement (LPR). Specifically, GSE performs instruction-guided reasoning to
generate a textural response and a coarse target region, while LPR refines this
region to produce an accurate bounding box and segmentation mask. To couple the
two stages, we introduce a locate-informed retrospective reward, where LPR's
outputs are used to optimize GSE for more robust coarse region exploration. %
Additionally, we present \textsc{FineRS}-4k, a new dataset for evaluating MLLMs
on attribute-level reasoning and pixel-level segmentation on subtle,
small-scale targets in complex high-resolution scenes. Experimental results on
\textsc{FineRS}-4k and public datasets demonstrate that our method consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art MLLM-based approaches on both instruction-guided
segmentation and visual reasoning tasks.

*Shufan Shen,Junshu Sun,Qingming Huang,Shuhui Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VL-SAE is a sparse autoencoder that interprets vision-language representations by mapping hidden neurons to semantic concepts, enforcing consistent activations for semantically similar multi-modal representations, and improving alignment and downstream task performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Interpretability of vision-language alignment is limited because multi-modal semantics are hard to map to a unified concept set; providing a concept-level interpretation and boosting alignment performance.

Method: Propose VL-SAE with a distance-based encoder and two modality-specific decoders; enforce neuron-concept correlations by ensuring semantically similar representations produce consistent activations via self-supervised training; use explicit cosine-based alignment to measure semantic similarity, align representations and correlate neurons to concepts.

Result: Empirical results on CLIP, LLaVA show VL-SAE can interpret and enhance vision-language alignment; improves zero-shot classification and reduces hallucinations; code released.

Conclusion: VL-SAE offers a unified concept-based interpretation of vision-language alignment and strengthens it at the concept level, enabling better interpretability and performance in VLMs.

Abstract: The alignment of vision-language representations endows current
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) with strong multi-modal reasoning capabilities.
However, the interpretability of the alignment component remains uninvestigated
due to the difficulty in mapping the semantics of multi-modal representations
into a unified concept set. To address this problem, we propose VL-SAE, a
sparse autoencoder that encodes vision-language representations into its hidden
activations. Each neuron in its hidden layer correlates to a concept
represented by semantically similar images and texts, thereby interpreting
these representations with a unified concept set. To establish the
neuron-concept correlation, we encourage semantically similar representations
to exhibit consistent neuron activations during self-supervised training.
First, to measure the semantic similarity of multi-modal representations, we
perform their alignment in an explicit form based on cosine similarity. Second,
we construct the VL-SAE with a distance-based encoder and two modality-specific
decoders to ensure the activation consistency of semantically similar
representations. Experiments across multiple VLMs (e.g., CLIP, LLaVA)
demonstrate the superior capability of VL-SAE in interpreting and enhancing the
vision-language alignment. For interpretation, the alignment between vision and
language representations can be understood by comparing their semantics with
concepts. For enhancement, the alignment can be strengthened by aligning
vision-language representations at the concept level, contributing to
performance improvements in downstream tasks, including zero-shot image
classification and hallucination elimination. Codes are available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FORM is a 3D cellular morphology prediction framework using a multi-channel VQGAN encoder and a diffusion-based perturbation model to predict and simulate perturbation-induced morphological changes, linking morphology to signaling and function.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current computational models are limited to 2D representations, missing the complexity of 3D cell morphology under perturbations; a 3D virtual cell framework is needed to better predict cellular responses and perturbation effects.

Method: FORM consists of two parts: (1) a morphology encoder trained end-to-end via a novel multi-channel VQGAN to learn compact 3D representations of cell shape from large-scale 3D fluorescence volumes; (2) a diffusion-based perturbation trajectory module that models how morphology evolves across perturbation conditions. It is trained on >65,000 3D cell volumes, supports unconditional morphology synthesis and conditional perturbation simulation, and enables downstream predictions (signalling activity, combinatorial perturbations, morphodynamic transitions).

Result: FORM enables generation and conditional simulation of perturbed 3D cell morphologies, predicts downstream signalling, and models effects of combinatorial and unseen perturbations. Evaluation is facilitated by MorphoEval, a benchmarking suite assessing perturbation-induced morphological changes across structural, statistical, and biological dimensions.

Conclusion: FORM and MorphoEval move toward a 3D virtual cell by linking morphology, perturbation, and function through high-resolution predictive simulation.

Abstract: Understanding how cells respond to external stimuli is a central challenge in
biomedical research and drug development. Current computational frameworks for
modelling cellular responses remain restricted to two-dimensional
representations, limiting their capacity to capture the complexity of cell
morphology under perturbation. This dimensional constraint poses a critical
bottleneck for the development of accurate virtual cell models. Here, we
present FORM, a machine learning framework for predicting perturbation-induced
changes in three-dimensional cellular structure. FORM consists of two
components: a morphology encoder, trained end-to-end via a novel multi-channel
VQGAN to learn compact 3D representations of cell shape, and a diffusion-based
perturbation trajectory module that captures how morphology evolves across
perturbation conditions. Trained on a large-scale dataset of over 65,000
multi-fluorescence 3D cell volumes spanning diverse chemical and genetic
perturbations, FORM supports both unconditional morphology synthesis and
conditional simulation of perturbed cell states. Beyond generation, FORM can
predict downstream signalling activity, simulate combinatorial perturbation
effects, and model morphodynamic transitions between states of unseen
perturbations. To evaluate performance, we introduce MorphoEval, a benchmarking
suite that quantifies perturbation-induced morphological changes in structural,
statistical, and biological dimensions. Together, FORM and MorphoEval work
toward the realisation of the 3D virtual cell by linking morphology,
perturbation, and function through high-resolution predictive simulation.

TL;DR: A CNN-Transformer-CLIP (CT-CLIP) framework fuses local lesion details and global structure via AFFM, enhanced by multimodal image-text alignment using CLIP to boost apple disease recognition in complex environments, achieving near 97% accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome phenotypic heterogeneity and background complexity in apple leaf diseases, which challenge traditional multi-scale CNN fusion methods that neglect local-global relationships, especially under few-shot conditions.

Method: A multi-branch architecture combining a CNN for local features and a Vision Transformer for global relationships, an Adaptive Feature Fusion Module (AFFM) for dynamic fusion of local and global features, and a multimodal image-text learning approach using pre-trained CLIP weights to align visual features with semantic disease descriptions.

Result: CT-CLIP achieved 97.38% accuracy on a public apple disease dataset and 96.12% on a self-built dataset, outperforming several baselines and demonstrating strong performance under complex environmental conditions and low-shot scenarios.

Conclusion: CT-CLIP provides an effective, practical solution for automated agricultural disease recognition by robustly integrating local/global information and semantic alignment, with strong performance under challenging environments.

Abstract: In complex orchard environments, the phenotypic heterogeneity of different
apple leaf diseases, characterized by significant variation among lesions,
poses a challenge to traditional multi-scale feature fusion methods. These
methods only integrate multi-layer features extracted by convolutional neural
networks (CNNs) and fail to adequately account for the relationships between
local and global features. Therefore, this study proposes a multi-branch
recognition framework named CNN-Transformer-CLIP (CT-CLIP). The framework
synergistically employs a CNN to extract local lesion detail features and a
Vision Transformer to capture global structural relationships. An Adaptive
Feature Fusion Module (AFFM) then dynamically fuses these features, achieving
optimal coupling of local and global information and effectively addressing the
diversity in lesion morphology and distribution. Additionally, to mitigate
interference from complex backgrounds and significantly enhance recognition
accuracy under few-shot conditions, this study proposes a multimodal image-text
learning approach. By leveraging pre-trained CLIP weights, it achieves deep
alignment between visual features and disease semantic descriptions.
Experimental results show that CT-CLIP achieves accuracies of 97.38% and 96.12%
on a publicly available apple disease and a self-built dataset, outperforming
several baseline methods. The proposed CT-CLIP demonstrates strong capabilities
in recognizing agricultural diseases, significantly enhances identification
accuracy under complex environmental conditions, provides an innovative and
practical solution for automated disease recognition in agricultural
applications.

TL;DR: Introduces Dynamic Semantic Relevance Generator for UAV tracking, integrating it with Transformer-based correlation and a pruning strategy to produce speed–accuracy variants; achieves competitive results on UAV datasets; code released.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current UAV trackers emphasize speed over semantic awareness, which limits the ability to extract accurate localization information from the template within the search region, reducing robustness under camera motion, fast motion, and low resolution.

Method: Proposes a Dynamic Semantic Relevance Generator (DSRG) that works with the Transformer's correlation map to mine semantic relevance and refine the search region; includes a pruning method to generate multiple model variants that trade off speed and accuracy for flexible deployment.

Result: Experiments on multiple UAV tracking datasets show improved accuracy and robustness, with competitive performance; the method offers flexible speed–accuracy trade-offs and outperforms baselines under challenging conditions.

Conclusion: Dynamic semantic-aware correlation modeling enhances UAV tracking robustness and accuracy, with deployable variants for different resource budgets; code is available at the authors’ GitHub.

Abstract: UAV tracking can be widely applied in scenarios such as disaster rescue,
environmental monitoring, and logistics transportation. However, existing UAV
tracking methods predominantly emphasize speed and lack exploration in semantic
awareness, which hinders the search region from extracting accurate
localization information from the template. The limitation results in
suboptimal performance under typical UAV tracking challenges such as camera
motion, fast motion, and low resolution, etc. To address this issue, we propose
a dynamic semantic aware correlation modeling tracking framework. The core of
our framework is a Dynamic Semantic Relevance Generator, which, in combination
with the correlation map from the Transformer, explore semantic relevance. The
approach enhances the search region's ability to extract important information
from the template, improving accuracy and robustness under the aforementioned
challenges. Additionally, to enhance the tracking speed, we design a pruning
method for the proposed framework. Therefore, we present multiple model
variants that achieve trade-offs between speed and accuracy, enabling flexible
deployment according to the available computational resources. Experimental
results validate the effectiveness of our method, achieving competitive
performance on multiple UAV tracking datasets. The code is available at

*Anupam Pani,Yanchao Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Gaze-guided training for egocentric VLMs using a gaze-regularized attention mechanism, trained with gaze data only during training, yielding improvements across architectures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human gaze reflects attention, short-term intent, and future actions. Leveraging gaze during training can align model attention with human vision to improve egocentric understanding tasks and overcome limitations of relying solely on visual input or using gaze at inference.

Method: Introduce a gaze-regularized attention mechanism that uses eye-tracking data during training to steer VLM attention to human gaze regions. The approach is modular and architecture-agnostic, compatible with various attention-based VLMs, and uses gaze supervision only during training (no gaze at test time).

Result: Semantic prediction scores improve by up to 11 points for fine-grained future event prediction and by about 7 points for current activity understanding compared with baselines trained without gaze regularization.

Conclusion: Gaze-guided training enhances the accuracy and robustness of egocentric VLMs and lays a foundation for incorporating human gaze in real-world applications like assistive robotics and human–machine collaboration; code is available at the provided GitHub link.

Abstract: Eye gaze offers valuable cues about attention, short-term intent, and future
actions, making it a powerful signal for modeling egocentric behavior. In this
work, we propose a gaze-regularized framework that enhances VLMs for two key
egocentric understanding tasks: fine-grained future event prediction and
current activity understanding. Unlike prior approaches that rely solely on
visual inputs or use gaze as an auxiliary input signal , our method uses gaze
only during training. We introduce a gaze-regularized attention mechanism that
aligns model focus with human visual gaze. This design is flexible and modular,
allowing it to generalize across multiple VLM architectures that utilize
attention. Experimental results show that our approach improves semantic
prediction scores by up to 11 for future event prediction and around 7 for
current activity understanding, compared to the corresponding baseline models
trained without gaze regularization. These results highlight the value of
gaze-guided training in improving the accuracy and robustness of egocentric
VLMs. Overall, this work establishes a foundation for using human gaze to
enhance the predictive capabilities of VLMs in real-world scenarios like
assistive robots and human-machine collaboration. Code and additional

TL;DR: A unified 2.5D U-Net++ model for sCT from MRI/CBCT using cross-region training and an IMPACT-Synth perceptual loss; registration strategy strongly affects evaluation, with IMPACT improving anatomical fidelity and reducing bias.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To advance high-fidelity synthetic CT generation for radiotherapy by exploring (i) cross-region training with region-specific fine-tuning, (ii) a perceptual loss (IMPACT-Synth) for structural fidelity, and (iii) registration strategies to mitigate bias and ensure anatomically consistent evaluation.

Method: A 2.5D U-Net++ with a ResNet-34 encoder trained jointly across anatomical regions, with per-region fine-tuning. Loss combines pixel-wise L1 and IMPACT-Synth perceptual loss derived from SAM and TotalSegmentator. Training uses AdamW on patch-based, normalized, body-masked inputs (MRI 320x320, CBCT 256x256) with random flipping; no post-processing; test-time augmentation and five-fold ensembling. Two registration strategies evaluated: Elastix with mutual information, and IMPACT-based feature similarity. Evaluation shows local data favoring IMPACT; public data showing Elastix bias.

Result: On local test sets, IMPACT-based registration yielded more accurate, anatomically consistent alignments, lower MAE, and more realistic structures. On the public validation set, Elastix-aligned data achieved higher scores due to a registration bias in the evaluation pipeline. This demonstrates that registration errors can propagate into supervised learning, inflating performance metrics while hurting anatomical fidelity. Adopting IMPACT reduces this bias and supports more robust, generalizable sCT synthesis.

Conclusion: Registration bias can dominate evaluation of sCT models; using perceptual/feature-based alignment (IMPACT) mitigates this bias and improves anatomical fidelity, enabling more robust generalization. The combination of cross-region training, a perceptual loss, and carefully chosen registration strategies yields a more faithful sCT synthesis pipeline.

Abstract: We participated in the SynthRAD2025 challenge (Tasks 1 and 2) with a unified
pipeline for synthetic CT (sCT) generation from MRI and CBCT, implemented using
the KonfAI framework. Our model is a 2.5D U-Net++ with a ResNet-34 encoder,
trained jointly across anatomical regions and fine-tuned per region. The loss
function combined pixel-wise L1 loss with IMPACT-Synth, a perceptual loss
derived from SAM and TotalSegmentator to enhance structural fidelity. Training
was performed using AdamW (initial learning rate = 0.001, halved every 25k
steps) on patch-based, normalized, body-masked inputs (320x320 for MRI, 256x256
for CBCT), with random flipping as the only augmentation. No post-processing
was applied. Final predictions leveraged test-time augmentation and five-fold
ensembling. The best model was selected based on validation MAE. Two
registration strategies were evaluated: (i) Elastix with mutual information,
consistent with the challenge pipeline, and (ii) IMPACT, a feature-based
similarity metric leveraging pretrained segmentation networks. On the local
test sets, IMPACT-based registration achieved more accurate and anatomically
consistent alignments than mutual-information-based registration, resulting in
improved sCT synthesis with lower MAE and more realistic anatomical structures.
On the public validation set, however, models trained with Elastix-aligned data
achieved higher scores, reflecting a registration bias favoring alignment
strategies consistent with the evaluation pipeline. This highlights how
registration errors can propagate into supervised learning, influencing both
training and evaluation, and potentially inflating performance metrics at the
expense of anatomical fidelity. By promoting anatomically consistent alignment,
IMPACT helps mitigate this bias and supports the development of more robust and
generalizable sCT synthesis models.

### [38] [BADiff: Bandwidth Adaptive Diffusion Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21366)
*Xi Zhang,Hanwei Zhu,Yan Zhong,Jiamang Wang,Weisi Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: An end-to-end trained diffusion model uses a bandwidth-derived quality cue to adapt its denoising trajectory, enabling early-stopped generation that preserves perceptual quality under limited bandwidth.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bandwidth constraints in cloud-to-device delivery degrade image quality and render fixed-step diffusion generation inefficient. There is a need for adaptive generation that respects transmission budgets.

Method: Joint end-to-end training where the diffusion model is conditioned on a target quality level derived from available bandwidth. The model learns to modulate the denoising process with a lightweight quality embedding, enabling early-stop sampling while maintaining the desired perceptual quality, with minimal architectural changes.

Result: Experimental results show substantial improvements in visual fidelity for bandwidth-adapted generations compared to naive early-stopping, demonstrating the practicality of bandwidth-aware diffusion for efficient image delivery; code is provided at the linked repository.

Conclusion: The approach is a promising direction for bandwidth-aware diffusion generation, offering efficient, adaptable image delivery in bandwidth-constrained environments with minimal modifications to existing architectures.

Abstract: In this work, we propose a novel framework to enable diffusion models to
adapt their generation quality based on real-time network bandwidth
constraints. Traditional diffusion models produce high-fidelity images by
performing a fixed number of denoising steps, regardless of downstream
transmission limitations. However, in practical cloud-to-device scenarios,
limited bandwidth often necessitates heavy compression, leading to loss of fine
textures and wasted computation. To address this, we introduce a joint
end-to-end training strategy where the diffusion model is conditioned on a
target quality level derived from the available bandwidth. During training, the
model learns to adaptively modulate the denoising process, enabling early-stop
sampling that maintains perceptual quality appropriate to the target
transmission condition. Our method requires minimal architectural changes and
leverages a lightweight quality embedding to guide the denoising trajectory.
Experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly improves the
visual fidelity of bandwidth-adapted generations compared to naive
early-stopping, offering a promising solution for efficient image delivery in
bandwidth-constrained environments. Code is available at:

*Datao Tang,Hao Wang,Yudeng Xin,Hui Qiao,Dongsheng Jiang,Yin Li,Zhiheng Yu,Xiangyong Cao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TerraGen is a unified, spatially controllable layout-to-image framework for remote sensing. It unifies bounding boxes and segmentation masks via a geographic-spatial layout encoder, uses multi-scale injection and mask-weighted loss, and is trained on a 45k-image multi-task dataset. It achieves high-quality generation and serves as universal data augmentation that improves downstream tasks in both full-data and few-shot regimes, with strong cross-task generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current generative data augmentation frameworks are task-specific and neglect geographic information and spatial constraints in remote sensing. There is a need for a unified, spatially controllable generator that can support multiple vision tasks (detection, segmentation, extraction) and leverage geographic layouts.

Method: Introduce a geographic-spatial layout encoder that unifies bounding box and segmentation mask inputs; apply a multi-scale injection scheme and mask-weighted loss to explicitly encode spatial constraints from global structures to fine details; build the first large-scale multi-task remote sensing layout generation dataset (45k images) and propose a standardized evaluation protocol.

Result: TerraGen achieves state-of-the-art generation image quality across diverse remote sensing tasks. As a universal data-augmentation generator, it significantly improves downstream task performance and demonstrates robust cross-task generalization in both full-data and few-shot settings.

Conclusion: TerraGen provides a universal, spatially controllable data generator for remote sensing that enables multi-task layout-to-image synthesis, improves downstream performance, and facilitates cross-task generalization, backed by a large standardized dataset and evaluation protocol.

Abstract: Remote sensing vision tasks require extensive labeled data across multiple,
interconnected domains. However, current generative data augmentation
frameworks are task-isolated, i.e., each vision task requires training an
independent generative model, and ignores the modeling of geographical
information and spatial constraints. To address these issues, we propose
\textbf{TerraGen}, a unified layout-to-image generation framework that enables
flexible, spatially controllable synthesis of remote sensing imagery for
various high-level vision tasks, e.g., detection, segmentation, and extraction.
Specifically, TerraGen introduces a geographic-spatial layout encoder that
unifies bounding box and segmentation mask inputs, combined with a multi-scale
injection scheme and mask-weighted loss to explicitly encode spatial
constraints, from global structures to fine details. Also, we construct the
first large-scale multi-task remote sensing layout generation dataset
containing 45k images and establish a standardized evaluation protocol for this
task. Experimental results show that our TerraGen can achieve the best
generation image quality across diverse tasks. Additionally, TerraGen can be
used as a universal data-augmentation generator, enhancing downstream task
performance significantly and demonstrating robust cross-task generalisation in
both full-data and few-shot scenarios.

*Zhiying Jiang,Ruhao Yan,Zengxi Zhang,Bowei Zhang,Jinyuan Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A depth-consistency-constrained image stitching framework that mitigates parallax via depth-regularized multi-stage alignment and graph-based seam optimization with soft seam diffusion, plus reparameterization for efficiency, achieving natural, seamless results and strong empirical gains with code release.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address parallax-induced ghosting and misalignment in multi-view image stitching caused by significant depth variations, which degrade stitching quality.

Method: 1) A multi-stage alignment framework with global depth regularization constraints to improve alignment of the same apparent target across different depth layers. 2) During fusion, an optimal stitching seam is found using graph-based low-cost computation; a soft-seam region is diffused to accurately locate transition areas, reducing parallax-induced misalignment. 3) A reparameterization strategy optimizes the shift regression-based design to cut computational overhead while preserving or enhancing performance.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate superiority over existing methods, with a public code release at the project repository.

Conclusion: The proposed depth-consistency-constrained stitching pipeline delivers natural, seamless results by improving multi-view alignment under depth-induced parallax, achieving efficient fusion via graph-based seam optimization and reparameterization, and it is validated by comprehensive experiments and a code release.

Abstract: Image stitching synthesizes images captured from multiple perspectives into a
single image with a broader field of view. The significant variations in object
depth often lead to large parallax, resulting in ghosting and misalignment in
the stitched results. To address this, we propose a
depth-consistency-constrained seamless-free image stitching method. First, to
tackle the multi-view alignment difficulties caused by parallax, a multi-stage
mechanism combined with global depth regularization constraints is developed to
enhance the alignment accuracy of the same apparent target across different
depth ranges. Second, during the multi-view image fusion process, an optimal
stitching seam is determined through graph-based low-cost computation, and a
soft-seam region is diffused to precisely locate transition areas, thereby
effectively mitigating alignment errors induced by parallax and achieving
natural and seamless stitching results. Furthermore, considering the
computational overhead in the shift regression process, a reparameterization
strategy is incorporated to optimize the structural design, significantly
improving algorithm efficiency while maintaining optimal performance. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method against
the existing methods. Code is available at https://github.com/DLUT-YRH/DSFN.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduce MUVR, a benchmark and task for untrimmed video retrieval with multi-modal queries, featuring multi-level visual correspondence and three evaluation variants; extensive baselines show current methods' limitations on long videos; code available.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To advance video retrieval for long-video platforms by enabling precise, multi-modal, untrimmed-video matching, addressing the gap where existing benchmarks focus on trimmed videos or single modalities.

Method: Propose MUVR task and benchmark: (1) video-centric multi-modal queries (long text, tag prompts, mask prompts); (2) one-to-many retrieval for untrimmed videos; (3) six-level visual correspondence (copy, event, scene, instance, action, others); (4) three evaluation variants (Base, Filter, QA) plus a Reranking Score; dataset of 53K untrimmed Bilibili videos, 1,050 queries, 84K matches; evaluate 3 video models, 6 image-based VLMs, 10 MLLMs.

Result: Extensive experiments reveal limitations of current retrieval approaches on untrimmed videos and multi-modal queries; MLLMs struggle with multi-video understanding and reranking; establishes baseline performance and diagnostic indicators across models.

Conclusion: MUVR provides a comprehensive, practical benchmark to drive progress in untrimmed, multi-modal video retrieval; code and data released to foster reproducibility and further research; highlights need for improved untrimmed-video understanding and reranking capabilities.

Abstract: We propose the Multi-modal Untrimmed Video Retrieval task, along with a new
benchmark (MUVR) to advance video retrieval for long-video platforms. MUVR aims
to retrieve untrimmed videos containing relevant segments using multi-modal
queries. It has the following features: 1) Practical retrieval paradigm: MUVR
supports video-centric multi-modal queries, expressing fine-grained retrieval
needs through long text descriptions, video tag prompts, and mask prompts. It
adopts a one-to-many retrieval paradigm and focuses on untrimmed videos,
tailored for long-video platform applications. 2) Multi-level visual
correspondence: To cover common video categories (e.g., news, travel, dance)
and precisely define retrieval matching criteria, we construct multi-level
visual correspondence based on core video content (e.g., news events, travel
locations, dance moves) which users are interested in and want to retrieve. It
covers six levels: copy, event, scene, instance, action, and others. 3)
Comprehensive evaluation criteria: We develop 3 versions of MUVR (i.e., Base,
Filter, QA). MUVR-Base/Filter evaluates retrieval models, while MUVR-QA
assesses MLLMs in a question-answering format. We also propose a Reranking
Score to evaluate the reranking ability of MLLMs. MUVR consists of 53K
untrimmed videos from the video platform Bilibili, with 1,050 multi-modal
queries and 84K matches. Extensive evaluations of 3 state-of-the-art video
retrieval models, 6 image-based VLMs, and 10 MLLMs are conducted. MUVR reveals
the limitations of retrieval methods in processing untrimmed videos and
multi-modal queries, as well as MLLMs in multi-video understanding and
reranking. Our code and benchmark is available at

*Whie Jung,Semin Kim,Junee Kim,Seunghoon Hong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A scalable framework that discovers image-related concept axes with a vision-language model and grounds concepts along these axes for compositional editing in real-world images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current language-grounded visual concept learning is limited to predefined axes and synthetic data; there is a need for scalable discovery of image-related axes and robust grounding in real-world scenes.

Method: The approach uses a pretrained vision-language model and a universal prompting strategy to identify diverse axes without prior knowledge. A universal concept encoder binds visual features to these axes without adding parameters per concept, and a compositional anchoring objective ensures axes can be independently manipulated without interference between axes.

Result: Demonstrates effectiveness on subsets of ImageNet, CelebA-HQ, and AFHQ, achieving superior editing across diverse real-world concepts that are too varied to manually predefined. Shows strong compositional generalization and outperforms existing visual concept learning and text-based editing methods. Code is released.

Conclusion: The work offers a scalable, knowledge-lean framework for discovering and grounding visual concepts along discovered axes, enabling robust compositional editing in real-world scenes.

Abstract: Human intelligence effortlessly interprets visual scenes along a rich
spectrum of semantic dimensions. However, existing approaches to
language-grounded visual concept learning are limited to a few predefined
primitive axes, such as color and shape, and are typically explored in
synthetic datasets. In this work, we propose a scalable framework that
adaptively identifies image-related concept axes and grounds visual concepts
along these axes in real-world scenes. Leveraging a pretrained vision-language
model and our universal prompting strategy, our framework identifies a diverse
image-related axes without any prior knowledge. Our universal concept encoder
adaptively binds visual features to the discovered axes without introducing
additional model parameters for each concept. To ground visual concepts along
the discovered axes, we optimize a compositional anchoring objective, which
ensures that each axis can be independently manipulated without affecting
others. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework on subsets of
ImageNet, CelebA-HQ, and AFHQ, showcasing superior editing capabilities across
diverse real-world concepts that are too varied to be manually predefined. Our
method also exhibits strong compositional generalization, outperforming
existing visual concept learning and text-based editing methods. The code is

*Honghua Chen,Yushi Lan,Yongwei Chen,Xingang Pan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ArtiLatent combines a VAE for joint geometry and articulation with a latent diffusion model and an articulation-aware Gaussian decoder to produce photorealistic, articulable 3D objects; it outperforms prior methods on PartNet-Mobility and ACD.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable generative, photorealistic, articulated 3D objects that maintain geometric consistency across articulation and reveal interior details, by unifying geometry, articulation, and appearance in a single generative framework.

Method: Embed sparse voxel geometry and articulation properties (joint type, axis, origin, range, part category) into a latent space via a variational autoencoder; train a latent diffusion model over this space for diverse, physically plausible samples; use an articulation-aware Gaussian decoder to capture articulation-dependent visibility and condition appearance decoding on articulation state to assign texture to occluded regions.

Result: Empirical evaluation on furniture-like objects from PartNet-Mobility and ACD shows ArtiLatent achieves higher geometric consistency and appearance fidelity compared to existing approaches across articulation configurations.

Conclusion: The framework provides a scalable, integrated solution for articulated 3D object synthesis and manipulation by jointly modeling geometry, articulation dynamics, and appearance in a unified latent space.

Abstract: We propose ArtiLatent, a generative framework that synthesizes human-made 3D
objects with fine-grained geometry, accurate articulation, and realistic
appearance. Our approach jointly models part geometry and articulation dynamics
by embedding sparse voxel representations and associated articulation
properties, including joint type, axis, origin, range, and part category, into
a unified latent space via a variational autoencoder. A latent diffusion model
is then trained over this space to enable diverse yet physically plausible
sampling. To reconstruct photorealistic 3D shapes, we introduce an
articulation-aware Gaussian decoder that accounts for articulation-dependent
visibility changes (e.g., revealing the interior of a drawer when opened). By
conditioning appearance decoding on articulation state, our method assigns
plausible texture features to regions that are typically occluded in static
poses, significantly improving visual realism across articulation
configurations. Extensive experiments on furniture-like objects from
PartNet-Mobility and ACD datasets demonstrate that ArtiLatent outperforms
existing approaches in geometric consistency and appearance fidelity. Our
framework provides a scalable solution for articulated 3D object synthesis and
manipulation.

### [44] [Anisotropic Pooling for LUT-realizable CNN Image Restoration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21437)
*Xi Zhang,Xiaolin Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LUT-based image restoration CNNs can be improved by anisotropic pooling instead of naive averaging when fusing oriented patch lookups; generalized median pooling and learnable orientation weights yield better restoration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome isotropy limitations and inefficiencies in LUT-based CNNs by reducing dependence on average pooling and improving handling of anisotropic structures while keeping LUT sizes manageable.

Method: Propose generalized median pooling; extend with data-dependent, orientation-specific pooling coefficients; learn adaptive weights for differently oriented patches; evaluate on restoration benchmarks.

Result: Anisotropic pooling with generalized median and learned orientation weights outperforms naive averaging and existing LUT-based methods in both perceptual and numerical metrics.

Conclusion: Anisotropic, adaptive pooling is a key improvement for LUT-realizable CNNs, enabling better restoration quality while maintaining computational benefits; suggests further extensions and potential application to various restoration tasks.

Abstract: Table look-up realization of image restoration CNNs has the potential of
achieving competitive image quality while being much faster and resource frugal
than the straightforward CNN implementation. The main technical challenge
facing the LUT-based CNN algorithm designers is to manage the table size
without overly restricting the receptive field. The prevailing strategy is to
reuse the table for small pixel patches of different orientations (apparently
assuming a degree of isotropy) and then fuse the look-up results. The fusion is
currently done by average pooling, which we find being ill suited to
anisotropic signal structures. To alleviate the problem, we investigate and
discuss anisotropic pooling methods to replace naive averaging for improving
the performance of the current LUT-realizable CNN restoration methods. First,
we introduce the method of generalized median pooling which leads to measurable
gains over average pooling. We then extend this idea by learning data-dependent
pooling coefficients for each orientation, so that they can adaptively weigh
the contributions of differently oriented pixel patches. Experimental results
on various restoration benchmarks show that our anisotropic pooling strategy
yields both perceptually and numerically superior results compared to existing
LUT-realizable CNN methods.

*Lisa Weijler,Sebastian Koch,Fabio Poiesi,Timo Ropinski,Pedro Hermosilla*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OpenHype uses a continuous hyperbolic latent space to model 3D scene hierarchies for implicit representations, addressing inefficiencies and rigid hierarchies of prior methods. It allows smooth hierarchy traversal via geodesics and shows improved benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hierarchical structure in 3D scenes is crucial for holistic understanding by autonomous agents. Implicit representations like NeRF struggle to capture multi-scale, hierarchical information efficiently. Prior methods either require multiple rendering passes or rely on predefined, closed-set hierarchies that fail to generalize to real-world diversity.

Method: Introduce OpenHype, which encodes scene hierarchies in a continuous hyperbolic latent space. The hyperbolic geometry naturally represents multi-scale relationships, enabling traversal along geodesic paths to move through hierarchy levels without extra rendering passes or fixed discrete hierarchies, integrated with implicit 3D representations.

Result: OpenHype outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on standard benchmarks, demonstrating superior efficiency and adaptability in 3D scene understanding.

Conclusion: Representing scene hierarchies in a continuous hyperbolic latent space enables efficient, flexible hierarchical understanding for 3D scenes with implicit representations, addressing key limitations of prior methods.

Abstract: Modeling the inherent hierarchical structure of 3D objects and 3D scenes is
highly desirable, as it enables a more holistic understanding of environments
for autonomous agents. Accomplishing this with implicit representations, such
as Neural Radiance Fields, remains an unexplored challenge. Existing methods
that explicitly model hierarchical structures often face significant
limitations: they either require multiple rendering passes to capture
embeddings at different levels of granularity, significantly increasing
inference time, or rely on predefined, closed-set discrete hierarchies that
generalize poorly to the diverse and nuanced structures encountered by agents
in the real world. To address these challenges, we propose OpenHype, a novel
approach that represents scene hierarchies using a continuous hyperbolic latent
space. By leveraging the properties of hyperbolic geometry, OpenHype naturally
encodes multi-scale relationships and enables smooth traversal of hierarchies
through geodesic paths in latent space. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art
approaches on standard benchmarks, demonstrating superior efficiency and
adaptability in 3D scene understanding.

*Shengtian Yang,Yue Feng,Yingshi Liu,Jingrou Zhang,Jie Qin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MoniTor is a training-free, memory-based online VAD method that uses streaming VLMs with an LSTM-like temporal predictor and a scoring queue with an anomaly prior to detect anomalies in real-time, achieving strong results on UCF-Crime and XD-Violence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Online video anomaly detection (VAD) is challenging due to real-time constraints and computational intensity. Leveraging pre-trained LLMs/VLMs can offer nuanced understanding of anomalies, but effective online temporal modeling and scoring without training remain open problems.

Method: Process streaming video frames through pre-trained vision–language models. Introduce an LSTM-inspired predictor to capture temporal dependencies and reuse past predictions. Maintain a dynamic scoring queue and an anomaly prior to store recent scores and cover all anomalies over the monitoring period, guiding LLMs to distinguish normal vs. abnormal behavior without training.

Result: MoniTor outperforms state-of-the-art methods and is competitive with weakly supervised methods that require training, across two large-scale datasets (UCF-Crime and XD-Violence).

Conclusion: A memory-based online scoring framework enables effective, training-free VAD by combining pre-trained VLMs with temporal prediction and a dynamic anomaly-scoring mechanism, offering a practical solution for real-time anomaly detection.

Abstract: Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) aims to locate unusual activities or behaviors
within videos. Recently, offline VAD has garnered substantial research
attention, which has been invigorated by the progress in large language models
(LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs), offering the potential for a more
nuanced understanding of anomalies. However, online VAD has seldom received
attention due to real-time constraints and computational intensity. In this
paper, we introduce a novel Memory-based online scoring queue scheme for
Training-free VAD (MoniTor), to address the inherent complexities in online
VAD. Specifically, MoniTor applies a streaming input to VLMs, leveraging the
capabilities of pre-trained large-scale models. To capture temporal
dependencies more effectively, we incorporate a novel prediction mechanism
inspired by Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. This ensures the model can
effectively model past states and leverage previous predictions to identify
anomalous behaviors. Thereby, it better understands the current frame.
Moreover, we design a scoring queue and an anomaly prior to dynamically store
recent scores and cover all anomalies in the monitoring scenario, providing
guidance for LLMs to distinguish between normal and abnormal behaviors over
time. We evaluate MoniTor on two large datasets (i.e., UCF-Crime and
XD-Violence) containing various surveillance and real-world scenarios. The
results demonstrate that MoniTor outperforms state-of-the-art methods and is
competitive with weakly supervised methods without training. Code is available

*Ming Xie,Junqiu Yu,Qiaole Dong,Xiangyang Xue,Yanwei Fu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VidSplice decouples video inpainting into multi-frame consistent image inpainting and masked area motion propagation, introducing spaced-frame priors and modules (CoSpliced, context controller) to improve spatiotemporal coherence, achieving competitive performance with better foreground alignment and motion stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current image-to-video (I2V) priors enhance temporal consistency but falter under severe degradation and often neglect robust spatiotemporal stability; a decoupled framework leveraging spaced priors is proposed to better govern content propagation across frames.

Method: VidSplice introduces two sub-tasks: (1) multi-frame consistent image inpainting and (2) masked area motion propagation. It employs spaced-frame priors to guide inpainting with spatiotemporal cues. The CoSpliced Module performs first-frame propagation by diffusing the initial frame content into subsequent reference frames via a splicing mechanism. A context controller encodes coherent priors after frame duplication and injects the spliced video into the I2V backbone to constrain content distortion during generation.

Result: Extensive evaluations show VidSplice achieves competitive performance across diverse video inpainting scenarios, with notable improvements in foreground alignment and motion stability compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: VidSplice provides a principled framework that leverages spaced-frame priors to guide spatiotemporal information flow in video inpainting, yielding improved content propagation and reduced distortion, particularly under challenging degradation.

Abstract: Recent video inpainting methods often employ image-to-video (I2V) priors to
model temporal consistency across masked frames. While effective in moderate
cases, these methods struggle under severe content degradation and tend to
overlook spatiotemporal stability, resulting in insufficient control over the
latter parts of the video. To address these limitations, we decouple video
inpainting into two sub-tasks: multi-frame consistent image inpainting and
masked area motion propagation. We propose VidSplice, a novel framework that
introduces spaced-frame priors to guide the inpainting process with
spatiotemporal cues. To enhance spatial coherence, we design a CoSpliced Module
to perform first-frame propagation strategy that diffuses the initial frame
content into subsequent reference frames through a splicing mechanism.
Additionally, we introduce a delicate context controller module that encodes
coherent priors after frame duplication and injects the spliced video into the
I2V generative backbone, effectively constraining content distortion during
generation. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that VidSplice achieves
competitive performance across diverse video inpainting scenarios. Moreover,
its design significantly improves both foreground alignment and motion
stability, outperforming existing approaches.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CXR-LanIC is a task-aligned, language-grounded interpretable classifier for chest X-rays that discovers thousands of monosemantic visual patterns to explain predictions, while maintaining competitive accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The black-box nature of deep learning in chest X-ray diagnosis undermines clinician trust and hampers failure mode analysis; transparent, verifiable explanations are needed for safe clinical deployment.

Method: Train an ensemble (100) of transcoder-based sparse autoencoders on a BiomedCLIP diagnostic classifier to decompose medical image representations into interpretable visual patterns. Use multimodal embeddings from the MIMIC-CXR dataset; discover ~5,000 monosemantic patterns across categories (cardiac, pulmonary, pleural, structural, device, artifact). Each pattern shows consistent activation across images with shared radiological features; predictions decompose into 20–50 interpretable patterns with activation galleries. Plan for natural language explanations via large multimodal model annotation.

Result: Achieves competitive diagnostic accuracy on five key findings; provides interpretable pattern activations and verifiable activation galleries, enabling transparent attribution of predictions.

Conclusion: Demonstrates that medical AI can be both accurate and interpretable when explanations are grounded in clinically relevant patterns extracted from task-specific embeddings, supporting safer clinical deployment and paving the way for natural language explanations.

Abstract: Deep learning models have achieved remarkable accuracy in chest X-ray
diagnosis, yet their widespread clinical adoption remains limited by the
black-box nature of their predictions. Clinicians require transparent,
verifiable explanations to trust automated diagnoses and identify potential
failure modes. We introduce CXR-LanIC (Language-Grounded Interpretable
Classifier for Chest X-rays), a novel framework that addresses this
interpretability challenge through task-aligned pattern discovery. Our approach
trains transcoder-based sparse autoencoders on a BiomedCLIP diagnostic
classifier to decompose medical image representations into interpretable visual
patterns. By training an ensemble of 100 transcoders on multimodal embeddings
from the MIMIC-CXR dataset, we discover approximately 5,000 monosemantic
patterns spanning cardiac, pulmonary, pleural, structural, device, and artifact
categories. Each pattern exhibits consistent activation behavior across images
sharing specific radiological features, enabling transparent attribution where
predictions decompose into 20-50 interpretable patterns with verifiable
activation galleries. CXR-LanIC achieves competitive diagnostic accuracy on
five key findings while providing the foundation for natural language
explanations through planned large multimodal model annotation. Our key
innovation lies in extracting interpretable features from a classifier trained
on specific diagnostic objectives rather than general-purpose embeddings,
ensuring discovered patterns are directly relevant to clinical decision-making,
demonstrating that medical AI systems can be both accurate and interpretable,
supporting safer clinical deployment through transparent, clinically grounded
explanations.

*Yating Huang,Qijun Yang,Lintao Xiang,Hujun Yin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A dual-stream model integrates macroscale tissue features with aggregated cellular representations using a receptance-weighted KV aggregation and a bidirectional tissue-cell interaction module, achieving improved fine-grained cancer subtype classification on four benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Capturing both global tissue context and cell-level details is essential for fine-grained histopathology tasks; current foundation models overlook cell-scale information.

Method: Proposes a dual-stream architecture combining tissue-level and cellular representations; introduces a receptance-weighted key-value aggregation with linear complexity; incorporates a recurrent transformer for cell dependencies; adds a bidirectional tissue-cell interaction module enabling mutual attention between cells and surrounding tissue.

Result: Outperforms existing models on four histopathological subtype benchmarks, demonstrating the benefit of cell-level aggregation and tissue-cell interaction.

Conclusion: Shows that jointly modeling tissue and cellular cues improves fine-grained pathology tasks; suggests avenues for scalable integration of multiscale information in computational pathology.

Abstract: Accurate interpretation of histopathological images demands integration of
information across spatial and semantic scales, from nuclear morphology and
cellular textures to global tissue organization and disease-specific patterns.
Although recent foundation models in pathology have shown strong capabilities
in capturing global tissue context, their omission of cell-level feature
modeling remains a key limitation for fine-grained tasks such as cancer subtype
classification. To address this, we propose a dual-stream architecture that
models the interplay between macroscale tissue features and aggregated cellular
representations. To efficiently aggregate information from large cell sets, we
propose a receptance-weighted key-value aggregation model, a recurrent
transformer that captures inter-cell dependencies with linear complexity.
Furthermore, we introduce a bidirectional tissue-cell interaction module to
enable mutual attention between localized cellular cues and their surrounding
tissue environment. Experiments on four histopathological subtype
classification benchmarks show that the proposed method outperforms existing
models, demonstrating the critical role of cell-level aggregation and
tissue-cell interaction in fine-grained computational pathology.

*Marek Socha,Michał Marczyk,Aleksander Kempski,Michał Cogiel,Paweł Foszner,Radosław Zawiski,Michał Staniszewski*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GRAP-MOT is a graph-weighted online MOT framework for crowded, closed-area, multi-camera scenarios that updates IDs using tracks and appearance features, with a position-estimation module; shows superiority in crowded settings and argues IDF1 is more appropriate than MOTA; code and dataset released.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address persistent occlusions and identity drift in crowded, multi-camera MOT in enclosed spaces by leveraging graph-based reasoning, online ID updates, and position cues, while advocating IDF1 as a better evaluation metric.

Method: A graph-weighted online identification approach (GRAP-MOT) that updates person IDs using tracks and characteristic features. The pipeline includes feature extraction, tracking, and community search, augmented by a position estimation module. Evaluated on synthetic closed-area recordings and public congested datasets; code and dataset are publicly released.

Result: GRAP-MOT achieves better identity maintenance in highly congested scenes, notably when position information is available, and yields higher IDF1 (and/or improved identity consistency) compared with methods lacking position data or relying on MOTA. The authors also provide publicly available code and dataset.

Conclusion: GRAP-MOT effectively handles occlusions and multi-camera fusion in closed-area MOT scenarios through graph-based online ID updates and position cues, endorsing IDF1 as a more suitable metric for congested MOT. The work’s reproducibility is supported by releasing code and data.

Abstract: GRAP-MOT is a new approach for solving the person MOT problem dedicated to
videos of closed areas with overlapping multi-camera views, where person
occlusion frequently occurs. Our novel graph-weighted solution updates a
person's identification label online based on tracks and the person's
characteristic features. To find the best solution, we deeply investigated all
elements of the MOT process, including feature extraction, tracking, and
community search. Furthermore, GRAP-MOT is equipped with a person's position
estimation module, which gives additional key information to the MOT method,
ensuring better results than methods without position data. We tested GRAP-MOT
on recordings acquired in a closed-area model and on publicly available real
datasets that fulfil the requirement of a highly congested space, showing the
superiority of our proposition. Finally, we analyzed existing metrics used to
compare MOT algorithms and concluded that IDF1 is more adequate than MOTA in
such comparisons. We made our code, along with the acquired dataset, publicly
available.

*Xiaoqing Liu,Jitai Han,Hua Yan,Peng Li,Sida Tang,Ying Li,Kaiwen Zhang,Min Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: An enhanced small-sample object detector EH-YOLOv11n for placental hematoma in ultrasound, combining wavelet and coordinate convolution with a cascaded group attention mechanism to suppress artifacts and improve localization; achieves 78% detection accuracy, outperforming YOLOv11n (+2.5 percentage points) and YOLOv8 (+13.7 points), with strong PR curves and real-time capability for computer-aided placental abruption diagnosis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Placental abruption diagnosis via ultrasound is highly dependent on clinician experience, leading to subjectivity and diagnostic inconsistencies; there is a need for reliable, real-time automatic detection of hematoma features, particularly in small-sample learning scenarios.

Method: Proposed EH-YOLOv11n (Enhanced Hemorrhage-YOLOv11n) for small datasets. It enhances feature extraction by integrating wavelet convolution (frequency-domain) and coordinate convolution (spatial encoding). It introduces a cascaded group attention mechanism to suppress ultrasound artifacts and occlusions, improving bounding box localization accuracy. The approach targets real-time performance suitable for computer-aided diagnosis in placental ultrasound.

Result: 98

Conclusion: EH-YOLOv11n provides a reliable, accurate, and efficient tool for automated placental abruption diagnosis in ultrasound, with significant clinical value for early detection and decision support, particularly in resource-limited settings due to small-sample learning.

Abstract: Placental abruption is a severe complication during pregnancy, and its early
accurate diagnosis is crucial for ensuring maternal and fetal safety.
Traditional ultrasound diagnostic methods heavily rely on physician experience,
leading to issues such as subjective bias and diagnostic inconsistencies. This
paper proposes an improved model, EH-YOLOv11n (Enhanced Hemorrhage-YOLOv11n),
based on small-sample learning, aiming to achieve automatic detection of
hematoma features in placental ultrasound images. The model enhances
performance through multidimensional optimization: it integrates wavelet
convolution and coordinate convolution to strengthen frequency and spatial
feature extraction; incorporates a cascaded group attention mechanism to
suppress ultrasound artifacts and occlusion interference, thereby improving
bounding box localization accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate a
detection accuracy of 78%, representing a 2.5% improvement over YOLOv11n and a
13.7% increase over YOLOv8. The model exhibits significant superiority in
precision-recall curves, confidence scores, and occlusion scenarios. Combining
high accuracy with real-time processing, this model provides a reliable
solution for computer-aided diagnosis of placental abruption, holding
significant clinical application value.

### [52] [GranViT: A Fine-Grained Vision Model With Autoregressive Perception For MLLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21501)
*Guanghao Zheng,Bowen Shi,Mingxing Xu,Ruoyu Sun,Peisen Zhao,Zhibo Zhang,Wenrui Dai,Junni Zou,Hongkai Xiong,Xiaopeng Zhang,Qi Tian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GranViT introduces a fine-grained vision transformer trained with region-level annotations and self-distillation, enhancing regional reasoning and transfer to LLMs, achieving state-of-the-art on fine-grained recognition, multimodal VQA, and OCR understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing vision encoders focus on global image representations and lack fine-grained perception due to scarce fine-grained annotated data and the absence of a fine-grained pretraining paradigm, hindering precise region-level alignment with LLMs for tasks like VQA and OCR.

Method: Propose GranViT, a Vision Transformer that integrates fine-grained feature extraction with semantic alignment to LLMs via region-level autoregressive training. Construct Gran-29M with 2M natural and OCR images and ~180M region-level annotations. Develop a pretraining-adaptation framework with self-distillation. Use bounding-box-to-caption regression to improve localized representations during pretraining and caption-to-bounding-box regression to enhance localization for LLM adaptation. Apply self-distillation to enforce explicit localization constraints for stronger regional reasoning.

Result: GranViT surpasses existing vision encoders and shows strong transferability to varying LLMs; achieves state-of-the-art results on fine-grained recognition, multimodal VQA, and OCR understanding.

Conclusion: Fine-grained pretraining with region-level annotations and self-distillation strengthens regional reasoning and LLM alignment in vision encoders. The Gran-29M dataset and the proposed training framework enable superior performance and transfer across tasks and LLMs.

Abstract: Vision encoders are indispensable for allowing impressive performance of
Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in vision language tasks such as
visual question answering and reasoning. However, existing vision encoders
focus on global image representations but overlook fine-grained regional
analysis. They are limited in fine grained perception due to the scarcity of
fine grained annotated data and the lack of a fine grained pre-training
paradigm. In this paper, we propose GranViT, a novel Vision Transformer that
integrates fine-grained feature extraction with semantic alignment to Large
Language Models (LLMs) via region level autoregressive training. We first
construct Gran-29M, a dataset comprising 2million natural and OCR images paired
with over 180 million high-quality region-level annotations, to enable large
scale fine grained pretraining. Consequently, we develop a
pretraining-adaptation framework along with a self distillation mechanism to
train fine-grained GranViT on Gran-29M. We sufficiently exploit the
fine-grained annotations from Gran-29M to resort to bounding-box-to-caption
regression to enhance localized visual representation of the vision encoder in
the pretraining and caption-to-bounding-box regression to improve vision
feature utilization and localization for LLM in the adaptation. We further
incorporate a self distillation mechanism that imposes explicit localization
constraints on the vision encoder to strengthen its regional reasoning
capability. Extensive experiments show that GranViT surpasses existing vision
encoders and attains strong transferability to varying LLMs. Remarkably, it
achieves state-of-the-art results on fine-grained recognition, multimodal VQA,
and OCR understanding.

### [53] [Towards a Golden Classifier-Free Guidance Path via Foresight Fixed Point Iterations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21512)
*Kaibo Wang,Jianda Mao,Tong Wu,Yang Xiang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Unified view of classifier-free guidance as fixed-point iterations; introduces Foresight Guidance (FSG) to solve longer-interval subproblems early, achieving better image quality and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CFG is central to text-to-image diffusion, but conflicting theories limit design; a unified, efficient framework is needed.

Method: Frame conditional guidance as fixed-point iterations; show CFG is a special case of single-step short-interval iteration; propose FSG that allocates more iterations to early, longer-interval subproblems; extensive experiments across datasets and architectures.

Result: FSG outperforms state-of-the-art methods in image quality and computational efficiency across diverse settings.

Conclusion: Provides new perspective on conditional guidance and enables adaptive design; broad potential for improving diffusion-based generation.

Abstract: Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) is an essential component of text-to-image
diffusion models, and understanding and advancing its operational mechanisms
remains a central focus of research. Existing approaches stem from divergent
theoretical interpretations, thereby limiting the design space and obscuring
key design choices. To address this, we propose a unified perspective that
reframes conditional guidance as fixed point iterations, seeking to identify a
golden path where latents produce consistent outputs under both conditional and
unconditional generation. We demonstrate that CFG and its variants constitute a
special case of single-step short-interval iteration, which is theoretically
proven to exhibit inefficiency. To this end, we introduce Foresight Guidance
(FSG), which prioritizes solving longer-interval subproblems in early diffusion
stages with increased iterations. Extensive experiments across diverse datasets
and model architectures validate the superiority of FSG over state-of-the-art
methods in both image quality and computational efficiency. Our work offers
novel perspectives for conditional guidance and unlocks the potential of
adaptive design.

### [54] [Head Pursuit: Probing Attention Specialization in Multimodal Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21518)
*Lorenzo Basile,Valentino Maiorca,Diego Doimo,Francesco Locatello,Alberto Cazzaniga*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper analyzes attention heads in text- and vision-language transformers, showing head-level specialization and that editing ~1% of heads can control outputs, with cross-domain validation on QA, toxicity mitigation, image classification, and captioning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how individual attention heads contribute to semantic/visual concepts and to enable interpretable and controllable editing of large generative models.

Method: Reinterpret probing of intermediate activations through the final decoding layer using a signal-processing perspective; compute head relevance across multiple samples; rank heads by their association with target concepts; edit by removing or amplifying selected heads; evaluate on unimodal and multimodal models and tasks.

Result: Head-level specialization patterns observed across both unimodal and multimodal transformers; editing around 1% of heads reliably suppresses/adds concepts in output; successful validations on language tasks (QA, toxicity mitigation) and vision-language tasks (image classification, captioning).

Conclusion: Attention layers contain interpretable, controllable structure; provides simple tools for understanding and editing large-scale generative models.

Abstract: Language and vision-language models have shown impressive performance across
a wide range of tasks, but their internal mechanisms remain only partly
understood. In this work, we study how individual attention heads in
text-generative models specialize in specific semantic or visual attributes.
Building on an established interpretability method, we reinterpret the practice
of probing intermediate activations with the final decoding layer through the
lens of signal processing. This lets us analyze multiple samples in a
principled way and rank attention heads based on their relevance to target
concepts. Our results show consistent patterns of specialization at the head
level across both unimodal and multimodal transformers. Remarkably, we find
that editing as few as 1% of the heads, selected using our method, can reliably
suppress or enhance targeted concepts in the model output. We validate our
approach on language tasks such as question answering and toxicity mitigation,
as well as vision-language tasks including image classification and captioning.
Our findings highlight an interpretable and controllable structure within
attention layers, offering simple tools for understanding and editing
large-scale generative models.

### [55] [Foley Control: Aligning a Frozen Latent Text-to-Audio Model to Video](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21581)
*Ciara Rowles,Varun Jampani,Simon Donné,Shimon Vainer,Julian Parker,Zach Evans*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A lightweight, frozen-backbone approach that adds a compact cross-attention bridge to fuse video into a text-to-audio model for Foley. It achieves competitive video-audio alignment with far fewer trainable parameters and preserves modular, prompt-driven control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Leverage large, pretrained single-modality models for video and audio without expensive end-to-end fine-tuning, while maintaining controllability and modularity in video-guided Foley generation.

Method: Freeze the video encoder (V-JEPA2) and the audio T2A backbone (Stable Audio Open DiT); insert a compact video cross-attention bridge after the model's text cross-attention to fuse video into audio generation; pool video tokens to reduce memory; train only the bridge to learn audio-video dependencies without retraining the audio prior; prompts provide global semantics while video refines timing and local dynamics.

Result: On curated video-audio benchmarks, Foley Control achieves competitive temporal and semantic alignment with far fewer trainable parameters than contemporary multi-modal systems, while preserving prompt-driven controllability and modularity (swap/upgrade encoders or the T2A backbone without end-to-end retraining).

Conclusion: The bridge design is potentially generalizable to other audio modalities (e.g., speech), offering a production-friendly pathway for video-guided audio generation with frozen backbones and a lightweight trainable bridge.

Abstract: Foley Control is a lightweight approach to video-guided Foley that keeps
pretrained single-modality models frozen and learns only a small
cross-attention bridge between them. We connect V-JEPA2 video embeddings to a
frozen Stable Audio Open DiT text-to-audio (T2A) model by inserting compact
video cross-attention after the model's existing text cross-attention, so
prompts set global semantics while video refines timing and local dynamics. The
frozen backbones retain strong marginals (video; audio given text) and the
bridge learns the audio-video dependency needed for synchronization -- without
retraining the audio prior. To cut memory and stabilize training, we pool video
tokens before conditioning. On curated video-audio benchmarks, Foley Control
delivers competitive temporal and semantic alignment with far fewer trainable
parameters than recent multi-modal systems, while preserving prompt-driven
controllability and production-friendly modularity (swap/upgrade encoders or
the T2A backbone without end-to-end retraining). Although we focus on
Video-to-Foley, the same bridge design can potentially extend to other audio
modalities (e.g., speech).

### [56] [Sample By Step, Optimize By Chunk: Chunk-Level GRPO For Text-to-Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21583)
*Yifu Luo,Penghui Du,Bo Li,Sinan Du,Tiantian Zhang,Yongzhe Chang,Kai Wu,Kun Gai,Xueqian Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Chunk-GRPO introduces chunk-level optimization for Group Relative Policy Optimization in flow-matching-based text-to-image generation, addressing inaccurate advantage attribution and temporal dynamics by grouping steps into coherent chunks (with optional weighted sampling); it yields improved preference alignment and image quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GRPO in flow-matching-based T2I suffers from inaccurate advantage attribution and neglect of temporal dynamics. Shifting optimization from the step level to chunk level aims to better capture temporal dynamics and attribution.

Method: Group consecutive steps into coherent chunks that capture temporal dynamics of flow matching, and optimize policies at the chunk level. An optional weighted sampling strategy is also proposed to further boost performance.

Result: Experimental results show ChunkGRPO achieves superior results in preference alignment and image quality compared to baselines, validating the effectiveness of chunk-level GRPO for T2I generation.

Conclusion: Chunk-level GRPO is a promising direction for T2I generation, demonstrating that chunked optimization can improve both policy attribution and generation quality.

Abstract: Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) has shown strong potential for
flow-matching-based text-to-image (T2I) generation, but it faces two key
limitations: inaccurate advantage attribution, and the neglect of temporal
dynamics of generation. In this work, we argue that shifting the optimization
paradigm from the step level to the chunk level can effectively alleviate these
issues. Building on this idea, we propose Chunk-GRPO, the first chunk-level
GRPO-based approach for T2I generation. The insight is to group consecutive
steps into coherent 'chunk's that capture the intrinsic temporal dynamics of
flow matching, and to optimize policies at the chunk level. In addition, we
introduce an optional weighted sampling strategy to further enhance
performance. Extensive experiments show that ChunkGRPO achieves superior
results in both preference alignment and image quality, highlighting the
promise of chunk-level optimization for GRPO-based methods.

*Minxing Luo,Linlong Fan,Wang Qiushi,Ge Wu,Yiyan Luo,Yuhang Yu,Jinwei Chen,Yaxing Wang,Qingnan Fan,Jian Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A two-stage, text-aware super-resolution method TIGER that first restores precise text glyphs and then guides image SR, plus UltraZoom-ST dataset; achieves state-of-the-art readability while preserving image quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current SR methods on text-containing images often distort text and face a trade-off between image fidelity and textual readability; there is a need to explicitly preserve text structures during SR.

Method: Proposes a two-stage framework: (1) text-first glyph restoration to reconstruct precise text structures, (2) image super-resolution guided by the recovered text glyphs for full-image enhancement. Also introduces UltraZoom-ST, a scene text dataset with extreme zoom, to support training and evaluation.

Result: Empirical results show TIGER achieves state-of-the-art performance, improving readability of text while maintaining overall image quality.

Conclusion: Decoupling glyph restoration from image enhancement successfully breaks the readability–quality trade-off in text-rich image SR; the methodology, together with the UltraZoom-ST dataset, provides a strong foundation for text-aware SR research.

Abstract: Current generative super-resolution methods show strong performance on
natural images but distort text, creating a fundamental trade-off between image
quality and textual readability. To address this, we introduce \textbf{TIGER}
(\textbf{T}ext-\textbf{I}mage \textbf{G}uided
sup\textbf{E}r-\textbf{R}esolution), a novel two-stage framework that breaks
this trade-off through a \textit{"text-first, image-later"} paradigm.
\textbf{TIGER} explicitly decouples glyph restoration from image enhancement:
it first reconstructs precise text structures and then uses them to guide
subsequent full-image super-resolution. This glyph-to-image guidance ensures
both high fidelity and visual consistency. To support comprehensive training
and evaluation, we also contribute the \textbf{UltraZoom-ST} (UltraZoom-Scene
Text), the first scene text dataset with extreme zoom (\textbf{$\times$14.29}).
Extensive experiments show that \textbf{TIGER} achieves
\textbf{state-of-the-art} performance, enhancing readability while preserving
overall image quality.

*Pauline Mouches,Julien Jung,Armand Demasson,Agnès Guinard,Romain Bouet,Rosalie Marchal,Romain Quentin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Deep learning models (ANN and CNN) can detect interictal spikes in MEG with limited expert annotations and robustness to annotation noise; an interactive ML strategy improves annotation quality; they outperform a state-of-the-art method on holdout data, suggesting potential clinical utility for presurgical evaluation in drug-resistant epilepsy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual detection of epileptiform spikes in MEG is time-consuming and subject to moderate interrater agreement; current automated approaches require extensive annotated data or fail on non-typical data. The work seeks robust spike detection with minimal annotations and real-world clinical applicability.

Method: Two architectures (a feature-based artificial neural network and a convolutional neural network) trained on MEG data from 59 patients, classifying short time windows. The study compares against a state-of-the-art model and uses an interactive machine learning strategy to iteratively improve annotations via intermediary model outputs.

Result: The models outperform the state-of-the-art on 10 holdout patients (F1: CNN=0.46, ANN=0.44). The interactive ML approach demonstrates robustness to noisy annotations, and simple architectures can handle complex, imperfectly annotated data.

Conclusion: Deep learning can effectively detect interictal spikes in MEG with limited, imperfect annotations. Interactive ML can accelerate data labeling. The proposed models offer practical, efficient tools to support automated spike detection in presurgical epilepsy evaluation.

Abstract: In drug-resistant epilepsy, presurgical evaluation of epilepsy can be
considered. Magnetoencephalography (MEG) has been shown to be an effective exam
to inform the localization of the epileptogenic zone through the localization
of interictal epileptic spikes. Manual detection of these pathological
biomarkers remains a fastidious and error-prone task due to the high
dimensionality of MEG recordings, and interrater agreement has been reported to
be only moderate. Current automated methods are unsuitable for clinical
practice, either requiring extensively annotated data or lacking robustness on
non-typical data. In this work, we demonstrate that deep learning models can be
used for detecting interictal spikes in MEG recordings, even when only temporal
and single-expert annotations are available, which represents real-world
clinical practice. We propose two model architectures: a feature-based
artificial neural network (ANN) and a convolutional neural network (CNN),
trained on a database of 59 patients, and evaluated against a state-of-the-art
model to classify short time windows of signal. In addition, we employ an
interactive machine learning strategy to iteratively improve our data
annotation quality using intermediary model outputs. Both proposed models
outperform the state-of-the-art model (F1-scores: CNN=0.46, ANN=0.44) when
tested on 10 holdout test patients. The interactive machine learning strategy
demonstrates that our models are robust to noisy annotations. Overall, results
highlight the robustness of models with simple architectures when analyzing
complex and imperfectly annotated data. Our method of interactive machine
learning offers great potential for faster data annotation, while our models
represent useful and efficient tools for automated interictal spikes detection.

*Orest Kupyn,Hirokatsu Kataoka,Christian Rupprecht*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: S3OD uses synthetic data via diffusion-based labeling and an ambiguity-aware multi-mask decoder to boost cross-dataset generalization in salient object detection, achieving 20-50% error reduction with synthetic data and state-of-the-art results after fine-tuning on DIS and HR-SOD.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Salient object detection is data-bound; pixel-precise annotations are expensive, often forcing separate models for related subtasks (DIS, HR-SOD) and hindering generalization. The work seeks to reduce annotation burden and improve cross-task/generalization performance with synthetic data and an ambiguity-aware design.

Method: Introduce S3OD, a dataset with 139k+ high-resolution images generated via a multi-modal diffusion pipeline that extracts labels from diffusion and DINO-v3 features. An iterative generation framework emphasizes challenging categories based on model performance. Propose a streamlined multi-mask decoder to handle inherent ambiguity by predicting multiple valid interpretations.

Result: Models trained solely on synthetic data achieve 20-50% error reduction in cross-dataset generalization; fine-tuned versions reach state-of-the-art performance across DIS and HR-SOD benchmarks.

Conclusion: Synthetic data generation combined with an ambiguity-aware multi-mask architecture significantly improves generalization in salient object detection, reducing reliance on pixel-precise annotations and enabling strong performance across related tasks.

Abstract: Salient object detection exemplifies data-bounded tasks where expensive
pixel-precise annotations force separate model training for related subtasks
like DIS and HR-SOD. We present a method that dramatically improves
generalization through large-scale synthetic data generation and
ambiguity-aware architecture. We introduce S3OD, a dataset of over 139,000
high-resolution images created through our multi-modal diffusion pipeline that
extracts labels from diffusion and DINO-v3 features. The iterative generation
framework prioritizes challenging categories based on model performance. We
propose a streamlined multi-mask decoder that naturally handles the inherent
ambiguity in salient object detection by predicting multiple valid
interpretations. Models trained solely on synthetic data achieve 20-50% error
reduction in cross-dataset generalization, while fine-tuned versions reach
state-of-the-art performance across DIS and HR-SOD benchmarks.

*Jiaxiang Liu,Yuan Wang,Jiawei Du,Joey Tianyi Zhou,Mingkun Xu,Zuozhu Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Modest-Align offers a lightweight, robust cross-modal alignment framework using Random Perturbation and Embedding Smoothing to tame overconfidence and improve retrieval under noisy/low-resource data, with far less data and compute than CLIP.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large-scale image-text pretraining (e.g., CLIP) yields strong recognition but is brittle in resource-constrained settings, where noisy or weakly correlated image-text pairs cause overconfidence. Existing contrastive methods relying on single positives amplify uncertainty.

Method: Introduce two complementary strategies: Random Perturbation (controlled noise to simulate uncertainty) and Embedding Smoothing (calibrate similarity distributions in the embedding space). The framework aims to be lightweight and robust, reducing overconfidence while maintaining accuracy.

Result: Empirical evaluations across multiple benchmarks show Modest-Align outperforms state-of-the-art retrieval methods while using >100x less training data and >600x less GPU time than CLIP, demonstrating strong robustness to noise and weak alignment.

Conclusion: Modest-Align provides a practical, scalable solution for cross-modal alignment in low-resource scenarios, balancing performance, data efficiency, and compute with enhanced robustness to uncertainty.

Abstract: Cross-modal alignment aims to map heterogeneous modalities into a shared
latent space, as exemplified by models like CLIP, which benefit from
large-scale image-text pretraining for strong recognition capabilities.
However, when operating in resource-constrained settings with limited or
low-quality data, these models often suffer from overconfidence and degraded
performance due to the prevalence of ambiguous or weakly correlated image-text
pairs. Current contrastive learning approaches, which rely on single positive
pairs, further exacerbate this issue by reinforcing overconfidence on uncertain
samples. To address these challenges, we propose Modest-Align, a lightweight
alignment framework designed for robustness and efficiency. Our approach
leverages two complementary strategies -- Random Perturbation, which introduces
controlled noise to simulate uncertainty, and Embedding Smoothing, which
calibrates similarity distributions in the embedding space. These mechanisms
collectively reduce overconfidence and improve performance on noisy or weakly
aligned samples. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmark datasets
demonstrate that Modest-Align outperforms state-of-the-art methods in retrieval
tasks, achieving competitive results with over 100x less training data and 600x
less GPU time than CLIP. Our method offers a practical and scalable solution
for cross-modal alignment in real-world, low-resource scenarios.

### [61] [Epipolar Geometry Improves Video Generation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21615)
*Orest Kupyn,Fabian Manhardt,Federico Tombari,Christian Rupprecht*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A method to enforce 3D-consistent video generation by aligning diffusion models with epipolar geometry constraints using preference-based optimization, enabling stable geometric enforcement without end-to-end differentiability and improving robustness over purely learned metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video diffusion models struggle with geometric inconsistencies, unstable motion, and artifacts that break 3D realism. There is a need to integrate classical geometric constraints to ensure spatial consistency in 3D scenes while maintaining visual quality.

Method: Use pairwise epipolar geometry constraints to guide the diffusion model via preference-based optimization. Enforce geometric principles without requiring end-to-end differentiability. Train on static scenes with dynamic cameras to obtain high-quality measurements and generalize to diverse dynamic content.

Result: Classical geometric constraints provide more stable optimization signals than modern learned metrics, leading to better alignment and reduced geometric artifacts. The model generalizes from static training scenes with dynamic cameras to diverse dynamic content while preserving visual quality.

Conclusion: Bridging data-driven deep learning with classical geometric computer vision yields a practical method for generating spatially consistent videos without sacrificing visual fidelity.

Abstract: Video generation models have progressed tremendously through large latent
diffusion transformers trained with rectified flow techniques. Yet these models
still struggle with geometric inconsistencies, unstable motion, and visual
artifacts that break the illusion of realistic 3D scenes. 3D-consistent video
generation could significantly impact numerous downstream applications in
generation and reconstruction tasks. We explore how epipolar geometry
constraints improve modern video diffusion models. Despite massive training
data, these models fail to capture fundamental geometric principles underlying
visual content. We align diffusion models using pairwise epipolar geometry
constraints via preference-based optimization, directly addressing unstable
camera trajectories and geometric artifacts through mathematically principled
geometric enforcement. Our approach efficiently enforces geometric principles
without requiring end-to-end differentiability. Evaluation demonstrates that
classical geometric constraints provide more stable optimization signals than
modern learned metrics, which produce noisy targets that compromise alignment
quality. Training on static scenes with dynamic cameras ensures high-quality
measurements while the model generalizes effectively to diverse dynamic

### [62] [DAP-MAE: Domain-Adaptive Point Cloud Masked Autoencoder for Effective Cross-Domain Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21635)
*Ziqi Gao,Qiufu Li,Linlin Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Cross-domain adaptive MAE for 3D point clouds (DAP-MAE) using a heterogeneous domain adapter and domain feature generator to enable adaptive pretraining and task-specific fine-tuning across domains, achieving strong results with one pretraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Limited availability of 3D point cloud data and domain-specific scarcity, plus potential misalignment when mixing data from different domains for MAE pretraining, which can degrade downstream performance.

Method: Introduce a heterogeneous domain adapter with an adaptation mode during pre-training to learn cross-domain information, and a fusion mode during fine-tuning to enhance features. Include a domain feature generator to guide adaptation of features to downstream tasks. A single pre-training is performed across domains.

Result: The approach yields excellent performance across four point cloud tasks, achieving 95.18% object classification on ScanObjectNN and 88.45% facial expression recognition on Bosphorus, demonstrating strong cross-domain transfer.

Conclusion: DAP-MAE effectively integrates cross-domain knowledge for general point cloud analysis, mitigating data scarcity effects and enabling strong performance with one pretraining.

Abstract: Compared to 2D data, the scale of point cloud data in different domains
available for training, is quite limited. Researchers have been trying to
combine these data of different domains for masked autoencoder (MAE)
pre-training to leverage such a data scarcity issue. However, the prior
knowledge learned from mixed domains may not align well with the downstream 3D
point cloud analysis tasks, leading to degraded performance. To address such an
issue, we propose the Domain-Adaptive Point Cloud Masked Autoencoder (DAP-MAE),
an MAE pre-training method, to adaptively integrate the knowledge of
cross-domain datasets for general point cloud analysis. In DAP-MAE, we design a
heterogeneous domain adapter that utilizes an adaptation mode during
pre-training, enabling the model to comprehensively learn information from
point clouds across different domains, while employing a fusion mode in the
fine-tuning to enhance point cloud features. Meanwhile, DAP-MAE incorporates a
domain feature generator to guide the adaptation of point cloud features to
various downstream tasks. With only one pre-training, DAP-MAE achieves
excellent performance across four different point cloud analysis tasks,
reaching 95.18% in object classification on ScanObjectNN and 88.45% in facial
expression recognition on Bosphorus.

### [63] [A Dynamic Knowledge Distillation Method Based on the Gompertz Curve](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21649)
*Han Yang,Guangjun Qin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A dynamic knowledge distillation method, Gompertz-CNN, uses the Gompertz growth curve to modulate distillation loss during training, enabling stage-aware transfer. It includes Wasserstein feature-distance and gradient-matching terms within a multi-loss objective, showing consistent gains on CIFAR-10/100 over standard KD.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional knowledge distillation often assumes a static or uniform transfer of knowledge, failing to account for the evolving learning capacity of the student. A principled method to model learning progression could enhance transfer efficiency and final accuracy.

Method: Propose Gompertz-CNN with stage-aware distillation where the distillation loss weight follows a Gompertz curve to reflect slow initial learning, rapid mid-phase improvement, and late-stage saturation. Incorporates Wasserstein distance for feature-level alignment and gradient matching to align backward propagation. The losses are combined in a multi-loss objective with the Gompertz modulation.

Result: Experiments on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 with teacher-student pairs (e.g., ResNet50 and MobileNet_v2) show consistent improvements over traditional distillation methods, achieving up to 8% accuracy gains on CIFAR-10 and up to 4% on CIFAR-100.

Conclusion: Modeling the student’s learning dynamics with a Gompertz-based weighting of distillation losses improves knowledge transfer across datasets and architectures, yielding robust performance gains compared with conventional KD.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel dynamic knowledge distillation framework,
Gompertz-CNN, which integrates the Gompertz growth model into the training
process to address the limitations of traditional knowledge distillation.
Conventional methods often fail to capture the evolving cognitive capacity of
student models, leading to suboptimal knowledge transfer. To overcome this, we
propose a stage-aware distillation strategy that dynamically adjusts the weight
of distillation loss based on the Gompertz curve, reflecting the student's
learning progression: slow initial growth, rapid mid-phase improvement, and
late-stage saturation. Our framework incorporates Wasserstein distance to
measure feature-level discrepancies and gradient matching to align backward
propagation behaviors between teacher and student models. These components are
unified under a multi-loss objective, where the Gompertz curve modulates the
influence of distillation losses over time. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10
and CIFAR-100 using various teacher-student architectures (e.g., ResNet50 and
MobileNet_v2) demonstrate that Gompertz-CNN consistently outperforms
traditional distillation methods, achieving up to 8% and 4% accuracy gains on
CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, respectively.

### [64] [Group Inertial Poser: Multi-Person Pose and Global Translation from Sparse Inertial Sensors and Ultra-Wideband Ranging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21654)
*Ying Xue,Jiaxi Jiang,Rayan Armani,Dominik Hollidt,Yi-Chi Liao,Christian Holz*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel IMU+UWB-based method, Group Inertial Poser (GIP), fuses sparse IMUs with inter-sensor distances to estimate 3D body poses and global translation for multiple people, introducing a two-step optimization and a new IMU+UWB dataset (GIP-DB).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: IMU-only tracking struggles with global translation and inter-person localization, while vision-based methods suffer from occlusion and environment constraints. Using absolute distance measurements via UWB can stabilize global positioning for multi-person tracking.

Method: Estimate absolute distances between pairs of sensors using ultra-wideband (UWB) ranging, fuse these with inertial observations in structured state-space models to capture temporal motion, and apply a two-step optimization to infer global trajectories. Introduce GIP-DB, an IMU+UWB dataset for two-person tracking (200 minutes from 14 participants).

Result: Outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods in accuracy and robustness on both synthetic and real-world data; demonstrates effective multi-person tracking with IMU+UWB fusion.

Conclusion: IMU+UWB fusion via the Group Inertial Poser framework is a promising approach for robust, scalable multi-human motion capture in unconstrained environments.

Abstract: Tracking human full-body motion using sparse wearable inertial measurement
units (IMUs) overcomes the limitations of occlusion and instrumentation of the
environment inherent in vision-based approaches. However, purely IMU-based
tracking compromises translation estimates and accurate relative positioning
between individuals, as inertial cues are inherently self-referential and
provide no direct spatial reference for others. In this paper, we present a
novel approach for robustly estimating body poses and global translation for
multiple individuals by leveraging the distances between sparse wearable
sensors - both on each individual and across multiple individuals. Our method
Group Inertial Poser estimates these absolute distances between pairs of
sensors from ultra-wideband ranging (UWB) and fuses them with inertial
observations as input into structured state-space models to integrate temporal
motion patterns for precise 3D pose estimation. Our novel two-step optimization
further leverages the estimated distances for accurately tracking people's
global trajectories through the world. We also introduce GIP-DB, the first
IMU+UWB dataset for two-person tracking, which comprises 200 minutes of motion
recordings from 14 participants. In our evaluation, Group Inertial Poser
outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods in accuracy and robustness across
synthetic and real-world data, showing the promise of IMU+UWB-based multi-human
motion capture in the wild. Code, models, dataset:

### [65] [Long-tailed Species Recognition in the NACTI Wildlife Dataset](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21657)
*Zehua Liu,Tilo Burghardt*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This study systematically evaluates long-tail recognition (LTR) techniques on the North America Camera Trap Images (NACTI) dataset, showing substantial gains over cross-entropy baselines and competitive with prior work, while also testing generalization under domain shifts and noting remaining tail-class weaknesses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long-tailed class imbalance in wildlife image datasets hinders accurate species recognition; the work assesses LTR methods and regularization to boost tail performance and domain generalization, with emphasis on reproducibility.

Method: Experiments built on the PyTorch Wildlife model, surveying multiple LTR loss functions and LTR-sensitive regularisation. The authors evaluate LTR-enhanced schedulers, and construct a Reduced-Bias Test set from the ENA-Detection dataset to probe distribution shift. Comparisons are made against standard cross-entropy with Adam. All dataset splits, key code, and full network weights are published for reproducibility.

Result: Best configuration achieves 99.40% Top-1 on the NACTI test set, vs. 95.51% baseline (cross-entropy+Adam) and higher than MLWIC2's 96.8% (with different settings). On the Reduced-Bias Test set from ENA-Detection, the model reaches 52.55% (up from 51.20%) under domain shift. LTR gains are consistent when paired with advanced schedulers, though tail classes can catastrophically fail under severe distribution shift; reproducible splits, code, and weights are provided.

Conclusion: LTR methods yield meaningful improvements for long-tailed wildlife recognition and better generalization under some distribution shifts, but they do not fully overcome tail-class breakdown in challenging domain shifts. The work emphasizes reproducibility and provides a solid baseline for future long-tail wildlife recognition research.

Abstract: As most ''in the wild'' data collections of the natural world, the North
America Camera Trap Images (NACTI) dataset shows severe long-tailed class
imbalance, noting that the largest 'Head' class alone covers >50% of the 3.7M
images in the corpus. Building on the PyTorch Wildlife model, we present a
systematic study of Long-Tail Recognition methodologies for species recognition
on the NACTI dataset covering experiments on various LTR loss functions plus
LTR-sensitive regularisation. Our best configuration achieves 99.40% Top-1
accuracy on our NACTI test data split, substantially improving over a 95.51%
baseline using standard cross-entropy with Adam. This also improves on
previously reported top performance in MLWIC2 at 96.8% albeit using partly
unpublished (potentially different) partitioning, optimiser, and evaluation
protocols. To evaluate domain shifts (e.g. night-time captures, occlusion,
motion-blur) towards other datasets we construct a Reduced-Bias Test set from
the ENA-Detection dataset where our experimentally optimised long-tail enhanced
model achieves leading 52.55% accuracy (up from 51.20% with WCE loss),
demonstrating stronger generalisation capabilities under distribution shift. We
document the consistent improvements of LTR-enhancing scheduler choices in this
NACTI wildlife domain, particularly when in tandem with state-of-the-art LTR
losses. We finally discuss qualitative and quantitative shortcomings that LTR
methods cannot sufficiently address, including catastrophic breakdown for
'Tail' classes under severe domain shift. For maximum reproducibility we
publish all dataset splits, key code, and full network weights.

### [66] [Self-Supervised Learning of Synapse Types from EM Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21663)
*Aarav Shetty,Gary B Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Unsupervised clustering of synapses in EM images based on local neighborhood similarity, without predefining the number of classes, demonstrated on Drosophila data; supports discovering synapse types and guiding ground-truth selection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To classify synapses by morphology without relying on labeled data or prior knowledge of how many classes exist, leveraging the intuition that neighboring synapses within a neuron are more similar to each other than random samples from different cells.

Method: An unsupervised approach that groups synapses by similarities inferred from spatial proximity, assuming nearby synapses are more alike than random pairs; does not require specifying the number of classes in advance; applied to Drosophila EM data.

Result: Shows feasibility of discovering multiple synapse classes without supervision and suggests a principled way to select ground-truth annotations spanning a range of synapse structures.

Conclusion: An locality-based, unsupervised framework for classifying synapses by morphology that scales to unknown class counts and can aid biological annotation and dataset curation.

Abstract: Separating synapses into different classes based on their appearance in EM
images has many applications in biology. Examples may include assigning a
neurotransmitter to a particular class, or separating synapses whose strength
can be modulated from those whose strength is fixed. Traditionally, this has
been done in a supervised manner, giving the classification algorithm examples
of the different classes. Here we instead separate synapses into classes based
only on the observation that nearby synapses in the same neuron are likely more
similar than synapses chosen randomly from different cells. We apply our
methodology to data from {\it Drosophila}. Our approach has the advantage that
the number of synapse types does not need to be known in advance. It may also
provide a principled way to select ground-truth that spans the range of synapse
structure.

### [67] [Foundation Models in Dermatopathology: Skin Tissue Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21664)
*Riya Gupta,Yiwei Zong,Dennis H. Murphree*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Virchow2-derived patch features with mean-aggregation achieved high slide-level accuracy (~90% with logistic regression) for classifying dermatopathology WSIs into melanocytic, basaloid, and squamous lesions, outperforming UNI-based features; overall gains were not statistically significant; data augmentation and normalization were explored; WandB tracked experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid production of whole-slide images in dermatopathology motivates automated, scalable methods for efficient processing and accurate classification.

Method: Compared two foundation-model–based feature extractors (Virchow2 and UNI) to obtain patch-level embeddings from WSIs. Used mean-aggregation to produce slide-level features, then trained classifiers (logistic regression, gradient-boosted trees, random forest). Evaluated with precision, recall, true positive rate, false positive rate, and AUROC on a test set. Explored data augmentation and image normalization. Used WandB.ai for experiment tracking.

Result: Virchow2 features outperformed UNI in most slide-level classifiers. Logistic regression achieved the highest accuracy (≈90%) with Virchow2, though the difference was not statistically significant. Mean-aggregation proved reliable for slide-level representation; data augmentation and normalization improved robustness. All metrics tracked with WandB.

Conclusion: Foundation-model–based feature extraction shows promise for automated WSI classification in dermatopathology, offering scalable slide-level representations and a path toward improved, generalizable diagnostic tools.

Abstract: The rapid generation of whole-slide images (WSIs) in dermatopathology
necessitates automated methods for efficient processing and accurate
classification. This study evaluates the performance of two foundation models,
UNI and Virchow2, as feature extractors for classifying WSIs into three
diagnostic categories: melanocytic, basaloid, and squamous lesions. Patch-level
embeddings were aggregated into slide-level features using a mean-aggregation
strategy and subsequently used to train multiple machine learning classifiers,
including logistic regression, gradient-boosted trees, and random forest
models. Performance was assessed using precision, recall, true positive rate,
false positive rate, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic
curve (AUROC) on the test set. Results demonstrate that patch-level features
extracted using Virchow2 outperformed those extracted via UNI across most
slide-level classifiers, with logistic regression achieving the highest
accuracy (90%) for Virchow2, though the difference was not statistically
significant. The study also explored data augmentation techniques and image
normalization to enhance model robustness and generalizability. The
mean-aggregation approach provided reliable slide-level feature
representations. All experimental results and metrics were tracked and
visualized using WandB.ai, facilitating reproducibility and interpretability.
This research highlights the potential of foundation models for automated WSI
classification, providing a scalable and effective approach for
dermatopathological diagnosis while paving the way for future advancements in
slide-level representation learning.

*Sikuang Li,Chen Yang,Jiemin Fang,Taoran Yi,Jia Lu,Jiazhong Cen,Lingxi Xie,Wei Shen,Qi Tian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WorldGrow introduces a hierarchical, unbounded 3D scene synthesis framework that uses data-curated scene blocks, 3D block inpainting, and coarse-to-fine generation; it achieves SOTA geometry reconstruction on 3D-FRONT and enables infinite, photorealistic scene generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current approaches for large-scale 3D world generation struggle with geometry and appearance inconsistencies (2D-lifting), scalability of 3D representations, and reliance on object-centric 3D foundation models. A solution is needed to enable coherent, scalable, scene-level generation by leveraging strong priors from pre-trained 3D models to generate structured scene blocks.

Method: WorldGrow comprises three core components: (1) a data curation pipeline that harvests high-quality scene blocks to train 3D structured latent representations; (2) a 3D block inpainting mechanism for context-aware scene extension; (3) a coarse-to-fine generation strategy that enforces global layout plausibility while ensuring local geometric/textural fidelity. This forms a hierarchical, unbounded 3D scene synthesis framework evaluated on the 3D-FRONT dataset.

Result: The approach achieves state-of-the-art geometry reconstruction on 3D-FRONT and uniquely supports infinite scene generation with photorealistic and structure-consistent outputs.

Conclusion: WorldGrow demonstrates the feasibility of constructing large-scale virtual environments and lays groundwork for future world models, highlighting the potential for scalable, coherent, unlimited 3D world generation.

Abstract: We tackle the challenge of generating the infinitely extendable 3D world --
large, continuous environments with coherent geometry and realistic appearance.
Existing methods face key challenges: 2D-lifting approaches suffer from
geometric and appearance inconsistencies across views, 3D implicit
representations are hard to scale up, and current 3D foundation models are
mostly object-centric, limiting their applicability to scene-level generation.
Our key insight is leveraging strong generation priors from pre-trained 3D
models for structured scene block generation. To this end, we propose
WorldGrow, a hierarchical framework for unbounded 3D scene synthesis. Our
method features three core components: (1) a data curation pipeline that
extracts high-quality scene blocks for training, making the 3D structured
latent representations suitable for scene generation; (2) a 3D block inpainting
mechanism that enables context-aware scene extension; and (3) a coarse-to-fine
generation strategy that ensures both global layout plausibility and local
geometric/textural fidelity. Evaluated on the large-scale 3D-FRONT dataset,
WorldGrow achieves SOTA performance in geometry reconstruction, while uniquely
supporting infinite scene generation with photorealistic and structurally
consistent outputs. These results highlight its capability for constructing
large-scale virtual environments and potential for building future world
models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Applying post-hoc explanations to a Faster R-CNN detector for harbor seals in Glacier Bay aerial imagery demonstrates localization fidelity, faithfulness, and diagnostic utility, revealing true regions, confirming model behavior, and highlighting failure modes to guide data refinement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ecological applications of computer vision face trust barriers due to black-box models. Post-hoc explanations can provide evidence for predictions and document deployment limitations, enabling auditable, field-ready decision support.

Method: Train a Faster R-CNN to detect pinnipeds (harbor seals) on Glacier Bay aerial images; generate explanations using gradient-based methods (HiResCAM, LayerCAM), LIME, and perturbation-based approaches; evaluate explanations along localization fidelity, faithfulness, and diagnostic utility; analyze failure modes and inform data augmentation.

Result: Explanations concentrate on seal torsos/contours rather than background; removing seals lowers detector confidence, supporting faithfulness; recurrent error sources include confusion with black ice and rocks; diagnostic insights point to targeted data curation and augmentation; pairing detection with explainability yields auditable, decision-support tools for conservation monitoring.

Conclusion: Combining object detection with post-hoc explanations advances trustworthy, auditable AI in ecology and provides concrete guidance for improving models and deployment in conservation contexts.

Abstract: Computer vision can accelerate ecological research and conservation
monitoring, yet adoption in ecology lags in part because of a lack of trust in
black-box neural-network-based models. We seek to address this challenge by
applying post-hoc explanations to provide evidence for predictions and document
limitations that are important to field deployment. Using aerial imagery from
Glacier Bay National Park, we train a Faster R-CNN to detect pinnipeds (harbor
seals) and generate explanations via gradient-based class activation mapping
(HiResCAM, LayerCAM), local interpretable model-agnostic explanations (LIME),
and perturbation-based explanations. We assess explanations along three axes
relevant to field use: (i) localization fidelity: whether high-attribution
regions coincide with the animal rather than background context; (ii)
faithfulness: whether deletion/insertion tests produce changes in detector
confidence; and (iii) diagnostic utility: whether explanations reveal
systematic failure modes. Explanations concentrate on seal torsos and contours
rather than surrounding ice/rock, and removal of the seals reduces detection
confidence, providing model-evidence for true positives. The analysis also
uncovers recurrent error sources, including confusion between seals and black
ice and rocks. We translate these findings into actionable next steps for model
development, including more targeted data curation and augmentation. By pairing
object detection with post-hoc explainability, we can move beyond "black-box"
predictions toward auditable, decision-supporting tools for conservation
monitoring.

*Han Yan,Xibin Song,Yifu Wang,Hongdong Li,Pan Ji,Chao Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BachVid offers a training-free method to generate multiple videos with consistent foreground and background by analyzing diffusion transformers to cache and reuse intermediate variables, removing the need for reference images or training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Achieving both foreground and background consistency across multiple T2V videos is challenging; existing methods rely on reference images or additional training and often only address foreground consistency, leaving backgrounds to image-to-video models. A training-free, end-to-end approach is desirable for scalable, consistent video generation.

Method: Perform a systematic analysis of Diffusion Transformer (DiT) attention and intermediate features to show that they can extract foreground masks and find matching points during denoising. Build a pipeline that first generates an identity video, caches intermediate variables, and then injects these cached variables into corresponding positions in new videos to enforce both foreground and background consistency across multiple outputs.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate robust consistency across generated videos without requiring additional training or reference images, indicating that BachVid can produce consistent multi-video outputs in a training-free manner.

Conclusion: BachVid introduces a novel and efficient solution for consistent video generation without reliance on reference images or extra training, offering a training-free pathway to reliable multi-video T2V generation and inviting further exploration of DiT-based consistency mechanisms.

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have recently driven significant progress in
text-to-video (T2V) generation. However, generating multiple videos with
consistent characters and backgrounds remains a significant challenge. Existing
methods typically rely on reference images or extensive training, and often
only address character consistency, leaving background consistency to
image-to-video models. We introduce BachVid, the first training-free method
that achieves consistent video generation without needing any reference images.
Our approach is based on a systematic analysis of DiT's attention mechanism and
intermediate features, revealing its ability to extract foreground masks and
identify matching points during the denoising process. Our method leverages
this finding by first generating an identity video and caching the intermediate
variables, and then inject these cached variables into corresponding positions
in newly generated videos, ensuring both foreground and background consistency
across multiple videos. Experimental results demonstrate that BachVid achieves
robust consistency in generated videos without requiring additional training,
offering a novel and efficient solution for consistent video generation without
relying on reference images or additional training.

*Nir Goren,Shai Yehezkel,Omer Dahary,Andrey Voynov,Or Patashnik,Daniel Cohen-Or*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Visual diffusion models can act as geometric solvers by reasoning in pixel space; trained on problem instances to generate approximate geometric solutions; demonstrated on the Inscribed Square Problem and two other well-known geometric problems; suggests image-space reasoning as a general framework for hard geometric tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bridge generative modeling and geometric problem solving by recasting geometric reasoning as image generation, enabling approximate solutions to hard problems without specialized architectures.

Method: Train a standard visual diffusion model on image representations of geometric problem instances; the model maps Gaussian noise to images representing valid approximate solutions; operates directly on visual representations rather than parametric geometric encodings; no domain-specific architecture.

Result: The model learns to transform noisy geometric structures into correct configurations, providing approximate solutions to the Inscribed Square Problem and two additional geometric problems; demonstrates that diffusion can function as a geometric solver.

Conclusion: Image-space diffusion modeling offers a general, practical framework for approximating hard geometric problems and suggests potential to tackle a wider class of geometric tasks beyond the studied cases.

Abstract: In this paper we show that visual diffusion models can serve as effective
geometric solvers: they can directly reason about geometric problems by working
in pixel space. We first demonstrate this on the Inscribed Square Problem, a
long-standing problem in geometry that asks whether every Jordan curve contains
four points forming a square. We then extend the approach to two other
well-known hard geometric problems: the Steiner Tree Problem and the Simple
Polygon Problem.
  Our method treats each problem instance as an image and trains a standard
visual diffusion model that transforms Gaussian noise into an image
representing a valid approximate solution that closely matches the exact one.
The model learns to transform noisy geometric structures into correct
configurations, effectively recasting geometric reasoning as image generation.
  Unlike prior work that necessitates specialized architectures and
domain-specific adaptations when applying diffusion to parametric geometric
representations, we employ a standard visual diffusion model that operates on
the visual representation of the problem. This simplicity highlights a
surprising bridge between generative modeling and geometric problem solving.
Beyond the specific problems studied here, our results point toward a broader
paradigm: operating in image space provides a general and practical framework
for approximating notoriously hard problems, and opens the door to tackling a
far wider class of challenging geometric tasks.

TL;DR: An automated, self-reflective agent framework detects unintended visual attribute dependencies in trained vision models, improving beyond non-reflective baselines and uncovering real-world dependencies in models like CLIP and YOLOv8.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To ensure model robustness, avoid overfitting and spurious correlations by identifying which visual attributes a model relies on beyond intended cues.

Method: An iterative framework featuring a self-reflective agent that proposes hypotheses about visual attributes, tests them experimentally, and performs self-evaluation. The agent refines hypotheses based on outcomes, triggers new experimentation cycles after inconsistencies, and is validated on a benchmark of 130 models across 18 attribute categories.

Result: The agent’s performance consistently improves with self-reflection and significantly surpasses non-reflective baselines. It identifies real-world visual attribute dependencies in state-of-the-art models, including CLIP’s vision encoder and YOLOv8.

Conclusion: Self-reflection boosts discovery of attribute dependencies in vision models, offering a robust automated approach to diagnose and mitigate spurious correlations and overfitting in complex architectures.

Abstract: When a vision model performs image recognition, which visual attributes drive
its predictions? Detecting unintended reliance on specific visual features is
critical for ensuring model robustness, preventing overfitting, and avoiding
spurious correlations. We introduce an automated framework for detecting such
dependencies in trained vision models. At the core of our method is a
self-reflective agent that systematically generates and tests hypotheses about
visual attributes that a model may rely on. This process is iterative: the
agent refines its hypotheses based on experimental outcomes and uses a
self-evaluation protocol to assess whether its findings accurately explain
model behavior. When inconsistencies arise, the agent self-reflects over its
findings and triggers a new cycle of experimentation. We evaluate our approach
on a novel benchmark of 130 models designed to exhibit diverse visual attribute
dependencies across 18 categories. Our results show that the agent's
performance consistently improves with self-reflection, with a significant
performance increase over non-reflective baselines. We further demonstrate that
the agent identifies real-world visual attribute dependencies in
state-of-the-art models, including CLIP's vision encoder and the YOLOv8 object
detector.

### [73] [Sketch2BIM: A Multi-Agent Human-AI Collaborative Pipeline to Convert Hand-Drawn Floor Plans to 3D BIM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20838)
*Abir Khan Ratul,Sanjay Acharjee,Somin Park,Md Nazmus Sakib*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A human-in-the-loop, multi-agent MLLM pipeline converts freehand floor plan sketches into semantically consistent 3D BIM models, achieving high accuracy (F1>0.83, errors approaching zero) after iterative feedback.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: BIM adoption is hindered by the gap between informal sketches and structured models. Enabling non-experts to generate BIM from freehand sketches can reduce time and cost, and MLLMs with human-in-the-loop can align perceptual extraction with semantic schemas.

Method: An iterative pipeline using multimodal LLMs in a multi-agent framework to extract features from hand-drawn sketches, refine them into a structured JSON layout (walls/doors/windows), apply human feedback for schema validation, and generate executable BIM scripts. Evaluated on ten diverse floor plans, with convergence through feedback iterations.

Result: Openings (doors/windows) are reliably captured early; wall detection starts around 83% and converges to near-perfect alignment after a few feedback iterations. Across categories, precision, recall, and F1 scores exceed 0.83. Geometric errors (RMSE, MAE) decrease to zero via feedback corrections.

Conclusion: MLLM-driven multi-agent reasoning can democratize BIM creation, enabling both experts and non-experts to build semantically consistent 3D BIM models from freehand sketches.

Abstract: This study introduces a human-in-the-loop pipeline that converts unscaled,
hand-drawn floor plan sketches into semantically consistent 3D BIM models. The
workflow leverages multimodal large language models (MLLMs) within a
multi-agent framework, combining perceptual extraction, human feedback, schema
validation, and automated BIM scripting. Initially, sketches are iteratively
refined into a structured JSON layout of walls, doors, and windows. Later,
these layouts are transformed into executable scripts that generate 3D BIM
models. Experiments on ten diverse floor plans demonstrate strong convergence:
openings (doors, windows) are captured with high reliability in the initial
pass, while wall detection begins around 83% and achieves near-perfect
alignment after a few feedback iterations. Across all categories, precision,
recall, and F1 scores remain above 0.83, and geometric errors (RMSE, MAE)
progressively decrease to zero through feedback corrections. This study
demonstrates how MLLM-driven multi-agent reasoning can make BIM creation
accessible to both experts and non-experts using only freehand sketches.

TL;DR: A Cultural Alien Sampler (CAS) separates coherence from cultural typicality to generate original yet internally coherent ideas in art, using dual GPT-2 models trained on WikiArt concepts. It outperforms baselines and rivals human students in originality and harmony, while producing more diverse concept spaces than GPT-4o.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Open-ended creative domains require ideas that are simultaneously original and coherent. LLMs often default to familiar cultural patterns or lose coherence when pushing novelty, limiting creative potential.

Method: Two GPT-2 models fine-tuned on WikiArt concepts: a Concept Coherence Model assesses plausible co-occurrence of concepts within artworks, and a Cultural Context Model estimates how typical those combinations are within an artist’s body of work. CAS selects concept combinations with high coherence and low typicality, encouraging internal consistency with creative deviation from learned conventions.

Result: In a human evaluation (N=100), CAS outperformed random selection and GPT-4o baselines and matched the performance of human art students in perceived originality and harmony. A quantitative study showed CAS yields more diverse outputs and broader conceptual exploration than GPT-4o.

Conclusion: Explicitly separating compositional coherence from cultural typicality via CAS enables autonomous agents to generate original, coherent ideas that expand creative space, demonstrating artificial cultural alienness can unlock creative potential.

Abstract: In open-ended domains like art, autonomous agents must generate ideas that
are both original and internally coherent, yet current Large Language Models
(LLMs) either default to familiar cultural patterns or sacrifice coherence when
pushed toward novelty. We address this by introducing the Cultural Alien
Sampler (CAS), a concept-selection method that explicitly separates
compositional fit from cultural typicality. CAS uses two GPT-2 models
fine-tuned on WikiArt concepts: a Concept Coherence Model that scores whether
concepts plausibly co-occur within artworks, and a Cultural Context Model that
estimates how typical those combinations are within individual artists' bodies
of work. CAS targets combinations that are high in coherence and low in
typicality, yielding ideas that maintain internal consistency while deviating
from learned conventions and embedded cultural context. In a human evaluation
(N = 100), our approach outperforms random selection and GPT-4o baselines and
achieves performance comparable to human art students in both perceived
originality and harmony. Additionally, a quantitative study shows that our
method produces more diverse outputs and explores a broader conceptual space
than its GPT-4o counterpart, demonstrating that artificial cultural alienness
can unlock creative potential in autonomous agents.

### [75] [Fuzzy numbers revisited: operations on extensional fuzzy numbers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20861)
*Krzysztof Siminski*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes extensional fuzzy numbers as an alternative to standard fuzzy numbers to tackle Zadeh extension issues; defines their operations and relational operators, illustrates with applications, and provides open-source C++ code.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address computational complexity of Zadeh's extension rule, loss of fuzzy set features under some operations (e.g., multiplication of triangular fuzzy numbers), and the tendency for fuzziness to grow with repeated operations; seek a framework preserving structure and enabling efficient computation.

Method: Introduce extensional fuzzy numbers, formalize arithmetic operations and relational operators on them, present applicational examples, implement in C++, and share code on GitHub.

Result: Defined a complete set of operations and relational predicates for extensional fuzzy numbers, demonstrated via application examples, with a public C++ implementation.

Conclusion: Extensional fuzzy numbers offer a viable alternative to conventional fuzzy numbers, mitigating some drawbacks of Zadeh's extension and enabling practical use, supported by a publicly available implementation.

Abstract: Fuzzy numbers are commonly represented with fuzzy sets. Their objective is to
better represent imprecise data. However, operations on fuzzy numbers are not
as straightforward as maths on crisp numbers. Commonly, the Zadeh's extension
rule is applied to elaborate a result. This can produce two problems: (1) high
computational complexity and (2) for some fuzzy sets and some operations the
results is not a fuzzy set with the same features (eg. multiplication of two
triangular fuzzy sets does not produce a triangular fuzzy set). One more
problem is the fuzzy spread -- fuzziness of the result increases with the
number of operations. These facts can severely limit the application field of
fuzzy numbers. In this paper we would like to revisite this problem with a
different kind of fuzzy numbers -- extensional fuzzy numbers. The paper defines
operations on extensional fuzzy numbers and relational operators (=, >, >=, <,
<=) for them. The proposed approach is illustrated with several applicational
examples. The C++ implementation is available from a public GitHub repository.

### [76] [Customizing Open Source LLMs for Quantitative Medication Attribute Extraction across Heterogeneous EHR Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21027)
*Zhe Fei,Mehmet Yigit Turali,Shreyas Rajesh,Xinyang Dai,Huyen Pham,Pavan Holur,Yuhui Zhu,Larissa Mooney,Yih-Ing Hser,Vwani Roychowdhury*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: An LLM-assisted data-harmonization framework to extract MOUD prescription attributes across heterogeneous EHRs, achieving high coverage and exact-match accuracy, enabling standardized MOUD exposure analytics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Heterogeneous EHR systems scatter key MOUD prescription attributes across varied fields and free text; this hampers cross-site monitoring of MOUD exposure, adherence, and retention.

Method: Customize open-source LLMs (Llama, Qwen, Gemma, MedGemma) to extract a fixed set of MOUD attributes (date, drug name, duration, total quantity, daily quantity, refills) into a fixed JSON schema, apply lightweight normalization and cross-field consistency checks, compute MOUD days per patient, and support privacy-preserving deployment. Evaluate on prescription-level EHR data from five clinics (25,605 records from 1,257 patients) using a previously annotated benchmark of 10,369 records (776 patients) as ground truth.

Result: Largest models perform best: Qwen2.5-32B achieves 93.4% coverage with 93.0% exact-match accuracy; MedGemma-27B achieves 93.1% coverage and 92.2% accuracy. Three common error types identified and addressed—imputing missing dosage from within-drug norms, deriving duration for monthly/weekly injectables (e.g., Vivitrol) from documented schedules, and adding unit checks to prevent misreading mass units as daily counts.

Conclusion: The approach removes brittle, site-specific ETL, enabling consistent cross-site MOUD exposure analyses in real-world settings and supports privacy-preserving deployment for monitoring MOUD adherence and retention.

Abstract: Harmonizing medication data across Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems is
a persistent barrier to monitoring medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD).
In heterogeneous EHR systems, key prescription attributes are scattered across
differently formatted fields and freetext notes. We present a practical
framework that customizes open source large language models (LLMs), including
Llama, Qwen, Gemma, and MedGemma, to extract a unified set of MOUD prescription
attributes (prescription date, drug name, duration, total quantity, daily
quantity, and refills) from heterogeneous, site specific data and compute a
standardized metric of medication coverage, \emph{MOUD days}, per patient. Our
pipeline processes records directly in a fixed JSON schema, followed by
lightweight normalization and cross-field consistency checks. We evaluate the
system on prescription level EHR data from five clinics in a national OUD study
(25{,}605 records from 1{,}257 patients), using a previously annotated
benchmark of 10{,}369 records (776 patients) as the ground truth. Performance
is reported as coverage (share of records with a valid, matchable output) and
record-level exact-match accuracy. Larger models perform best overall:
Qwen2.5-32B achieves \textbf{93.4\%} coverage with \textbf{93.0\%} exact-match
accuracy across clinics, and MedGemma-27B attains
\textbf{93.1\%}/\textbf{92.2\%}. A brief error review highlights three common
issues and fixes: imputing missing dosage fields using within-drug norms,
handling monthly/weekly injectables (e.g., Vivitrol) by setting duration from
the documented schedule, and adding unit checks to prevent mass units (e.g.,
``250 g'') from being misread as daily counts. By removing brittle,
site-specific ETL and supporting local, privacy-preserving deployment, this
approach enables consistent cross-site analyses of MOUD exposure, adherence,
and retention in real-world settings.

### [77] [Epistemic Deference to AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21043)
*Benjamin Lange*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A principled middle-ground on AI deference: AI outputs should serve as contributory reasons rather than outright replacements, via a total-evidence framework. The paper introduces Artificial Epistemic Authorities (AEAs) and AI Preemptionism, critiques unconditional deference, and presents criteria for when deference is warranted, especially in high-stakes contexts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Motivated by when to rely on AI versus human judgment, drawing from social epistemology to justify treating certain AI systems as AEAs and to regulate their influence on epistemic decisions.

Method: Conceptual analysis and argumentation: define AEAs and AI Preemptionism, critique classical preemption objections (uncritical deference, epistemic entrenchment, unhinging bases), develop a total-evidence account, and outline practical criteria for justified AI deference.

Result: Clarifies a principled approach in which AI outputs are contributory rather than replacement reasons, preserving human engagement and oversight; highlights advantages like mitigating expertise atrophy, enabling meaningful oversight, and providing a basis to mistrust AI when reliability fails; offers a criterion-based framework for justification of AI deference in high-stakes contexts.

Conclusion: The work promises a demanding but coherent framework to balance AI reliability with human epistemic agency, informing when and how AI deference should be invoked in high-stakes settings.

Abstract: When should we defer to AI outputs over human expert judgment? Drawing on
recent work in social epistemology, I motivate the idea that some AI systems
qualify as Artificial Epistemic Authorities (AEAs) due to their demonstrated
reliability and epistemic superiority. I then introduce AI Preemptionism, the
view that AEA outputs should replace rather than supplement a user's
independent epistemic reasons. I show that classic objections to preemptionism
- such as uncritical deference, epistemic entrenchment, and unhinging epistemic
bases - apply in amplified form to AEAs, given their opacity, self-reinforcing
authority, and lack of epistemic failure markers. Against this, I develop a
more promising alternative: a total evidence view of AI deference. According to
this view, AEA outputs should function as contributory reasons rather than
outright replacements for a user's independent epistemic considerations. This
approach has three key advantages: (i) it mitigates expertise atrophy by
keeping human users engaged, (ii) it provides an epistemic case for meaningful
human oversight and control, and (iii) it explains the justified mistrust of AI
when reliability conditions are unmet. While demanding in practice, this
account offers a principled way to determine when AI deference is justified,
particularly in high-stakes contexts requiring rigorous reliability.

### [78] [From Questions to Queries: An AI-powered Multi-Agent Framework for Spatial Text-to-SQL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21045)
*Ali Khosravi Kazazi,Zhenlong Li,M. Naser Lessani,Guido Cervone*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A multi-agent framework translates natural language to spatial SQL with a self-verification step, achieving strong accuracy on spatial and general NL-to-SQL benchmarks and showing improved alignment with user intent, enabling more accessible spatial analysis and advancing autonomous GIS.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SQL complexity and specialized geospatial functions (e.g., PostGIS) create barriers for non-experts. Single-agent LLMs struggle with spatial semantics and syntax. A collaborative, self-verifying multi-agent system with context-rich knowledge and retrieval should improve accuracy, reliability, and generalizability for spatial Text-to-SQL.

Method: A knowledge base with programmatic schema profiling and semantic enrichment, plus embeddings for context retrieval. A collaborative multi-agent pipeline including: (1) entity extraction, (2) metadata retrieval, (3) query logic formulation, (4) SQL generation, and (5) a review agent for programmatic and semantic validation (self-verification) of the generated SQL.

Result: Evaluated on KaggleDBQA achieving 81.2% accuracy (221/272) after the review agent's corrections. For spatial queries on SpatialQueryQA, accuracy is 87.7% (79/90) with the review agent, vs 76.7% without the review agent. Some queries produced by the system aligned more closely with user intent than benchmark queries.

Conclusion: The framework lowers barriers to spatial analysis, providing a robust, generalizable foundation for spatial Text-to-SQL systems and supporting the development of autonomous GIS.

Abstract: The complexity of Structured Query Language (SQL) and the specialized nature
of geospatial functions in tools like PostGIS present significant barriers to
non-experts seeking to analyze spatial data. While Large Language Models (LLMs)
offer promise for translating natural language into SQL (Text-to-SQL),
single-agent approaches often struggle with the semantic and syntactic
complexities of spatial queries. To address this, we propose a multi-agent
framework designed to accurately translate natural language questions into
spatial SQL queries. The framework integrates several innovative components,
including a knowledge base with programmatic schema profiling and semantic
enrichment, embeddings for context retrieval, and a collaborative multi-agent
pipeline as its core. This pipeline comprises specialized agents for entity
extraction, metadata retrieval, query logic formulation, SQL generation, and a
review agent that performs programmatic and semantic validation of the
generated SQL to ensure correctness (self-verification). We evaluate our system
using both the non-spatial KaggleDBQA benchmark and a new, comprehensive
SpatialQueryQA benchmark that includes diverse geometry types, predicates, and
three levels of query complexity. On KaggleDBQA, the system achieved an overall
accuracy of 81.2% (221 out of 272 questions) after the review agent's review
and corrections. For spatial queries, the system achieved an overall accuracy
of 87.7% (79 out of 90 questions), compared with 76.7% without the review
agent. Beyond accuracy, results also show that in some instances the system
generates queries that are more semantically aligned with user intent than
those in the benchmarks. This work makes spatial analysis more accessible, and
provides a robust, generalizable foundation for spatial Text-to-SQL systems,
advancing the development of autonomous GIS.

*Siyong Chen,Jinbo Wen,Jiawen Kang,Tenghui Huang,Xumin Huang,Yuanjia Su,Hudan Pan,Zishao Zhong,Dusit Niyato,Shengli Xie,Dong In Kim*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MedAlign offers a retrieval-aware, federated, and visually grounded framework that improves medical VQA accuracy and efficiency by aligning preferences with visual context, routing queries to specialized experts, and enabling multi-institutional collaboration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) struggle in medical settings due to hallucinations, fixed-depth reasoning, and lack of cross-institution collaboration. Grounding answers in visual evidence while enabling adaptive, collaborative reasoning is needed for safe, reliable Med-VQA.

Method: 1) Multimodal Direct Preference Optimization (mDPO) to align model preferences with visual evidence; 2) Retrieval-Aware Mixture-of-Experts (RA-MoE) routing queries to an expert LVLM using image/text similarity; 3) Federated governance with locally fine-tuned experts performing iterative Chain-of-Thought (CoT) via a local uncertainty estimator; 4) Expert selection and context augmentation to reduce hallucinations; 5) Evaluation on three Med-VQA datasets.

Result: MedAlign achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming strong retrieval-augmented baselines by up to 11.85% in F1-score, and reduces average reasoning length by 51.60% compared with fixed-depth CoT approaches.

Conclusion: MedAlign demonstrates that combining mDPO, RA-MoE, and federated CoT with local uncertainty-guided reasoning yields accurate, efficient, and collaboratively trainable LVLMs for medical visual question answering, addressing hallucinations and enabling multi-institutional deployment.

Abstract: Recently, large models have shown significant potential for smart healthcare.
However, the deployment of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) for clinical
services is currently hindered by three critical challenges: a tendency to
hallucinate answers not grounded in visual evidence, the inefficiency of
fixed-depth reasoning, and the difficulty of multi-institutional collaboration.
To address these challenges, in this paper, we develop MedAlign, a novel
framework to ensure visually accurate LVLM responses for Medical Visual
Question Answering (Med-VQA). Specifically, we first propose a multimodal
Direct Preference Optimization (mDPO) objective to explicitly align preference
learning with visual context. We then design a Retrieval-Aware
Mixture-of-Experts (RA-MoE) architecture that utilizes image and text
similarity to route queries to a specialized and context-augmented LVLM (i.e.,
an expert), thereby mitigating hallucinations in LVLMs. To achieve adaptive
reasoning and facilitate multi-institutional collaboration, we propose a
federated governance mechanism, where the selected expert, fine-tuned on
clinical datasets based on mDPO, locally performs iterative Chain-of-Thought
(CoT) reasoning via the local meta-cognitive uncertainty estimator. Extensive
experiments on three representative Med-VQA datasets demonstrate that MedAlign
achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming strong retrieval-augmented
baselines by up to $11.85\%$ in F1-score, and simultaneously reducing the
average reasoning length by $51.60\%$ compared with fixed-depth CoT approaches.

### [80] [Confounding Robust Deep Reinforcement Learning: A Causal Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21110)
*Mingxuan Li,Junzhe Zhang,Elias Bareinboim*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A robust off-policy deep RL method that handles unobserved confounding by optimizing for the worst-case environment compatible with data, outperforming DQN on confounded Atari games.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Off-policy methods like Q-learning rely on historical data that may be biased due to unobserved confounders. In high-dimensional domains, such biases can degrade policy learning. A safe, robust approach is needed to perform well despite such biases.

Method: Extend Deep Q-Network (DQN) with a robust (minimax) objective that searches for a policy whose performance is guaranteed under the worst-case environment consistent with the observed data, thereby mitigating unobserved confounding.

Result: The proposed algorithm consistently dominates standard DQN across twelve confounded Atari games, particularly in cases where the input to the behavioral and target policies mismatches and unobserved confounders exist.

Conclusion: A robust off-policy method can effectively guard against unobserved confounding biases in high-dimensional domains, improving performance over conventional DQN in settings with biased data; further work could explore theoretical guarantees and broader domains.

Abstract: A key task in Artificial Intelligence is learning effective policies for
controlling agents in unknown environments to optimize performance measures.
Off-policy learning methods, like Q-learning, allow learners to make optimal
decisions based on past experiences. This paper studies off-policy learning
from biased data in complex and high-dimensional domains where \emph{unobserved
confounding} cannot be ruled out a priori. Building on the well-celebrated Deep
Q-Network (DQN), we propose a novel deep reinforcement learning algorithm
robust to confounding biases in observed data. Specifically, our algorithm
attempts to find a safe policy for the worst-case environment compatible with
the observations. We apply our method to twelve confounded Atari games, and
find that it consistently dominates the standard DQN in all games where the
observed input to the behavioral and target policies mismatch and unobserved
confounders exist.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Empirically evaluates an agentic AI voter in DAO governance using thousands of proposals, showing alignment with human and token-weighted outcomes and potential to augment decision-making with interpretable, auditable signals in a simulated DeFi environment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess feasibility, accuracy, and governance implications of autonomous AI agents making voting decisions in decentralized protocols; address auditability, explainability, and economic rigor in AI-enabled governance.

Method: Collect >3,000 proposals from major protocols; develop an agentic AI voter that interprets proposal contexts, fetches historical deliberations, and autonomously votes within a modular composable program workflow (MCP) using the Agentics framework; evaluate in a realistic financial simulation grounded in verifiable blockchain data; compare agent votes to human and token-weighted baselines using designed metrics.

Result: The agent's voting decisions show strong alignment with human and token-weighted outcomes; outputs interpretable and auditable signals; demonstrates feasibility of AI augmentation in DAO governance in a simulation.

Conclusion: Agentic AI can augment collective decision-making in decentralized financial systems; offers explainable, economically grounded decision signals; informs design of governance tools and AI agents for DeFi.

Abstract: This paper presents a first empirical study of agentic AI as autonomous
decision-makers in decentralized governance. Using more than 3K proposals from
major protocols, we build an agentic AI voter that interprets proposal
contexts, retrieves historical deliberation data, and independently determines
its voting position. The agent operates within a realistic financial simulation
environment grounded in verifiable blockchain data, implemented through a
modular composable program (MCP) workflow that defines data flow and tool usage
via Agentics framework. We evaluate how closely the agent's decisions align
with the human and token-weighted outcomes, uncovering strong alignments
measured by carefully designed evaluation metrics. Our findings demonstrate
that agentic AI can augment collective decision-making by producing
interpretable, auditable, and empirically grounded signals in realistic DAO
governance settings. The study contributes to the design of explainable and
economically rigorous AI agents for decentralized financial systems.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PACE builds a panic-focused dataset from first-person narratives and trains PACER, a counseling model optimized with supervision and simulated preferences; PanicEval assesses quality; results show PACER outperforms baselines and is preferred by humans; code released.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Scarce high-quality, ethically sourced datasets for panic/crisis counseling; need for effective, scalable interventions in acute distress.

Method: Construct PACE around Psychological First Aid principles from first-person panic narratives; train PACER to provide empathetic and directive support via supervised learning and simulated preference alignment; evaluate via PanicEval which covers general counseling quality and crisis-specific strategies.

Result: PACER outperforms strong baselines on counselor-side metrics and client affect improvement; human evaluators prefer PACER over general, CBT-based, and GPT-4-powered models.

Conclusion: PACE and PACER show practical value for crisis intervention; dataset and model provide a foundation for further development and deployment; code available.

Abstract: Panic attacks are acute episodes of fear and distress, in which timely,
appropriate intervention can significantly help individuals regain stability.
However, suitable datasets for training such models remain scarce due to
ethical and logistical issues. To address this, we introduce PACE, which is a
dataset that includes high-distress episodes constructed from first-person
narratives, and structured around the principles of Psychological First Aid
(PFA). Using this data, we train PACER, a counseling model designed to provide
both empathetic and directive support, which is optimized through supervised
learning and simulated preference alignment. To assess its effectiveness, we
propose PanicEval, a multi-dimensional framework covering general counseling
quality and crisis-specific strategies. Experimental results show that PACER
outperforms strong baselines in both counselor-side metrics and client affect
improvement. Human evaluations further confirm its practical value, with PACER
consistently preferred over general, CBT-based, and GPT-4-powered models in
panic scenarios (Code is available at https://github.com/JihyunLee1/PanicToCalm

### [83] [NeuroGenPoisoning: Neuron-Guided Attacks on Retrieval-Augmented Generation of LLM via Genetic Optimization of External Knowledge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21144)
*Hanyu Zhu,Lance Fiondella,Jiawei Yuan,Kai Zeng,Long Jiao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Neuron-guided genetic poisoning of RAG (NeuroGenPoisoning) can hijack external knowledge by activating Poison-Responsive Neurons, achieving high POSR (>90%) with fluent outputs and addressing knowledge-conflict with strong parametric knowledge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how external poisoned knowledge interacts with LLM internal representations in Retrieval-Augmented Generation, addressing gaps in prior work that focus on retrieval prompts while neglecting neuron-level sensitivities and the knowledge-conflict between external and parametric knowledge.

Method: Identify Poison-Responsive Neurons through attribution analysis that correlates neuron activations with poisoning knowledge. Use a genetic algorithm to evolve adversarial passages that maximize activation of these neurons. Reuse promising but initial unsuccessful variants via attribution signals to enable scalable generation. Evaluate across models and datasets, measuring Population Overwrite Success Rate (POSR) and fluency, and examine knowledge-conflict resolution.

Result: Experimental results show POSR >90% across models/datasets with fluent outputs. The method effectively generates potent poisoned external knowledge and empirically demonstrates resolution of knowledge conflict between external and parametric knowledge.

Conclusion: NeuroGenPoisoning reveals a potent neuron-guided poisoning pathway in RAG, highlighting a new dimension of vulnerability tied to internal representations. The work motivates the development of defenses against neuron-level poisoning and suggests avenues for robust retrieval/memory integration strategies and further study of neuron-activation-based attack dynamics.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) empowers Large Language Models (LLMs) to
dynamically integrate external knowledge during inference, improving their
factual accuracy and adaptability. However, adversaries can inject poisoned
external knowledge to override the model's internal memory. While existing
attacks iteratively manipulate retrieval content or prompt structure of RAG,
they largely ignore the model's internal representation dynamics and
neuron-level sensitivities. The underlying mechanism of RAG poisoning has not
been fully studied and the effect of knowledge conflict with strong parametric
knowledge in RAG is not considered. In this work, we propose NeuroGenPoisoning,
a novel attack framework that generates adversarial external knowledge in RAG
guided by LLM internal neuron attribution and genetic optimization. Our method
first identifies a set of Poison-Responsive Neurons whose activation strongly
correlates with contextual poisoning knowledge. We then employ a genetic
algorithm to evolve adversarial passages that maximally activate these neurons.
Crucially, our framework enables massive-scale generation of effective poisoned
RAG knowledge by identifying and reusing promising but initially unsuccessful
external knowledge variants via observed attribution signals. At the same time,
Poison-Responsive Neurons guided poisoning can effectively resolves knowledge
conflict. Experimental results across models and datasets demonstrate
consistently achieving high Population Overwrite Success Rate (POSR) of over
90% while preserving fluency. Empirical evidence shows that our method
effectively resolves knowledge conflict.

### [84] [How to Auto-optimize Prompts for Domain Tasks? Adaptive Prompting and Reasoning through Evolutionary Domain Knowledge Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21148)
*Yang Zhao,Pu Wang,Hao Frank Yang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: EGO-Prompt is an automated framework that evolves domain-specific prompts and reasoning graphs (SCGs) using causal-guided textual gradients to improve LLM performance, especially for smaller models, across real-world tasks. It yields 7.32%-12.61% higher F1 than state-of-the-art methods, reduces cost to reach large-model performance (under 20%), and provides an interpretable, refined SCG.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Designing optimal prompts and reasoning processes for domain-specific tasks is crucial yet challenging. Experts provide SCG descriptions, but these can be partial or imperfect, and optimal integration varies across LLMs. There is a need to integrate domain knowledge efficiently, enhance reasoning, and offer refined hints for knowledge integration.

Method: Propose Evolutionary Graph Optimization for Prompting (EGO-Prompt). Start with a general prompt and fault-tolerant initial Semantic Causal Graph (SCG) provided by experts. Iteratively refine and optimize the SCG and the reasoning mechanism using causal-guided textual gradients with ground-truth. Two steps: (1) generate nearly deterministic instance-specific reasoning guidance from the SCG; (2) adapt the LLM to effectively use this guidance along with the original input. An evolutionary optimization algorithm updates both the SCG and the reasoning process.

Result: EGO-Prompt achieves 7.32%-12.61% higher F1 than cutting-edge methods. It enables small models to reach the performance of larger models at under 20% of the original cost. It also outputs a refined, domain-specific SCG that improves interpretability.

Conclusion: The framework provides an automated, adaptable method to design prompts and reasoning processes, leveraging domain knowledge via SCGs. It is robust to partial or imperfect expert inputs and improves interpretability while reducing cost, with demonstrated gains on real-world health, transportation, and behavior tasks.

Abstract: Designing optimal prompts and reasoning processes for large language models
(LLMs) on domain-specific tasks is both necessary and challenging in real-world
applications. Determining how to integrate domain knowledge, enhance reasoning
efficiency, and even provide domain experts with refined knowledge integration
hints are particularly crucial yet unresolved tasks. In this research, we
propose Evolutionary Graph Optimization for Prompting (EGO-Prompt), an
automated framework to designing better prompts, efficient reasoning processes
and providing enhanced causal-informed process. EGO-Prompt begins with a
general prompt and fault-tolerant initial Semantic Causal Graph (SCG)
descriptions, constructed by human experts, which is then automatically refined
and optimized to guide LLM reasoning. Recognizing that expert-defined SCGs may
be partial or imperfect and that their optimal integration varies across LLMs,
EGO-Prompt integrates a novel causal-guided textual gradient process in two
steps: first, generating nearly deterministic reasoning guidance from the SCG
for each instance, and second, adapting the LLM to effectively utilize the
guidance alongside the original input. The iterative optimization algorithm
further refines both the SCG and the reasoning mechanism using textual
gradients with ground-truth. We tested the framework on real-world public
health, transportation and human behavior tasks. EGO-Prompt achieves
7.32%-12.61% higher F1 than cutting-edge methods, and allows small models to
reach the performence of larger models at under 20% of the original cost. It
also outputs a refined, domain-specific SCG that improves interpretability.

### [85] [String Seed of Thought: Prompting LLMs for Distribution-Faithful and Diverse Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21150)
*Kou Misaki,Takuya Akiba*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SSoT is a prompting method that injects entropy via a seed string so LLMs perform Probabilistic Instruction Following (PIF) with maintained diversity, approaching pseudo-random performance and benefiting open-ended tasks (NoveltyBench).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with PIF: they tend to bias toward deterministic answers, hurting non-deterministic tasks and diversity; this undermines test-time scaling and realistic simulations.

Method: Prompt the model to output a random seed string, then manipulate the string to derive the final answer, enabling controlled randomness while satisfying constraints.

Result: SSoT significantly improves PIF performance, approaching ideal pseudo-random parity, and increases response diversity on NoveltyBench.

Conclusion: SSoT offers a simple, effective way to enable probabilistic and diverse responses in LLMs, with broad applicability to non-deterministic tasks; future work could explore limits, generalization, and optimization.

Abstract: We introduce String Seed of Thought (SSoT), a novel prompting method for LLMs
that improves Probabilistic Instruction Following (PIF). We define PIF as a
task requiring an LLM to select its answer from a predefined set of options,
each associated with a specific probability, such that the empirical
distribution of the generated answers aligns with the target distribution when
prompted multiple times. While LLMs excel at tasks with single, deterministic
answers, they often fail at PIF, exhibiting biases problematic for applications
requiring non-deterministic behaviors, such as human-behavior simulation,
content diversification, and multiplayer games. It also harms the diversity of
generated responses, a crucial factor in test-time scaling, by causing the
outputs to collapse into a limited set of answers. To address this, we propose
SSoT, a simple prompting method that instructs an LLM to first output a random
string to generate sufficient entropy. SSoT also instructs the LLM to extract
randomness by manipulating this string to derive a final answer, thereby
preserving diversity while adhering to specific constraints. We demonstrate
that SSoT significantly improves the PIF performance of LLMs, approaching the
ideal performance of a pseudo-random number generator. Furthermore, our
experiments on NoveltyBench show SSoT's benefits extend beyond closed-set tasks
to open-ended tasks by enhancing response diversity.

*Yujin Jo,Taesup Kim*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: NuSA-CL is a lightweight memory-free continual learning framework for zero-shot vision-language models that uses low-rank adaptation and null-space constrained updates to preserve prior knowledge and zero-shot capabilities while requiring minimal overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need to adapt VLMs to evolving environments and novel classes without catastrophic forgetting, without relying on replay or costly distillation, suitable for resource-constrained deployment.

Method: Apply low-rank adaptation (LoRA-like) and constrain task-specific updates to lie within an approximate null space of current parameters, avoiding interference with previously learned knowledge; no replay buffers; lightweight.

Result: Preserves zero-shot transfer abilities and achieves competitive performance on standard continual learning benchmarks with low computational/memory overhead.

Conclusion: NuSA-CL offers a practical, scalable solution for continual zero-shot VLMs in real-world applications.

Abstract: Pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs), such as CLIP, have demonstrated
remarkable zero-shot generalization, enabling deployment in a wide range of
real-world tasks without additional task-specific training. However, in real
deployment scenarios with evolving environments or emerging classes, these
models inevitably face distributional shifts and novel tasks. In such contexts,
static zero-shot capabilities are insufficient, and there is a growing need for
continual learning methods that allow models to adapt over time while avoiding
catastrophic forgetting. We introduce NuSA-CL (Null Space Adaptation for
Continual Learning), a lightweight memory-free continual learning framework
designed to address this challenge. NuSA-CL employs low-rank adaptation and
constrains task-specific weight updates to lie within an approximate null space
of the model's current parameters. This strategy minimizes interference with
previously acquired knowledge, effectively preserving the zero-shot
capabilities of the original model. Unlike methods relying on replay buffers or
costly distillation, NuSA-CL imposes minimal computational and memory overhead,
making it practical for deployment in resource-constrained, real-world
continual learning environments. Experiments show that our framework not only
effectively preserves zero-shot transfer capabilities but also achieves highly
competitive performance on continual learning benchmarks. These results
position NuSA-CL as a practical and scalable solution for continually evolving
zero-shot VLMs in real-world applications.

### [87] [Shylock: Causal Discovery in Multivariate Time Series based on Hybrid Constraints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21181)
*Shuo Li,Keqin Xu,Jie Liu,Dan Ye*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Shylock is a new method for causal discovery in multivariate time series that works well with limited data (few-shot) and normal data by dramatically reducing parameters through group dilated convolution and a shared kernel, while using global and local constraints to enable information sharing; it includes a data-generation method for time-delayed MTS, is evaluated on benchmarks, outperforms two SOTA methods, and comes with a Tcausal library deployed on EarthDataMiner.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Causal relationship discovery in multivariate time series (MTS) is crucial but hampered by data scarcity, reliance on human experience or simple statistics, idealized assumptions, and overfitting when data are limited. A robust method that can learn with few examples and still generalize is needed, along with a practical toolkit.

Method: Shylock uses group dilated convolution and a shared kernel to exponentially reduce the number of parameters while preserving representation of time-delayed relations. It combines global and local constraints to enable information sharing across networks, improving causal inference accuracy. The authors also design a data-generation method to produce MTS with time delay for evaluation. They validate the approach on standard benchmarks and on generated datasets, and implement a library, Tcausal, for easy use and deployment on the EarthDataMiner platform.

Result: Extensive experiments show Shylock outperforms two existing state-of-the-art methods on both few-shot and normal MTS.

Conclusion: Shylock addresses data scarcity and overfitting in MTS causal discovery by parameter reduction and informed representation learning, demonstrating strong empirical performance and providing a usable toolkit (Tcausal) for practitioners via EarthDataMiner.

Abstract: Causal relationship discovery has been drawing increasing attention due to
its prevalent application. Existing methods rely on human experience,
statistical methods, or graphical criteria methods which are error-prone, stuck
at the idealized assumption, and rely on a huge amount of data. And there is
also a serious data gap in accessing Multivariate time series(MTS) in many
areas, adding difficulty in finding their causal relationship. Existing methods
are easy to be over-fitting on them. To fill the gap we mentioned above, in
this paper, we propose Shylock, a novel method that can work well in both
few-shot and normal MTS to find the causal relationship. Shylock can reduce the
number of parameters exponentially by using group dilated convolution and a
sharing kernel, but still learn a better representation of variables with time
delay. By combing the global constraint and the local constraint, Shylock
achieves information sharing among networks to help improve the accuracy. To
evaluate the performance of Shylock, we also design a data generation method to
generate MTS with time delay. We evaluate it on commonly used benchmarks and
generated datasets. Extensive experiments show that Shylock outperforms two
existing state-of-art methods on both few-shot and normal MTS. We also
developed Tcausal, a library for easy use and deployed it on the EarthDataMiner
platform

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes OutboundEval, a domain-oriented benchmark for expert-level outbound calling with a large-model-driven user simulator and dynamic evaluation, showing trade-offs among 12 LLMs and laying groundwork for extensible evaluation in professional outbound AI.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address three major flaws in existing LLM outbound evaluation: insufficient dataset diversity and domain coverage, unrealistic user simulations, and inaccurate evaluation metrics that fail to capture professional outbound task performance.

Method: (1) Benchmark design: six business domains, 30 sub-scenarios with scenario-specific process decomposition, weighted scoring, and domain-adaptive metrics. (2) User simulator: a large-model-driven system generating diverse, persona-rich virtual users with realistic behaviors, emotions, and communication styles. (3) Dynamic evaluation: adaptive to task variations, combining automated metrics with human-in-the-loop assessment to gauge task execution accuracy, knowledge application, adaptability, and user experience.

Result: Experiments on 12 state-of-the-art LLMs reveal clear trade-offs between achieving expert-level task completion and maintaining fluent, natural interactions; the framework yields practical insights for building reliable, human-like outbound AI systems and demonstrates extensibility and domain-oriented benchmarking.

Conclusion: OutboundEval offers a practical, extensible standard for benchmarking LLMs in professional outbound applications, with domain coverage, realistic user modeling, and dynamic evaluation to better reflect real-world usage.

Abstract: We propose OutboundEval, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating large
language models (LLMs) in expert-level intelligent outbound calling scenarios.
Unlike existing methods that suffer from three key limitations - insufficient
dataset diversity and category coverage, unrealistic user simulation, and
inaccurate evaluation metrics - OutboundEval addresses these issues through a
structured framework. First, we design a benchmark spanning six major business
domains and 30 representative sub-scenarios, each with scenario-specific
process decomposition, weighted scoring, and domain-adaptive metrics. Second,
we develop a large-model-driven User Simulator that generates diverse,
persona-rich virtual users with realistic behaviors, emotional variability, and
communication styles, providing a controlled yet authentic testing environment.
Third, we introduce a dynamic evaluation method that adapts to task variations,
integrating automated and human-in-the-loop assessment to measure task
execution accuracy, professional knowledge application, adaptability, and user
experience quality. Experiments on 12 state-of-the-art LLMs reveal distinct
trade-offs between expert-level task completion and interaction fluency,
offering practical insights for building reliable, human-like outbound AI
systems. OutboundEval establishes a practical, extensible, and domain-oriented
standard for benchmarking LLMs in professional applications.

### [89] [Out-of-Distribution Detection for Safety Assurance of AI and Autonomous Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21254)
*Victoria J. Hodge,Colin Paterson,Ibrahim Habli*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A comprehensive review of out-of-distribution (OOD) detection in safety assurance for autonomous systems, outlining concepts, causes of OoD, lifecycle techniques, integration strategies, caveats, and future directions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As autonomous systems operate in safety-critical domains, robust safety assurance requires handling novel or uncertain data. OOD detection is central to this, but challenges remain in applying it across the system lifecycle.

Method: Systematic literature review and synthesis: define OOD concepts, analyze causes of OoD, examine safety-assurance challenges, catalog OOD techniques, map them to stages of the ML development lifecycle, discuss caveats for engineers, and outline future research directions.

Result: Identifies a broad set of OOD detection techniques applicable across the ML lifecycle; maps these techniques to lifecycle stages to support safety-assurance arguments; discusses practical caveats for integration by systems engineers; outlines challenges and directions for future work in safe autonomous-system development and operation.

Conclusion: OOD detection is essential for the safe operation of autonomous systems. While many techniques exist, effective integration into safety assurance requires careful, domain-specific consideration and ongoing research; the review provides a foundation for engineering practice and future work.

Abstract: The operational capabilities and application domains of AI-enabled autonomous
systems have expanded significantly in recent years due to advances in robotics
and machine learning (ML). Demonstrating the safety of autonomous systems
rigorously is critical for their responsible adoption but it is challenging as
it requires robust methodologies that can handle novel and uncertain situations
throughout the system lifecycle, including detecting out-of-distribution (OoD)
data. Thus, OOD detection is receiving increased attention from the research,
development and safety engineering communities. This comprehensive review
analyses OOD detection techniques within the context of safety assurance for
autonomous systems, in particular in safety-critical domains. We begin by
defining the relevant concepts, investigating what causes OOD and exploring the
factors which make the safety assurance of autonomous systems and OOD detection
challenging. Our review identifies a range of techniques which can be used
throughout the ML development lifecycle and we suggest areas within the
lifecycle in which they may be used to support safety assurance arguments. We
discuss a number of caveats that system and safety engineers must be aware of
when integrating OOD detection into system lifecycles. We conclude by outlining
the challenges and future work necessary for the safe development and operation
of autonomous systems across a range of domains and applications.

### [90] [Investigating Scale Independent UCT Exploration Factor Strategies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21275)
*Robin Schmöcker,Christoph Schnell,Alexander Dockhorn*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Adaptive lambda strategies for UCT that are reward-scale-agnostic; introduces five new strategies alongside existing ones; recommends setting lambda = 2*sigma (sigma = empirical std dev of state-action Q-values in the search tree) for improved robustness and performance across tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Remove dependence of UCT's exploration constant on the reward scale of the game, enabling robust performance for games with dense rewards and varied reward magnitudes.

Method: Evaluate multiple lambda-strategies (including five newly proposed ones) for adapting the UCT exploration constant; compare their performance across diverse tasks; identify a recommended strategy based on empirical results; propose a specific strategy: lambda = 2*sigma where sigma is the empirical std dev of all state-action Q-values in the search tree.

Result: The lambda = 2*sigma strategy outperforms existing lambda-strategies across a wide range of tasks, both in terms of a fixed parameter value and when optimizing all available parameters for peak performance.

Conclusion: An exploration-constant strategy based on the empirical standard deviation of Q-values yields a reward-scale-agnostic UCT with superior robustness and performance across tasks.

Abstract: The Upper Confidence Bounds For Trees (UCT) algorithm is not agnostic to the
reward scale of the game it is applied to. For zero-sum games with the sparse
rewards of $\{-1,0,1\}$ at the end of the game, this is not a problem, but many
games often feature dense rewards with hand-picked reward scales, causing a
node's Q-value to span different magnitudes across different games. In this
paper, we evaluate various strategies for adaptively choosing the UCT
exploration constant $\lambda$, called $\lambda$-strategies, that are agnostic
to the game's reward scale. These $\lambda$-strategies include those proposed
in the literature as well as five new strategies. Given our experimental
results, we recommend using one of our newly suggested $\lambda$-strategies,
which is to choose $\lambda$ as $2 \cdot \sigma$ where $\sigma$ is the
empirical standard deviation of all state-action pairs' Q-values of the search
tree. This method outperforms existing $\lambda$-strategies across a wide range
of tasks both in terms of a single parameter value and the peak performances
obtained by optimizing all available parameters.

### [91] [Towards Reliable Code-as-Policies: A Neuro-Symbolic Framework for Embodied Task Planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21302)
*Sanghyun Ahn,Wonje Choi,Junyong Lee,Jinwoo Park,Honguk Woo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Neuro-symbolic framework for embodied task planning that integrates symbolic verification and interactive validation during LLM-generated code to improve grounding and reliability in dynamic, partially observable environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM-based code-as-policies often lack robust environmental grounding, leading to incorrect or incomplete actions in changing environments.

Method: Incorporates explicit symbolic verification and an interactive validation phase where exploratory code interacts with the environment to gather missing observations while preserving task-relevant states; the system interleaves generation, verification, and exploration.

Result: Significant improvements: +46.2% task success over Code-as-Policies baselines; >86.8% executability of task-relevant actions in RLBench and real-world tests.

Conclusion: The integrated neuro-symbolic approach enhances grounding and reliability of LLM-driven task planning in dynamic, partially observable settings.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled the automatic
generation of executable code for task planning and control in embodied agents
such as robots, demonstrating the potential of LLM-based embodied intelligence.
However, these LLM-based code-as-policies approaches often suffer from limited
environmental grounding, particularly in dynamic or partially observable
settings, leading to suboptimal task success rates due to incorrect or
incomplete code generation. In this work, we propose a neuro-symbolic embodied
task planning framework that incorporates explicit symbolic verification and
interactive validation processes during code generation. In the validation
phase, the framework generates exploratory code that actively interacts with
the environment to acquire missing observations while preserving task-relevant
states. This integrated process enhances the grounding of generated code,
resulting in improved task reliability and success rates in complex
environments. We evaluate our framework on RLBench and in real-world settings
across dynamic, partially observable scenarios. Experimental results
demonstrate that our framework improves task success rates by 46.2% over
Code-as-Policies baselines and attains over 86.8% executability of
task-relevant actions, thereby enhancing the reliability of task planning in
dynamic environments.

### [92] [When Models Outthink Their Safety: Mitigating Self-Jailbreak in Large Reasoning Models with Chain-of-Guardrails](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21285)
*Yingzhi Mao,Chunkang Zhang,Junxiang Wang,Xinyan Guan,Boxi Cao,Yaojie Lu,Hongyu Lin,Xianpei Han,Le Sun*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Large Reasoning Models are vulnerable to safety-reasoning trade-offs and can exhibit a Self-Jailbreak where they override risk assessments. The paper introduces Chain-of-Guardrail (CoG) to recombine or backtrack unsafe reasoning steps, steering back to safe trajectories while preserving valid reasoning, and reports strong safety gains with little to no loss in reasoning performance across benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and mitigate safety risks in LRMs without unduly harming reasoning ability, by studying reasoning trajectories and the Self-Jailbreak phenomenon that reveals latent safety capabilities.

Method: Analyze reasoning trajectories of diverse LRMs to identify Self-Jailbreak, then propose Chain-of-Guardrail (CoG): a training framework that recomposes or backtracks unsafe reasoning steps to steer the model back to safe trajectories while preserving valid reasoning chains.

Result: CoG substantially improves safety on LRMs while maintaining comparable reasoning ability and significantly outperforming prior methods that harm safety-reasoning performance trade-offs.

Conclusion: CoG provides a scalable approach to align LRMs for safe reasoning without sacrificing reasoning capability, validated across multiple reasoning and safety benchmarks.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities on complex
reasoning tasks but remain vulnerable to severe safety risks, including harmful
content generation and jailbreak attacks. Existing mitigation strategies rely
on injecting heuristic safety signals during training, which often suppress
reasoning ability and fail to resolve the safety-reasoning trade-off. To
systematically investigate this issue, we analyze the reasoning trajectories of
diverse LRMs and uncover a phenomenon we term Self-Jailbreak, where models
override their own risk assessments and justify responding to unsafe prompts.
This finding reveals that LRMs inherently possess the ability to reject unsafe
queries, but this ability is compromised, resulting in harmful outputs.
Building on these insights, we propose the Chain-of-Guardrail (CoG), a training
framework that recomposes or backtracks unsafe reasoning steps, steering the
model back onto safe trajectories while preserving valid reasoning chains.
Extensive experiments across multiple reasoning and safety benchmarks
demonstrate that CoG substantially improves the safety of current LRMs while
preserving comparable reasoning ability, significantly outperforming prior
methods that suffer from severe safety-reasoning trade-offs.

*Siddharth Mehrotra,Jin Huang,Xuelong Fu,Roel Dobbe,Clara I. Sánchez,Maarten de Rijke*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A scoping review of AIES and FAccT papers shows progress in defining technical trust attributes but gaps in sociotechnical aspects; emphasizes need for interdisciplinary trust frameworks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how AI trustworthiness is defined, measured, and validated in the AIES and FAccT communities and to identify gaps and opportunities for holistic trustworthy AI.

Method: Scoping review of conference proceedings from AIES and FAccT; analyze definitions, operationalization, verification/validation techniques, application areas, underlying values; cross-domain synthesis.

Result: Techniques have focused on transparency, accountability, robustness; sociotechnical and value-based dimensions are underexplored; trustworthiness is contested and shaped by power holders.

Conclusion: Interdisciplinary approach integrating technical rigor with social, cultural, and institutional considerations; propose actionable measures for holistic trustworthy AI frameworks.

Abstract: Background: Trustworthy AI serves as a foundational pillar for two major AI
ethics conferences: AIES and FAccT. However, current research often adopts
techno-centric approaches, focusing primarily on technical attributes such as
reliability, robustness, and fairness, while overlooking the sociotechnical
dimensions critical to understanding AI trustworthiness in real-world contexts.
  Objectives: This scoping review aims to examine how the AIES and FAccT
communities conceptualize, measure, and validate AI trustworthiness,
identifying major gaps and opportunities for advancing a holistic understanding
of trustworthy AI systems.
  Methods: We conduct a scoping review of AIES and FAccT conference proceedings
to date, systematically analyzing how trustworthiness is defined,
operationalized, and applied across different research domains. Our analysis
focuses on conceptualization approaches, measurement methods, verification and
validation techniques, application areas, and underlying values.
  Results: While significant progress has been made in defining technical
attributes such as transparency, accountability, and robustness, our findings
reveal critical gaps. Current research often predominantly emphasizes technical
precision at the expense of social and ethical considerations. The
sociotechnical nature of AI systems remains less explored and trustworthiness
emerges as a contested concept shaped by those with the power to define it.
  Conclusions: An interdisciplinary approach combining technical rigor with
social, cultural, and institutional considerations is essential for advancing
trustworthy AI. We propose actionable measures for the AI ethics community to
adopt holistic frameworks that genuinely address the complex interplay between
AI systems and society, ultimately promoting responsible technological
development that benefits all stakeholders.

### [94] [Learning Neural Control Barrier Functions from Expert Demonstrations using Inverse Constraint Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21560)
*Yuxuan Yang,Hussein Sibai*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ICL-based labeling is used to train a neural CBF for autonomous safety by classifying states as safe or unsafe to avoid an unspecified failure set, leveraging expert demonstrations; it outperforms baselines and matches performance of CBFs trained with ground-truth safety labels across four environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Safety for autonomous systems is critical, but failure sets can be hard to specify formally. Learning-based CBFs require labeled data; the proposed approach uses in-context learning to derive a safety constraint from demonstrations, enabling data-efficient neural CBF training.

Method: Train a constraint function via in-context learning that labels states as safe (belonging to a forward invariant set disjoint from the failure set) or unsafe (complement). Use this function to label simulated trajectories and train a neural CBF. Evaluate on four environments and compare to baselines and a neural CBF trained with ground-truth safety labels.

Result: The method outperforms existing baselines and achieves performance comparable to a neural CBF trained with ground-truth safety labels on the same data.

Conclusion: ICL-based labeling provides an effective, data-efficient pathway to neural CBF synthesis when explicit failure sets are unknown, delivering strong safety performance across varied environments.

Abstract: Safety is a fundamental requirement for autonomous systems operating in
critical domains. Control barrier functions (CBFs) have been used to design
safety filters that minimally alter nominal controls for such systems to
maintain their safety. Learning neural CBFs has been proposed as a data-driven
alternative for their computationally expensive optimization-based synthesis.
However, it is often the case that the failure set of states that should be
avoided is non-obvious or hard to specify formally, e.g., tailgating in
autonomous driving, while a set of expert demonstrations that achieve the task
and avoid the failure set is easier to generate. We use ICL to train a
constraint function that classifies the states of the system under
consideration to safe, i.e., belong to a controlled forward invariant set that
is disjoint from the unspecified failure set, and unsafe ones, i.e., belong to
the complement of that set. We then use that function to label a new set of
simulated trajectories to train our neural CBF. We empirically evaluate our
approach in four different environments, demonstrating that it outperforms
existing baselines and achieves comparable performance to a neural CBF trained
with the same data but annotated with ground-truth safety labels.

### [95] [CXRAgent: Director-Orchestrated Multi-Stage Reasoning for Chest X-Ray Interpretation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21324)
*Jinhui Lou,Yan Yang,Zhou Yu,Zhenqi Fu,Weidong Han,Qingming Huang,Jun Yu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CXRAgent is a director-driven, multi-stage agent for chest X-ray interpretation that coordinates diverse CXR-analysis tools, uses an Evidence-driven Validator (EDV) for visual-grounded verification, assembles an expert team through diagnostic planning, and combines insights for an evidence-backed diagnosis. It shows strong performance across tasks and generalizes to varying clinical complexities, with code available online.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current CXR interpretation models struggle to adapt to new diagnostic tasks and complex reasoning. Many existing agents rely on a single diagnostic pipeline and lack mechanisms to assess the reliability of tools, limiting adaptability and credibility. There is a need for a controller that ensures credible tool usage with evidence grounding and collaborative reasoning.

Method: A director orchestrates three stages: (1) Tool Invocation where multiple CXR-analysis tools are strategically used, outputs are normalized and verified by an Evidence-driven Validator (EDV) that grounds results with visual evidence; (2) Diagnostic Planning where, guided by task requirements and intermediate findings, a targeted plan is formulated and an expert team is assembled with defined roles; (3) Collaborative Decision-making where the agent integrates expert insights with contextual memories to synthesize an evidence-backed diagnostic conclusion.

Result: Experiments on various CXR interpretation tasks show CXRAgent delivers strong performance, provides visual evidence, and generalizes well to clinical tasks of different complexity.

Conclusion: CXRAgent enhances adaptability and credibility in CXR interpretation by combining tool coordination, EDV-grounded evidence, and collaborative reasoning; code and data are available at the provided GitHub link.

Abstract: Chest X-ray (CXR) plays a pivotal role in clinical diagnosis, and a variety
of task-specific and foundation models have been developed for automatic CXR
interpretation. However, these models often struggle to adapt to new diagnostic
tasks and complex reasoning scenarios. Recently, LLM-based agent models have
emerged as a promising paradigm for CXR analysis, enhancing model's capability
through tool coordination, multi-step reasoning, and team collaboration, etc.
However, existing agents often rely on a single diagnostic pipeline and lack
mechanisms for assessing tools' reliability, limiting their adaptability and
credibility. To this end, we propose CXRAgent, a director-orchestrated,
multi-stage agent for CXR interpretation, where a central director coordinates
the following stages: (1) Tool Invocation: The agent strategically orchestrates
a set of CXR-analysis tools, with outputs normalized and verified by the
Evidence-driven Validator (EDV), which grounds diagnostic outputs with visual
evidence to support reliable downstream diagnosis; (2) Diagnostic Planning:
Guided by task requirements and intermediate findings, the agent formulates a
targeted diagnostic plan. It then assembles an expert team accordingly,
defining member roles and coordinating their interactions to enable adaptive
and collaborative reasoning; (3) Collaborative Decision-making: The agent
integrates insights from the expert team with accumulated contextual memories,
synthesizing them into an evidence-backed diagnostic conclusion. Experiments on
various CXR interpretation tasks show that CXRAgent delivers strong
performance, providing visual evidence and generalizes well to clinical tasks
of different complexity. Code and data are valuable at this

*Lufan Chang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Magellan introduces a principled guided search (Monte Carlo Tree Search) over an LLM's latent space, using a semantic compass for long-range direction and a landscape-aware value function for local decisions, yielding superior creative ideas over ToT and ReAct.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often default to tired, high-probability ideas and current search-based methods rely on imperfect self-evaluation heuristics. There is a need for principled exploration of the model's latent concept space to enhance true innovation.

Method: Magellan applies Monte Carlo Tree Search with a hierarchical guidance system. A semantic compass—an orthogonal-projection vector—steers long-range exploration toward novelty and relevance. A landscape-aware value function provides explicit rewards balancing intrinsic coherence, extrinsic novelty, and narrative progress to guide local decisions.

Result: Extensive experiments show Magellan significantly outperforms strong baselines (e.g., ReAct and Tree of Thoughts) in generating scientific ideas that better balance plausibility and innovation.

Conclusion: For creative discovery, a principled, guided search framework is more effective than unconstrained agency, enabling LLMs to be better partners in innovation.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle with generating truly innovative
ideas, typically defaulting to high-probability, familiar concepts within their
training data's "gravity wells." While advanced search-based methods like Tree
of Thoughts (ToT) attempt to mitigate this, they are fundamentally limited by
their reliance on unprincipled, inconsistent self-evaluation heuristics to
guide exploration. To address this gap, we introduce \textbf{Magellan}, a novel
framework that reframes creative generation as a principled, guided exploration
of an LLM's latent conceptual space. At its core, Magellan employs Monte Carlo
Tree Search (MCTS) governed by a hierarchical guidance system. For long-range
direction, a "semantic compass" vector, formulated via orthogonal projection,
steers the search towards relevant novelty. For local, step-by-step decisions,
a landscape-aware value function replaces flawed self-evaluation with an
explicit reward structure that balances intrinsic coherence, extrinsic novelty,
and narrative progress. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Magellan
significantly outperforms strong baselines, including ReAct and ToT, in
generating scientific ideas with superior plausibility and innovation. Our work
shows that for creative discovery, a principled, guided search is more
effective than unconstrained agency, paving the way for LLMs to become more
capable partners in innovation.

### [97] [Boosting Accuracy and Efficiency of Budget Forcing in LLMs via Reinforcement Learning for Mathematical Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21398)
*Ravindra Aribowo Tarunokusumo,Rafael Fernandes Cunha*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A framework combines supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with reinforcement learning (RL) to improve token efficiency and reasoning accuracy for a 1.5B model under budgeted decoding, achieving higher GSM8K accuracy with ~40% fewer tokens across various compute budgets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Budget-forcing decoding relies on long-context SFT, which degrades performance on smaller models due to verbose responses. There is a need for a token-efficient training paradigm that preserves or enhances reasoning capabilities when compute budgets are limited.

Method: Incorporates reinforcement learning (RL) with SFT (SFT+RL) on a 1.5B model, trained on a small dataset (1.5K samples). The approach aims to reduce token usage while improving mathematical reasoning. Evaluation is performed on GSM8K across varying compute budgets, comparing against an SFT baseline.

Result: SFT+RL achieves higher accuracy on GSM8K and reduces token usage by over 40% compared to the SFT model, demonstrating improved token efficiency and sustained reasoning performance under budget constraints.

Conclusion: RL can mitigate losses from long-context SFT training, delivering better mathematical reasoning performance for small-to-medium LMs when decoding budgets are constrained.

Abstract: Test-time scaling methods have seen a rapid increase in popularity for its
computational efficiency and parameter-independent training to improve
reasoning performance on Large Language Models. One such method is called
budget forcing, a decoding intervention strategy which allocates extra compute
budget for thinking and elicits the inherent self-correcting behavior of the
model. However, this relies on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on long-context
reasoning traces which causes performance degradation on smaller models due to
verbose responses. For this reason, we offer a framework integrating
reinforcement learning (RL) to improve token efficiency and boost the
performance of a 1.5B model for mathematical reasoning. We demonstrate this
using only 1.5K training samples and found that our SFT+RL model performed
better on the GSM8K dataset with varying compute budgets. Our main findings
showed an overall higher accuracy while significantly reducing its token usage
by over 40% compared to the SFT model, revealing how RL can recover the losses
due to long-context training and altogether improving performance in
mathematical reasoning.

TL;DR: Taxonomy and roadmap for symbolic integration of NeSy AI with LLMs to boost transparency, organized around four dimensions: (1) stages of LLM processing, (2) coupling mechanisms, (3) architectural paradigms, and (4) algorithmic/application perspectives, with benchmarks, advancements, and gaps identified.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are powerful but opaque; current Neurosymbolic AI methods were designed for traditional neural networks and do not translate well to LLMs. There is a need for a systematic understanding and roadmap to integrate symbolic techniques into LLMs to improve transparency.

Method: Comprehensive literature review of NeSy AI approaches; development of a novel four-dimension taxonomy for symbolic integration in LLMs; construction of a roadmap to merge symbolic and neural methods; mapping of current benchmarks, advances, and gaps to inform future research.

Result: Introduction of a structured taxonomy and roadmap that consolidates existing work, clarifies how symbolic methods can be integrated at multiple levels of LLMs, and identifies benchmarks and critical gaps to guide future research and practical implementation.

Conclusion: Symbolic integration into LLMs is feasible and beneficial. The proposed four-dimension taxonomy and roadmap provide a systematic path to enhance transparency by bridging NeSy AI with modern LLMs and by outlining priorities for benchmarks and future work.

Abstract: LLMs have demonstrated highly effective learning, human-like response
generation,and decision-making capabilities in high-risk sectors. However,
these models remain black boxes because they struggle to ensure transparency in
responses. The literature has explored numerous approaches to address
transparency challenges in LLMs, including Neurosymbolic AI (NeSy AI). NeSy AI
approaches were primarily developed for conventional neural networks and are
not well-suited to the unique features of LLMs. Consequently, there is a
limited systematic understanding of how symbolic AI can be effectively
integrated into LLMs. This paper aims to address this gap by first reviewing
established NeSy AI methods and then proposing a novel taxonomy of symbolic
integration in LLMs, along with a roadmap to merge symbolic techniques with
LLMs. The roadmap introduces a new categorisation framework across four
dimensions by organising existing literature within these categories. These
include symbolic integration across various stages of LLM, coupling mechanisms,
architectural paradigms, as well as algorithmic and application-level
perspectives. The paper thoroughly identifies current benchmarks, cutting-edge
advancements, and critical gaps within the field to propose a roadmap for
future research. By highlighting the latest developments and notable gaps in
the literature, it offers practical insights for implementing frameworks for
symbolic integration into LLMs to enhance transparency.

### [99] [AutoOpt: A Dataset and a Unified Framework for Automating Optimization Problem Solving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21436)
*Ankur Sinha,Shobhit Arora,Dhaval Pujara*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AutoOpt-11k is a large image dataset of 11k optimization problem formulations (handwritten and printed) with LaTeX and Pyomo representations, paired with a three-module AutoOpt framework that converts images to executable models and solves them. It includes MER (image-to-LaTeX), Text-to-Text (LaTeX to Pyomo), and a BO-based decomposition solver; the system outperforms baselines and traditional solvers on complex problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable end-to-end automated solving of optimization problems from visual formulations, reducing human effort in translating images of problem statements into executable models and solving them, while handling diverse problem types (single/multi-objective, multi-level, stochastic) and complexities.

Method: Create AutoOpt-11k dataset with 11k images labeled by 25 experts, verified in two phases. Develop AutoOpt with three modules: M1 MER (image to LaTeX), M2 Text_to_Text (LaTeX to Pyomo via fine-tuned LLM), M3 Optimization (BOBD: bilevel optimization-based decomposition) to solve Pyomo models. Train/test M1 on AutoOpt-11k; evaluate M1 via BLEU against ChatGPT, Gemini, Nougat; assess M3 against interior-point and GA on complex problems.

Result: M1 MER model achieves higher BLEU scores than ChatGPT, Gemini, and Nougat. M3 BOBD yields better performance on complex test problems than standard approaches like interior-point and genetic algorithms.

Conclusion: AutoOpt provides a complete pipeline from image-based problem formulations to automated solving, backed by a large curated dataset and a three-module framework. This advances ML-assisted optimization by reducing human intervention and improving performance on challenging problem classes.

Abstract: This study presents AutoOpt-11k, a unique image dataset of over 11,000
handwritten and printed mathematical optimization models corresponding to
single-objective, multi-objective, multi-level, and stochastic optimization
problems exhibiting various types of complexities such as non-linearity,
non-convexity, non-differentiability, discontinuity, and high-dimensionality.
The labels consist of the LaTeX representation for all the images and modeling
language representation for a subset of images. The dataset is created by 25
experts following ethical data creation guidelines and verified in two-phases
to avoid errors. Further, we develop AutoOpt framework, a machine learning
based automated approach for solving optimization problems, where the user just
needs to provide an image of the formulation and AutoOpt solves it efficiently
without any further human intervention. AutoOpt framework consists of three
Modules: (i) M1 (Image_to_Text)- a deep learning model performs the
Mathematical Expression Recognition (MER) task to generate the LaTeX code
corresponding to the optimization formulation in image; (ii) M2 (Text_to_Text)-
a small-scale fine-tuned LLM generates the PYOMO script (optimization modeling
language) from LaTeX code; (iii) M3 (Optimization)- a Bilevel Optimization
based Decomposition (BOBD) method solves the optimization formulation described
in the PYOMO script. We use AutoOpt-11k dataset for training and testing of
deep learning models employed in AutoOpt. The deep learning model for MER task
(M1) outperforms ChatGPT, Gemini and Nougat on BLEU score metric. BOBD method
(M3), which is a hybrid approach, yields better results on complex test
problems compared to common approaches, like interior-point algorithm and
genetic algorithm.

### [100] [Multi-Task Vehicle Routing Solver via Mixture of Specialized Experts under State-Decomposable MDP](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21453)
*Yuxin Pan,Zhiguang Cao,Chengyang Gu,Liu Liu,Peilin Zhao,Yize Chen,Fangzhen Lin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes SDMDP and MoSES to reuse basis VRP solvers via state decomposition and latent mixture, yielding a scalable, superior unified solver across VRP variants.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VRP variants are compositional and derivable from a shared basis set, but existing multi-task neural solvers underutilize this structure. Reusing specialized basis solvers could mitigate exponential solver growth and improve performance.

Method: Introduce State-Decomposable MDP (SDMDP) with state space as a Cartesian product of basis state spaces, yielding optimal basis policies. Extend to Latent Space-based SDMDP with a learnable mixture function to enable policy reuse in latent space. Implement Mixture-of-Specialized-Experts Solver (MoSES) using specialized LoRA experts to realize basis policies and an adaptive gating mechanism for the mixture. Provide theoretical conditions under which the latent extension recovers the optimal unified policy.

Result: Extensive experiments across VRP variants show MoSES outperforms prior methods, validating the approach.

Conclusion: The framework enables scalable reuse of basis policies to construct superior unified solvers for multi-task VRPs. Under mild assumptions, the latent extension can recover the optimal unified policy, offering practical gains via MoSES.

Abstract: Existing neural methods for multi-task vehicle routing problems (VRPs)
typically learn unified solvers to handle multiple constraints simultaneously.
However, they often underutilize the compositional structure of VRP variants,
each derivable from a common set of basis VRP variants. This critical oversight
causes unified solvers to miss out the potential benefits of basis solvers,
each specialized for a basis VRP variant. To overcome this limitation, we
propose a framework that enables unified solvers to perceive the
shared-component nature across VRP variants by proactively reusing basis
solvers, while mitigating the exponential growth of trained neural solvers.
Specifically, we introduce a State-Decomposable MDP (SDMDP) that reformulates
VRPs by expressing the state space as the Cartesian product of basis state
spaces associated with basis VRP variants. More crucially, this formulation
inherently yields the optimal basis policy for each basis VRP variant.
Furthermore, a Latent Space-based SDMDP extension is developed by incorporating
both the optimal basis policies and a learnable mixture function to enable the
policy reuse in the latent space. Under mild assumptions, this extension
provably recovers the optimal unified policy of SDMDP through the mixture
function that computes the state embedding as a mapping from the basis state
embeddings generated by optimal basis policies. For practical implementation,
we introduce the Mixture-of-Specialized-Experts Solver (MoSES), which realizes
basis policies through specialized Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) experts, and
implements the mixture function via an adaptive gating mechanism. Extensive
experiments conducted across VRP variants showcase the superiority of MoSES
over prior methods.

### [101] [EU-Agent-Bench: Measuring Illegal Behavior of LLM Agents Under EU Law](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21524)
*Ilija Lichkovski,Alexander Müller,Mariam Ibrahim,Tiwai Mhundwa*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: EU-Agent-Bench is a human-curated, verifiable benchmark that measures whether LLM agents align with EU legal norms in scenarios where benign prompts could lead to unlawful actions. It uses a rubric backed by legal citations to assess model behavior, tests the impact of including legislative excerpts in the system prompt, and provides a public preview data set with a private test set to prevent data contamination. The work aims to extend to other jurisdictions and multi-turn/multilingual settings, and releases code.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To quantify the latent propensity of LLM agents to take illegal actions within an EU regulatory context, addressing safety concerns about agentic behavior and providing a legally grounded, verifiable evaluation framework.

Method: Construct categories of scenarios (data protection, bias/discrimination, scientific integrity) with user inputs that permit compliant and non-compliant execution. Evaluate the model by comparing its function calls against a rubric exhaustively supported by citations to relevant EU legislation. Examine the effect of supplying EU legislative excerpts in the system prompt with explicit compliance instructions. Use a public preview set and a private test set to ensure data integrity. Release code publicly.

Result: The paper presents a verifiable benchmark and baseline evaluations showing how EU legal norms can be used to assess LLM agent compliance. It also demonstrates the impact of including legislative excerpts in the system prompt on compliance, and makes available a public preview dataset and a private withheld test set; code is released.

Conclusion: EU-Agent-Bench offers a reproducible, legally grounded framework for evaluating EU compliance of frontier LLMs and invites extensions to other jurisdictions and multilingual/multi-turn interactions, with open-source code.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as agents in various
contexts by providing tools at their disposal. However, LLM agents can exhibit
unpredictable behaviors, including taking undesirable and/or unsafe actions. In
order to measure the latent propensity of LLM agents for taking illegal actions
under an EU legislative context, we introduce EU-Agent-Bench, a verifiable
human-curated benchmark that evaluates an agent's alignment with EU legal norms
in situations where benign user inputs could lead to unlawful actions. Our
benchmark spans scenarios across several categories, including data protection,
bias/discrimination, and scientific integrity, with each user request allowing
for both compliant and non-compliant execution of the requested actions.
Comparing the model's function calls against a rubric exhaustively supported by
citations of the relevant legislature, we evaluate the legal compliance of
frontier LLMs, and furthermore investigate the compliance effect of providing
the relevant legislative excerpts in the agent's system prompt along with
explicit instructions to comply. We release a public preview set for the
research community, while holding out a private test set to prevent data
contamination in evaluating upcoming models. We encourage future work extending
agentic safety benchmarks to different legal jurisdictions and to multi-turn
and multilingual interactions. We release our code on

### [102] [Co-Sight: Enhancing LLM-Based Agents via Conflict-Aware Meta-Verification and Trustworthy Reasoning with Structured Facts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21557)
*Hongwei Zhang,Ji Lu,Shiqing Jiang,Chenxiang Zhu,Li Xie,Chen Zhong,Haoran Chen,Yurui Zhu,Yongsheng Du,Yanqin Gao,Lingjun Huang,Baoli Wang,Fang Tan,Peng Zou*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Co-Sight introduces a scalable verification framework for long-horizon LLM reasoning, combining Conflict-Aware Meta-Verification (CAMV) with Trustworthy Reasoning with Structured Facts (TRSF). TRSF provides structured, verifiable facts while CAMV focuses verification on disagreement hotspots via targeted falsification, forming a closed loop that grounds reasoning and improves reliability and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long-horizon reasoning in LLM agents often falters due to weak verification of intermediate steps. Full-chain verification is costly; there is a need for a falsifiable, auditable process that scales with reasoning length and maintains grounded, source-verified information.

Method: Two components: (1) CAMV reformulates verification as conflict identification and targeted falsification across expert agents, concentrating computation on hotspots of disagreement; (2) TRSF maintains a structured facts module that organizes, validates, and synchronizes evidence, ensuring reasoning is grounded in verified information. Together they create a closed loop where TRSF provides facts and CAMV selectively falsifies or reinforces them.

Result: Empirically, Co-Sight achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on GAIA (84.4%), Humanity's Last Exam (35.5%), and strong results on Chinese-SimpleQA (93.8%). Ablation studies show that the synergy between structured grounding and conflict-aware verification drives improvements, with efficiency gains due to targeted verification.

Conclusion: Co-Sight offers a scalable paradigm for reliable long-horizon reasoning in LLM-based agents by grounding reasoning in structured facts and employing conflict-aware verification; code is available at the provided GitHub link.

Abstract: Long-horizon reasoning in LLM-based agents often fails not from generative
weakness but from insufficient verification of intermediate reasoning. Co-Sight
addresses this challenge by turning reasoning into a falsifiable and auditable
process through two complementary mechanisms: Conflict-Aware Meta-Verification
(CAMV) and Trustworthy Reasoning with Structured Facts (TRSF). CAMV
reformulates verification as conflict identification and targeted
falsification, allocating computation only to disagreement hotspots among
expert agents rather than to full reasoning chains. This bounds verification
cost to the number of inconsistencies and improves efficiency and reliability.
TRSF continuously organizes, validates, and synchronizes evidence across agents
through a structured facts module. By maintaining verified, traceable, and
auditable knowledge, it ensures that all reasoning is grounded in consistent,
source-verified information and supports transparent verification throughout
the reasoning process. Together, TRSF and CAMV form a closed verification loop,
where TRSF supplies structured facts and CAMV selectively falsifies or
reinforces them, yielding transparent and trustworthy reasoning. Empirically,
Co-Sight achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on GAIA (84.4%) and Humanity's Last
Exam (35.5%), and strong results on Chinese-SimpleQA (93.8%). Ablation studies
confirm that the synergy between structured factual grounding and
conflict-aware verification drives these improvements. Co-Sight thus offers a
scalable paradigm for reliable long-horizon reasoning in LLM-based agents. Code

*Wenyi Wang,Piotr Piękos,Li Nanbo,Firas Laakom,Yimeng Chen,Mateusz Ostaszewski,Mingchen Zhuge,Jürgen Schmidhuber*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Introduces CMP, a metric aggregating descendants' benchmark performance to estimate self-improvement potential; proposes HGM guided by CMP to search self-modification trees; shows superior performance on SWE-bench variants and transfer to other datasets/LLMs; code released.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a mismatch between self-improvement potential (metaproductivity) and coding benchmark performance in self-modifying agents. Need a predictor and guidance mechanism inspired by clades and Gödel machines to improve search.

Method: Define CMP as aggregated benchmark outcomes of descendants; show that access to true CMP can simulate Gödel machine-like behavior; develop HGM that uses CMP as guidance to explore the self-modification tree; evaluate on SWE-bench Verified and Polyglot with GPT-5 family; perform transfer experiments; report best results and code.

Result: HGM outperforms prior self-improving coding agent methods, using less wall-clock time; demonstrates strong transfer to other datasets and LLMs; achieves human-level performance on SWE-bench Lite with GPT-5; code available.

Conclusion: CMP is a meaningful predictor of self-improvement potential; HGM demonstrates effective search guidance in self-modifying agents and generalizes across datasets/LLMs; the approach advances safe, efficient self-improvement in coding agents and is reproducible.

Abstract: Recent studies operationalize self-improvement through coding agents that
edit their own codebases. They grow a tree of self-modifications through
expansion strategies that favor higher software engineering benchmark
performance, assuming that this implies more promising subsequent
self-modifications. However, we identify a mismatch between the agent's
self-improvement potential (metaproductivity) and its coding benchmark
performance, namely the Metaproductivity-Performance Mismatch. Inspired by
Huxley's concept of clade, we propose a metric ($\mathrm{CMP}$) that aggregates
the benchmark performances of the descendants of an agent as an indicator of
its potential for self-improvement. We show that, in our self-improving coding
agent development setting, access to the true $\mathrm{CMP}$ is sufficient to
simulate how the G\"odel Machine would behave under certain assumptions. We
introduce the Huxley-G\"odel Machine (HGM), which, by estimating $\mathrm{CMP}$
and using it as guidance, searches the tree of self-modifications. On SWE-bench
Verified and Polyglot, HGM outperforms prior self-improving coding agent
development methods while using less wall-clock time. Last but not least, HGM
demonstrates strong transfer to other coding datasets and large language
models. The agent optimized by HGM on SWE-bench Verified with GPT-5-mini and
evaluated on SWE-bench Lite with GPT-5 achieves human-level performance,
matching the best officially checked results of human-engineered coding agents.
Our code is available at https://github.com/metauto-ai/HGM.

*Xiaoxi Li,Wenxiang Jiao,Jiarui Jin,Guanting Dong,Jiajie Jin,Yinuo Wang,Hao Wang,Yutao Zhu,Ji-Rong Wen,Yuan Lu,Zhicheng Dou*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DeepAgent is an end-to-end reasoning agent that autonomously thinks, discovers tools, and executes actions with a memory folding mechanism and ToolPO reinforcement learning, achieving strong results on eight benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world tasks require long-horizon problem solving and external tools; existing agents rely on predefined workflows and accumulate context/history poorly, limiting autonomy and performance.

Method: An end-to-end deep reasoning agent that integrates autonomous thinking, tool discovery, and action execution. It introduces a memory folding mechanism that compresses past interactions into episodic, working, and tool memories to curb context explosion and error accumulation. It also presents ToolPO, an end-to-end RL strategy that uses LLM-simulated APIs and tool-call advantage attribution to credit tool invocations.

Result: DeepAgent consistently outperforms baselines across eight benchmarks in both labeled-tool and open-set tool retrieval scenarios, demonstrating strong generalization to general tool-use tasks and downstream applications.

Conclusion: This work advances toward more general and capable agents for real-world applications, with code and demo available for replication.

Abstract: Large reasoning models have demonstrated strong problem-solving abilities,
yet real-world tasks often require external tools and long-horizon
interactions. Existing agent frameworks typically follow predefined workflows,
which limit autonomous and global task completion. In this paper, we introduce
DeepAgent, an end-to-end deep reasoning agent that performs autonomous
thinking, tool discovery, and action execution within a single, coherent
reasoning process. To address the challenges of long-horizon interactions,
particularly the context length explosion from multiple tool calls and the
accumulation of interaction history, we introduce an autonomous memory folding
mechanism that compresses past interactions into structured episodic, working,
and tool memories, reducing error accumulation while preserving critical
information. To teach general-purpose tool use efficiently and stably, we
develop an end-to-end reinforcement learning strategy, namely ToolPO, that
leverages LLM-simulated APIs and applies tool-call advantage attribution to
assign fine-grained credit to the tool invocation tokens. Extensive experiments
on eight benchmarks, including general tool-use tasks (ToolBench, API-Bank,
TMDB, Spotify, ToolHop) and downstream applications (ALFWorld, WebShop, GAIA,
HLE), demonstrate that DeepAgent consistently outperforms baselines across both
labeled-tool and open-set tool retrieval scenarios. This work takes a step
toward more general and capable agents for real-world applications. The code

Weld*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AstaBench provides the first holistic benchmark for AI agents in scientific research, featuring 2400+ problems across domains, a production-grade research environment with search tools, nine science-optimized agent classes, and baselines; evaluation of 57 agents across 22 classes shows measurable progress but reveals that AI has not yet solved science research assistance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the shortcomings of prior benchmarks in AI science agents, which often lacked holistic, reproducible, and confounder-aware evaluation, standardized prototyping interfaces, and comprehensive baselines; the goal is to enable rigorous, real-world-relevant assessment of agentic scientific capabilities.

Method: Define benchmarking principles and tooling; construct AstaBench with 2400+ problems spanning multiple scientific domains, including user-inspired tasks; implement a scientific research environment with production-grade search tools to enable controlled, reproducible evaluation; provide nine science-optimized agent classes and numerous baselines; evaluate a diverse set of 57 agents across 22 agent classes to identify performance patterns and confounding factors.

Result: AstaBench delivers the first holistic measure of an agentic ability to perform scientific research, offering standardized interfaces, reproducible evaluation, and a broad, real-world-oriented problem suite; it reveals meaningful progress on some aspects but indicates AI is not yet capable of fully solving science research assistance.

Conclusion: The study represents a significant step forward in rigorous benchmarking for science-oriented AI agents, establishing a practical, reproducible evaluation framework and baselines; however, more work is needed to close the gap to fully autonomous, capable science research agents.

Abstract: AI agents hold the potential to revolutionize scientific productivity by
automating literature reviews, replicating experiments, analyzing data, and
even proposing new directions of inquiry; indeed, there are now many such
agents, ranging from general-purpose "deep research" systems to specialized
science-specific agents, such as AI Scientist and AIGS. Rigorous evaluation of
these agents is critical for progress. Yet existing benchmarks fall short on
several fronts: they (1) fail to provide holistic, product-informed measures of
real-world use cases such as science research; (2) lack reproducible agent
tools necessary for a controlled comparison of core agentic capabilities; (3)
do not account for confounding variables such as model cost and tool access;
(4) do not provide standardized interfaces for quick agent prototyping and
evaluation; and (5) lack comprehensive baseline agents necessary to identify
true advances. In response, we define principles and tooling for more
rigorously benchmarking agents. Using these, we present AstaBench, a suite that
provides the first holistic measure of agentic ability to perform scientific
research, comprising 2400+ problems spanning the entire scientific discovery
process and multiple scientific domains, and including many problems inspired
by actual user requests to deployed Asta agents. Our suite comes with the first
scientific research environment with production-grade search tools that enable
controlled, reproducible evaluation, better accounting for confounders.
Alongside, we provide a comprehensive suite of nine science-optimized classes
of Asta agents and numerous baselines. Our extensive evaluation of 57 agents
across 22 agent classes reveals several interesting findings, most importantly
that despite meaningful progress on certain individual aspects, AI remains far
from solving the challenge of science research assistance.

*Marta Contreiras Silva,Daniel Faria,Catia Pesquita*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CMOMgen is an end-to-end framework for complex multi-ontology matching that generates complete, semantically sound mappings across arbitrary numbers of target ontologies, using Retrieval-Augmented Generation to assemble mappings and leverage reference examples; it achieves strong F1 scores (≥63%) on three biomedical tasks and favorable manual evaluations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of simple pairwise equivalence mappings in ontology alignment and enable expressive, provenance-rich mappings across multiple ontologies.

Method: Develops CMOMgen, an end-to-end CMOM strategy that uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation to select relevant classes and filter reference mappings as in-context learning prompts; no restriction on the number of target ontologies or entities; evaluate on three biomedical tasks with partial references; perform baselines and ablations; manual evaluation of non-reference mappings.

Result: CMOMgen outperforms baselines in class selection; achieves at least 63% F1 in all tasks, beats baselines and ablated versions in two tasks and ranks second in the third; manual evaluation of non-reference mappings shows 46% achieve maximum score.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that end-to-end CMOM with retrieval-augmented generation can produce high-quality, semantically sound mappings across arbitrary ontologies, improving integration and provenance; suggests further work to enhance recall and handle more complex target structures.

Abstract: Constructing comprehensive knowledge graphs requires the use of multiple
ontologies in order to fully contextualize data into a domain. Ontology
matching finds equivalences between concepts interconnecting ontologies and
creating a cohesive semantic layer. While the simple pairwise state of the art
is well established, simple equivalence mappings cannot provide full semantic
integration of related but disjoint ontologies. Complex multi-ontology matching
(CMOM) aligns one source entity to composite logical expressions of multiple
target entities, establishing more nuanced equivalences and provenance along
the ontological hierarchy.
  We present CMOMgen, the first end-to-end CMOM strategy that generates
complete and semantically sound mappings, without establishing any restrictions
on the number of target ontologies or entities. Retrieval-Augmented Generation
selects relevant classes to compose the mapping and filters matching reference
mappings to serve as examples, enhancing In-Context Learning. The strategy was
evaluated in three biomedical tasks with partial reference alignments. CMOMgen
outperforms baselines in class selection, demonstrating the impact of having a
dedicated strategy. Our strategy also achieves a minimum of 63% in F1-score,
outperforming all baselines and ablated versions in two out of three tasks and
placing second in the third. Furthermore, a manual evaluation of non-reference
mappings showed that 46% of the mappings achieve the maximum score, further
substantiating its ability to construct semantically sound mappings.

*Gaku Morio,Harri Rowlands,Dominik Stammbach,Christopher D. Manning,Peter Henderson*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Introduces a benchmark dataset of expert-annotated video ads for framing analysis across 50+ entities in 20 countries, designed to evaluate vision-language models on framing detection; baseline results show GPT-4.1 achieves 79% F1 on environmental messages while the best multimodal model achieves 46% F1 for framing around green innovation; identifies challenges for VLMs such as implicit framing, varying video lengths, and cross-cultural context.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable scalable, multimodal analysis of strategic communication and greenwashing in energy-sector advertising, and to provide a standardized benchmark for vision-language models.

Method: Curates and annotates video ads from Facebook and YouTube with 13 framing types across 50+ companies/advocacy groups in 20 countries; designed to evaluate VLMs rather than text-only framing datasets; includes expert annotations and baseline experiments.

Result: Baseline results indicate limited yet promising performance: GPT-4.1 ~79% F1 on environmental messages; best model ~46% F1 on green-innovation framing; demonstrates substantial room for improvement; highlights implicit framing and cultural differences as major challenges.

Conclusion: The dataset advances multimodal framing analysis in the energy sector, enabling systematic study of PR framing at scale and providing a testbed for improving VLMs, while also pointing to areas needing methodological and linguistic improvements.

Abstract: Companies spend large amounts of money on public relations campaigns to
project a positive brand image. However, sometimes there is a mismatch between
what they say and what they do. Oil & gas companies, for example, are accused
of "greenwashing" with imagery of climate-friendly initiatives. Understanding
the framing, and changes in framing, at scale can help better understand the
goals and nature of public relations campaigns. To address this, we introduce a
benchmark dataset of expert-annotated video ads obtained from Facebook and
YouTube. The dataset provides annotations for 13 framing types for more than 50
companies or advocacy groups across 20 countries. Our dataset is especially
designed for the evaluation of vision-language models (VLMs), distinguishing it
from past text-only framing datasets. Baseline experiments show some promising
results, while leaving room for improvement for future work: GPT-4.1 can detect
environmental messages with 79% F1 score, while our best model only achieves
46% F1 score on identifying framing around green innovation. We also identify
challenges that VLMs must address, such as implicit framing, handling videos of
various lengths, or implicit cultural backgrounds. Our dataset contributes to
research in multimodal analysis of strategic communication in the energy
sector.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A knowledge-graph–based translation layer coordinates multi-agent autonomy by translating high-level missions into per-agent worldviews and physics-aware rules, enabling adaptive, explainable planning and coordinated behavior; demonstrated end-to-end with Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) in the Gulf of Mexico and policy-driven performance differences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bridge the semantic gap between high-level mission objectives and low-level planner inputs, enabling mission-aware coordination, explainability, and adaptability in dynamic, multi-agent environments.

Method: Proposes a two-plane Knowledge Graph architecture that compiles declarative mission facts into per-agent worldviews and physics-aware traversal rules, decoupling mission semantics from a domain-agnostic planner; implements end-to-end pipeline and tests with AUVs, comparing effects of different declarative policies.

Result: Different declarative policies yield distinct, high-performing outcomes; end-to-end pipeline demonstrated and quantified; KG acts as a stateful orchestrator rather than a simple data store.

Conclusion: The KG framework functions as an intelligent, adaptive, and explainable orchestrator for autonomous systems, enabling mission changes by updating declarative facts and producing coordinated paths without reworking the planner.

Abstract: The coordination of autonomous agents in dynamic environments is hampered by
the semantic gap between high-level mission objectives and low-level planner
inputs. To address this, we introduce a framework centered on a Knowledge Graph
(KG) that functions as an intelligent translation layer. The KG's two-plane
architecture compiles declarative facts into per-agent, mission-aware
``worldviews" and physics-aware traversal rules, decoupling mission semantics
from a domain-agnostic planner. This allows complex, coordinated paths to be
modified simply by changing facts in the KG. A case study involving Autonomous
Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) in the Gulf of Mexico visually demonstrates the
end-to-end process and quantitatively proves that different declarative
policies produce distinct, high-performing outcomes. This work establishes the
KG not merely as a data repository, but as a powerful, stateful orchestrator
for creating adaptive and explainable autonomous systems.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: ROPES is an unsupervised score-based CRL method for robotic pose estimation that disentangles controllable latent factors from images using interventional CRL (actuator-induced distribution changes) without labels, demonstrating high-fidelity factor recovery in semi-synthetic manipulator experiments and positioning CRL as practically viable in robotics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bridging the theory-practice gap in causal representation learning, especially in robotics, by enabling unsupervised recovery of pose (position and orientation) from images through the identification of actuation-controllable latent factors.

Method: A score-based CRL framework that leverages interventional CRL theory to identify latent factors that are actuated, using distributional changes induced by actuator commands; evaluated on semi-synthetic manipulator data and compared to a semi-supervised baseline.

Result: Disentangles latent generative factors with high fidelity to ground truth without using labeled data; achieves favorable comparisons against a semi-supervised baseline in semi-synthetic robotic experiments.

Conclusion: Robot pose estimation serves as a near-practical testbed for CRL, and ROPES demonstrates the feasibility and promise of interventional CRL in robotics, encouraging further unsupervised, controllable representation learning in real-world settings.

Abstract: Causal representation learning (CRL) has emerged as a powerful unsupervised
framework that (i) disentangles the latent generative factors underlying
high-dimensional data, and (ii) learns the cause-and-effect interactions among
the disentangled variables. Despite extensive recent advances in
identifiability and some practical progress, a substantial gap remains between
theory and real-world practice. This paper takes a step toward closing that gap
by bringing CRL to robotics, a domain that has motivated CRL. Specifically,
this paper addresses the well-defined robot pose estimation -- the recovery of
position and orientation from raw images -- by introducing Robotic Pose
Estimation via Score-Based CRL (ROPES). Being an unsupervised framework, ROPES
embodies the essence of interventional CRL by identifying those generative
factors that are actuated: images are generated by intrinsic and extrinsic
latent factors (e.g., joint angles, arm/limb geometry, lighting, background,
and camera configuration) and the objective is to disentangle and recover the
controllable latent variables, i.e., those that can be directly manipulated
(intervened upon) through actuation. Interventional CRL theory shows that
variables that undergo variations via interventions can be identified. In
robotics, such interventions arise naturally by commanding actuators of various
joints and recording images under varied controls. Empirical evaluations in
semi-synthetic manipulator experiments demonstrate that ROPES successfully
disentangles latent generative factors with high fidelity with respect to the
ground truth. Crucially, this is achieved by leveraging only distributional
changes, without using any labeled data. The paper also includes a comparison
with a baseline based on a recently proposed semi-supervised framework. This
paper concludes by positioning robot pose estimation as a near-practical
testbed for CRL.

Motivation: To enable repeatable, high-precision, long-horizon robotic suturing by providing a benchmark, dataset, and evaluation framework to drive autonomous performance.

Method: Introduce SutureBot benchmark on dVRK; release a 1,890-demo suturing dataset; propose a goal-conditioned framework optimizing insertion-point precision (59–74% improvement over a task-only baseline); evaluate VLA models augmented with a high-level task-prediction policy.

Conclusion: Advances autonomous suturing by offering a reproducible benchmark, a precision-focused learning framework, and cross-model evaluation to spur development of end-to-end dexterous suturing policies.

Abstract: Robotic suturing is a prototypical long-horizon dexterous manipulation task,
requiring coordinated needle grasping, precise tissue penetration, and secure
knot tying. Despite numerous efforts toward end-to-end autonomy, a fully
autonomous suturing pipeline has yet to be demonstrated on physical hardware.
We introduce SutureBot: an autonomous suturing benchmark on the da Vinci
Research Kit (dVRK), spanning needle pickup, tissue insertion, and knot tying.
To ensure repeatability, we release a high-fidelity dataset comprising 1,890
suturing demonstrations. Furthermore, we propose a goal-conditioned framework
that explicitly optimizes insertion-point precision, improving targeting
accuracy by 59\%-74\% over a task-only baseline. To establish this task as a
benchmark for dexterous imitation learning, we evaluate state-of-the-art
vision-language-action (VLA) models, including $\pi_0$, GR00T N1, OpenVLA-OFT,
and multitask ACT, each augmented with a high-level task-prediction policy.
Autonomous suturing is a key milestone toward achieving robotic autonomy in

TL;DR: Introduces PPC, a canonicalization framework for point-cloud RL that maps observations under any rigid transform to a single canonical pose, reducing viewpoint variations and improving robustness to unseen camera poses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reinforcement learning from raw visuals is fragile to distribution shifts; point-cloud RL mitigates appearance brittleness but remains sensitive to camera pose mismatches in realistic settings; a pose-consistent representation could improve reliability for downstream robotic control.

Method: PPC maps point clouds under arbitrary rigid-body transformations to a unique canonical pose, aligning observations to a consistent frame and reducing viewpoint-induced inconsistencies; designed specifically for downstream robotic control tasks.

Result: Experiments show PPC improves robustness to unseen camera poses across challenging robotic tasks and offers a principled alternative to domain randomization.

Conclusion: Canonicalization via PPC provides a principled approach to reduce viewpoint-induced variability in PC-RL, enhancing robustness for real-world robotic control.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) from raw visual input has achieved impressive
successes in recent years, yet it remains fragile to out-of-distribution
variations such as changes in lighting, color, and viewpoint. Point Cloud
Reinforcement Learning (PC-RL) offers a promising alternative by mitigating
appearance-based brittleness, but its sensitivity to camera pose mismatches
continues to undermine reliability in realistic settings. To address this
challenge, we propose PCA Point Cloud (PPC), a canonicalization framework
specifically tailored for downstream robotic control. PPC maps point clouds
under arbitrary rigid-body transformations to a unique canonical pose, aligning
observations to a consistent frame, thereby substantially decreasing
viewpoint-induced inconsistencies. In our experiments, we show that PPC
improves robustness to unseen camera poses across challenging robotic tasks,
providing a principled alternative to domain randomization.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A four-module pipeline turning human demonstration videos into robot end-effector trajectories and optimized robot motions for mobile manipulation in new environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable robots to learn manipulation tasks by observing humans, reducing manual programming and enabling adaptation to object placements.

Method: 1) Data collection via AR headset from robot's perspective; 2) Video understanding to detect objects and extract 3D hand trajectories; 3) Transfer hand trajectory into a reference trajectory of the robot end-effector in 3D space; 4) Trajectory optimization in the robot configuration space to follow the transferred trajectory.

Result: Experiments on a mobile manipulator show the approach can replicate demonstrated tasks despite changes in object placement and environment.

Conclusion: End-to-end system for video-based transfer from human demos to robot actions; success hinges on robust perception modules (object detection and hand/pose estimation); demonstrates potential for generalizable mobile manipulation from videos.

Abstract: We introduce a novel system for human-to-robot trajectory transfer that
enables robots to manipulate objects by learning from human demonstration
videos. The system consists of four modules. The first module is a data
collection module that is designed to collect human demonstration videos from
the point of view of a robot using an AR headset. The second module is a video
understanding module that detects objects and extracts 3D human-hand
trajectories from demonstration videos. The third module transfers a human-hand
trajectory into a reference trajectory of a robot end-effector in 3D space. The
last module utilizes a trajectory optimization algorithm to solve a trajectory
in the robot configuration space that can follow the end-effector trajectory
transferred from the human demonstration. Consequently, these modules enable a
robot to watch a human demonstration video once and then repeat the same mobile
manipulation task in different environments, even when objects are placed
differently from the demonstrations. Experiments of different manipulation
tasks are conducted on a mobile manipulator to verify the effectiveness of our
system

*Zlatan Ajanović,Ravi Prakash,Leandro de Souza Rosa,Jens Kober*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Comparative study of monolithic vs sequential demonstrations for long-horizon robotic tasks; introduces (ST)^2 sequential framework enabling stepwise teaching; finds similar trajectory quality and success rates, with user preferences split between methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in learning from demonstration for long-horizon tasks, such as error accumulation, distributional shift, and human fatigue, by exploring whether a sequential, point-defined teaching flow can improve training effectiveness and user experience.

Method: Compare a traditional monolithic demonstration approach with a sequential (ST)^2 framework where users segment the task by defining key points and provide incremental demonstrations. A user study (n=16) on a restocking task in a realistic retail environment evaluates trajectory quality, success rate, and user preferences.

Result: Both methods achieve similar trajectory quality and success rates. Some participants preferred the sequential approach for iterative control, while others favored the monolithic approach for its simplicity.

Conclusion: Both teaching paradigms are viable for long-horizon manipulation tasks. The sequential (ST)^2 framework offers incremental, structured demonstrations and user-controlled flow, but the choice between methods may depend on user preference and task characteristics.

Abstract: Learning from demonstration is effective for teaching robots complex skills
with high sample efficiency. However, teaching long-horizon tasks with multiple
skills is difficult, as deviations accumulate, distributional shift increases,
and human teachers become fatigued, raising the chance of failure. In this
work, we study user responses to two teaching frameworks: (i) a traditional
monolithic approach, where users demonstrate the entire trajectory of a
long-horizon task; and (ii) a sequential approach, where the task is segmented
by the user and demonstrations are provided step by step. To support this
study, we introduce $(ST)^2$, a sequential method for learning long-horizon
manipulation tasks that allows users to control the teaching flow by defining
key points, enabling incremental and structured demonstrations. We conducted a
user study on a restocking task with 16 participants in a realistic retail
environment to evaluate both user preference and method effectiveness. Our
objective and subjective results show that both methods achieve similar
trajectory quality and success rates. Some participants preferred the
sequential approach for its iterative control, while others favored the
monolithic approach for its simplicity.

### [115] [Revisiting Replanning from Scratch: Real-Time Incremental Planning with Fast Almost-Surely Asymptotically Optimal Planners](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21074)
*Mitchell E. C. Sabbadini,Andrew H. Liu,Joseph Ruan,Tyler S. Wilson,Zachary Kingston,Jonathan D. Gammell*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: ASAO-based independent replanning can handle dynamic obstacles without reusing plans, yielding fast initial solutions and convergence to optimality; validated by EIT* simulations and AORRTC on a robot arm.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce the computational burden and detection effort of updating dense planning graphs for reactive replanning in changing environments, while preserving high-quality, robust paths.

Method: Treat incremental replanning as a series of independent ASAO planning problems. Use Effort Informed Trees (EIT*) to quickly obtain initial, near-optimal paths and converge toward optimality; validate with Asymptotically Optimal RRT-Connect (AORRTC) on a real robot-arm planning problem.

Result: In simulations, EIT* produced shorter median path lengths than tested reactive planners; AORRTC demonstrated feasibility on a real-world robot-arm task.

Conclusion: ASAO-based replanning can achieve efficient, high-quality navigation under changing obstacles without explicit plan reuse, offering a practical alternative to plan-update strategies.

Abstract: Robots operating in changing environments either predict obstacle changes
and/or plan quickly enough to react to them. Predictive approaches require a
strong prior about the position and motion of obstacles. Reactive approaches
require no assumptions about their environment but must replan quickly and find
high-quality paths to navigate effectively.
  Reactive approaches often reuse information between queries to reduce
planning cost. These techniques are conceptually sound but updating dense
planning graphs when information changes can be computationally prohibitive. It
can also require significant effort to detect the changes in some applications.
  This paper revisits the long-held assumption that reactive replanning
requires updating existing plans. It shows that the incremental planning
problem can alternatively be solved more efficiently as a series of independent
problems using fast almost-surely asymptotically optimal (ASAO) planning
algorithms. These ASAO algorithms quickly find an initial solution and converge
towards an optimal solution which allows them to find consistent global plans
in the presence of changing obstacles without requiring explicit plan reuse.
This is demonstrated with simulated experiments where Effort Informed Trees
(EIT*) finds shorter median solution paths than the tested reactive planning
algorithms and is further validated using Asymptotically Optimal RRT-Connect
(AORRTC) on a real-world planning problem on a robot arm.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A hierarchical, object-centric skill learning framework (GSL) that leverages foundation models to canonicalize skills in the object frame, enabling strong generalization and sample efficiency with few demonstrations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve policy generalization and data efficiency in robot manipulation by creating a modular interface between high-level vision-language models and low-level policies through transferable, object-centered skill primitives.

Method: Decompose demonstrations into transferable, object-canonicalized skill primitives using foundation models; operate in the object frame; a high-level agent predicts skill–object pairs; a low-level module maps canonical actions back to the world frame for execution; evaluate generalization to unseen arrangements and appearances with minimal demonstrations.

Result: In simulation, 3 demonstrations per task outperform baselines trained with 30x data by 15.5% on unseen tasks. Real-world experiments show the method surpassing a baseline trained with 10x more data.

Conclusion: GSL’s object-centric hierarchical architecture significantly enhances sample efficiency and generalization across unseen spatial arrangements, object appearances, and task compositions by effectively bridging high-level planning and low-level control.

Abstract: We present Generalizable Hierarchical Skill Learning (GSL), a novel framework
for hierarchical policy learning that significantly improves policy
generalization and sample efficiency in robot manipulation. One core idea of
GSL is to use object-centric skills as an interface that bridges the high-level
vision-language model and the low-level visual-motor policy. Specifically, GSL
decomposes demonstrations into transferable and object-canonicalized skill
primitives using foundation models, ensuring efficient low-level skill learning
in the object frame. At test time, the skill-object pairs predicted by the
high-level agent are fed to the low-level module, where the inferred canonical
actions are mapped back to the world frame for execution. This structured yet
flexible design leads to substantial improvements in sample efficiency and
generalization of our method across unseen spatial arrangements, object
appearances, and task compositions. In simulation, GSL trained with only 3
demonstrations per task outperforms baselines trained with 30 times more data
by 15.5 percent on unseen tasks. In real-world experiments, GSL also surpasses
the baseline trained with 10 times more data.

TL;DR: Dynamic hypersphere clamp enables adaptive velocity bounds for modular robot self-assembly under disturbances; step-based variant offers predictability, continuous version accelerates convergence with mm-level accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need safe, robust controllers for autonomous self-assembly of modular robots in harsh lunar environments, with real-time disturbances and sensing noise.

Method: Robot-agnostic controller that adjusts translational/rotational speed limits via a hypersphere clamp using real-time end-effector and target pose data; implemented in two variants (discrete step-based and continuous velocity-based); tested on two MoonBot limbs in JAXA's lunar environment simulator.

Result: Step-based variant yields highly predictable, low-wobble motions; continuous variant converges faster and achieves millimeter-level positional accuracy; both robust across limbs with mechanical imperfections and sensing noise.

Conclusion: Demonstrates flexibility and robustness of the robot-agnostic framework for autonomous self-assembly and reconfiguration under harsh conditions.

Abstract: Modular robots offer reconfigurability and fault tolerance essential for
lunar missions, but require controllers that adapt safely to real-world
disturbances. We build on our previous hardware-agnostic actuator
synchronization in Motion Stack to develop a new controller enforcing adaptive
velocity bounds via a dynamic hypersphere clamp. Using only real-time
end-effector and target pose measurements, the controller adjusts its
translational and rotational speed limits to ensure smooth, stable alignment
without abrupt motions. We implemented two variants, a discrete, step-based
version and a continuous, velocity-based version, and tested them on two
MoonBot limbs in JAXA's lunar environment simulator. Field trials demonstrate
that the step-based variant produces highly predictable, low-wobble motions,
while the continuous variant converges more quickly and maintains
millimeter-level positional accuracy, and both remain robust across limbs with
differing mechanical imperfections and sensing noise (e.g., backlash and flex).
These results highlight the flexibility and robustness of our robot-agnostic
framework for autonomous self-assembly and reconfiguration under harsh
conditions.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A four-modality underwater SLAM system that fuses stereo visual data, IMU, DVL, and pressure into a graph-based visual-inertial-acoustic-depth framework, featuring velocity-bias DVL preintegration and hybrid frontend optimization to achieve robust localization under degraded visibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Underwater environments suffer from poor visibility, low lighting, and sparse features, which challenge traditional visual-inertial SLAM. Integrating complementary sensing (acoustic, depth/pressure) can provide robust pose estimation and mapping where visuals fail.

Method: A graph-based SLAM pipeline that tightly fuses stereo camera data, IMU, DVL velocity estimates, and pressure readings. It introduces a novel velocity-bias-based DVL preintegration to reduce drift, employs hybrid tracking at the frontend, and uses acoustic-inertial-depth joint optimization with multi-source hybrid residuals in the graph optimization framework.

Result: Extensive experiments in simulation and real underwater scenarios show that the proposed system outperforms state-of-the-art stereo visual-inertial SLAM in stability and localization accuracy, with exceptional robustness in visually challenging conditions.

Conclusion: Tight integration of four sensor modalities and the proposed DVL preintegration strategy yield a robust underwater SLAM system capable of maintaining accurate localization when visual cues are scarce or degraded.

Abstract: Visual degradation caused by limited visibility, insufficient lighting, and
feature scarcity in underwater environments presents significant challenges to
visual-inertial simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) systems. To
address these challenges, this paper proposes a graph-based
visual-inertial-acoustic-depth SLAM system that integrates a stereo camera, an
inertial measurement unit (IMU), the Doppler velocity log (DVL), and a pressure
sensor. The key innovation lies in the tight integration of four distinct
sensor modalities to ensure reliable operation, even under degraded visual
conditions. To mitigate DVL drift and improve measurement efficiency, we
propose a novel velocity-bias-based DVL preintegration strategy. At the
frontend, hybrid tracking strategies and acoustic-inertial-depth joint
optimization enhance system stability. Additionally, multi-source hybrid
residuals are incorporated into a graph optimization framework. Extensive
quantitative and qualitative analyses of the proposed system are conducted in
both simulated and real-world underwater scenarios. The results demonstrate
that our approach outperforms current state-of-the-art stereo visual-inertial
SLAM systems in both stability and localization accuracy, exhibiting
exceptional robustness, particularly in visually challenging environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reduce operator workload and enable autonomous operation in GNSS-denied or urban environments, while lowering hardware and software barriers by using consumer-grade drones.

Method: An Android app runs on the UAVs' remote controller to perform state estimation and obstacle avoidance; a ground control station coordinates multiple heterogeneous UAVs and merges their observations into a joint 3D environment model.

Result: Demonstrates feasibility of autonomous flight with lightweight consumer hardware and a centralized multi-UAV management system; improved situational awareness through a unified 3D map.

Conclusion: Autonomous operation of consumer UAVs is feasible with app-based onboard processing and a centralized ground station, enabling scalable multi-UAV missions and enhanced situational awareness.

Abstract: In recent years, consumer-grade UAVs have been widely adopted by first
responders. In general, they are operated manually, which requires trained
pilots, especially in unknown GNSS-denied environments and in the vicinity of
structures. Autonomous flight can facilitate the application of UAVs and reduce
operator strain. However, autonomous systems usually require special
programming interfaces, custom sensor setups, and strong onboard computers,
which limits a broader deployment.
  We present a system for autonomous flight using lightweight consumer-grade
DJI drones. They are controlled by an Android app for state estimation and
obstacle avoidance directly running on the UAV's remote control. Our ground
control station enables a single operator to configure and supervise multiple
heterogeneous UAVs at once. Furthermore, it combines the observations of all
UAVs into a joint 3D environment model for improved situational awareness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address safety and instability of collapsing terrains in search-and-rescue and planetary exploration. The approach seeks to realize terrain awareness and safe navigation without relying on external terrain mapping or specialized hardware by leveraging existing joint measurements.

Method: Integrates terrain probing with joint measurements and load-bearing analysis to assess terrain stability; uses Model Predictive Control (MPC) to optimize motion while respecting probing constraints; a state machine coordinates terrain probing actions and dynamic foothold adjustments; demonstrated on custom collapsing platforms and rocky terrains.

Result: The framework traverses collapsing terrain while maintaining stability and prioritizing safety, validated by experiments on custom platforms and rocky surfaces indicating robustness to instability.

Conclusion: An integrated, sensor-frugal approach that combines probing, load analysis, planning, and control to enable safe quadruped locomotion on unstable substrates, with applicability to SAR and planetary exploration scenarios.

Abstract: Collapsing terrains, often present in search and rescue missions or planetary
exploration, pose significant challenges for quadruped robots. This paper
introduces a robust locomotion framework for safe navigation over unstable
surfaces by integrating terrain probing, load-bearing analysis, motion
planning, and control strategies. Unlike traditional methods that rely on
specialized sensors or external terrain mapping alone, our approach leverages
joint measurements to assess terrain stability without hardware modifications.
A Model Predictive Control (MPC) system optimizes robot motion, balancing
stability and probing constraints, while a state machine coordinates terrain
probing actions, enabling the robot to detect collapsible regions and
dynamically adjust its footholds. Experimental results on custom-made
collapsing platforms and rocky terrains demonstrate the framework's ability to
traverse collapsing terrain while maintaining stability and prioritizing
safety.

TL;DR: A multimodal BT-based PREVENT system enhances workflow awareness in mobile robotic chemistry by fusing visual sensors and an IoT gas sensor to reduce false alarms and improve decision-making, showing superior deployment accuracy in simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mobile robotic chemists face workflow-disrupting anomalies and high false-positive rates from perception; a robust, autonomous system is needed to safely and efficiently manage chemical workflows with minimal human intervention.

Method: Propose PREVENT, a system integrating navigation and manipulation skills via a multimodal Behavior Tree. It uses hierarchical perception with AI techniques and sensory feedback from Dexterous Vision, Navigational Vision cameras, and an IoT gas sensor module, enabling informed execution decisions. The approach is designed for minimal modification to existing software architectures.

Result: Experimental evaluations indicate the approach is comparatively efficient and completely avoids both false negatives and false positives in simulated risk scenarios. The multi-modal perception yields deployment accuracies higher than uni-modal counterparts for both navigation and manipulation.

Conclusion: PREVENT provides a safer, more efficient autonomous workflow for mobile robotic chemistry, with strong simulation-based evidence of reduced misdetections and better deployment accuracy, and clear potential for integration with existing systems; real-world validation remains a future step.

Abstract: Mobile robotic chemists are a fast growing trend in the field of chemistry
and materials research. However, so far these mobile robots lack workflow
awareness skills. This poses the risk that even a small anomaly, such as an
improperly capped sample vial could disrupt the entire workflow. This wastes
time, and resources, and could pose risks to human researchers, such as
exposure to toxic materials. Existing perception mechanisms can be used to
predict anomalies but they often generate excessive false positives. This may
halt workflow execution unnecessarily, requiring researchers to intervene and
to resume the workflow when no problem actually exists, negating the benefits
of autonomous operation. To address this problem, we propose PREVENT a system
comprising navigation and manipulation skills based on a multimodal Behavior
Tree (BT) approach that can be integrated into existing software architectures
with minimal modifications. Our approach involves a hierarchical perception
mechanism that exploits AI techniques and sensory feedback through Dexterous
Vision and Navigational Vision cameras and an IoT gas sensor module for
execution-related decision-making. Experimental evaluations show that the
proposed approach is comparatively efficient and completely avoids both false
negatives and false positives when tested in simulated risk scenarios within
our robotic chemistry workflow. The results also show that the proposed
multi-modal perception skills achieved deployment accuracies that were higher
than the average of the corresponding uni-modal skills, both for navigation and
for manipulation.

TL;DR: Resilience is a core property of social robots that enables trust and robust performance in adverse conditions, especially for elderly users.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As AI integrates into sensitive domains, ensuring resilience and trust in social robots is crucial for safe, acceptable operation, particularly with elderly populations who often distrust AI systems.

Method: The paper offers a theoretical analysis framing resilience as a fundamental characteristic of social robots and discusses its role in trust, with a focus on elderly contexts.

Result: Resilience is defined as the ability to operate under adverse or stressful conditions, even when degraded, while maintaining essential capabilities; this trait supports and sustains trust in social robots.

Conclusion: Building resilience into social robots is essential to maintain trust and reliable operation in real-world, high-stakes settings, such as elder care.

Abstract: As artificial intelligence continues to advance and becomes more integrated
into sensitive areas like healthcare, education, and everyday life, it's
crucial for these systems to be both resilient and robust. This paper shows how
resilience is a fundamental characteristic of social robots, which, through it,
ensure trust in the robot itself-an essential element especially when operating
in contexts with elderly people, who often have low trust in these systems.
Resilience is therefore the ability to operate under adverse or stressful
conditions, even when degraded or weakened, while maintaining essential
operational capabilities.

TL;DR: AURASeg introduces Attention-Guided Upsampling with Residual Boundary-Assistive Refinement for ground-plane segmentation, achieving better border precision and real-time performance, outperforming baselines by +1.26% mIoU and +1.65% F1 on GMRP and Gazebo indoor datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

The architecture emphasizes border refinement while preserving speed.

Result: The model outperforms benchmark segmentation architectures in mIoU and F1 on the Ground Mobile Robot Perception (GMRP) dataset and a custom Gazebo indoor dataset, with an mIoU improvement of 1.26% and segmentation precision improvement of 1.65%, indicating improved border accuracy with minimal impact on inference speed.

Conclusion: The approach demonstrates feasibility for autonomous perception in both indoor and outdoor environments, delivering refined borders and maintaining real-time performance.

Abstract: Free space ground segmentation is essential to navigate robots and autonomous
vehicles, recognize drivable zones, and traverse efficiently. Fine-grained
features remain challenging for existing segmentation models, particularly for
robots in indoor and structured environments. These difficulties arise from
ineffective multi-scale processing, suboptimal boundary refinement, and limited
feature representation. In order to overcome these limitations, we propose
Attention-Guided Upsampling with Residual Boundary-Assistive Refinement
(AURASeg), a ground-plane semantic segmentation model that maintains high
segmentation accuracy while improving border precision. Our method uses
CSP-Darknet backbone by adding a Residual Border Refinement Module (RBRM) for
accurate edge delineation and an Attention Progressive Upsampling Decoder
(APUD) for strong feature integration. We also incorporate a lightweight Atrous
Spatial Pyramid Pooling (ASPP-Lite) module to ensure multi-scale context
extraction without compromising real-time performance. The proposed model beats
benchmark segmentation architectures in mIoU and F1 metrics when tested on the
Ground Mobile Robot Perception (GMRP) Dataset and a custom Gazebo indoor
dataset. Our approach achieves an improvement in mean Intersection-over-Union
(mIoU) of +1.26% and segmentation precision of +1.65% compared to
state-of-the-art models. These results show that our technique is feasible for
autonomous perception in both indoor and outdoor environments, enabling precise
border refinement with minimal effect on inference speed.

*Qixiu Li,Yu Deng,Yaobo Liang,Lin Luo,Lei Zhou,Chengtang Yao,Lingqi Zeng,Zhiyuan Feng,Huizhi Liang,Sicheng Xu,Yizhong Zhang,Xi Chen,Hao Chen,Lily Sun,Dong Chen,Jiaolong Yang,Baining Guo*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A scalable pretraining approach for Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models that leverages unscripted egocentric hand videos to create robotic-aligned data, enabling zero-shot generalization and data-efficient fine-tuning for dexterous manipulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current robotic VLA data are scarce and costly to annotate. By exploiting abundant unlabelled real-life hand videos and treating the human hand as a dexterous end-effector, the work aims to scale pretraining so models can generalize across objects, tasks, and environments.

Method: Develop a fully automated holistic hand activity analysis pipeline that segments egocentric hand videos into atomic actions with language descriptions and provides framewise 3D hand and camera motion. Build a large dataset (1M episodes, 26M frames) of hand-VLA data, design a dexterous hand VLA model architecture, and pretrain on this dataset. Evaluate zero-shot performance on unseen real-world observations and fine-tune on limited real robot data to assess data efficiency and generalization. Analyze scaling behavior with respect to pretraining data size.

Result: The pretrained model shows strong zero-shot capabilities on unseen real-world observations. Fine-tuning on a small amount of real robot action data improves task success and generalization to novel objects. The study also demonstrates favorable scaling: more pretraining data leads to better task performance.

Conclusion: This work establishes a scalable foundation for Vision-Language-Action pretraining using in-the-wild egocentric data, advancing robots toward truly generalizable embodied intelligence and enabling efficient transfer to real robotic tasks.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach for pretraining robotic manipulation
Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models using a large corpus of unscripted
real-life video recordings of human hand activities. Treating human hand as
dexterous robot end-effector, we show that "in-the-wild" egocentric human
videos without any annotations can be transformed into data formats fully
aligned with existing robotic V-L-A training data in terms of task granularity
and labels. This is achieved by the development of a fully-automated holistic
human activity analysis approach for arbitrary human hand videos. This approach
can generate atomic-level hand activity segments and their language
descriptions, each accompanied with framewise 3D hand motion and camera motion.
We process a large volume of egocentric videos and create a hand-VLA training
dataset containing 1M episodes and 26M frames. This training data covers a wide
range of objects and concepts, dexterous manipulation tasks, and environment
variations in real life, vastly exceeding the coverage of existing robot data.
We design a dexterous hand VLA model architecture and pretrain the model on
this dataset. The model exhibits strong zero-shot capabilities on completely
unseen real-world observations. Additionally, fine-tuning it on a small amount
of real robot action data significantly improves task success rates and
generalization to novel objects in real robotic experiments. We also
demonstrate the appealing scaling behavior of the model's task performance with
respect to pretraining data scale. We believe this work lays a solid foundation
for scalable VLA pretraining, advancing robots toward truly generalizable
embodied intelligence.

*Elle Miller,Trevor McInroe,David Abel,Oisin Mac Aodha,Sethu Vijayakumar*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: SSL methods effectively use sparse binary tactile signals to improve dexterity in real-world RL; decoupling SSL memory from on-policy memory can boost performance; RoTO benchmark released to standardize tactile-rich manipulation research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world robotic manipulation suffers from sensory deficits and reliance on idealized state information. Tactile sensing promises robust manipulation, but its RL efficacy is inconsistent. The paper aims to harness tactile data through self-supervised learning in a scalable proprioception-plus-sparse-binary-contact setting.

Method: Develops self-supervised learning approaches to leverage tactile observations in a scalable setup with proprioception and sparse binary contact signals. Demonstrates that sparse tactile signals are crucial for dexterity, especially in decoupled robot-object motions. Evaluates on tasks like ball bouncing and Baoding ball rotation. Explores decoupling SSL memory from on-policy memory to improve performance. Introduces the Robot Tactile Olympiad (RoTO) benchmark.

Result: Sparse binary tactile signals significantly boost dexterity, enabling superhuman performance on complex contact tasks. Decoupling the SSL memory from on-policy memory further improves performance. The RoTO benchmark is released to standardize tactile-based manipulation research.

Conclusion: Tactile information is highly beneficial for manipulation when properly leveraged via SSL, and sparse binary signals are particularly impactful. Decoupling SSL memory from on-policy memory can be a simple yet effective improvement. The RoTO benchmark provides a platform to accelerate future research in tactile RL.

Abstract: Achieving safe, reliable real-world robotic manipulation requires agents to
evolve beyond vision and incorporate tactile sensing to overcome sensory
deficits and reliance on idealised state information. Despite its potential,
the efficacy of tactile sensing in reinforcement learning (RL) remains
inconsistent. We address this by developing self-supervised learning (SSL)
methodologies to more effectively harness tactile observations, focusing on a
scalable setup of proprioception and sparse binary contacts. We empirically
demonstrate that sparse binary tactile signals are critical for dexterity,
particularly for interactions that proprioceptive control errors do not
register, such as decoupled robot-object motions. Our agents achieve superhuman
dexterity in complex contact tasks (ball bouncing and Baoding ball rotation).
Furthermore, we find that decoupling the SSL memory from the on-policy memory
can improve performance. We release the Robot Tactile Olympiad (RoTO) benchmark
to standardise and promote future research in tactile-based manipulation.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Low-cost, modular micro aerial vehicle (MAV) under 2 kg with reinforced frame and open-source onboard control, enabling real-time perception and dynamic path replanning for search-and-rescue without expensive hardware accelerators.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address two common limitations of small, low-cost MAVs: (1) inadequate structural durability for rough-terrain flight, and (2) inability to replan paths dynamically when new victims or obstacles are detected, hindering effective SAR operations.

Method: Design and build a fully customized drone from commonly available components and materials, emphasizing modularity and low cost. Reinforce the lightweight frame for impact resistance, and implement onboard control using free, open-source software. Achieve real-time perception and adaptive navigation without relying on hardware accelerators, highlighting an affordable, easily assembled SAR solution.

Conclusion: Presents a practical, affordable, and modular drone design that balances durability and dynamic reactivity for search-and-rescue tasks, leveraging open-source software to reduce cost and complexity.

Abstract: Micro aerial vehicles are becoming increasingly important in search and
rescue operations due to their agility, speed, and ability to access confined
spaces or hazardous areas. However, designing lightweight aerial systems
presents significant structural, aerodynamic, and computational challenges.
This work addresses two key limitations in many low-cost aerial systems under
two kilograms: their lack of structural durability during flight through rough
terrains and inability to replan paths dynamically when new victims or
obstacles are detected. We present a fully customised drone built from scratch
using only commonly available components and materials, emphasising modularity,
low cost, and ease of assembly. The structural frame is reinforced with
lightweight yet durable materials to withstand impact, while the onboard
control system is powered entirely by free, open-source software solutions. The
proposed system demonstrates real-time perception and adaptive navigation
capabilities without relying on expensive hardware accelerators, offering an
affordable and practical solution for real-world search and rescue missions.

### [127] [Near-Optimal Min-Sum Motion Planning in a Planar Polygonal Environment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21639)
*Pankaj K. Agarwal,Benjamin Holmgren,Alex Steiger*

Main category: cs.CG

TL;DR: Presents a polynomial-time bicriteria approximation for min-sum motion planning of a constant number of unit-radius square robots in polygonal environments; achieves (1+ε)-approximation on total path length with an inflated radius 1+ε (or +ε additive) and time f(k,ε)n^{O(k)}; first such result for constant k>2, extendable to congruent disks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle the PSPACE-hardness of multi-robot motion planning by providing tractable algorithms with provable guarantees for a small fixed number of robots, focusing on the min-sum objective in obstacle-rich planar environments.

Method: The authors reduce the problem to a combinatorial, fixed-parameter tractable framework by inflating robot size to 1+ε and discretizing the configuration/space, then solving a coordinated planning problem to obtain a multi-robot path set whose total length approximates the optimum. The algorithm runs in time f(k,ε)·n^{O(k)} and delivers a plan whose cost is at most (1+ε)opt(s,t,1+ε)+ε; and (1+ε)opt(s,t,1+ε) when opt≥1. The approach also handles k congruent disks.

Result: A coordinated motion plan is produced with total length within the stated bicriteria bounds; the running time is polynomial in n for fixed k and ε (specifically f(k,ε)·n^{O(k)}). For unit-square robots and for disks, the guarantees hold.

Conclusion: This work delivers the first polynomial-time bicriteria (1+ε)-approximation for constant-k multi-robot min-sum planning among obstacles, a significant step in tractable multi-agent motion planning; the method is limited to fixed small k and planar polygonal environments, with potential for refining constants and extending to broader models.

Abstract: Let $W \subset \mathbb{R}^2$ be a planar polygonal environment with $n$
vertices, and let $[k] = \{1,\ldots,k\}$ denote $k$ unit-square robots
translating in $W$. Given source and target placements $s_1, t_1, \ldots, s_k,
t_k \in W$ for each robot, we wish to compute a collision-free motion plan
$\mathbf{\pi}$, i.e., a coordinated motion for each robot $i$ along a
continuous path from $s_i$ to $t_i$ so that robot $i$ does not leave $W$ or
collide with any other $j$. Moreover, we additionally require that
$\mathbf{\pi}$ minimizes the sum of the path lengths; this variant is known as
\textit{min-sum motion planning}.
  Even computing a feasible motion plan for $k$ unit-square robots in a
polygonal environment is {\textsf PSPACE}-hard. For $r > 0$, let
$opt(\mathbf{s},\mathbf{t}, r)$ denote the cost of a min-sum motion plan for
$k$ square robots of radius $r$ each from $\mathbf{s}=(s_1,\ldots,s_k)$ to
$\mathbf{t}=(t_1,\ldots,t_k)$. Given a parameter $\epsilon > 0$, we present an
algorithm for computing a coordinated motion plan for $k$ unit radius square
robots of cost at most $(1+\epsilon)opt(\mathbf{s},\mathbf{t},
1+\epsilon)+\epsilon$, which improves to
$(1+\epsilon)opt(\mathbf{s},\mathbf{t}, 1+\epsilon)$ if
$opt(\mathbf{s},\mathbf{t}, 1+\epsilon)\geq 1$, that runs in time
$f(k,\epsilon)n^{O(k)}$, where $f(k,\epsilon) = (k/\epsilon)^{O(k^2)}$. Our
result is the first polynomial-time bicriteria $(1+\epsilon)$-approximation
algorithm for any optimal multi-robot motion planning problem amidst obstacles
for a constant value of $k > 2$. The algorithm also works even if robots are
modeled as $k$ congruent disks.

### [128] [Incentivizing Consistent, Effective and Scalable Reasoning Capability in Audio LLMs via Reasoning Process Rewards](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20867)
*Jiajun Fan,Roger Ren,Jingyuan Li,Rahul Pandey,Prashanth Gurunath Shivakumar,Ivan Bulyko,Ankur Gandhe,Ge Liu,Yile Gu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CESAR is an online RL framework for Audio LLMs that rewards the reasoning process to overcome test-time inverse scaling, achieving state-of-the-art on MMAU Test-mini and near-human performance on MMSU; it shifts from verifying outcomes to rewarding structured, causal, and domain-relevant reasoning, improving both reasoning quality and multimodal perception.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reasoning in Audio LLMs often degrades performance when extended (test-time inverse scaling) due to unguided reasoning that becomes hallucinated and inconsistent. Properly guiding the reasoning process during training could convert longer chains into better outputs.

Method: Online reinforcement learning using Group Relative Policy Optimization with a multi-faceted reward suite. Rewards incentivize correctness and formatting, but also consistency, structured analytical patterns, causal reasoning, domain-knowledge integration, and calibrated reasoning depth. Shifts focus from outcome verification to rewarding the reasoning process.

Result: CESAR achieves state-of-the-art results on MMAU Test-mini, substantially outperforming Gemini 2.5 Pro and GPT-4o Audio, and near-human-level performance on MMSU reasoning tasks. AI-as-judge evaluations and qualitative comparisons validate improved reasoning quality; reasoning enhancements also improve multimodal reasoning and perception.

Conclusion: CESAR provides a principled method for developing robust, scalable reasoning in Audio LLMs, turning reasoning into a gain rather than a liability and identifying model-specific 'reasoning sweet spots' where test-time scaling is beneficial.

Abstract: The role of reasoning in Audio Large Language Models remains widely
underexplored, as introducing a reasoning process often degrades rather than
improves performance during inference, a phenomenon we term test-time inverse
scaling, where longer reasoning chains yield progressively worse results. We
demonstrate that this stems not from fundamental limitations of reasoning
itself, but from inadequate training: models without proper guidance for the
reasoning process produce hallucinatory, inconsistent reasoning that
accumulates errors over longer chains. To address these challenges, we
introduce CESAR (Consistent, Effective, and Scalable Audio Reasoners), shifting
from outcome verification to rewarding the reasoning process. Our online
reinforcement learning framework employs Group Relative Policy Optimization
with a multi-faceted reward suite that incentivizes not only correctness and
format but also consistency, structured analytical patterns, causal reasoning,
domain-knowledge integration, and calibrated reasoning depth. CESAR resolves
test-time inverse scaling, transforming reasoning from detriments into gains
while revealing model-specific ``reasoning sweet spots", where performance
peaks during test-time scaling. We achieve state-of-the-art results on MMAU
Test-mini, substantially outperforming Gemini 2.5 Pro and GPT-4o Audio, and
near-human-level performance on MMSU reasoning tasks. Through AI-as-judge
evaluations and qualitative comparisons, we provide both quantitative and
qualitative validation of our improved reasoning quality. Importantly, enhanced
reasoning creates synergistic effects, simultaneously improving multimodal
reasoning and perception capabilities. Overall, CESAR establishes a principled
method for developing robust and scalable reasoning in Audio LLMs.

*Zan Li,Rui Fan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CRISP is a crisis-aware graph-spatio-temporal model that learns adaptive asset relations via attention-based graphs, enabling regime-specific predictions and superior risk-adjusted returns across crises.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fixed-topology graphs fail to capture regime-dependent correlations during crises; there is a need for a model that discovers which asset relationships matter under different crisis mechanisms (credit contagion, pandemics, inflation shocks).

Method: A graph-based spatio-temporal architecture: Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) for spatial relations, BiLSTM with self-attention for temporal dynamics, and multi-head Graph Attention Networks to learn sparse, regime-sensitive connections; explicitly filters ~92.5% of spurious edges; trained on 2005–2021 data including credit and pandemic crises; demonstrates generalization to 2022–2024 inflation-driven regimes.

Result: CRISP achieves accurate regime-specific forecasts and adaptive portfolio allocation with strong risk-adjusted returns: Sharpe ratio 3.76; ~707% improvement over equal-weight baselines; ~94% improvement over static graph methods; learned attention weights enable interpretable regime detection, with defensive cluster attention strengthening 49% during crises versus 31% market-wide.

Conclusion: Learning crisis-sensitive, sparse graph structures via attention yields robust, interpretable regime-aware predictions and adaptive portfolio strategies, outperforming fixed-topology approaches across diverse crisis mechanisms.

Abstract: Financial time series forecasting faces a fundamental challenge: predicting
optimal asset allocations requires understanding regime-dependent correlation
structures that transform during crisis periods. Existing graph-based
spatio-temporal learning approaches rely on predetermined graph
topologies--correlation thresholds, sector classifications--that fail to adapt
when market dynamics shift across different crisis mechanisms: credit
contagion, pandemic shocks, or inflation-driven selloffs.
  We present CRISP (Crisis-Resilient Investment through Spatio-temporal
Patterns), a graph-based spatio-temporal learning framework that encodes
spatial relationships via Graph Convolutional Networks and temporal dynamics
via BiLSTM with self-attention, then learns sparse structures through
multi-head Graph Attention Networks. Unlike fixed-topology methods, CRISP
discovers which asset relationships matter through attention mechanisms,
filtering 92.5% of connections as noise while preserving crisis-relevant
dependencies for accurate regime-specific predictions.
  Trained on 2005--2021 data encompassing credit and pandemic crises, CRISP
demonstrates robust generalization to 2022--2024 inflation-driven markets--a
fundamentally different regime--by accurately forecasting regime-appropriate
correlation structures. This enables adaptive portfolio allocation that
maintains profitability during downturns, achieving Sharpe ratio 3.76: 707%
improvement over equal-weight baselines and 94% improvement over static graph
methods. Learned attention weights provide interpretable regime detection, with
defensive cluster attention strengthening 49% during crises versus 31%
market-wide--emergent behavior from learning to forecast rather than imposing
assumptions.

### [130] [MOBO-OSD: Batch Multi-Objective Bayesian Optimization via Orthogonal Search Directions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20872)
*Lam Ngo,Huong Ha,Jeffrey Chan,Hongyu Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MOBO-OSD is a multi-objective Bayesian optimization method that generates a diverse Pareto set by solving multiple constrained subproblems along orthogonal search directions based on an approximate convex hull of objective minima. It densifies the Pareto front via Pareto Front Estimation, supports batch evaluations, and shows state-of-the-art performance on 2–6 objectives; code is available.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-objective Bayesian optimization aims to find a well-distributed set of Pareto-optimal solutions. Existing methods often struggle to balance convergence, diversity, and computational efficiency, especially as the number of objectives grows.

Method: Define orthogonal search directions (OSDs) using an approximate convex hull of the individual objective minima. Solve MOBO-OSD subproblems along these directions to obtain a diverse set of Pareto-optimal candidates. Use Pareto Front Estimation to generate additional nearby solutions to densify the Pareto set without adding many subproblems. Support batch optimization for parallel evaluations.

Result: Empirically outperforms state-of-the-art MOBO methods on synthetic and real-world benchmarks with 2–6 objectives, achieving better diversity and hypervolume metrics.

Conclusion: MOBO-OSD offers broad coverage of the objective space through orthogonal search directions, enhanced density via Pareto Front Estimation, and batch optimization capability, contributing a practical and effective approach for multi-objective BO.

Abstract: Bayesian Optimization (BO) is a powerful tool for optimizing expensive
black-box objective functions. While extensive research has been conducted on
the single-objective optimization problem, the multi-objective optimization
problem remains challenging. In this paper, we propose MOBO-OSD, a
multi-objective Bayesian Optimization algorithm designed to generate a diverse
set of Pareto optimal solutions by solving multiple constrained optimization
problems, referred to as MOBO-OSD subproblems, along orthogonal search
directions (OSDs) defined with respect to an approximated convex hull of
individual objective minima. By employing a well-distributed set of OSDs,
MOBO-OSD ensures broad coverage of the objective space, enhancing both solution
diversity and hypervolume performance. To further improve the density of the
set of Pareto optimal candidate solutions without requiring an excessive number
of subproblems, we leverage a Pareto Front Estimation technique to generate
additional solutions in the neighborhood of existing solutions. Additionally,
MOBO-OSD supports batch optimization, enabling parallel function evaluations to
accelerate the optimization process when resources are available. Through
extensive experiments and analysis on a variety of synthetic and real-world
benchmark functions with two to six objectives, we demonstrate that MOBO-OSD
consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms. Our code
implementation can be found at https://github.com/LamNgo1/mobo-osd.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Landslides are increasing due to climate change with severe environmental and human costs; current data access is rising but timely, coordinated responses remain underdeveloped.

Method: Integrates satellite observations and environmental signals into a modular multi-agent architecture (Prediction, Planning, Execution) to enable real-time monitoring, coordinated response planning, and intervention across vulnerable mountainous terrains.

Conclusion: A scalable, proactive, climate-resilient disaster preparedness solution for landslides in high mountain regions via a multi-agent system.

Abstract: Landslides are a growing climate induced hazard with severe environmental and
human consequences, particularly in high mountain Asia. Despite increasing
access to satellite and temporal datasets, timely detection and disaster
response remain underdeveloped and fragmented. This work introduces CC-GRMAS, a
framework leveraging a series of satellite observations and environmental
signals to enhance the accuracy of landslide forecasting. The system is
structured around three interlinked agents Prediction, Planning, and Execution,
which collaboratively enable real time situational awareness, response
planning, and intervention. By incorporating local environmental factors and
operationalizing multi agent coordination, this approach offers a scalable and
proactive solution for climate resilient disaster preparedness across

### [132] [Multimodal Negative Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20877)
*Baoquan Gong,Xiyuan Gao,Pengfei Zhu,Qinghua Hu,Bing Cao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces Multimodal Negative Learning (MNL): a paradigm where dominant modalities guide weak modalities to suppress non-target classes (negative learning) rather than forcing alignment, preserving modality-specific information and improving robustness under noise/imbalance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modality imbalance in multimodal learning causes dominant modalities to overshadow weaker ones and degrade learning of the latter; traditional Positive Learning (alignment) risks erasing unique information of weak modalities; a negative-learning framework could stabilize the decision space while preserving modality-specific signals.

Method: Proposes the Multimodal Negative Learning (MNL) framework with a dynamic guidance mechanism for negative learning, where dominant modalities steer weak modalities to suppress non-target classes. The approach is theoretically grounded from a robustness perspective, deriving a tighter robustness lower bound via increasing the Unimodal Confidence Margin (UCoM) and reducing weak-modality empirical error, especially under noise and imbalance.

Result: The authors claim theoretical guarantees (tighter robustness bound, higher UCoM) and empirical improvements across multiple benchmarks, demonstrating effectiveness and generalizability of MNL under challenging conditions.

Conclusion: Negative learning provides a principled, robust alternative to positive, alignment-based fusion in multimodal learning, preserving modality-specific information, stabilizing decision spaces, and achieving better performance in noisy/imbalanced settings; code will be released.

Abstract: Multimodal learning systems often encounter challenges related to modality
imbalance, where a dominant modality may overshadow others, thereby hindering
the learning of weak modalities. Conventional approaches often force weak
modalities to align with dominant ones in "Learning to be (the same)" (Positive
Learning), which risks suppressing the unique information inherent in the weak
modalities. To address this challenge, we offer a new learning paradigm:
"Learning Not to be" (Negative Learning). Instead of enhancing weak modalities'
target-class predictions, the dominant modalities dynamically guide the weak
modality to suppress non-target classes. This stabilizes the decision space and
preserves modality-specific information, allowing weak modalities to preserve
unique information without being over-aligned. We proceed to reveal multimodal
learning from a robustness perspective and theoretically derive the Multimodal
Negative Learning (MNL) framework, which introduces a dynamic guidance
mechanism tailored for negative learning. Our method provably tightens the
robustness lower bound of multimodal learning by increasing the Unimodal
Confidence Margin (UCoM) and reduces the empirical error of weak modalities,
particularly under noisy and imbalanced scenarios. Extensive experiments across
multiple benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of our
approach against competing methods. The code will be available at
https://github.com/BaoquanGong/Multimodal-Negative-Learning.git.

### [133] [HA-RAG: Hotness-Aware RAG Acceleration via Mixed Precision and Data Placement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20878)
*Danying Ge,Jianhua Gao,Yixue Yang,Weixing Ji*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HA-RAG reduces memory and latency in retrieval-augmented generation by exploiting hotness (access frequency) of KV chunks through mixed-precision compression and hot data placement, achieving up to 10.5x TTFT speedup with minimal accuracy loss compared to TurboRAG.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RAG can hallucinate and lag due to large external KBs, and long-context processing causes high memory and latency. There is a need to accelerate inference while preserving accuracy by smartly managing external KV data.

Method: 1) Analyze distribution of KV chunk hotness and apply hotness-aware mixed-precision compression/loading to cut disk I/O and memory access. 2) Implement hotness-aware data placement to keep frequently accessed KV chunks in high-speed memory. 3) Compare against TurboRAG on TTFT and accuracy.

Result: HA-RAG achieves average TTFT speedup of 2.10x and maximum 10.49x with negligible accuracy loss compared to TurboRAG.

Conclusion: Hotness-aware management of KB KV chunks effectively accelerates RAG inference and reduces memory/I/O overhead with minimal impact on output quality.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) improves model output accuracy by
leveraging external knowledge bases, serving as an effective solution to
address hallucination issues and knowledge-update delays in Large Language
Models (LLMs). However, the introduction of external knowledge bases presents
RAG with challenges in long-context processing, significantly increasing memory
consumption and inference latency. Existing research accelerates inference by
precomputing Key and Value (KV) of the knowledge base and loading them
on-demand during inference. Based on the access frequency of different KV
chunks within the external knowledge base, this paper proposes a hotness-aware
RAG (HA-RAG) inference optimization system. First, leveraging the numerical
distribution of KV chunks, we introduce a hotness-aware mixed-precision
compressing and loading method to reduce disk I/O and memory access overhead.
Second, we design a hotness-aware data placement strategy that prioritizes
storing frequently accessed KV chunks in high-speed memory to improve data
access efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared with
TurboRAG, the proposed HA-RAG achieves an average speedup of 2.10x and maximum
speedup of 10.49x in Time-To-First-Token (TTFT) with negligible accuracy loss.

*Xingyu Wang,Chang-Han Rhee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Heavy-tailed SGD with gradient clipping can avoid sharp minima and improve generalization, with a theory based on large deviations and metastability, supported by simulations and deep-learning experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explain SGD's global dynamics and generalization by studying noise tails; move beyond local convergence and understand how heavy-tailed noise shapes the loss landscape traversal.

Method: Develop a technical machinery using large deviations and metastability (building on Wang & Rhee 2023); analyze heavy-tailed SGD with injected and truncated noise and gradient clipping to characterize its global dynamics.

Result: Provide a sharp characterization of the global dynamics of heavy-tailed SGD; show that heavy-tailed noise with clipping leads to minima with flatter geometry and better generalization; validate theory via simulations and deep-learning experiments.

Conclusion: Controlling the tail of the noise in SGD (e.g., injecting then clipping heavy-tailed noise) is a viable strategy to bias optimization toward flatter minima and improve generalization in deep networks.

Abstract: Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and its variants enable modern artificial
intelligence. However, theoretical understanding lags far behind their
empirical success. It is widely believed that SGD has a curious ability to
avoid sharp local minima in the loss landscape, which are associated with poor
generalization. To unravel this mystery and further enhance such capability of
SGDs, it is imperative to go beyond the traditional local convergence analysis
and obtain a comprehensive understanding of SGDs' global dynamics. In this
paper, we develop a set of technical machinery based on the recent large
deviations and metastability analysis in Wang and Rhee (2023) and obtain sharp
characterization of the global dynamics of heavy-tailed SGDs. In particular, we
reveal a fascinating phenomenon in deep learning: by injecting and then
truncating heavy-tailed noises during the training phase, SGD can almost
completely avoid sharp minima and achieve better generalization performance for
the test data. Simulation and deep learning experiments confirm our theoretical
prediction that heavy-tailed SGD with gradient clipping finds local minima with
a more flat geometry and achieves better generalization performance.

Motivation: Exact target labels can be expensive or impossible to obtain; learning with interval targets addresses uncertainty and provides theoretical guarantees.

Method: Two-part approach: (1) study losses compatible with interval targets and derive non-asymptotic generalization bounds under hypothesis-class smoothness (relaxing realizability and small-ambiguity assumptions); (2) introduce a min–max learning formulation that minimizes the worst-case targets within the intervals; though the inner maximization is non-convex, smoothness constraints yield good performance.

Result: Theoretical generalization bounds are established; the min–max method with smoothness delivers strong empirical results, achieving state-of-the-art performance on real-world datasets.

Conclusion: Interval-target regression is viable with the proposed loss-compatible framework and a robust min–max formulation, offering both guarantees and strong empirical performance.

Abstract: We study the problem of regression with interval targets, where only upper
and lower bounds on target values are available in the form of intervals. This
problem arises when the exact target label is expensive or impossible to
obtain, due to inherent uncertainties. In the absence of exact targets,
traditional regression loss functions cannot be used. First, we study the
methodology of using a loss functions compatible with interval targets, for
which we establish non-asymptotic generalization bounds based on smoothness of
the hypothesis class that significantly relaxing prior assumptions of
realizability and small ambiguity degree. Second, we propose a novel min-max
learning formulation: minimize against the worst-case (maximized) target labels
within the provided intervals. The maximization problem in the latter is
non-convex, but we show that good performance can be achieved with the
incorporation of smoothness constraints. Finally, we perform extensive
experiments on real-world datasets and show that our methods achieve
state-of-the-art performance.

### [136] [Meta-Learning for Cross-Task Generalization in Protein Mutation Property Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20943)
*Srivathsan Badrinarayanan,Yue Su,Janghoon Ock,Alan Pham,Sanya Ahuja,Amir Barati Farimani*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MAML-based meta-learning with a new mutation encoding for protein mutation property prediction improves cross-dataset generalization and efficiency across multiple datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Protein mutation property prediction suffers from dataset-specific patterns and heterogeneous experimental conditions; limited target-domain data makes cross-dataset generalization hard. There is a need for rapid adaptation across tasks.

Method: Apply Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) to transformer-based protein mutation property predictors; introduce separator-token mutation encoding to embed mutations directly into sequence context; train across multiple mutation-property tasks to enable fast adaptation with few gradient steps.

Result: Across three datasets (functional fitness, thermal stability, solubility), meta-learning approach outperforms traditional fine-tuning; functional fitness improved 29% accuracy with 65% less training time; solubility improved 94% accuracy with 55% faster training; training efficiency largely dataset-size independent.

Conclusion: This work demonstrates systematic application of meta-learning to protein mutation analysis and presents an effective mutation encoding strategy, enabling cross-domain generalization valuable for industrial protein design with limited data.

Abstract: Protein mutations can have profound effects on biological function, making
accurate prediction of property changes critical for drug discovery, protein
engineering, and precision medicine. Current approaches rely on fine-tuning
protein-specific transformers for individual datasets, but struggle with
cross-dataset generalization due to heterogeneous experimental conditions and
limited target domain data. We introduce two key innovations: (1) the first
application of Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) to protein mutation property
prediction, and (2) a novel mutation encoding strategy using separator tokens
to directly incorporate mutations into sequence context. We build upon
transformer architectures integrating them with MAML to enable rapid adaptation
to new tasks through minimal gradient steps rather than learning
dataset-specific patterns. Our mutation encoding addresses the critical
limitation where standard transformers treat mutation positions as unknown
tokens, significantly degrading performance. Evaluation across three diverse
protein mutation datasets (functional fitness, thermal stability, and
solubility) demonstrates significant advantages over traditional fine-tuning.
In cross-task evaluation, our meta-learning approach achieves 29% better
accuracy for functional fitness with 65% less training time, and 94% better
accuracy for solubility with 55% faster training. The framework maintains
consistent training efficiency regardless of dataset size, making it
particularly valuable for industrial applications and early-stage protein
design where experimental data is limited. This work establishes a systematic
application of meta-learning to protein mutation analysis and introduces an
effective mutation encoding strategy, offering transformative methodology for
cross-domain generalization in protein engineering.

### [137] [LLM-Integrated Bayesian State Space Models for Multimodal Time-Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20952)
*Sungjun Cho,Changho Shin,Suenggwan Jo,Xinya Yan,Shourjo Aditya Chaudhuri,Frederic Sala*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LLS introduces LBS, a probabilistic multimodal forecasting framework that unifies Bayesian State Space Models with pretrained LLMs to jointly predict numerical values and textual summaries with uncertainty, using flexible horizons.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world forecasting often requires combining structured time-series with unstructured text while also quantifying uncertainty. Fixed input/output horizons and lack of probabilistic modeling limit current methods. A unified, interpretable, multimodal approach is needed.

Method: LBS has two components: a Bayesian State Space Model backbone that captures latent state dynamics driving both numerical and textual observations, and a pretrained Large Language Model adapted to encode textual inputs for posterior state estimation and to decode textual forecasts aligned with the latent trajectory. This enables flexible lookback/forecast windows and principled uncertainty quantification, leveraging the inductive bias of SSMs for dynamical systems.

Result: On TextTimeCorpus, LBS improves the previous state-of-the-art by 13.20% and provides human-readable summaries for each forecast, demonstrating superior multimodal temporal reasoning.

Conclusion: This work unifies LLMs and SSMs for joint numerical and textual prediction, establishing a novel foundation for multimodal temporal reasoning with uncertainty quantification and better temporal generalization.

Abstract: Forecasting in the real world requires integrating structured time-series
data with unstructured textual information, but existing methods are
architecturally limited by fixed input/output horizons and are unable to model
or quantify uncertainty. We address this challenge by introducing
LLM-integrated Bayesian State space models (LBS), a novel probabilistic
framework for multimodal temporal forecasting. At a high level, LBS consists of
two components: (1) a state space model (SSM) backbone that captures the
temporal dynamics of latent states from which both numerical and textual
observations are generated and (2) a pretrained large language model (LLM) that
is adapted to encode textual inputs for posterior state estimation and decode
textual forecasts consistent with the latent trajectory. This design enables
flexible lookback and forecast windows, principled uncertainty quantification,
and improved temporal generalization thanks to the well-suited inductive bias
of SSMs toward modeling dynamical systems. Experiments on the TextTimeCorpus
benchmark demonstrate that LBS improves the previous state-of-the-art by 13.20%
while providing human-readable summaries of each forecast. Our work is the
first to unify LLMs and SSMs for joint numerical and textual prediction,
offering a novel foundation for multimodal temporal reasoning.

### [138] [Safety Assessment in Reinforcement Learning via Model Predictive Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20955)
*Jeff Pflueger,Michael Everett*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes reversibility-based safety for model-free RL by using model-predictive path integral control (MPC-PIC) to vet policy actions against black-box dynamics, aborting unsafe actions during training while maintaining PPO-like progress.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Safety guarantees for model-free RL are hard when dynamics and constraints are not fully known; invariance-based safety issues are common but difficult to specify. A method that relies on querying dynamics rather than explicit models could provide practical safety assurances.

Method: During training, for each action proposed by the learned policy, apply model-predictive path integral control to assess the action's safety under the black-box dynamics. If deemed unsafe, abort the action; this reversibility-based check enforces safety throughout training without requiring explicit safety constraints or dynamics models.

Result: The algorithm successfully aborts before all unsafe actions are taken and achieves training progress comparable to a PPO baseline that is allowed to violate safety.

Conclusion: Reversibility-based safety checks via MPC-PIC offer a practical, constraint-light framework for safe model-free RL with black-box dynamics, preserving learning efficiency while preventing unsafe actions.

Abstract: Model-free reinforcement learning approaches are promising for control but
typically lack formal safety guarantees. Existing methods to shield or
otherwise provide these guarantees often rely on detailed knowledge of the
safety specifications. Instead, this work's insight is that many
difficult-to-specify safety issues are best characterized by invariance.
Accordingly, we propose to leverage reversibility as a method for preventing
these safety issues throughout the training process. Our method uses
model-predictive path integral control to check the safety of an action
proposed by a learned policy throughout training. A key advantage of this
approach is that it only requires the ability to query the black-box dynamics,
not explicit knowledge of the dynamics or safety constraints. Experimental
results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm successfully aborts before all
unsafe actions, while still achieving comparable training progress to a
baseline PPO approach that is allowed to violate safety.

*Sizhe Rao,Runqiu Zhang,Sajal Saha,Liang Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: EPFL proposes an Ensembled Penalized Federated Learning framework for privacy-preserving fall detection that combines continual learning, personalized models, and a Specialized Weighted Aggregation; achieves strong recall and F1 on a benchmark dataset, outperforming centralized/baseline models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limited generalizability, data privacy concerns, and inter-individual variability in fall detection by leveraging federated learning with personalization, penalized local training, and ensemble inference.

Method: Framework integrates continual learning and personalized modeling with penalized local training and ensemble-based inference, using Specialized Weighted Aggregation. Privacy is maintained via homomorphic encryption and federated training on wearable sensor data capturing sequential motion patterns.

Result: Recall 88.31% and F1-score 89.94% on a benchmark dataset; outperforms centralized and baseline models.

Conclusion: EPFL offers a scalable, secure, and accurate fall detection solution with potential for continual improvement via adaptive feedback, suitable for real-world healthcare deployment.

Abstract: Falls among elderly and disabled individuals remain a leading cause of injury
and mortality worldwide, necessitating robust, accurate, and privacy-aware fall
detection systems. Traditional fall detection approaches, whether centralized
or point-wise, often struggle with key challenges such as limited
generalizability, data privacy concerns, and variability in individual movement
behaviors. To address these limitations, we propose EPFL-an Ensembled Penalized
Federated Learning framework that integrates continual learning, personalized
modeling, and a novel Specialized Weighted Aggregation (SWA) strategy. EPFL
leverages wearable sensor data to capture sequential motion patterns while
preserving user privacy through homomorphic encryption and federated training.
Unlike existing federated models, EPFL incorporates both penalized local
training and ensemble-based inference to improve inter-client consistency and
adaptability to behavioral differences. Extensive experiments on a benchmark
fall detection dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving
a Recall of 88.31 percent and an F1-score of 89.94 percent, significantly
outperforming both centralized and baseline models. This work presents a
scalable, secure, and accurate solution for real-world fall detection in
healthcare settings, with strong potential for continuous improvement via its
adaptive feedback mechanism.

### [140] [Towards Scalable Oversight with Collaborative Multi-Agent Debate in Error Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20963)
*Yongqiang Chen,Gang Niu,James Cheng,Bo Han,Masashi Sugiyama*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ColMAD reframes multi-agent debate as a collaborative, non-zero-sum protocol to improve error detection in LLMs, overcoming the drawbacks of competitive MAD such as debate hacking and overconfidence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Self-diagnosis in LLMs on complex tasks is unreliable; prior zero-sum MAD can incentivize debaters to mislead or overstate claims. A collaborative approach aims to provide richer, more trustworthy external feedback.

Method: Introduce ColMAD, a collaborative MAD protocol in which multiple agents critique each other in a supportive, non-competitive manner. A judge aggregates the evidence to reach a conclusion. The evaluation compares ColMAD to prior competitive MAD and single-agent baselines on error-detection performance.

Result: ColMAD significantly outperforms previous competitive MAD by 19% and yields non-trivial improvements over single-agent methods in error detection.

Conclusion: Shifting MAD from a competitive to a collaborative, non-zero-sum framework reduces debate hacking and enhances error-detection robustness in LLM supervision, suggesting a promising direction for scalable oversight.

Abstract: Accurate detection of errors in large language models (LLM) responses is
central to the success of scalable oversight, or providing effective
supervision to superhuman intelligence. Yet, self-diagnosis is often unreliable
on complex tasks unless aided by reliable external feedback. Multi-agent debate
(MAD) seems to be a natural alternative to external feedback: multiple LLMs
provide complementary perspectives and cross-checks for error detection.
However, prior MAD protocols frame debate as a zero-sum game, where the
debaters compete to win the game instead of seeking the truth. Consequently, it
leads to debate hacking: debaters tend to mislead the judge by misinterpreting
the task or presenting overconfident claims, which introduce more mistakes and
underperform single-agent methods. To mitigate the issue, we introduce a new
collaborative MAD protocol, termed ColMAD, that reframes MAD as a non-zero sum
game. Specifically, ColMAD encourages multiple agents to criticize each other
in a supportive way, such that they can complement the missing points of each
other. Therefore, the judge agent can make a more informative conclusion based
on more comprehensive evidence. Empirically, we show that ColMAD significantly
outperforms previous competitive MAD by 19% and brings non-trivial improvements
over single-agent methods in error detection.

### [141] [Neural Mutual Information Estimation with Vector Copulas](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20968)
*Yanzhi Chen,Zijing Ou,Adrian Weller,Michael U. Gutmann*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A new mutual information estimator uses vector copula theory to interpolate between highly flexible neural-network models and simple Gaussian copula models, aiming for a better bias-variance trade-off and data efficiency; it shows improved performance on benchmarks and real-world multi-modal data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Estimating MI is hard because flexible models require large data and simple models miss complex dependencies. A principled interpolation could capture diverse dependencies while remaining data-efficient.

Method: Develop a vector-copula–driven interpolation framework that blends flexible representation with structured copula constraints to balance capacity and bias. Implement and evaluate on synthetic benchmarks and real-world multi-modal datasets.

Result: The proposed estimator demonstrates superior performance over existing MI estimators on challenging benchmarks and across diverse data modalities, indicating improved accuracy and robustness.

Conclusion: Vector-copula–based interpolation provides a principled, data-efficient approach to MI estimation, achieving a favorable bias-variance trade-off and strong empirical results; it offers a practical path for handling complex dependencies without relying solely on highly flexible models.

Abstract: Estimating mutual information (MI) is a fundamental task in data science and
machine learning. Existing estimators mainly rely on either highly flexible
models (e.g., neural networks), which require large amounts of data, or overly
simplified models (e.g., Gaussian copula), which fail to capture complex
distributions. Drawing upon recent vector copula theory, we propose a
principled interpolation between these two extremes to achieve a better
trade-off between complexity and capacity. Experiments on state-of-the-art
synthetic benchmarks and real-world data with diverse modalities demonstrate
the advantages of the proposed estimator.

### [142] [On the accuracy of implicit neural representations for cardiovascular anatomies and hemodynamic fields](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20970)
*Jubilee Lee,Daniele E. Schiavazzi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Implicit neural representations can compress hemodynamic fields and cardiovascular anatomies with high fidelity and resolution independence. The study reports very high compression (up to ~230x) and low errors (1 mmHg pressure, 5–10 cm/s velocity; anatomy errors <~1.6 mm across 48 thoracic aorta anatomies). SIREN, MFN-Gabor, and MHE architectures perform best; source code/data available.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate how state-of-the-art INRs perform in domain-specific biomedical applications, quantify their accuracy and compression on hemodynamic fields and cardiovascular anatomies, and address spectral bias to improve representation.

Method: Evaluate several INR strategies (specialized activation functions, fixed/trainable positional encodings, and linear combinations of nonlinear kernels) on realistic, space- and time-varying hemodynamic fields in the thoracic aorta. Compare architectures (SIREN, MFN-Gabor, MHE) across 48 anatomies for pressure and velocity fields and for signed distance representations of anatomies.

Result: Achieved high compression ratios (up to ~230x) with maximum absolute errors of 1 mmHg for pressure and 5–10 cm/s for velocity. Average anatomy discrepancy <0.5 mm and maximum <1.6 mm across 48 anatomies. SIREN, MFN-Gabor, and MHE performed best.

Conclusion: INRs enable highly compressed yet accurate representations for domain-specific hemodynamic fields and cardiovascular anatomies; specialized activations and encodings mitigate spectral bias, with SIREN, MFN-Gabor, and MHE being the leading architectures. Open-source code/data provided.

Abstract: Implicit neural representations (INRs, also known as neural fields) have
recently emerged as a powerful framework for knowledge representation,
synthesis, and compression. By encoding fields as continuous functions within
the weights and biases of deep neural networks-rather than relying on voxel- or
mesh-based structured or unstructured representations-INRs offer both
resolution independence and high memory efficiency. However, their accuracy in
domain-specific applications remains insufficiently understood. In this work,
we assess the performance of state-of-the-art INRs for compressing hemodynamic
fields derived from numerical simulations and for representing cardiovascular
anatomies via signed distance functions. We investigate several strategies to
mitigate spectral bias, including specialized activation functions, both fixed
and trainable positional encoding, and linear combinations of nonlinear
kernels. On realistic, space- and time-varying hemodynamic fields in the
thoracic aorta, INRs achieved remarkable compression ratios of up to
approximately 230, with maximum absolute errors of 1 mmHg for pressure and 5-10
cm/s for velocity, without extensive hyperparameter tuning. Across 48 thoracic
aortic anatomies, the average and maximum absolute anatomical discrepancies
were below 0.5 mm and 1.6 mm, respectively. Overall, the SIREN, MFN-Gabor, and
MHE architectures demonstrated the best performance. Source code and data is

*Jiyu Cui,Fang Wu,Haokai Zhao,Minggao Feng,Xenophon Evangelopoulos,Andrew I. Cooper,Yejin Choi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces L2M3OF, a multimodal LLM for MOFs that fuses crystal representations with language to enable structure-aware reasoning; it outperforms several closed-source LLMs in property prediction and knowledge generation with fewer parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MOF design involves complex 3D structures and strict coordination rules that are not easily captured by text alone; integrating structure, textual data, and knowledge is necessary to navigate the vast design space and codify tacit expertise.

Method: Use a pre-trained crystal encoder plus a lightweight projection layer to map structural information into a token space compatible with language models; curate a structure-property-knowledge database of crystalline materials; benchmark L2M3OF against state-of-the-art closed-source LLMs (GPT-5, Gemini-2.5-Pro, DeepSeek-R1) on property prediction and knowledge generation tasks.

Result: L2M3OF outperforms leading text-based closed-source LLMs in both property prediction and knowledge generation while using far fewer parameters, demonstrating the value of multimodal representations for porous materials.

Conclusion: Multimodal LLMs that jointly process structure, text, and knowledge can significantly advance materials discovery (MOFs) and provide a foundation for future AI systems in crystalline materials research.

Abstract: Large language models have demonstrated remarkable reasoning capabilities
across diverse natural language tasks. However, comparable breakthroughs in
scientific discovery are more limited, because understanding complex physical
phenomena demands multifaceted representations far beyond language alone. A
compelling example is the design of functional materials such as MOFs-critical
for a range of impactful applications like carbon capture and hydrogen storage.
Navigating their vast and intricate design space in language-based
representations interpretable by LLMs is challenging due to the numerous
possible three-dimensional atomic arrangements and strict reticular rules of
coordination geometry and topology. Despite promising early results in
LLM-assisted discovery for simpler materials systems, MOF design remains
heavily reliant on tacit human expertise rarely codified in textual information
alone. To overcome this barrier, we introduce L2M3OF, the first multimodal LLM
for MOFs. L2M3OF integrates crystal representation learning with language
understanding to process structural, textual, and knowledge modalities jointly.
L2M3OF employs a pre-trained crystal encoder with a lightweight projection
layer to compress structural information into a token space, enabling efficient
alignment with language instructions. To facilitate training and evaluation, we
curate a structure-property-knowledge database of crystalline materials and
benchmark L2M3OF against state-of-the-art closed-source LLMs such as GPT-5,
Gemini-2.5-Pro and DeepSeek-R1. Experiments show that L2M3OF outperforms
leading text-based closed-source LLMs in property prediction and knowledge
generation tasks, despite using far fewer parameters. These results highlight
the importance of multimodal approaches for porous material understanding and
establish L2M3OF as a foundation for next-generation AI systems in materials
discovery.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MeDyate is a memory-aware dynamic subnetwork adaptation framework for on-device neural network training, combining Layer Ranking (LaRa) and dynamic channel sampling to enable fine-tuning under very tight RAM budgets, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: On-device training is constrained by limited memory, hindering adaptation of pre-trained models. There is a need for principled layer pre-selection and budget-aware exploration of the parameter space to enable effective fine-tuning under stringent memory limits.

Method: MeDyate introduces Layer Ranking (LaRa) as an improved layer importance metric for principled layer pre-selection, and a dynamic channel sampling strategy that leverages the temporal stability of channel importances during fine-tuning. It resamples channels between epochs according to importance-weighted probabilities to explore the parameter space within a fixed memory budget.

Result: Extensive evaluation across a large panel of tasks and architectures shows state-of-the-art performance under extreme memory constraints, consistently outperforming existing static and dynamic baselines while maintaining high computational efficiency.

Conclusion: MeDyate represents a significant step toward enabling efficient on-device learning by enabling effective fine-tuning with memory budgets as low as a few hundred kilobytes of RAM.

Abstract: On-device neural network training faces critical memory constraints that
limit the adaptation of pre-trained models to downstream tasks. We present
MeDyate, a theoretically-grounded framework for memory-constrained dynamic
subnetwork adaptation. Our approach introduces two key innovations: LaRa (Layer
Ranking), an improved layer importance metric that enables principled layer
pre-selection, and a dynamic channel sampling strategy that exploits the
temporal stability of channel importance distributions during fine-tuning.
MeDyate dynamically resamples channels between epochs according to
importance-weighted probabilities, ensuring comprehensive parameter space
exploration while respecting strict memory budgets. Extensive evaluation across
a large panel of tasks and architectures demonstrates that MeDyate achieves
state-of-the-art performance under extreme memory constraints, consistently
outperforming existing static and dynamic approaches while maintaining high
computational efficiency. Our method represents a significant step towards
enabling efficient on-device learning by demonstrating effective fine-tuning

*Yunuo Zhang,Baiting Luo,Ayan Mukhopadhyay,Gabor Karsai,Abhishek Dubey*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Presents ESCORT, a particle-based method for POMDP belief approximation that uses correlation-aware SVGD and temporal consistency to capture high-dimensional, multi-modal beliefs, outperforming existing approaches in accuracy and decision quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Belief representations in POMDPs are increasingly complex (high-dimensional, multi-modal). Existing methods (particle filters, parametric models) can misrepresent uncertainty, leading to suboptimal decisions due to degeneracy, fixed capacity, or poor correlation handling.

Method: ESCORT extends Stein Variational Gradient Descent (SVGD) with two innovations: (1) correlation-aware projections that model dependencies between state dimensions, and (2) temporal consistency constraints that stabilize updates over time while preserving correlation structures. It remains particle-based, avoids resampling and restrictive distributional assumptions, and adapts to belief landscape complexity.

Result: Empirical evaluations on POMDP domains and synthetic multi-modal distributions across varying dimensionality show that ESCORT achieves higher belief approximation accuracy and better downstream decision quality than state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: ESCORT provides an efficient, flexible, nonparametric framework for modeling complex belief landscapes in high-dimensional POMDPs, reducing degeneracy and improving decision performance, with broad applicability to multi-modal belief distributions.

Abstract: In Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs), maintaining and
updating belief distributions over possible underlying states provides a
principled way to summarize action-observation history for effective
decision-making under uncertainty. As environments grow more realistic, belief
distributions develop complexity that standard mathematical models cannot
accurately capture, creating a fundamental challenge in maintaining
representational accuracy. Despite advances in deep learning and probabilistic
modeling, existing POMDP belief approximation methods fail to accurately
represent complex uncertainty structures such as high-dimensional, multi-modal
belief distributions, resulting in estimation errors that lead to suboptimal
agent behaviors. To address this challenge, we present ESCORT (Efficient
Stein-variational and sliced Consistency-Optimized Representation for Temporal
beliefs), a particle-based framework for capturing complex, multi-modal
distributions in high-dimensional belief spaces. ESCORT extends SVGD with two
key innovations: correlation-aware projections that model dependencies between
state dimensions, and temporal consistency constraints that stabilize updates
while preserving correlation structures. This approach retains SVGD's
attractive-repulsive particle dynamics while enabling accurate modeling of
intricate correlation patterns. Unlike particle filters prone to degeneracy or
parametric methods with fixed representational capacity, ESCORT dynamically
adapts to belief landscape complexity without resampling or restrictive
distributional assumptions. We demonstrate ESCORT's effectiveness through
extensive evaluations on both POMDP domains and synthetic multi-modal
distributions of varying dimensionality, where it consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in terms of belief approximation accuracy and
downstream decision quality.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GLVQ: Grouped Lattice Vector Quantization for post-training quantization of LLMs. It learns a lattice codebook per weight group via a trainable generation matrix, uses Babai rounding to enable differentiable training, and decodes with a simple matrix-vector product. It achieves a better size–accuracy trade-off than standard PTQ baselines and is practical for resource-constrained deployment. Code available on GitHub.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reduce inference memory and compute for large language models through effective post-training quantization. Uniform quantization often hurts performance at low bit-width; a trainable, group-wise lattice approach can maintain accuracy while shrinking model size.

Method: Partition model weights into groups; assign a customized lattice codebook per group, defined by a learnable generation matrix. During training, apply Babai rounding to approximate the nearest lattice point, enabling gradient-based optimization of the generation matrices. After training, decoding becomes a straightforward matrix–vector multiplication for efficient inference.

Result: Experiments across multiple benchmarks show improved trade-offs between model size and accuracy compared with existing PTQ baselines, indicating GLVQ’s effectiveness for deploying large models under strict resource constraints.

Conclusion: GLVQ provides an effective and efficient PTQ framework that yields favorable size–accuracy trade-offs for LLM deployment, with practical decoding speed. The authors release their code on GitHub for reproducibility.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities but
typically require extensive computational resources and memory for inference.
Post-training quantization (PTQ) can effectively reduce these demands by
storing weights in lower bit-width formats. However, standard uniform
quantization often leads to notable performance degradation, particularly in
low-bit scenarios. In this work, we introduce a Grouped Lattice Vector
Quantization (GLVQ) framework that assigns each group of weights a customized
lattice codebook, defined by a learnable generation matrix. To address the
non-differentiability of the quantization process, we adopt Babai rounding to
approximate nearest-lattice-point search during training, which enables stable
optimization of the generation matrices. Once trained, decoding reduces to a
simple matrix-vector multiplication, yielding an efficient and practical
quantization pipeline. Experiments on multiple benchmarks show that our
approach achieves a better trade-off between model size and accuracy compared
to existing post-training quantization baselines, highlighting its
effectiveness in deploying large models under stringent resource constraints.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate GPU memory prediction is critical for resource scheduling in deep learning workloads; existing methods are insufficient; a model combining BiGRU and Transformer may capture temporal and long-range dependencies in memory usage.

Method: Developed Transformer model optimized with Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Units; evaluated against four baseline ML models (Decision Tree, Random Forest, AdaBoost, XGBoost); metrics: MSE, RMSE, MAE, R2; dataset: not specified.

Result: BiGRU-Transformer achieved lowest MSE and RMSE among all models; MAE and R2 indicate balanced, stable performance; deviations from actual values are smallest; overall improvement over baselines.

Conclusion: BiGRU-Transformer is effective for GPU memory demand prediction in DL tasks, enabling better resource scheduling and cluster utilization; offers strong technical support for memory management optimization.

Abstract: In response to the increasingly critical demand for accurate prediction of
GPU memory resources in deep learning tasks, this paper deeply analyzes the
current research status and innovatively proposes a deep learning model that
integrates bidirectional gated recurrent units (BiGRU) to optimize the
Transformer architecture, aiming to improve the accuracy of memory demand
prediction. To verify the effectiveness of the model, a carefully designed
comparative experiment was conducted, selecting four representative basic
machine learning models: decision tree, random forest, Adaboost, and XGBoost as
benchmarks. The detailed experimental results show that the BiGRU Transformer
optimization model proposed in this paper exhibits significant advantages in
key evaluation indicators: in terms of mean square error (MSE) and root mean
square error (RMSE), the model achieves the lowest value among all comparison
models, and its predicted results have the smallest deviation from the actual
values; In terms of mean absolute error (MAE) and coefficient of determination
(R2) indicators, the model also performs well and the results are balanced and
stable, with comprehensive predictive performance far exceeding the benchmark
machine learning methods compared. In summary, the Transformer model based on
bidirectional gated recurrent unit optimization successfully constructed in
this study can efficiently and accurately complete GPU memory demand prediction
tasks in deep learning tasks, and its prediction accuracy has been
significantly improved compared to traditional machine learning methods. This
research provides strong technical support and reliable theoretical basis for
optimizing resource scheduling and management of deep learning tasks, and
improving the utilization efficiency of computing clusters.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address constrained learning with non-convex parameterizations where duality gaps hinder optimization, and to provide a principled, minimally invasive method with theoretical guarantees and practical effectiveness.

Method: Reexamine Augmented Lagrangian methods in non-convex constrained learning, establish strong duality under mild conditions, prove convergence of dual ascent to feasible and optimal primal solutions, and derive PAC-style generalization guarantees; apply the framework to fairness-constrained classification tasks.

Result: Strong duality under mild conditions; convergence of dual ascent to feasible and optimal primal solutions; PAC-style generalization guarantees; empirical effectiveness demonstrated on fairness-constrained classification.

Conclusion: Augmented Lagrangian methods offer a robust and theoretically sound approach for constrained learning in non-convex settings, providing both convergence guarantees and practical performance improvements for tasks such as fairness-constrained classification.

Abstract: Despite the non-convexity of most modern machine learning parameterizations,
Lagrangian duality has become a popular tool for addressing constrained
learning problems. We revisit Augmented Lagrangian methods, which aim to
mitigate the duality gap in non-convex settings while requiring only minimal
modifications, and have remained comparably unexplored in constrained learning
settings. We establish strong duality results under mild conditions, prove
convergence of dual ascent algorithms to feasible and optimal primal solutions,
and provide PAC-style generalization guarantees. Finally, we demonstrate its
effectiveness on fairness constrained classification tasks.

### [149] [Exploring Spiking Neural Networks for Binary Classification in Multivariate Time Series at the Edge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20997)
*James Ghawaly,Andrew Nicholson,Catherine Schuman,Dalton Diez,Aaron Young,Brett Witherspoon*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A general, hardware-friendly framework that uses Evolutionary Optimization of Neuromorphic Systems (EONS) to train sparse, stateful spiking neural networks for binary time-series classification, with step-wise predictions and low false alarms, demonstrated on gamma-ray spectroscopy and EEG seizure detection, including ensemble voting to boost robustness and reduced-parameter performance compared to deep learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable accurate, low-false-alarm binary classification on multivariate time series with efficient, neuromorphic hardware implementations, by jointly optimizing sparse SNN architectures and parameters.

Method: Evolve sparse, stateful SNNs using the EONS algorithm; encode inputs as spike trains; make predictions by thresholding a single output neuron's spike counts; incorporate simple voting ensembles; apply domain-specific optimizations for gamma-ray spectral data; test generalizability on EEG seizure detection; deploy on microCaspian neuromorphic hardware.

Result: Gamma-ray task achieved 51.8% true positive rate (TPR) at 1 false alarm per hour (FAR); PCA baseline 42.7%, deep learning baseline 49.8%; a three-model any-vote ensemble raised TPR to 67.1% at the same FAR; hardware: 2 mW power and 20.2 ms inference latency; EEG seizure detection with ensemble achieved 95% TPR at 16% false positives, competitive with recent DL while using fewer parameters.

Conclusion: The framework generalizes across domains, delivering competitive performance with far fewer parameters and enabling energy-efficient neuromorphic deployment; ensemble voting improves robustness, and the approach shows promise for step-wise, low-FPR predictions in time-series tasks.

Abstract: We present a general framework for training spiking neural networks (SNNs) to
perform binary classification on multivariate time series, with a focus on
step-wise prediction and high precision at low false alarm rates. The approach
uses the Evolutionary Optimization of Neuromorphic Systems (EONS) algorithm to
evolve sparse, stateful SNNs by jointly optimizing their architectures and
parameters. Inputs are encoded into spike trains, and predictions are made by
thresholding a single output neuron's spike counts. We also incorporate simple
voting ensemble methods to improve performance and robustness.
  To evaluate the framework, we apply it with application-specific
optimizations to the task of detecting low signal-to-noise ratio radioactive
sources in gamma-ray spectral data. The resulting SNNs, with as few as 49
neurons and 66 synapses, achieve a 51.8% true positive rate (TPR) at a false
alarm rate of 1/hr, outperforming PCA (42.7%) and deep learning (49.8%)
baselines. A three-model any-vote ensemble increases TPR to 67.1% at the same
false alarm rate. Hardware deployment on the microCaspian neuromorphic platform
demonstrates 2mW power consumption and 20.2ms inference latency.
  We also demonstrate generalizability by applying the same framework, without
domain-specific modification, to seizure detection in EEG recordings. An
ensemble achieves 95% TPR with a 16% false positive rate, comparable to recent
deep learning approaches with significant reduction in parameter count.

### [150] [Distilled Decoding 2: One-step Sampling of Image Auto-regressive Models with Conditional Score Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21003)
*Enshu Liu,Qian Chen,Xuefei Ning,Shengen Yan,Guohao Dai,Zinan Lin,Yu Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DD2 enables one-step sampling for image autoregressive models by training a separate score-predicting network via a conditional score distillation loss, achieving substantial speed-ups with modest quality loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Image autoregressive models are slow to sample due to many sequential steps. DD1 relied on a predefined mapping, which limited flexibility and caused performance degradation in one-step sampling; there is a need for a flexible one-step generator.

Method: Treat the original AR model as a teacher that provides ground-truth conditional scores in latent embedding space for each token. Train a separate network to predict these conditional scores and apply score distillation at every token position conditioned on previously generated tokens, without any predefined mapping.

Result: DD2 enables one-step sampling with a modest FID increase from 3.40 to 5.43 on ImageNet-256. Compared with the strongest baseline DD1, DD2 reduces the one-step gap by 67% and achieves up to 12.3× training speed-up.

Conclusion: DD2 makes one-step sampling for image AR models feasible, significantly advancing fast, high-quality autoregressive generation; code is available at the provided GitHub repository.

Abstract: Image Auto-regressive (AR) models have emerged as a powerful paradigm of
visual generative models. Despite their promising performance, they suffer from
slow generation speed due to the large number of sampling steps required.
Although Distilled Decoding 1 (DD1) was recently proposed to enable few-step
sampling for image AR models, it still incurs significant performance
degradation in the one-step setting, and relies on a pre-defined mapping that
limits its flexibility. In this work, we propose a new method, Distilled
Decoding 2 (DD2), to further advances the feasibility of one-step sampling for
image AR models. Unlike DD1, DD2 does not without rely on a pre-defined
mapping. We view the original AR model as a teacher model which provides the
ground truth conditional score in the latent embedding space at each token
position. Based on this, we propose a novel \emph{conditional score
distillation loss} to train a one-step generator. Specifically, we train a
separate network to predict the conditional score of the generated distribution
and apply score distillation at every token position conditioned on previous
tokens. Experimental results show that DD2 enables one-step sampling for image
AR models with an minimal FID increase from 3.40 to 5.43 on ImageNet-256.
Compared to the strongest baseline DD1, DD2 reduces the gap between the
one-step sampling and original AR model by 67%, with up to 12.3$\times$
training speed-up simultaneously. DD2 takes a significant step toward the goal
of one-step AR generation, opening up new possibilities for fast and
high-quality AR modeling. Code is available at

### [151] [Fair Representation Learning with Controllable High Confidence Guarantees via Adversarial Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21017)
*Yuhong Luo,Austin Hoag,Xintong Wang,Philip S. Thomas,Przemyslaw A. Grabowicz*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FRG introduces high-confidence fairness guarantees for representation learning, bounding demographic disparity by a user-specified epsilon with high probability using an optimized adversarial model; empirically shows consistent fairness across downstream models on three real-world datasets, outperforming six baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To ensure fair downstream outcomes in representation learning by providing provable, high-probability guarantees with user-defined fairness tolerance, addressing limitations of existing methods that lack per-task guarantees.

Method: FRG trains representations with a targeted adversarial framework that optimizes to yield fairness guarantees; obtains high-confidence bounds on demographic disparity (per downstream task) controlled by epsilon, across multiple downstream models/tasks.

Result: FRG consistently bounds unfairness across diverse downstream models and tasks, outperforming six state-of-the-art fair representation methods on three real-world datasets.

Conclusion: FRG offers a practical approach to enforce high-probability fairness guarantees in learned representations, enabling safer deployment across downstream tasks.

Abstract: Representation learning is increasingly applied to generate representations
that generalize well across multiple downstream tasks. Ensuring fairness
guarantees in representation learning is crucial to prevent unfairness toward
specific demographic groups in downstream tasks. In this work, we formally
introduce the task of learning representations that achieve high-confidence
fairness. We aim to guarantee that demographic disparity in every downstream
prediction remains bounded by a *user-defined* error threshold $\epsilon$, with
*controllable* high probability. To this end, we propose the ***F**air
**R**epresentation learning with high-confidence **G**uarantees (FRG)*
framework, which provides these high-confidence fairness guarantees by
leveraging an optimized adversarial model. We empirically evaluate FRG on three
real-world datasets, comparing its performance to six state-of-the-art fair
representation learning methods. Our results demonstrate that FRG consistently
bounds unfairness across a range of downstream models and tasks.

### [152] [More Than Memory Savings: Zeroth-Order Optimization Mitigates Forgetting in Continual Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21019)
*Wanhao Yu,Zheng Wang,Shuteng Niu,Sen Lin,Li Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ZO optimization yields memory-efficient continual learning with improved stability (less forgetting) but reduced plasticity; a targeted approach (ZO-FC) can balance stability and adaptation by applying ZO to an adapter-based PEFT module while keeping a FO classifier.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Investigate whether zeroth-order optimization can address the plasticity-stability-efficiency trade-off in continual learning and whether its memory efficiency and tendency to flatten loss landscapes help mitigate forgetting.

Method: Theoretical analysis plus empirical evaluation across existing continual learning methods. Examine how ZO affects loss landscape flatness and forgetting. Propose ZO-FC: apply ZO to a single adapter-based PEFT module with a FO-optimized classifier to balance stability and plasticity while keeping memory overhead low.

Result: ZO optimization tends to produce flatter loss landscapes, which reduces forgetting and improves stability in continual learning. However, its imprecise gradient estimates slow convergence and hinder acquisition of new task knowledge, reducing plasticity, especially under limited training budgets. Holistic evaluation shows stability gains but sometimes at the cost of plasticity, notably with learnable classifiers. The proposed ZO-FC approach uses ZO for a single adapter-based PEFT module while maintaining FO optimization for the classifier, achieving a better balance between stability and plasticity with minimal memory overhead.

Conclusion:  zeroth-order optimization offers a memory-efficient path for on-device continual learning by enhancing stability at the expense of plasticity; a balanced design like ZO-FC can preserve adaptability while keeping stability benefits, suggesting practical applicability for resource-constrained CL scenarios.

Abstract: Zeroth-order (ZO) optimization has gained attention as a memory-efficient
alternative to first-order (FO) methods, particularly in settings where
gradient computation is expensive or even impractical. Beyond its memory
efficiency, in this work, we investigate ZO optimization for continual learning
(CL) as a novel approach to address the plasticity-stability-efficiency
trilemma. Through theoretical analysis and empirical evidence, we show that ZO
optimization naturally leads to flatter loss landscapes, which in turn reduce
forgetting in CL. However, this stability comes at a cost of plasticity: due to
its imprecise gradient estimates and slower convergence, ZO optimization tends
to be less effective than FO in acquiring new task-specific knowledge,
particularly under constrained training budgets. To better understand this
trade-off, we conduct a holistic evaluation of ZO optimization applied to
various existing CL methods. Our findings reveal that ZO optimization enhances
stability but often undermines plasticity, particularly when used with
learnable classifiers. Motivated by this insight, we propose ZO-FC, a simple
but effective approach that applies ZO optimization to a single adapter-based
PEFT module with FO optimized classifier. This design leverages the stability
benefits of ZO while preserving the adaptability of FO updates with negligible
memory overhead. Experiments demonstrate that ZO-FC achieves an effective
balance between stability and plasticity, offering a practical and
memory-efficient solution for on-device CL.

### [153] [From Information to Generative Exponent: Learning Rate Induces Phase Transitions in SGD](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21020)
*Konstantinos Christopher Tsiolis,Alireza Mousavi-Hosseini,Murat A. Erdogdu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper studies how learning rates in gradient-based learning of Gaussian single-index models affect sample complexity, revealing a phase transition between an information-exponent regime (small rates) and a generative-exponent regime (large rates); it unifies correlational and non-correlational updates, introduces a two-timescale layer-wise training method to go beyond correlational queries without sample reuse, and stresses that learning-rate choice is crucial for efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand feature learning dynamics in neural networks, unify prior analyses of SGD variants, and explain how learning rate choices influence the efficiency of gradient-based learning for nonlinear single-index models.

Method: Develop a theoretical framework for gradient-based algorithms with potentially different learning rates across updates and layers; analyze one-pass SGD, batch reuse, and introduce a two-timescale layer-wise training algorithm that enables non-correlational updates without sample reuse or loss modification.

Result: Characterizes how learning-rate choices shape sample complexity and reveals a phase transition between information-exponent and generative-exponent regimes; shows the framework covers previous analyses and that a two-timescale layer-wise training method can surpass correlational updates; emphasizes that learning-rate design is as important as algorithm design for efficiency.

Conclusion: Learning-rate selection is a critical driver of efficiency in gradient-based feature learning for Gaussian single-index models; the proposed framework and two-timescale method broaden the toolkit beyond correlational updates and clarify when different exponent regimes emerge, shaping both theory and practical training strategies.

Abstract: To understand feature learning dynamics in neural networks, recent
theoretical works have focused on gradient-based learning of Gaussian
single-index models, where the label is a nonlinear function of a latent
one-dimensional projection of the input. While the sample complexity of online
SGD is determined by the information exponent of the link function, recent
works improved this by performing multiple gradient steps on the same sample
with different learning rates -- yielding a non-correlational update rule --
and instead are limited by the (potentially much smaller) generative exponent.
However, this picture is only valid when these learning rates are sufficiently
large. In this paper, we characterize the relationship between learning rate(s)
and sample complexity for a broad class of gradient-based algorithms that
encapsulates both correlational and non-correlational updates. We demonstrate
that, in certain cases, there is a phase transition from an "information
exponent regime" with small learning rate to a "generative exponent regime"
with large learning rate. Our framework covers prior analyses of one-pass SGD
and SGD with batch reuse, while also introducing a new layer-wise training
algorithm that leverages a two-timescales approach (via different learning
rates for each layer) to go beyond correlational queries without reusing
samples or modifying the loss from squared error. Our theoretical study
demonstrates that the choice of learning rate is as important as the design of
the algorithm in achieving statistical and computational efficiency.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CIPHER is a framework that accelerates large-scale labeling of complex time series in physics by combining indexable symbolic representations, unsupervised clustering, and human-in-the-loop validation to propagate expert annotations across clusters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Label scarcity and inconsistency in time-series data from physical sciences hinder robust machine learning; scalable, interpretable labeling is needed to enable understanding, prediction, and forecasting in domains like space weather.

Method: Combine iSAX for interpretable compression/indexing, HDBSCAN for density-based clustering to group recurring phenomena, and a human-in-the-loop to validate representative samples. Annotations from domain scientists are propagated across clusters to produce scalable classifications.

Result: Applied to solar wind phenomena in OMNI data, CIPHER recovered meaningful categories such as coronal mass ejections and stream interaction regions, demonstrating a broadly applicable strategy for label-scarce time series.

Conclusion: A general framework that integrates symbolic representations, unsupervised learning, and expert knowledge to enable scalable, reproducible labeling in physical-science time series; code and configurations are publicly available to support reproducibility.

Abstract: Labeling or classifying time series is a persistent challenge in the physical
sciences, where expert annotations are scarce, costly, and often inconsistent.
Yet robust labeling is essential to enable machine learning models for
understanding, prediction, and forecasting. We present the \textit{Clustering
and Indexation Pipeline with Human Evaluation for Recognition} (CIPHER), a
framework designed to accelerate large-scale labeling of complex time series in
physics. CIPHER integrates \textit{indexable Symbolic Aggregate approXimation}
(iSAX) for interpretable compression and indexing, density-based clustering
(HDBSCAN) to group recurring phenomena, and a human-in-the-loop step for
efficient expert validation. Representative samples are labeled by domain
scientists, and these annotations are propagated across clusters to yield
systematic, scalable classifications. We evaluate CIPHER on the task of
classifying solar wind phenomena in OMNI data, a central challenge in space
weather research, showing that the framework recovers meaningful phenomena such
as coronal mass ejections and stream interaction regions. Beyond this case
study, CIPHER highlights a general strategy for combining symbolic
representations, unsupervised learning, and expert knowledge to address label
scarcity in time series across the physical sciences. The code and
configuration files used in this study are publicly available to support
reproducibility.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A physics-consistent neural operator (PCNO) with a Fourier-space projection layer enforces mass and momentum conservation; extended with a diffusion-based consistency model (DiffPCNO) for uncertainty quantification, yielding accurate, physically grounded spatiotemporal forecasts across scales and systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long-term spatiotemporal forecasting is challenging because many ML methods ignore governing physical laws and lack reliable uncertainty quantification. A physics-informed, uncertainty-aware approach is needed to improve reliability across diverse systems and resolutions.

Method: Introduce PCNO with a physics-consistent projection layer that projects surrogate outputs onto function spaces satisfying conservation laws, efficiently computed in Fourier space. Build DiffPCNO by incorporating a diffusion-model-based consistency framework to quantify and mitigate uncertainties.

Result: Demonstrates high-fidelity spatiotemporal predictions while preserving physical consistency and uncertainty estimates across diverse applications (turbulent flow, flood/atmospheric forecasting) and multiple spatial resolutions.

Conclusion: A two-stage framework (PCNO + DiffPCNO) offers a robust, versatile approach for accurate, physically grounded, and uncertainty-aware spatiotemporal forecasting.

Abstract: Accurate long-term forecasting of spatiotemporal dynamics remains a
fundamental challenge across scientific and engineering domains. Existing
machine learning methods often neglect governing physical laws and fail to
quantify inherent uncertainties in spatiotemporal predictions. To address these
challenges, we introduce a physics-consistent neural operator (PCNO) that
enforces physical constraints by projecting surrogate model outputs onto
function spaces satisfying predefined laws. A physics-consistent projection
layer within PCNO efficiently computes mass and momentum conservation in
Fourier space. Building upon deterministic predictions, we further propose a
diffusion model-enhanced PCNO (DiffPCNO), which leverages a consistency model
to quantify and mitigate uncertainties, thereby improving the accuracy and
reliability of forecasts. PCNO and DiffPCNO achieve high-fidelity
spatiotemporal predictions while preserving physical consistency and
uncertainty across diverse systems and spatial resolutions, ranging from
turbulent flow modeling to real-world flood/atmospheric forecasting. Our
two-stage framework provides a robust and versatile approach for accurate,
physically grounded, and uncertainty-aware spatiotemporal forecasting.

*Gereon Elvers,Gilad Landau,Oiwi Parker Jones*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes Keyword Spotting (KWS) as a practical, privacy-aware intermediate task for non-invasive BCIs, with standardized LibriBrain 52-hour within-subject data splits, robust evaluation for extreme class imbalance, and a lightweight baseline model; released tooling for reproducibility. KWS shows strong viability, with ~13x AUPRC gain over a permutation baseline on held-out sessions, and analyses indicate scalable learning with more training hours and word-level factors affecting detectability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current BCI benchmarks focus on simple tasks (e.g., Speech Detection, Phoneme Classification) and lack application-ready results like Brain-to-Text. A practically relevant, privacy-aware task and standardized benchmark are needed for reproducible progress in non-invasive BCIs.

Method: Standardized train/validation/test splits on the 52-hour within-subject LibriBrain corpus; evaluation using AUPRC with false alarms per hour (FA/h) at fixed recall to handle extreme class imbalance; release of updated pnpl library with word-level dataloaders and Colab tutorials; a reference model: a compact 1-D Conv/ResNet with focal loss and top-k pooling, trainable on a consumer-class GPU.

Result: The reference model achieves about 13x the permutation baseline AUPRC on held-out sessions, demonstrating viability of KWS as an intermediate BCI task.

Conclusion: Keyword Spotting is a viable, privacy-aware intermediate benchmark for non-invasive BCIs, enabling reproducible benchmarking and practical insights. Key findings include predictable within-subject scaling (performance scales log-linearly with training hours) and the influence of word-level factors (frequency and duration) on detectability; ongoing tooling and datasets support further research.

Abstract: Non-invasive brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) are beginning to benefit from
large, public benchmarks. However, current benchmarks target relatively simple,
foundational tasks like Speech Detection and Phoneme Classification, while
application-ready results on tasks like Brain-to-Text remain elusive. We
propose Keyword Spotting (KWS) as a practically applicable, privacy-aware
intermediate task. Using the deep 52-hour, within-subject LibriBrain corpus, we
provide standardized train/validation/test splits for reproducible
benchmarking, and adopt an evaluation protocol tailored to extreme class
imbalance. Concretely, we use area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC) as
a robust evaluation metric, complemented by false alarms per hour (FA/h) at
fixed recall to capture user-facing trade-offs. To simplify deployment and
further experimentation within the research community, we are releasing an
updated version of the pnpl library with word-level dataloaders and Colab-ready
tutorials. As an initial reference model, we present a compact 1-D Conv/ResNet
baseline with focal loss and top-k pooling that is trainable on a single
consumer-class GPU. The reference model achieves approximately 13x the
permutation baseline AUPRC on held-out sessions, demonstrating the viability of
the task. Exploratory analyses reveal: (i) predictable within-subject scaling -
performance improves log-linearly with more training hours - and (ii) the
existence of word-level factors (frequency and duration) that systematically
modulate detectability.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A-GPS introduces an online generative model for Pareto sets in discrete black-box MOO, conditioning on user preferences via a class probability estimator, enabling sampling across the Pareto front without retraining and avoiding explicit hypervolume computations; demonstrated with synthetic benchmarks and protein design showing strong sample efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To efficiently obtain quality Pareto set approximations in online discrete MOO while accommodating subjective user preferences and avoiding costly hypervolume calculations.

Method: Train a generative model of the Pareto set; use a class probability estimator to predict non-dominance and condition the generator; show the estimator implicitly estimates the probability of hypervolume improvement; incorporate user-specified preference direction vectors; update the model each iteration using Pareto membership and alignment with preferences; yield an amortized model capable of sampling across the Pareto front without retraining.

Result: Achieves high-quality Pareto set approximations with strong sample efficiency; effective incorporation of user preferences; avoids explicit hypervolume computation; demonstrated on synthetic benchmarks and protein design tasks.

Conclusion: A-GPS provides a simple, flexible framework for preference-driven online MOO in discrete domains, delivering Pareto-sample generation without retraining and with efficient sampling across the front, suitable for applications requiring subjective trade-offs.

Abstract: We introduce active generation of Pareto sets (A-GPS), a new framework for
online discrete black-box multi-objective optimization (MOO). A-GPS learns a
generative model of the Pareto set that supports a-posteriori conditioning on
user preferences. The method employs a class probability estimator (CPE) to
predict non-dominance relations and to condition the generative model toward
high-performing regions of the search space. We also show that this
non-dominance CPE implicitly estimates the probability of hypervolume
improvement (PHVI). To incorporate subjective trade-offs, A-GPS introduces
preference direction vectors that encode user-specified preferences in
objective space. At each iteration, the model is updated using both Pareto
membership and alignment with these preference directions, producing an
amortized generative model capable of sampling across the Pareto front without
retraining. The result is a simple yet powerful approach that achieves
high-quality Pareto set approximations, avoids explicit hypervolume
computation, and flexibly captures user preferences. Empirical results on
synthetic benchmarks and protein design tasks demonstrate strong sample
efficiency and effective preference incorporation.

*Faraz Zargari,Hossein Nekouyan,Lyndon Hallett,Bo Sun,Xiaoqi Tan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces a lossless rounding scheme and a relax-and-round framework to achieve online multi-class selection with group fairness, including handling multi-class agents and a learning-augmented variant.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Online resource allocation with sequential arrivals while enforcing group fairness across multiple agent classes; existing work lacks lossless (equal) performance in integral solutions and does not adequately address agents belonging to multiple classes.

Method: 1) Compute a fractional solution using a set-aside (resource-reservation) mechanism to enforce class fairness. 2) Apply a randomized, lossless rounding step to obtain an integral solution preserving the fractional solution's expected performance. 3) Use a relax-and-round framework to handle agents in multiple classes. 4) Propose a learning-augmented variant that leverages untrusted machine-learned predictions to balance fairness and efficiency.

Result: The integral online algorithm matches the fractional solution in expectation, preserving performance while maintaining fairness guarantees. The rounding step does not degrade performance, and the approach extends to multi-class agents. The learning-augmented variant offers robustness to imperfect predictions.

Conclusion: The paper presents a principled framework for online fair allocation with multi-class agents, achieving lossless translation from fractional to integral solutions and incorporating untrusted predictions to enhance practical balance between fairness and efficiency.

Abstract: We study the online multi-class selection problem with group fairness
guarantees, where limited resources must be allocated to sequentially arriving
agents. Our work addresses two key limitations in the existing literature.
First, we introduce a novel lossless rounding scheme that ensures the integral
algorithm achieves the same expected performance as any fractional solution.
Second, we explicitly address the challenges introduced by agents who belong to
multiple classes. To this end, we develop a randomized algorithm based on a
relax-and-round framework. The algorithm first computes a fractional solution
using a resource reservation approach -- referred to as the set-aside mechanism
-- to enforce fairness across classes. The subsequent rounding step preserves
these fairness guarantees without degrading performance. Additionally, we
propose a learning-augmented variant that incorporates untrusted
machine-learned predictions to better balance fairness and efficiency in
practical settings.

### [159] [On the Sample Complexity of Differentially Private Policy Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21060)
*Yi He,Xingyu Zhou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Presents a theoretical study of differentially private policy optimization (PO), formalizing DP for on-policy PO and analyzing the sample complexity of common PO algorithms (e.g., policy gradient, natural policy gradient) under DP constraints within a unified framework. Finds that privacy costs often enter as lower-order terms in sample complexity and offers practical design insights for privacy-preserving PO.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Policy optimization is increasingly used in sensitive domains (robotics, healthcare, large-scale model training). DP is needed to protect data, but PO's on-policy nature makes privacy definitions and accounting nontrivial. The work aims to establish a rigorous DP framework for PO and quantify sample complexity under privacy constraints.

Method: Develop a DP definition tailored to policy optimization that accounts for on-policy data and the privacy unit. Build a unified analytical framework to study the sample complexity of PO methods (e.g., policy gradient, natural policy gradient) under DP, across different settings, and derive theoretical results.

Result: Theoretical analysis shows that incorporating DP costs often contributes only to lower-order terms in the overall sample complexity. The work also uncovers subtle effects in private PO that influence algorithm design and practical privacy-utility trade-offs.

Conclusion: Differentially private policy optimization is feasible with manageable sample complexity overhead in many settings. DP constraints should be accounted for in PO algorithm design, but privacy costs do not necessarily dominate sample efficiency; the framework provides guidance for developing privacy-preserving PO methods and highlights important subtleties in private PO.

Abstract: Policy optimization (PO) is a cornerstone of modern reinforcement learning
(RL), with diverse applications spanning robotics, healthcare, and large
language model training. The increasing deployment of PO in sensitive domains,
however, raises significant privacy concerns. In this paper, we initiate a
theoretical study of differentially private policy optimization, focusing
explicitly on its sample complexity. We first formalize an appropriate
definition of differential privacy (DP) tailored to PO, addressing the inherent
challenges arising from on-policy learning dynamics and the subtlety involved
in defining the unit of privacy. We then systematically analyze the sample
complexity of widely-used PO algorithms, including policy gradient (PG),
natural policy gradient (NPG) and more, under DP constraints and various
settings, via a unified framework. Our theoretical results demonstrate that
privacy costs can often manifest as lower-order terms in the sample complexity,
while also highlighting subtle yet important observations in private PO
settings. These offer valuable practical insights for privacy-preserving PO
algorithms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The PSP dataset (2018–2024, >150 GB) exceeds what traditional analysis can efficiently handle. A scalable, interpretable, and reproducible approach is needed to characterize solar wind parameters and extreme space weather events.

Method: Distributed processing with Dask for large-scale statistics; Kernel Density Matrices (KDM) to estimate univariate and bivariate distributions of solar wind speed, proton density, and proton thermal speed; derive anomaly thresholds; create processed data products; publish code and configurations for reproducibility.

Result: Identified characteristic trends in the inner heliosphere: solar wind speed increases with distance from the Sun, proton density decreases, and speed-density show an inverse relationship. The framework provides quantitative insights into how solar wind structures influence extreme space weather and geomagnetic storms, with scalable, interpretable analyses and publicly available data/products.

Conclusion: The approach offers a tractable, interpretable, and distributed methodology for exploring large-scale in situ solar wind measurements, enabling reproducible research and forecasting support; data products and analysis tools are openly available to advance future solar wind dynamics studies.

Abstract: We present a scalable machine learning framework for analyzing Parker Solar
Probe (PSP) solar wind data using distributed processing and the
quantum-inspired Kernel Density Matrices (KDM) method. The PSP dataset
(2018--2024) exceeds 150 GB, challenging conventional analysis approaches. Our
framework leverages Dask for large-scale statistical computations and KDM to
estimate univariate and bivariate distributions of key solar wind parameters,
including solar wind speed, proton density, and proton thermal speed, as well
as anomaly thresholds for each parameter. We reveal characteristic trends in
the inner heliosphere, including increasing solar wind speed with distance from
the Sun, decreasing proton density, and the inverse relationship between speed
and density. Solar wind structures play a critical role in enhancing and
mediating extreme space weather phenomena and can trigger geomagnetic storms;
our analyses provide quantitative insights into these processes. This approach
offers a tractable, interpretable, and distributed methodology for exploring
complex physical datasets and facilitates reproducible analysis of large-scale
in situ measurements. Processed data products and analysis tools are made
publicly available to advance future studies of solar wind dynamics and space
weather forecasting. The code and configuration files used in this study are
publicly available to support reproducibility.

### [161] [The Virtues of Brevity: Avoid Overthinking in Parallel Test-Time Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21067)
*Raul Cavalcante Dinardi,Bruno Yamamoto,Anna Helena Reali Costa,Artur Jordao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Shortest-answer heuristic for LLM reasoning matches or exceeds self-consistency while reducing compute; biases toward concise solutions by leveraging two-regime behavior and a critical point.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reduce computation and complexity of test-time reasoning, while maintaining predictive performance on hard tasks.

Method: Evaluate naive shortest-answer sampling against self-consistency on two challenging benchmarks; analyze regimes and compute cost; assess applicability when output equality is ill-defined.

Result: Competitive with self-consistency; substantial computational savings; Pareto improvement; works even if exact equality isn't defined.

Conclusion: A simple, effective, low-cost heuristic for sampling solution paths in LLM reasoning; explanation via regime-based perspective; practical for diverse tasks.

Abstract: Reasoning models represent a significant advance in LLM capabilities,
particularly for complex reasoning tasks such as mathematics and coding.
Previous studies confirm that parallel test-time compute-sampling multiple
solutions and selecting the best one-can further enhance the predictive
performance of LLMs. However, strategies in this area often require complex
scoring, thus increasing computational cost and complexity. In this work, we
demonstrate that the simple and counterintuitive heuristic of selecting the
shortest solution is highly effective. We posit that the observed effectiveness
stems from models operating in two distinct regimes: a concise, confident
conventional regime and a verbose overthinking regime characterized by
uncertainty, and we show evidence of a critical point where the overthinking
regime begins to be significant. By selecting the shortest answer, the
heuristic preferentially samples from the conventional regime. We confirm that
this approach is competitive with more complex methods such as self-consistency
across two challenging benchmarks while significantly reducing computational
overhead. The shortest-answer heuristic provides a Pareto improvement over
self-consistency and applies even to tasks where output equality is not well
defined.

### [162] [Neural Collapse under Gradient Flow on Shallow ReLU Networks for Orthogonally Separable Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21078)
*Hancheng Min,Zhihui Zhu,René Vidal*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Gradient flow on a two-layer ReLU network trained to classify orthogonally separable data exhibits Neural Collapse, even with constrained last-layer features. The work shows data structure, nonlinear activations, and the implicit bias of gradient dynamics jointly drive NC beyond unconstrained-feature setups.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neural Collapse (NC) explains the discriminative power of learned representations; prior theory mainly assumes unconstrained last-layer features; there is a need to understand how data geometry, activations, and training dynamics contribute to NC in more realistic settings.

Method: Analytical study of gradient flow for a two-layer ReLU network on orthogonally separable data, incorporating constrained features. Derives conditions under which NC emerges and isolates the role of implicit bias in training.

Result: The paper proves that NC emerges in this setting, even with feature constraints; shows that data structure and nonlinear activation influence NC, and that implicit bias of gradient dynamics facilitates NC.

Conclusion: Extends NC theory by relaxing unconstrained-feature assumption and highlighting implicit-bias-driven emergence, clarifying how data geometry and activation shape NC in gradient-based training.

Abstract: Among many mysteries behind the success of deep networks lies the exceptional
discriminative power of their learned representations as manifested by the
intriguing Neural Collapse (NC) phenomenon, where simple feature structures
emerge at the last layer of a trained neural network. Prior works on the
theoretical understandings of NC have focused on analyzing the optimization
landscape of matrix-factorization-like problems by considering the last-layer
features as unconstrained free optimization variables and showing that their
global minima exhibit NC. In this paper, we show that gradient flow on a
two-layer ReLU network for classifying orthogonally separable data provably
exhibits NC, thereby advancing prior results in two ways: First, we relax the
assumption of unconstrained features, showing the effect of data structure and
nonlinear activations on NC characterizations. Second, we reveal the role of
the implicit bias of the training dynamics in facilitating the emergence of NC.

*Zhuojin Li,Marco Paolieri,Leana Golubchik*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Collaborative CPU-GPU inference on mobile with OpenCL SVM and learned latency models to reduce synchronization overhead, achieving up to ~1.9x speedups for linear and conv layers on Pixel 5.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mobile DNNs are constrained by limited computing resources; sharing work between CPU and GPU could reduce latency, but synchronization and accurate timing prediction pose major challenges.

Method: Introduce a lightweight synchronization mechanism based on OpenCL fine-grained shared virtual memory (SVM) and train machine learning models to predict execution times (including GPU dispatch times) for CPU- and GPU-bound tasks, capturing GPU kernel performance characteristics; evaluate across four mobile platforms.

Result: Achieves up to 1.89x speedup for linear layers and 1.75x speedup for convolutional layers, approaching the observed maximal gains of 2.01x and 1.87x from exhaustive grid search on a Pixel 5; demonstrated across four mobile platforms.

Conclusion: CPU-GPU co-execution with SVM-based synchronization and learned latency models effectively reduces mobile inference latency and can attain near-optimal speedups in practical settings.

Abstract: Deploying deep neural networks on mobile devices is increasingly important
but remains challenging due to limited computing resources. On the other hand,
their unified memory architecture and narrower gap between CPU and GPU
performance provide an opportunity to reduce inference latency by assigning
tasks to both CPU and GPU. The main obstacles for such collaborative execution
are the significant synchronization overhead required to combine partial
results, and the difficulty of predicting execution times of tasks assigned to
CPU and GPU (due to the dynamic selection of implementations and parallelism
level). To overcome these obstacles, we propose both a lightweight
synchronization mechanism based on OpenCL fine-grained shared virtual memory
(SVM) and machine learning models to accurately predict execution times.
Notably, these models capture the performance characteristics of GPU kernels
and account for their dispatch times. A comprehensive evaluation on four mobile
platforms shows that our approach can quickly select CPU-GPU co-execution
strategies achieving up to 1.89x speedup for linear layers and 1.75x speedup
for convolutional layers (close to the achievable maximum values of 2.01x and
1.87x, respectively, found by exhaustive grid search on a Pixel~5 smartphone).

### [164] [DictPFL: Efficient and Private Federated Learning on Encrypted Gradients](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21086)
*Jiaqi Xue,Mayank Kumar,Yuzhang Shang,Shangqian Gao,Rui Ning,Mengxin Zheng,Xiaoqian Jiang,Qian Lou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DictPFL provides full gradient privacy in federated learning with homomorphic encryption by decomposing model weights into a static local dictionary and an updatable encrypted lookup table; it uses encryption-aware pruning to minimize encrypted parameters, achieving near-plaintext performance with large communication and speedups.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Gradient-sharing in federated learning risks privacy leakage (e.g., gradient inversion). While homomorphic encryption enables secure aggregation, it incurs heavy computation and communication costs. Existing HE-based FL methods are either fully encrypted with high overhead or partially encrypted with vulnerabilities. There is a need for full gradient protection with low overhead.

Method: Decompose-for-Partial-Encrypt (DePE): split model weights into a static dictionary (local, not shared) and an updatable lookup table (encrypted and aggregated). Prune-for-Minimum-Encrypt (PrME): encryption-aware pruning using history-guided masks to minimize the number of encrypted parameters. The combination yields full gradient protection with minimal overhead while avoiding sharing the static dictionary.

Result: DictPFL reduces communication cost by 402-748× and accelerates training by 28-65× compared with fully encrypted FL. It outperforms state-of-the-art selective encryption methods by 51-155× in overhead and 4-19× in speed. Runtime is within 2× of plaintext FL, suggesting HE-based private FL can be practical for real-world deployment.

Conclusion: HE-based private federated learning can be practical with careful design. DictPFL demonstrates that full gradient protection is achievable with minimal overhead by separating static and encrypted components and by encryption-aware pruning. The approach is ready for broader deployment, with code available at the authors' GitHub.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across
institutions without sharing raw data. However, gradient sharing still risks
privacy leakage, such as gradient inversion attacks. Homomorphic Encryption
(HE) can secure aggregation but often incurs prohibitive computational and
communication overhead. Existing HE-based FL methods sit at two extremes:
encrypting all gradients for full privacy at high cost, or partially encrypting
gradients to save resources while exposing vulnerabilities. We present DictPFL,
a practical framework that achieves full gradient protection with minimal
overhead. DictPFL encrypts every transmitted gradient while keeping
non-transmitted parameters local, preserving privacy without heavy computation.
It introduces two key modules: Decompose-for-Partial-Encrypt (DePE), which
decomposes model weights into a static dictionary and an updatable lookup
table, only the latter is encrypted and aggregated, while the static dictionary
remains local and requires neither sharing nor encryption; and
Prune-for-Minimum-Encrypt (PrME), which applies encryption-aware pruning to
minimize encrypted parameters via consistent, history-guided masks. Experiments
show that DictPFL reduces communication cost by 402-748$\times$ and accelerates
training by 28-65$\times$ compared to fully encrypted FL, while outperforming
state-of-the-art selective encryption methods by 51-155$\times$ in overhead and
4-19$\times$ in speed. Remarkably, DictPFL's runtime is within 2$\times$ of
plaintext FL, demonstrating for the first time, that HE-based private federated
learning is practical for real-world deployment. The code is publicly available
at https://github.com/UCF-ML-Research/DictPFL.

### [165] [M-GLC: Motif-Driven Global-Local Context Graphs for Few-shot Molecular Property Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21088)
*Xiangyang Xu,Hongyang Gao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes Motif Driven Global-Local Context Graph for few-shot molecular property prediction (FSMPP). Introduces global motif nodes to form a global tri-partite graph (motif–molecule–property) and local subgraphs for each node, achieving state-of-the-art results on five FSMPP benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FSMPP is hampered by scarce labeled data. Existing molecule–property graphs provide limited structural guidance for transfer learning. The proposed approach aims to enrich global and local context using motif-driven information to improve knowledge transfer and focus on informative substructures.

Method: Global level: construct a tri-partite heterogeneous graph with motif nodes representing shared substructures (rings/functional groups) linking to molecules and properties, enabling motif–molecule–property connections and long-range pattern transfer. Local level: build and encode a subgraph for each node in a molecule–property pair to concentrate on informative neighboring molecules and motifs, enhancing attention to relevant context. Integration of global motifs with local context via a fusion mechanism.

Result: Experiments on five standard FSMPP benchmarks show the framework consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: Integrating global motif knowledge with fine-grained local context improves robustness and effectiveness in FSMPP, enabling better knowledge transfer across molecules sharing motifs and more focused local reasoning.

Abstract: Molecular property prediction (MPP) is a cornerstone of drug discovery and
materials science, yet conventional deep learning approaches depend on large
labeled datasets that are often unavailable. Few-shot Molecular property
prediction (FSMPP) addresses this scarcity by incorporating relational
inductive bias through a context graph that links molecule nodes to property
nodes, but such molecule-property graphs offer limited structural guidance. We
propose a comprehensive solution: Motif Driven Global-Local Context Graph for
few-shot molecular property prediction, which enriches contextual information
at both the global and local levels. At the global level, chemically meaningful
motif nodes representing shared substructures, such as rings or functional
groups, are introduced to form a global tri-partite heterogeneous graph,
yielding motif-molecule-property connections that capture long-range
compositional patterns and enable knowledge transfer among molecules with
common motifs. At the local level, we build a subgraph for each node in the
molecule-property pair and encode them separately to concentrate the model's
attention on the most informative neighboring molecules and motifs. Experiments
on five standard FSMPP benchmarks demonstrate that our framework consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art methods. These results underscore the
effectiveness of integrating global motif knowledge with fine-grained local
context to advance robust few-shot molecular property prediction.

*Maitreyi Swaroop,Tamar Krishnamurti,Bryan Wilder*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Model-agnostic feature selection via a continuous relaxation with a noise-based mechanism; selects a small subset of features that maintains predictive quality across multiple subpopulations without backpropagating through model training; validated on synthetic and real-world data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Feature collection is costly (surveys, sensors). We need a small feature set that yields high-quality downstream models across diverse populations.

Method: A continuous relaxation of traditional variable selection using a noise-based mechanism. The method optimizes the variance of a Bayes-optimal predictor, is model-agnostic, and does not require backpropagation through the training process.

Result: Empirical validation on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrates robust, balanced performance across subpopulations.

Conclusion: The framework provides a cost-efficient, population-robust feature selection approach that can be applied across domains without relying on gradient-based training pipelines.

Abstract: We study the problem of selecting limited features to observe such that
models trained on them can perform well simultaneously across multiple
subpopulations. This problem has applications in settings where collecting each
feature is costly, e.g. requiring adding survey questions or physical sensors,
and we must be able to use the selected features to create high-quality
downstream models for different populations. Our method frames the problem as a
continuous relaxation of traditional variable selection using a noising
mechanism, without requiring backpropagation through model training processes.
By optimizing over the variance of a Bayes-optimal predictor, we develop a
model-agnostic framework that balances overall performance of downstream
prediction across populations. We validate our approach through experiments on
both synthetic datasets and real-world data.

### [167] [SolarBoost: Distributed Photovoltaic Power Forecasting Amid Time-varying Grid Capacity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21129)
*Linyuan Geng,Linxiao Yang,Xinyue Gu,Liang Sun*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SolarBoost forecasts distributed PV output by decomposing it into grid-level unit-output functions scaled by capacities, enabling accurate DPV predictions despite missing data and variability; it uses upper-bound loss approximations for efficiency and validates via theoretical analysis and city-scale deployments in China, with open-source code.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DPV systems face data gaps, shifting installed capacity, geographic variability, and panel diversity, making centralized PV models less effective. A scalable, grid-level approach that separates unit behavior from capacity can improve forecasting accuracy and grid operation insights.

Method: Model aggregated DPV output as a sum of grid outputs where each grid uses a unit output function multiplied by its capacity. This decouples unit dynamics from capacity. Propose efficient optimization via an upper-bound approximation to large loss functions. Provide theoretical analysis and empirical validation across multiple Chinese cities; release code publicly.

Result: Grid-level modeling with unit-output functions outperforms centralized approaches in theory and experiments. Demonstrated deployment across various Chinese cities reduces potential losses and offers operational insights for power grids.

Conclusion: SolarBoost provides an effective, scalable DPV forecasting framework that handles data gaps and capacity dynamics, with practical deployments and publicly available code to facilitate adoption.

Abstract: This paper presents SolarBoost, a novel approach for forecasting power output
in distributed photovoltaic (DPV) systems. While existing centralized
photovoltaic (CPV) methods are able to precisely model output dependencies due
to uniformity, it is difficult to apply such techniques to DPV systems, as DPVs
face challenges such as missing grid-level data, temporal shifts in installed
capacity, geographic variability, and panel diversity. SolarBoost overcomes
these challenges by modeling aggregated power output as a composite of output
from small grids, where each grid output is modeled using a unit output
function multiplied by its capacity. This approach decouples the homogeneous
unit output function from dynamic capacity for accurate prediction. Efficient
algorithms over an upper-bound approximation are proposed to overcome
computational bottlenecks in loss functions. We demonstrate the superiority of
grid-level modeling via theoretical analysis and experiments. SolarBoost has
been validated through deployment across various cities in China, significantly
reducing potential losses and provides valuable insights for the operation of
power grids. The code for this work is available at

*Yuhao Fu,Yinghao Zhang,Yalin Liu,Bishenghui Tao,Junhong Ruan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A hierarchical, two-tier DDPG-based scheduler for sequential MIoT workflows across edge/fog/cloud to minimize makespan; global layer selection plus local node assignment; shows improved makespan as workload complexity grows.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MIoT requires stringent end-to-end latency guarantees across heterogeneous edge-fog-cloud infrastructures. Scheduling sequential workflows to minimize makespan is NP-hard, necessitating scalable learning-based approaches that can adapt to large-scale, complex MIoT deployments.

Method: A two-tier reinforcement learning framework using Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG). A global controller selects the execution layer (edge, fog, or cloud); specialized local controllers handle node assignment within the chosen layer. The objective is to minimize workflow makespan across a heterogeneous multi-layer environment.

Result: Experimental results show the proposed framework achieving progressively better makespan performance compared to baselines, with performance gains growing as workflow complexity increases, indicating effective learning of long-term scheduling strategies.

Conclusion: A hierarchical DDPG-based scheduler effectively handles MIoT sequential workflows across edge/fog/cloud infrastructures, delivering improved makespan especially for complex workloads. The approach demonstrates scalability and the potential for real-world deployment, with future work likely addressing robustness, energy considerations, and broader objective trade-offs.

Abstract: The Medical Internet of Things (MIoT) demands stringent end-to-end latency
guarantees for sequential healthcare workflows deployed over heterogeneous
cloud-fog-edge infrastructures. Scheduling these sequential workflows to
minimize makespan is an NP-hard problem. To tackle this challenge, we propose a
Two-tier DDPG-based scheduling framework that decomposes the scheduling
decision into a hierarchical process: a global controller performs layer
selection (edge, fog, or cloud), while specialized local controllers handle
node assignment within the chosen layer. The primary optimization objective is
the minimization of the workflow makespan. Experiments results validate our
approach, demonstrating increasingly superior performance over baselines as
workflow complexity rises. This trend highlights the frameworks ability to
learn effective long-term strategies, which is critical for complex,
large-scale MIoT scheduling scenarios.

*Lianghong Chen,Dongkyu Eugene Kim,Mike Domaratzki,Pingzhao Hu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: An uncertainty-aware RL framework improves multi-objective optimization for 3D molecular diffusion models, enhancing molecule quality and property alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of balancing complex, real-world constraints in de novo 3D molecule design with diffusion models, and to leverage predictive uncertainty to guide optimization.

Method: Employ surrogate models with predictive uncertainty to dynamically shape RL reward functions, guiding diffusion-based molecular design across multiple objectives. Evaluate across three benchmark datasets and several diffusion architectures; validate top candidates with Molecular Dynamics simulations and ADMET profiling.

Result: Outperforms baselines in molecular quality and multi-objective property optimization across datasets and architectures. MD simulations and ADMET profiling indicate drug-like behavior and stable binding, comparable to known EGFR inhibitors.

Conclusion: Uncertainty-aware RL-guided diffusion is a strong approach for efficient, multi-objective de novo molecular design with potential real-world impact in drug discovery.

Abstract: Designing de novo 3D molecules with desirable properties remains a
fundamental challenge in drug discovery and molecular engineering. While
diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in generating
high-quality 3D molecular structures, they often struggle to effectively
control complex multi-objective constraints critical for real-world
applications. In this study, we propose an uncertainty-aware Reinforcement
Learning (RL) framework to guide the optimization of 3D molecular diffusion
models toward multiple property objectives while enhancing the overall quality
of the generated molecules. Our method leverages surrogate models with
predictive uncertainty estimation to dynamically shape reward functions,
facilitating balance across multiple optimization objectives. We
comprehensively evaluate our framework across three benchmark datasets and
multiple diffusion model architectures, consistently outperforming baselines
for molecular quality and property optimization. Additionally, Molecular
Dynamics (MD) simulations and ADMET profiling of top generated candidates
indicate promising drug-like behavior and binding stability, comparable to
known Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) inhibitors. Our results
demonstrate the strong potential of RL-guided generative diffusion models for
advancing automated molecular design.

*Angshul Majumdar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A unified matrix factorization framework for crisp and fuzzy clustering, extended to robust variants via l1,2-norm; introduces alternating minimization and IRLS algorithms with convergence to local minima.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bridge crisp k-means and fuzzy c-means through a matrix factorization view, formalize fuzzy c-means within the same framework, and enable principled robust extensions that resist outliers.

Method: Revisit and rigorously rederive the k-means MF equivalence (building on Bauckhage), generalize to a MF interpretation of fuzzy c-means, formulate both as optimization over factor matrices, replace Frobenius norm with l1,2-norm for robustness, and develop alternating minimization algorithms and IRLS-based schemes, with convergence proofs to local minima.

Result: A theoretical unification of crisp and fuzzy clustering under a single MF framework, plus robust variants with l1,2-norm and algorithms that are guaranteed to converge to local minima.

Conclusion: The work provides a principled, extensible MF-based unification for clustering that includes robust variants and accompanying convergence guarantees, enabling future extensions and applications to outlier-prone data.

Abstract: This paper presents a unified matrix factorization framework for classical
and robust clustering. We begin by revisiting the well-known equivalence
between crisp k-means clustering and matrix factorization, following and
rigorously rederiving an unpublished formulation by Bauckhage. Extending this
framework, we derive an analogous matrix factorization interpretation for fuzzy
c-means clustering, which to the best of our knowledge has not been previously
formalized. These reformulations allow both clustering paradigms to be
expressed as optimization problems over factor matrices, thereby enabling
principled extensions to robust variants. To address sensitivity to outliers,
we propose robust formulations for both crisp and fuzzy clustering by replacing
the Frobenius norm with the l1,2-norm, which penalizes the sum of Euclidean
norms across residual columns. We develop alternating minimization algorithms
for the standard formulations and IRLS-based algorithms for the robust
counterparts. All algorithms are theoretically proven to converge to a local
minimum.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A visual big data system for meteorology loads open weather data into a local NoSQL DB, fuses data across temporal/spatial scales, and performs predictive analysis (including forecasting with neighbor stations) for temperature and rainfall; evaluated for usability and predictive performance with NMSE 0.00013 and directional symmetry ~0.84, showing promising results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Meteorology generates large, high-dimensional data with missing values and strong variable correlations. There is a need to apply Big Data and Data Mining techniques to extract actionable knowledge and improve weather predictions.

Method: Collect open weather data and load into a local NoSQL database; fuse data at different temporal and spatial aggregation levels; apply univariate and multivariate predictive analyses; perform forecasting using data from neighbor stations to handle missing values; assess usability and predictive performance.

Result: Predictive performance: overall NMSE = 0.00013; overall directional symmetry ≈ 0.84. Usability and overall system evaluation rated positively by experts (graphic design not rated as highly).

Conclusion: The results indicate the proposed visual Big Data system is valid and promising for analyzing weather data and supporting predictive tasks; further work is encouraged to enhance functionality and generalizability.

Abstract: The Meteorology is a field where huge amounts of data are generated, mainly
collected by sensors at weather stations, where different variables can be
measured. Those data have some particularities such as high volume and
dimensionality, the frequent existence of missing values in some stations, and
the high correlation between collected variables. In this regard, it is crucial
to make use of Big Data and Data Mining techniques to deal with those data and
extract useful knowledge from them that can be used, for instance, to predict
weather phenomena. In this paper, we propose a visual big data system that is
designed to deal with high amounts of weather-related data and lets the user
analyze those data to perform predictive tasks over the considered variables
(temperature and rainfall). The proposed system collects open data and loads
them onto a local NoSQL database fusing them at different levels of temporal
and spatial aggregation in order to perform a predictive analysis using
univariate and multivariate approaches as well as forecasting based on training
data from neighbor stations in cases with high rates of missing values. The
system has been assessed in terms of usability and predictive performance,
obtaining an overall normalized mean squared error value of 0.00013, and an
overall directional symmetry value of nearly 0.84. Our system has been rated
positively by a group of experts in the area (all aspects of the system except
graphic desing were rated 3 or above in a 1-5 scale). The promising preliminary
results obtained demonstrate the validity of our system and invite us to keep
working on this area.

*Tomer Galanti,Aarya Bookseller,Korok Ray*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A generic bilevel max-max optimization framework for principal-agent contract design using implicit differentiation with conjugate gradients, enabling matrix-free, scalable solutions and extension to nonlinear contracts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the gap where realistic contract settings with nonlinear utilities, stochastic dynamics, and high-dimensional actions lack closed-form solutions; provide a computational tool for systematic contract design.

Method: Algorithmic bilevel framework that uses implicit differentiation with conjugate gradients to compute hypergradients via Hessian-vector products without forming or inverting Hessians; matrix-free, variance-reduced, and problem-agnostic.

Result: In CARA-Normal benchmarks, recovers analytical optima and converges from random initializations; demonstrates extension to nonlinear contracts such as sigmoidal wages, relative-performance/tournament schedules with shocks, multi-task contracts with vector actions and heterogeneous noise, and CARA-Poisson models; offers a scalable tool for intractable contract design.

Conclusion: Provides a new computational tool for contract design, enabling systematic study of models that are analytically intractable and extending applicability to a broad range of contract formats and applications.

Abstract: We study a bilevel \emph{max-max} optimization framework for principal-agent
contract design, in which a principal chooses incentives to maximize utility
while anticipating the agent's best response. This problem, central to moral
hazard and contract theory, underlies applications ranging from market design
to delegated portfolio management, hedge fund fee structures, and executive
compensation. While linear-quadratic models such as Holmstr"om-Milgrom admit
closed-form solutions, realistic environments with nonlinear utilities,
stochastic dynamics, or high-dimensional actions generally do not.
  We introduce a generic algorithmic framework that removes this reliance on
closed forms. Our method adapts modern machine learning techniques for bilevel
optimization -- using implicit differentiation with conjugate gradients (CG) --
to compute hypergradients efficiently through Hessian-vector products, without
ever forming or inverting Hessians. In benchmark CARA-Normal (Constant Absolute
Risk Aversion with Gaussian distribution of uncertainty) environments, the
approach recovers known analytical optima and converges reliably from random
initialization. More broadly, because it is matrix-free, variance-reduced, and
problem-agnostic, the framework extends naturally to complex nonlinear
contracts where closed-form solutions are unavailable, such as sigmoidal wage
schedules (logistic pay), relative-performance/tournament compensation with
common shocks, multi-task contracts with vector actions and heterogeneous
noise, and CARA-Poisson count models with $\mathbb{E}[X\mid a]=e^{a}$. This
provides a new computational tool for contract design, enabling systematic
study of models that have remained analytically intractable.

### [173] [Reducing the Probability of Undesirable Outputs in Language Models Using Probabilistic Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21184)
*Stephen Zhao,Aidan Li,Rob Brekelmans,Roger Grosse*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RePULSe enhances RL-based alignment by adding a proposal-driven loss to discourage low-reward outputs, yielding a better reward-versus-undesired-output tradeoff and stronger adversarial robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard RL focuses on average reward but can tolerate undesired outputs; need better control of failure modes without sacrificing overall performance.

Method: Introduce RePULSe: augment standard RL loss with a second loss that uses learned proposals to sample low-reward outputs and then penalize their probability, guiding the model away from undesired outputs during training.

Result: Experiments show improved tradeoff between expected reward and occurrence of undesired outputs; increased adversarial robustness compared with standard RL alignment methods and alternatives.

Conclusion: RePULSe offers a practical improvement to alignment training by coupling reward optimization with proposal-guided suppression of low-reward outputs, enhancing robustness and safety without overly harming average performance.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a predominant technique to align
language models (LMs) with human preferences or promote outputs which are
deemed to be desirable by a given reward function. Standard RL approaches
optimize average reward, while methods explicitly focused on reducing the
probability of undesired outputs typically come at a cost to average-case
performance. To improve this tradeoff, we introduce RePULSe, a new training
method that augments the standard RL loss with an additional loss that uses
learned proposals to guide sampling low-reward outputs, and then reduces those
outputs' probability. We run experiments demonstrating that RePULSe produces a

### [174] [PLAN: Proactive Low-Rank Allocation for Continual Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21188)
*Xiequn Wang,Zhan Zhuang,Yu Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PLAN extends LoRA for continual learning by proactively allocating task-specific, orthogonal low-rank subspaces, with a perturbation-based optimization to minimize interference and a selection mechanism to pick basis vectors least sensitive to forgetting; achieves state-of-the-art results on foundation-model CL benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Continual learning with large pre-trained models suffers from catastrophic forgetting and inefficiency when adapting to new tasks. Existing LoRA-based fine-tuning is parameter-efficient but not designed for interference-aware task separation. PLAN aims to proactively allocate subspaces per task to isolate learning and reduce forgetting in a scalable way.

Method: PLAN introduces per-task orthogonal basis vectors to guide low-rank adapters. It uses a perturbation-based optimization to minimize conflicts with previously learned parameters and a selection mechanism to assign vectors with minimal sensitivity to interference, effectively extending LoRA to a continual learning setting with foundation models.

Result: Empirical evaluations on standard continual learning benchmarks show PLAN consistently outperforms existing methods and establishes a new state-of-the-art for continual learning with foundation models.

Conclusion: Proactive, orthogonal, low-rank subspace allocation with interference-aware vector selection enables efficient and effective continual learning in large models, improving accuracy on past tasks while enabling adaptation to new tasks.

Abstract: Continual learning (CL) requires models to continuously adapt to new tasks
without forgetting past knowledge. In this work, we propose
\underline{P}roactive \underline{L}ow-rank \underline{A}llocatio\underline{N}
(PLAN), a framework that extends Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to enable efficient
and interference-aware fine-tuning of large pre-trained models in CL settings.
PLAN proactively manages the allocation of task-specific subspaces by
introducing orthogonal basis vectors for each task and optimizing them through
a perturbation-based strategy that minimizes conflicts with previously learned
parameters. Furthermore, PLAN incorporates a novel selection mechanism that
identifies and assigns basis vectors with minimal sensitivity to interference,
reducing the risk of degrading past knowledge while maintaining efficient
adaptation to new tasks. Empirical results on standard CL benchmarks
demonstrate that PLAN consistently outperforms existing methods, establishing a
new state-of-the-art for continual learning with foundation models.

### [175] [Gen-Review: A Large-scale Dataset of AI-Generated (and Human-written) Peer Reviews](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21192)
*Luca Demetrio,Giovanni Apruzzese,Kathrin Grosse,Pavel Laskov,Emil Lupu,Vera Rimmer,Philine Widmer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GenReview is a large, public dataset of 81k LLM-generated peer reviews for all ICLR submissions from 2018–2025, linked to the original papers and reviews, enabling analyses of LLM bias, detectability, instruction-following, and alignment with acceptance decisions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As LLMs increasingly participate in scientific peer review, there is a need for a comprehensive dataset to study their effects on review quality, integrity, and decision-making; prior datasets were lacking.

Method: Generate LLM-written reviews for all ICLR submissions from 2018 to 2025 using three prompts (negative, positive, neutral); link these reviews to the corresponding papers and original human reviews; provide access to the dataset.

Result: Initial investigations show that LLMs exhibit bias in reviewing, LLM-written reviews can be automatically detected, they do not always follow reviewing instructions, and LLM-provided ratings align with paper acceptance decisions only for accepted papers.

Conclusion: GenReview serves as a valuable resource for broad investigations into the utility and implications of LLMs in peer review, enabling researchers to study biases, reliability, and the alignment of automated reviews with editorial outcomes.

Abstract: How does the progressive embracement of Large Language Models (LLMs) affect
scientific peer reviewing? This multifaceted question is fundamental to the
effectiveness -- as well as to the integrity -- of the scientific process.
Recent evidence suggests that LLMs may have already been tacitly used in peer
reviewing, e.g., at the 2024 International Conference of Learning
Representations (ICLR). Furthermore, some efforts have been undertaken in an
attempt to explicitly integrate LLMs in peer reviewing by various editorial
boards (including that of ICLR'25). To fully understand the utility and the
implications of LLMs' deployment for scientific reviewing, a comprehensive
relevant dataset is strongly desirable. Despite some previous research on this
topic, such dataset has been lacking so far. We fill in this gap by presenting
GenReview, the hitherto largest dataset containing LLM-written reviews. Our
dataset includes 81K reviews generated for all submissions to the 2018--2025
editions of the ICLR by providing the LLM with three independent prompts: a
negative, a positive, and a neutral one. GenReview is also linked to the
respective papers and their original reviews, thereby enabling a broad range of
investigations. To illustrate the value of GenReview, we explore a sample of
intriguing research questions, namely: if LLMs exhibit bias in reviewing (they
do); if LLM-written reviews can be automatically detected (so far, they can);
if LLMs can rigorously follow reviewing instructions (not always) and whether
LLM-provided ratings align with decisions on paper acceptance or rejection
(holds true only for accepted papers). GenReview can be accessed at the
following link: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/gen_review.

### [176] [Online AUC Optimization Based on Second-order Surrogate Loss](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21202)
*JunRu Luo,Difei Cheng,Bo Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A second-order surrogate loss for online AUC optimization that aggregates pairwise losses via first- and second-order statistics, achieving logarithmic regret and scalable kernel extension, with strong empirical results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome non-convex, discontinuous pairwise 0/1 losses and high memory costs in AUC optimization, especially under class imbalance and large-scale settings.

Method: Introduce a second-order surrogate loss based on pairwise hinge loss; replace aggregate pairwise losses with a surrogate built from data statistics; develop an efficient online algorithm; extend to nonlinear settings via kernels.

Result: Theoretical regret improved to O(log T) (vs O(sqrt(T)) for existing methods); empirical experiments show superior efficiency and effectiveness.

Conclusion: The proposed framework provides a scalable, online, and kernel-extendable approach to AUC optimization with strong theoretical guarantees and practical performance.

Abstract: The Area Under the Curve (AUC) is an important performance metric for
classification tasks, particularly in class-imbalanced scenarios. However,
minimizing the AUC presents significant challenges due to the non-convex and
discontinuous nature of pairwise 0/1 losses, which are difficult to optimize,
as well as the substantial memory cost of instance-wise storage, which creates
bottlenecks in large-scale applications. To overcome these challenges, we
propose a novel second-order surrogate loss based on the pairwise hinge loss,
and develop an efficient online algorithm. Unlike conventional approaches that
approximate each individual pairwise 0/1 loss term with an instance-wise
surrogate function, our approach introduces a new paradigm that directly
substitutes the entire aggregated pairwise loss with a surrogate loss function
constructed from the first- and second-order statistics of the training data.
Theoretically, while existing online AUC optimization algorithms typically
achieve an $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{T})$ regret bound, our method attains a tighter
$\mathcal{O}(\ln T)$ bound. Furthermore, we extend the proposed framework to
nonlinear settings through a kernel-based formulation. Extensive experiments on
multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate the superior efficiency and
effectiveness of the proposed second-order surrogate loss in optimizing online
AUC performance.

### [177] [Mitra: Mixed Synthetic Priors for Enhancing Tabular Foundation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21204)

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Designing synthetic priors is crucial for tabular foundation models (TFMs) with in-context learning. The paper introduces Mitra, a TFM trained on a diverse mixture of synthetic priors, achieving superior performance and sample efficiency over TabPFNv2/TabICL by leveraging principled prior design.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Gap in understanding how to design effective synthetic priors for TFMs. While TabPFN showed strong ICL from synthetic data, the principles guiding prior design were unclear. The work aims to elucidate which properties of synthetic priors drive generalization and performance.

Method: Systematic investigation of synthetic priors for TFMs. Identify key properties (diversity, distinctiveness, real-world performance). Curate a mixture of priors with these properties. Train Mitra on this curated mixture and evaluate on classification and regression benchmarks against state-of-the-art TFMs.

Result: Mitra outperforms TabPFNv2 and TabICL across classification and regression benchmarks and exhibits better sample efficiency, demonstrating the effectiveness of principled synthetic prior design.

Conclusion: Principled design of synthetic priors is a key driver of TFM generalization; Mitra provides a strong benchmark and supports shifting the design focus from model architecture to data priors for tabular ICL models.

Abstract: Since the seminal work of TabPFN, research on tabular foundation models
(TFMs) based on in-context learning (ICL) has challenged long-standing
paradigms in machine learning. Without seeing any real-world data, models
pretrained on purely synthetic datasets generalize remarkably well across
diverse datasets, often using only a moderate number of in-context examples.
This shifts the focus in tabular machine learning from model architecture
design to the design of synthetic datasets, or, more precisely, to the prior
distributions that generate them. Yet the guiding principles for prior design
remain poorly understood. This work marks the first attempt to address the gap.
We systematically investigate and identify key properties of synthetic priors
that allow pretrained TFMs to generalize well. Based on these insights, we
introduce Mitra, a TFM trained on a curated mixture of synthetic priors
selected for their diversity, distinctiveness, and performance on real-world
tabular data. Mitra consistently outperforms state-of-the-art TFMs, such as
TabPFNv2 and TabICL, across both classification and regression benchmarks, with
better sample efficiency.

*Yunlong Chu,Minglai Shao,Zengyi Wo,Bing Hao,Yuhang Liu,Ruijie Wang,Jianxin Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ADaMoRE introduces an Adaptive Mixture of Residual Experts for graphs, enabling fully unsupervised, heterogeneous MoE training via a backbone-residual architecture, a structurally-aware gate, and a unified objective with reconstruction and a diversity regularizer; it delivers state-of-the-art unsupervised node classification and few-shot learning with better efficiency and convergence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GNNs are limited by fixed message-passing; graph MoE could adapt, but prior MoE methods rely on supervision and suffer instability when training heterogeneous experts; there is a need for robust unsupervised training for heterogeneous MoEs on graphs.

Method: Propose ADaMoRE: backbone-residual expert architecture with stable backbone encoders and specialized residual experts; structurally-aware gating network for fine-grained node routing; end-to-end unsupervised training with a primary reconstruction task plus an information-theoretic diversity regularizer to enforce specialization; theoretical analysis showing improved data efficiency and training stability.

Result: Evaluated on 16 benchmarks; achieves state-of-the-art performance in unsupervised node classification and few-shot learning; demonstrates better generalization, training efficiency, and faster convergence across diverse graphs and tasks.

Conclusion: ADaMoRE provides a robust, unsupervised heterogeneous MoE framework for graphs, delivering efficiency and performance gains; validated across many benchmarks with theoretical support.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) face a fundamental adaptability challenge: their
fixed message-passing architectures struggle with the immense diversity of
real-world graphs, where optimal computational strategies vary by local
structure and task. While Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) offers a promising pathway
to adaptability, existing graph MoE methods remain constrained by their
reliance on supervised signals and instability when training heterogeneous
experts. We introduce ADaMoRE (Adaptive Mixture of Residual Experts), a
principled framework that enables robust, fully unsupervised training of
heterogeneous MoE on graphs. ADaMoRE employs a backbone-residual expert
architecture where foundational encoders provide stability while specialized
residual experts capture diverse computational patterns. A structurally-aware
gating network performs fine-grained node routing. The entire architecture is
trained end-to-end using a unified unsupervised objective, which integrates a
primary reconstruction task with an information-theoretic diversity regularizer
to explicitly enforce functional specialization among the experts. Theoretical
analysis confirms our design improves data efficiency and training stability.
Extensive evaluation across 16 benchmarks validates ADaMoRE's state-of-the-art
performance in unsupervised node classification and few-shot learning,
alongside superior generalization, training efficiency, and faster convergence
on diverse graphs and tasks.

### [179] [On the flow matching interpretability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21210)
*Francesco Pivi,Simone Gazza,Davide Evangelista,Roberto Amadini,Maurizio Gabbrielli*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Constrain flow-based generative models to physically interpretable steps by aligning each flow update with thermal equilibrium states of a 2D Ising model under a temperature-driven diffusion, yielding interpretable trajectories and faster generation than Monte Carlo for larger lattices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Flow-matching models generate data by transforming noise through a sequence of vector-field updates, but the intermediate steps are opaque. Embedding physical semantics into each step aims to make the generative process interpretable and controllable.

Method: Propose a general framework where every flow step is sampled from a known physical distribution and the flow trajectories map to equilibrium states of a simulated physical process. Implemented on the 2D Ising model with a encoder mapping discrete configurations to a continuous latent space, a flow-matching network performing temperature-driven diffusion, and a projector returning to discrete states while enforcing physical constraints.

Result: The framework preserves physical fidelity across multiple lattice sizes and outperforms Monte Carlo generation in speed as lattice size grows. Unlike standard flow matching, each vector field corresponds to a meaningful, stepwise transition in the Ising latent space, yielding interpretable neural trajectories that reflect physical processes.

Conclusion: Embedding physical semantics into generative flows can transform opaque neural trajectories into interpretable physical processes while maintaining fidelity and improving generation efficiency at scale.

Abstract: Generative models based on flow matching have demonstrated remarkable success
in various domains, yet they suffer from a fundamental limitation: the lack of
interpretability in their intermediate generation steps. In fact these models
learn to transform noise into data through a series of vector field updates,
however the meaning of each step remains opaque. We address this problem by
proposing a general framework constraining each flow step to be sampled from a
known physical distribution. Flow trajectories are mapped to (and constrained
to traverse) the equilibrium states of the simulated physical process. We
implement this approach through the 2D Ising model in such a way that flow
steps become thermal equilibrium points along a parametric cooling schedule.
  Our proposed architecture includes an encoder that maps discrete Ising
configurations into a continuous latent space, a flow-matching network that
performs temperature-driven diffusion, and a projector that returns to discrete
Ising states while preserving physical constraints.
  We validate this framework across multiple lattice sizes, showing that it
preserves physical fidelity while outperforming Monte Carlo generation in speed
as the lattice size increases. In contrast with standard flow matching, each
vector field represents a meaningful stepwise transition in the 2D Ising
model's latent space. This demonstrates that embedding physical semantics into
generative flows transforms opaque neural trajectories into interpretable
physical processes.

*Kexuan Shi,Yandong Wen,Weiyang Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes Functional Dual Anchors (FDAs) to merge models by aligning synthetic inputs' gradients with task vectors in input space, offering robustness and complementarity to parameter-space merging.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Parameter-space merging of finetuned checkpoints is hampered by parameter inconsistencies. A functional viewpoint—modeling input representations—can unify multi-task training and post-hoc merging and improve robustness/flexibility.

Method: Introduce FDAs: synthetic inputs whose induced gradients align with task vectors, capturing task-specific functional shifts relative to a pretrained model. Operate in the input-representation space. Provide a principled initialization scheme and demonstrate that FDAs complement parameter-space model merging.

Result: Comprehensive experiments show that FDAs are effective for model merging, improving robustness and flexibility and enabling complementary use alongside parameter-space merges.

Conclusion: FDAs offer a principled functional perspective for multi-task model merging, bridging joint training and post-hoc merging, and providing robustness and flexibility beyond parameter-space methods.

Abstract: Model merging is an efficient post-training strategy for integrating
knowledge from multiple finetuned checkpoints of a shared foundation model.
Existing methods operate in the parameter space, combining task vectors to
mitigate conflicts, but remain constrained by parameter inconsistencies. We
propose Functional Dual Anchors (FDAs), a framework that instead models the
input-representation space. FDAs are synthetic inputs whose induced gradients
align with task vectors, capturing task-specific functional shifts relative to
the pretrained model. This perspective bridges joint multi-task training and
post-hoc merging, offering both robustness and flexibility. We further
introduce a principled initialization scheme and show that FDAs are
complementary to parameter-space model merging. Comprehensive experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness of FDAs in model merging.

*Waris Radji,Odalric-Ambrym Maillard*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Adversarially construct near-indistinguishable neural world models (most confusing instances) to reveal how model uncertainty affects exploration; empirical study links confusion degree to model uncertainty, guiding deep model-based RL exploration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend the notion of most confusing instances to neural network world models and use it to understand the minimal exploration required for optimal policy, with implications for regret bounds in deep RL.

Method: Formalize as constrained optimization to find modified models close to a reference while making the optimal and suboptimal policies diverge; apply an adversarial training procedure; perform empirical evaluation across world models of varying quality.

Result: Confusion achievable by the adversarial modification correlates with the uncertainty in the approximate model; this relationship could inform exploration strategies in deep model-based RL.

Conclusion: Extends the most confusing instance concept to neural world models and provides a practical adversarial framework; findings advocate uncertainty-aware exploration design in deep model-based RL.

Abstract: In reinforcement learning (RL) theory, the concept of most confusing
instances is central to establishing regret lower bounds, that is, the minimal
exploration needed to solve a problem. Given a reference model and its optimal
policy, a most confusing instance is the statistically closest alternative
model that makes a suboptimal policy optimal. While this concept is
well-studied in multi-armed bandits and ergodic tabular Markov decision
processes, constructing such instances remains an open question in the general
case. In this paper, we formalize this problem for neural network world models
as a constrained optimization: finding a modified model that is statistically
close to the reference one, while producing divergent performance between
optimal and suboptimal policies. We propose an adversarial training procedure
to solve this problem and conduct an empirical study across world models of
varying quality. Our results suggest that the degree of achievable confusion
correlates with uncertainty in the approximate model, which may inform
theoretically-grounded exploration strategies for deep model-based RL.

*Noah Oberweis,Semih Cayci*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Continuous-time stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics (SGLD) under lazy training with state-dependent noise yields non-degenerate behavior with high probability and converges exponentially in expectation to the empirical minimizer, with finite-time/finite-width bounds on optimality gap; supported by regression experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide non-asymptotic convergence guarantees for SGLD as a continuous-time model of SGD in deep learning, especially under multiplicative, state-dependent noise and lazy training, where existing analyses are often asymptotic or assume simple noise structures.

Method: Non-asymptotic convergence analysis of SGLD viewed as an Itô SDE approximation of SGD in continuous time, under Hessian regularity. Proves high-probability non-degeneracy of the kernel throughout training, and establishes exponential convergence in expectation along with finite-time and finite-width bounds on the optimality gap; supports results with numerical regression experiments.

Result: The study proves (i) high-probability non-degeneracy of the SGLD kernel during training; (ii) exponential convergence to the empirical risk minimizer in expectation; and provides finite-time and finite-width bounds on the optimality gap. Numerical experiments in regression validate the theoretical findings.

Conclusion: SGLD with multiplicative, state-dependent noise in the lazy training regime offers rigorous, non-asymptotic guarantees for convergence to the empirical minimizer, reinforcing the usefulness of continuous-time stochastic models for understanding training dynamics in deep learning.

Abstract: Continuous-time models provide important insights into the training dynamics
of optimization algorithms in deep learning. In this work, we establish a
non-asymptotic convergence analysis of stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics
(SGLD), which is an It\^o stochastic differential equation (SDE) approximation
of stochastic gradient descent in continuous time, in the lazy training regime.
We show that, under regularity conditions on the Hessian of the loss function,
SGLD with multiplicative and state-dependent noise (i) yields a non-degenerate
kernel throughout the training process with high probability, and (ii) achieves
exponential convergence to the empirical risk minimizer in expectation, and we
establish finite-time and finite-width bounds on the optimality gap. We
corroborate our theoretical findings with numerical examples in the regression
setting.

Motivation: There is no single central library for testing RNN variations, and reimplementing different architectures is time-consuming and error-prone, hindering reproducibility and exploration of long-term dependencies.

Method: Introduce and describe three libraries that provide a consistent framework for constructing and extending RNN models, with built-in customization and experimentation tools; libraries are MIT-licensed and hosted on GitHub: torchrecurrent, RecurrentLayers.jl, LuxRecurrentLayers.jl.

Conclusion: The work delivers a unified, extensible toolchain for RNN research and deployment, enabling easier testing of RNN variants and improving reproducibility across studies.

Abstract: Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are a cornerstone of sequence modeling
across various scientific and industrial applications. Owing to their
versatility, numerous RNN variants have been proposed over the past decade,
aiming to improve the modeling of long-term dependencies and to address
challenges such as vanishing and exploding gradients. However, no central

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PINN Balls: a local Mixture of Experts with adaptive domain decomposition that enables scalable second-order training for PINNs, achieving higher accuracy than state-of-the-art while preserving scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Second-order methods offer potential accuracy gains for Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) but suffer from prohibitive memory costs at scale. The authors propose a parameter-efficient, sparse MoE approach with learnable domain decomposition and adaptive sampling to make second-order training feasible for large PDE problems.

Method: Introduce a local Mixture of Experts (MoE) that combines ensemble efficiency with sparse coding to reduce memory usage for second-order optimization. Implement a fully learnable domain decomposition via Adversarial Adaptive Sampling (AAS) to adapt the PDE domain during training. Train PINN Balls as a composition of expert modules with a shared second-order optimization strategy.

Result: The method achieves higher accuracy than the current state-of-the-art in scientific machine learning, while maintaining important scalability properties and grounding in theoretical principles.

Conclusion: PINN Balls demonstrates that combining MoE-based parameter efficiency with adaptive domain decomposition enables scalable and accurate second-order training for PINNs, potentially offering a competitive alternative to traditional numerical PDE solvers.

Abstract: Recent advances in Scientific Machine Learning have shown that second-order
methods can enhance the training of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs),
making them a suitable alternative to traditional numerical methods for Partial
Differential Equations (PDEs). However, second-order methods induce large
memory requirements, making them scale poorly with the model size. In this
paper, we define a local Mixture of Experts (MoE) combining the
parameter-efficiency of ensemble models and sparse coding to enable the use of
second-order training. Our model -- \textsc{PINN Balls} -- also features a
fully learnable domain decomposition structure, achieved through the use of
Adversarial Adaptive Sampling (AAS), which adapts the DD to the PDE and its
domain. \textsc{PINN Balls} achieves better accuracy than the state-of-the-art
in scientific machine learning, while maintaining invaluable scalability
properties and drawing from a sound theoretical background.

### [185] [Relieving the Over-Aggregating Effect in Graph Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21267)
*Junshu Sun,Wanxing Chang,Chenxue Yang,Qingming Huang,Shuhui Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Wideformer is a plug-and-play graph attention method that mitigates over-aggregating by partitioning aggregation into parallel processes and ranking outputs to prioritize informative messages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In graph attention, aggregating messages from many nodes can dilute key information (over-aggregating), especially in large graphs. Reducing input volume per aggregation and focusing on informative messages is needed to preserve discriminative signals while maintaining scalability.

Method: Wideformer splits the global aggregation into parallel processes over subsets of nodes and uses a guiding step to sort and weight the aggregation outputs, effectively prioritizing informative messages and avoiding dilution.

Result: Empirical evaluations show Wideformer mitigates over-aggregating and enables backbone graph attention models to achieve superior performance compared to baseline methods.

Conclusion: Wideformer provides a practical, plug-and-play approach to improve graph attention by preventing message dilution, enabling more effective utilization of informative signals.

Abstract: Graph attention has demonstrated superior performance in graph learning
tasks. However, learning from global interactions can be challenging due to the
large number of nodes. In this paper, we discover a new phenomenon termed
over-aggregating. Over-aggregating arises when a large volume of messages is
aggregated into a single node with less discrimination, leading to the dilution
of the key messages and potential information loss. To address this, we propose
Wideformer, a plug-and-play method for graph attention. Wideformer divides the
aggregation of all nodes into parallel processes and guides the model to focus
on specific subsets of these processes. The division can limit the input volume
per aggregation, avoiding message dilution and reducing information loss. The
guiding step sorts and weights the aggregation outputs, prioritizing the
informative messages. Evaluations show that Wideformer can effectively mitigate
over-aggregating. As a result, the backbone methods can focus on the
informative messages, achieving superior performance compared to baseline
methods.

### [186] [Buffer layers for Test-Time Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21271)
*Hyeongyu Kim,Geonhui Han,Dosik Hwang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces a Buffer layer for Test Time Adaptation (TTA) that preserves the backbone, avoids BN-based updates, and improves robustness to domain shift and forgetting; modular and compatible with existing TTA methods, with code released.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Normalization-based TTA updates (e.g., BatchNorm) are fragile: they depend on training-time statistics and perform poorly with small batch sizes, struggling under significant domain shifts. There is a need for online adaptation that does not compromise the pre-trained backbone or cause forgetting.

Method: Proposes a modular Buffer layer that sits alongside the backbone and is updated during test time instead of core parameters. This preserves backbone integrity, reduces catastrophic forgetting, and can be plugged into most TTA frameworks to improve domain adaptation performance.

Result: Experiments show the Buffer-based approach outperforms traditional normalization-based TTA in mitigating domain shift and demonstrates strong resilience to forgetting, with consistent gains across various architectures.

Conclusion: The Buffer layer is a versatile, plug-in solution that enhances TTA performance without altering the pre-trained backbone, making it suitable for real-world domain adaptation scenarios and easy to integrate across existing pipelines.

Abstract: In recent advancements in Test Time Adaptation (TTA), most existing
methodologies focus on updating normalization layers to adapt to the test
domain. However, the reliance on normalization-based adaptation presents key
challenges. First, normalization layers such as Batch Normalization (BN) are
highly sensitive to small batch sizes, leading to unstable and inaccurate
statistics. Moreover, normalization-based adaptation is inherently constrained
by the structure of the pre-trained model, as it relies on training-time
statistics that may not generalize well to unseen domains. These issues limit
the effectiveness of normalization-based TTA approaches, especially under
significant domain shift. In this paper, we introduce a novel paradigm based on
the concept of a Buffer layer, which addresses the fundamental limitations of
normalization layer updates. Unlike existing methods that modify the core
parameters of the model, our approach preserves the integrity of the
pre-trained backbone, inherently mitigating the risk of catastrophic forgetting
during online adaptation. Through comprehensive experimentation, we demonstrate
that our approach not only outperforms traditional methods in mitigating domain
shift and enhancing model robustness, but also exhibits strong resilience to
forgetting. Furthermore, our Buffer layer is modular and can be seamlessly
integrated into nearly all existing TTA frameworks, resulting in consistent
performance improvements across various architectures. These findings validate
the effectiveness and versatility of the proposed solution in real-world domain
adaptation scenarios. The code is available at

*Pavankumar Chandankar,Robin Burchard*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Sensor-specific PatchTST ensemble with noise-aware data augmentation yields robust HAR on WEAR dataset, outperforming baseline.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HAR systems degrade under sensor noise and perturbations; a sensor-specific, augmented training approach with transform-based ensembling can improve cross-sensor robustness and test-time perturbation handling.

Method: Train four independent PatchTST models, each for a distinct inertial sensor location, on a tampered training set where 1-second windows are augmented to mimic test-time noise (align train/test schemas as JSON-encoded 50-sample windows); apply randomized jitter, scaling, rotation, and channel dropout. At inference, average softmax probabilities across the four sensor models on the Kaggle test set to produce final labels.

Result: Macro-F1 substantially above the baseline on the private leaderboard, indicating strong robustness to real-world sensor perturbations.

Conclusion: Test-matched augmentation plus transformer-based ensembling is an effective strategy for robust HAR under noisy conditions.

Abstract: We present a noise-aware, sensor-specific ensemble approach for robust human
activity recognition on the 2nd WEAR Dataset Challenge. Our method leverages
the PatchTST transformer architecture, training four independent models-one per
inertial sensor location-on a tampered training set whose 1-second sliding
windows are augmented to mimic the test-time noise. By aligning the train and
test data schemas (JSON-encoded 50-sample windows) and applying randomized
jitter, scaling, rotation, and channel dropout, each PatchTST model learns to
generalize across real-world sensor perturbations. At inference, we compute
softmax probabilities from all four sensor models on the Kaggle test set and
average them to produce final labels. On the private leaderboard, this pipeline
achieves a macro-F1 substantially above the baseline, demonstrating that
test-matched augmentation combined with transformer-based ensembling is an
effective strategy for robust HAR under noisy conditions.

### [188] [Adaptive Data Selection for Multi-Layer Perceptron Training: A Sub-linear Value-Driven Method](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21286)
*Xiyang Zhang,Chen Liang,Haoxuan Qiu,Hongzhi Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DVC (Data Value Contribution) is a budget-aware data selection method for training MLPs that decomposes data contribution into Layer Value Contribution (LVC) and Global Value Contribution (GVC) using six metrics across quality, relevance, and distributional diversity. It uses an Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) scheme to adaptively select data sources, and demonstrates superior performance over baselines under budget constraints, with theoretical guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Data selection for neural networks, especially multi-layer perceptrons, is challenging under budget constraints due to large, multi-source, heterogeneous data. Existing methods oversimplify nonlinearities, ignore informative intermediate representations, or scale poorly. There is a need for a budget-aware, hierarchical evaluation of data value that accounts for dynamic network parameter evolution during training.

Method: DVC decomposes data contribution into Layer Value Contribution (LVC) and Global Value Contribution (GVC). It defines six metrics across three dimensions—quality, relevance, and distributional diversity—evaluated at different granularities. Efficient algorithms implement these metrics, and results are integrated with an Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) algorithm to adaptively select data sources during training, balancing exploration and exploitation as the model parameters evolve.

Result: Extensive experiments on six datasets and eight baselines show that DVC consistently outperforms existing approaches under various budget constraints, achieving superior accuracy and F1 scores, with theoretical guarantees and practical advantages for large-scale ML systems.

Conclusion: This work provides the first systematic treatment of hierarchical data evaluation for neural networks, delivering both theoretical guarantees and practical benefits for data selection in large-scale training.

Abstract: Data selection is one of the fundamental problems in neural network training,
particularly for multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) where identifying the most
valuable training samples from massive, multi-source, and heterogeneous data
sources under budget constraints poses significant challenges. Existing data
selection methods, including coreset construction, data Shapley values, and
influence functions, suffer from critical limitations: they oversimplify
nonlinear transformations, ignore informative intermediate representations in
hidden layers, or fail to scale to larger MLPs due to high computational
complexity. In response, we propose DVC (Data Value Contribution), a novel
budget-aware method for evaluating and selecting data for MLP training that
accounts for the dynamic evolution of network parameters during training. The
DVC method decomposes data contribution into Layer Value Contribution (LVC) and
Global Value Contribution (GVC), employing six carefully designed metrics and
corresponding efficient algorithms to capture data characteristics across three
dimensions--quality, relevance, and distributional diversity--at different
granularities. DVC integrates these assessments with an Upper Confidence Bound
(UCB) algorithm for adaptive source selection that balances exploration and
exploitation. Extensive experiments across six datasets and eight baselines
demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms existing approaches under
various budget constraints, achieving superior accuracy and F1 scores. Our
approach represents the first systematic treatment of hierarchical data
evaluation for neural networks, providing both theoretical guarantees and
practical advantages for large-scale machine learning systems.

### [189] [Additive Models Explained: A Computational Complexity Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21292)
*Shahaf Bassan,Michal Moshkovitz,Guy Katz*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GAM explanations have varying computational complexity; under P != NP, explanations can be easy or hard depending on input domain, component models, and task (regression/classification); additive neural representations can ease explanations in some cases; the paper maps when explanations are feasible vs hard.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Interpreting GAMs is not guaranteed by their simple structure; understanding the computational complexity of explanations is essential for practical deployment and theoretical insights.

Method: Theoretical complexity analysis under standard assumptions; analyzes multiple GAM variants, input domain structures, and explanation methods; compares regression vs classification and additive neural models; derives conditions under which explanations are tractable vs intractable.

Result: The authors reveal a diverse landscape: explanation complexity for GAMs depends on input space structure, component model type, and task; additive neural representations can simplify explanations, but only for certain explanations and domains; there are both hardness and tractable cases across settings.

Conclusion: Provides a rigorous theoretical map of when computing GAM explanations is feasible or provably hard, emphasizing the role of domain structure, model composition, and explanation method in interpretability.

Abstract: Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) are commonly considered *interpretable*
within the ML community, as their structure makes the relationship between
inputs and outputs relatively understandable. Therefore, it may seem natural to
hypothesize that obtaining meaningful explanations for GAMs could be performed
efficiently and would not be computationally infeasible. In this work, we
challenge this hypothesis by analyzing the *computational complexity* of
generating different explanations for various forms of GAMs across multiple
contexts. Our analysis reveals a surprisingly diverse landscape of both
positive and negative complexity outcomes. Particularly, under standard
complexity assumptions such as P!=NP, we establish several key findings: (1) in
stark contrast to many other common ML models, the complexity of generating
explanations for GAMs is heavily influenced by the structure of the input
space; (2) the complexity of explaining GAMs varies significantly with the
types of component models used - but interestingly, these differences only
emerge under specific input domain settings; (3) significant complexity
distinctions appear for obtaining explanations in regression tasks versus
classification tasks in GAMs; and (4) expressing complex models like neural
networks additively (e.g., as neural additive models) can make them easier to
explain, though interestingly, this benefit appears only for certain
explanation methods and input domains. Collectively, these results shed light
on the feasibility of computing diverse explanations for GAMs, offering a
rigorous theoretical picture of the conditions under which such computations
are possible or provably hard.

### [190] [A Convergence Analysis of Adaptive Optimizers under Floating-point Quantization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21314)
*Xuan Tang,Jichu Li,Difan Zou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: First theoretical framework for convergence of adaptive optimizers (Adam and Muon) under floating-point quantization of gradients, weights, and optimizer states. Shows near–full-precision convergence with mantissa length growing only logarithmically with iterations; Adam is highly sensitive to weight and second-moment quantization, Muon is more robust. Numerical experiments on synthetic and real data validate the theory.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Explain why low-precision training remains effective despite existing theory assuming exact arithmetic; address hardware-aware quantization for adaptive optimizers.

Method: Develop a convergence framework for non-convex smooth objectives with stochastic gradients under quantization of all components (gradients, weights, and momentum estimates); derive convergence rates and quantify how quantization errors affect progress; compare Adam and Muon and identify sensitivity to beta2 → 1.

Result: Derived convergence rates that stay close to full-precision when mantissa length scales logarithmically with iterations; revealed Adam’s sensitivity to weights and second-moment quantization; Muon requires weaker error control and may be more robust; numerical experiments on synthetic and real data corroborate the theory.

Conclusion: Provides a first theoretical understanding of low-precision training with adaptive optimizers, narrowing the gap between empirical success and theory; suggests Muon may offer more robust performance in quantized settings and highlights the importance of hardware-aware analysis.

Abstract: The rapid scaling of large language models (LLMs) has made low-precision
training essential for reducing memory, improving efficiency, and enabling
larger models and datasets. Existing convergence theories for adaptive
optimizers, however, assume all components are exact and neglect hardware-aware
quantization, leaving open the question of why low-precision training remains
effective. We introduce the first theoretical framework for analyzing the
convergence of adaptive optimizers, including Adam and Muon, under
floating-point quantization of gradients, weights, and optimizer states (e.g.,
moment estimates). Within this framework, we derive convergence rates on smooth
non-convex objectives under standard stochastic gradient assumptions,
explicitly characterizing how quantization errors from different components
affect convergence. We show that both algorithms retain rates close to their
full-precision counterparts provided mantissa length scales only
logarithmically with the number of iterations. Our analysis further reveals
that Adam is highly sensitive to weights and second-moment quantization due to
its reliance on $\beta_2 \to 1$, while Muon requires weaker error control and
is thus potentially more robust. These results narrow the gap between empirical
success and theoretical understanding of low-precision training methods.
Numerical experiments on synthetic and real-world data corroborate our theory.

### [191] [An Evidence-Based Post-Hoc Adjustment Framework for Anomaly Detection Under Data Contamination](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21296)
*Sukanya Patra,Souhaib Ben Taieb*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: EPHAD is a test-time adaptation framework for unsupervised anomaly detection that updates outputs of models trained on contaminated data using test-time evidence from multimodal models and classical AD tools, improving robustness across diverse datasets with publicly available code.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world anomaly datasets often contain undetected or mislabeled anomalies, and existing remedies require access to training pipelines, data, or contamination proportions—limiting practicality. A lightweight test-time approach could leverage evidence available at inference to mitigate contamination.

Method: EPHAD integrates prior knowledge from an AD model trained on contaminated data with evidence from multimodal foundation models (e.g., CLIP), plus classical methods (e.g., Latent Outlier Factor) and domain knowledge, to adapt outputs at test time without retraining. Evaluation includes a toy example and large-scale experiments across eight visual and 26 tabular datasets, plus a real-world industrial dataset; ablations analyze hyperparameters and contamination robustness; code is released.

Result: EPHAD demonstrates improved robustness to label/contamination in unsupervised anomaly detection across diverse datasets and evidence pairs, with consistent performance gains and demonstrated versatility across models. Ablations show how hyperparameters and contamination levels affect performance.

Conclusion: Test-time adaptation that fuses AD model priors with multimodal and domain evidence is a practical, effective strategy to fix contaminated training data problems in unsupervised anomaly detection, and the approach appears broadly applicable and reproducible.

Abstract: Unsupervised anomaly detection (AD) methods typically assume clean training
data, yet real-world datasets often contain undetected or mislabeled anomalies,
leading to significant performance degradation. Existing solutions require
access to the training pipelines, data or prior knowledge of the proportions of
anomalies in the data, limiting their real-world applicability. To address this
challenge, we propose EPHAD, a simple yet effective test-time adaptation
framework that updates the outputs of AD models trained on contaminated
datasets using evidence gathered at test time. Our approach integrates the
prior knowledge captured by the AD model trained on contaminated datasets with
evidence derived from multimodal foundation models like Contrastive
Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP), classical AD methods like the Latent
Outlier Factor or domain-specific knowledge. We illustrate the intuition behind
EPHAD using a synthetic toy example and validate its effectiveness through
comprehensive experiments across eight visual AD datasets, twenty-six tabular
AD datasets, and a real-world industrial AD dataset. Additionally, we conduct
an ablation study to analyse hyperparameter influence and robustness to varying
contamination levels, demonstrating the versatility and robustness of EPHAD
across diverse AD models and evidence pairs. To ensure reproducibility, our
code is publicly available at https://github.com/sukanyapatra1997/EPHAD.

### [192] [Weak-to-Strong Generalization under Distribution Shifts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21332)
*Myeongho Jeon,Jan Sobotka,Suhwan Choi,Maria Brbić*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RAVEN is a robust weak-to-strong generalization framework that jointly learns a strong model and a dynamic mixture of weak models, achieving strong out-of-distribution gains and competitive in-distribution performance while automatically identifying trustworthy supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As AI models become more capable, supervising their behavior is increasingly difficult for humans; while weak-to-strong generalization can help, naive approaches fail under distribution shifts, necessitating a robust method.

Method: Introduce RAVEN, a framework that dynamically learns optimal combinations (weights) of multiple weak models and jointly optimizes the strong model's parameters to enable robust supervision under distribution shifts.

Result: RAVEN achieves over 30% improvement on out-of-distribution tasks and matches or surpasses existing methods on in-distribution tasks across image classification, text classification, and preference alignment; it automatically assigns higher weights to more accurate weak models.

Conclusion: RAVEN provides robust weak-to-strong generalization under distribution shifts and can automatically identify trustworthy supervision, with broad applicability across modalities.

Abstract: As future superhuman models become increasingly complex, accurately
supervising their behavior may exceed human capabilities. Recent works have
demonstrated that in such scenarios, weak models can effectively supervise
strong models, a phenomenon known as weak-to-strong generalization. However, we
find that naive weak-to-strong generalization fails under distribution shifts,
often leading to worse performance of the strong model than its weak
supervisors. To address this, we propose RAVEN, a robust weak-to-strong
generalization framework that dynamically learns the optimal combinations of
weak models in addition to parameters of the strong model. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of RAVEN on image classification, text classification, and
preference alignment tasks. RAVEN outperforms alternative baselines by over 30%
on out-of-distribution tasks while matching or surpassing existing methods on
in-distribution tasks. Moreover, our results show that RAVEN assigns higher
weights to more accurate weak models, demonstrating its ability to
automatically identify trustworthy supervision.

### [193] [Amortized Variational Inference for Partial-Label Learning: A Probabilistic Approach to Label Disambiguation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21300)
*Tobias Fuchs,Nadja Klein*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A probabilistic PLL framework using amortized variational inference with neural nets to predict posterior over true labels; architecture-agnostic; achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world data is noisy and ambiguous; PLL handles instances with candidate label sets; existing methods are computationally heavy or rely on surrogate losses; a principled, scalable probabilistic approach is needed.

Method: Directly approximates the posterior over true labels via amortized variational inference. Neural networks predict variational parameters from input data, enabling efficient, architecture-agnostic inference.

Result: Theoretical analysis and extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show state-of-the-art performance in accuracy and efficiency.

Conclusion: Bridges deep-learning expressiveness with probabilistic rigor, enabling efficient, scalable PLL with an architecture-agnostic framework; demonstrates strong empirical performance.

Abstract: Real-world data is frequently noisy and ambiguous. In crowdsourcing, for
example, human annotators may assign conflicting class labels to the same
instances. Partial-label learning (PLL) addresses this challenge by training
classifiers when each instance is associated with a set of candidate labels,
only one of which is correct. While early PLL methods approximate the true
label posterior, they are often computationally intensive. Recent deep learning
approaches improve scalability but rely on surrogate losses and heuristic label
refinement. We introduce a novel probabilistic framework that directly
approximates the posterior distribution over true labels using amortized
variational inference. Our method employs neural networks to predict
variational parameters from input data, enabling efficient inference. This
approach combines the expressiveness of deep learning with the rigor of
probabilistic modeling, while remaining architecture-agnostic. Theoretical
analysis and extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets
demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in both
accuracy and efficiency.

*Aymane El Firdoussi,El Mahdi Chayti,Mohamed El Amine Seddik,Martin Jaggi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces a new class of reparameterization methods for transfer learning to improve generalization during fine-tuning, supported by Random Matrix Theory analysis and experiments including LLM fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fine-tuning with limited data can overfit; existing reparameterization approaches (e.g., LoRA) augment frozen weights to improve sample efficiency. The work aims to enhance generalization in high-dimensional settings with both theoretical backing and practical validation.

Method: Proposes a new reparameterization framework that augments a frozen weight matrix with trainable components to improve generalization. Provides theoretical analysis in a high-dimensional binary classification setting using Random Matrix Theory and validates findings through realistic experiments, including fine-tuning large language models.

Result: Theoretical analysis indicates effectiveness in high-dimensional binary classification. Empirical experiments, including fine-tuning of LLMs, corroborate the theoretical insights and demonstrate the approach's practical viability.

Conclusion: The proposed reparameterization class offers a principled way to improve generalization in fine-tuning, supported by theory and experiments, with implications for transferring knowledge to large-scale models.

Abstract: Fine-tuning has proven to be highly effective in adapting pre-trained models
to perform better on new desired tasks with minimal data samples. Among the
most widely used approaches are reparameterization methods, which update a
target module by augmenting its frozen weight matrix with an additional
trainable weight matrix. The most prominent example is Low Rank Adaption
(LoRA), which gained significant attention in recent years. In this paper, we
introduce a new class of reparameterization methods for transfer learning,
designed to enhance the generalization ability of fine-tuned models. We
establish the effectiveness of our approach in a high-dimensional binary
classification setting using tools from Random Matrix Theory, and further
validate our theoretical findings through more realistic experiments, such as
fine-tuning LLMs.

### [195] [Data as a Lever: A Neighbouring Datasets Perspective on Predictive Multiplicity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21303)
*Prakhar Ganesh,Hsiang Hsu,Golnoosh Farnadi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces a neighbouring datasets framework to study multiplicity, showing that higher inter-class overlap can reduce multiplicity due to a shared Rashomon parameter, and extends the idea to active learning and data imputation with multiplicity-aware methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how data, even a single-point difference, shapes multiplicity and to fill the data-centric gap in multiplicity research.

Method: Proposes a neighbouring datasets framework to analyze the impact of a single data point on multiplicity, proves that datasets with greater class overlap can yield lower multiplicity via a shared Rashomon parameter, and extends the framework to active learning and data imputation, including a first systematic study of multiplicity in existing algorithms and the proposal of multiplicity-aware acquisition and imputation techniques.

Result: Counterintuitive finding: more overlap between neighboring datasets leads to lower multiplicity, supported by rigorous proofs involving the Rashomon parameter; first systematic study of multiplicity across existing algorithms; development of multiplicity-aware methods for active learning and data imputation.

Conclusion: Data properties strongly influence multiplicity, challenging intuition about data diversity; the neighbouring datasets perspective enables data-centric strategies (multiplicity-aware acquisition and imputation) to control and exploit multiplicity in practical settings.

Abstract: Multiplicity -- the existence of distinct models with comparable performance
-- has received growing attention in recent years. While prior work has largely
emphasized modelling choices, the critical role of data in shaping multiplicity
has been comparatively overlooked. In this work, we introduce a neighbouring
datasets framework to examine the most granular case: the impact of a
single-data-point difference on multiplicity. Our analysis yields a seemingly
counterintuitive finding: neighbouring datasets with greater inter-class
distribution overlap exhibit lower multiplicity. This reversal of conventional
expectations arises from a shared Rashomon parameter, and we substantiate it
with rigorous proofs.
  Building on this foundation, we extend our framework to two practical
domains: active learning and data imputation. For each, we establish natural
extensions of the neighbouring datasets perspective, conduct the first
systematic study of multiplicity in existing algorithms, and finally, propose
novel multiplicity-aware methods, namely, multiplicity-aware data acquisition
strategies for active learning and multiplicity-aware data imputation
techniques.

### [196] [Revisiting Social Welfare in Bandits: UCB is (Nearly) All You Need](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21312)
*Dhruv Sarkar,Nishant Pandey,Sayak Ray Chowdhury*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A simple algorithm — an initial uniform exploration phase followed by a standard UCB — achieves near-optimal Nash regret in stochastic bandits under mild assumptions, and extends to a broad family of fairness metrics (p-mean regret).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address fairness in bandit rewards across a population (e.g., patients). Traditional regret measures ignore fairness; Nash regret aligns with Nash social welfare but has been hard to achieve under general distributions due to strong assumptions. The work aims for fairness-aware regret with minimal assumptions.

Method: Empirically, start with uniform exploration, then switch to a standard Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) algorithm. The theoretical analysis uses additive Hoeffding bounds (not multiplicative concentration) and extends to sub-Gaussian rewards. Generalizes to p-mean regret for a broad class of fairness metrics.

Result: Demonstrates near-optimal Nash regret with the proposed exploration+UCB scheme under mild conditions, and shows that the same approach achieves near-optimal regret for the entire family of p-mean fairness metrics (for all p). Improves over prior work that required restrictive assumptions (multiplicative inequalities, non-negative bounded rewards) and often yielded suboptimal guarantees.

Conclusion: A simple, robust algorithm suffices to attain fairness-aware regret guarantees (Nash regret and p-mean regret) under broad reward distributions, without the strong assumptions of prior methods. This broadens applicability to settings like Gaussian or sub-Gaussian rewards and supports a range of fairness metrics.

Abstract: Regret in stochastic multi-armed bandits traditionally measures the
difference between the highest reward and either the arithmetic mean of
accumulated rewards or the final reward. These conventional metrics often fail
to address fairness among agents receiving rewards, particularly in settings
where rewards are distributed across a population, such as patients in clinical
trials. To address this, a recent body of work has introduced Nash regret,
which evaluates performance via the geometric mean of accumulated rewards,
aligning with the Nash social welfare function known for satisfying fairness
axioms.
  To minimize Nash regret, existing approaches require specialized algorithm
designs and strong assumptions, such as multiplicative concentration
inequalities and bounded, non-negative rewards, making them unsuitable for even
Gaussian reward distributions. We demonstrate that an initial uniform
exploration phase followed by a standard Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) algorithm
achieves near-optimal Nash regret, while relying only on additive Hoeffding
bounds, and naturally extending to sub-Gaussian rewards. Furthermore, we
generalize the algorithm to a broad class of fairness metrics called the
$p$-mean regret, proving (nearly) optimal regret bounds uniformly across all
$p$ values. This is in contrast to prior work, which made extremely restrictive
assumptions on the bandit instances and even then achieved suboptimal regret
bounds.

*Stefan Kraft,Andreas Theissler,Vera Wienhausen-Wilke,Gjergji Kasneci,Hendrik Lensch*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Transparent, application-grounded AI assistance, especially when used as a post-hoc QC step, improves event-level accuracy by ~30% over black-box guidance, while start-time guidance is faster; WB transparency is preferred; AI collaboration reduces inter-rater variability; overall increases trust and acceptance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bridge the gap between predictive performance and clinical trust by studying how the type and timing of AI assistance affect performance, workflow, and user experience in clinical practice, using a realistic sleep medicine scoring task.

Method: Eight professional sleep medicine practitioners scored nocturnal arousal events in polysomnographic data under three conditions (manual scoring, black-box AI assistance, transparent white-box AI assistance), with assistance provided either at the start of scoring or during post-hoc quality-control (QC). The study evaluated event-level and count-based performance relative to the clinical standard used to train the AI, time requirements, and user experience, using a within-subject design.

Result: Both AI-assisted and human-AI teams outperform unaided experts; collaboration reduces inter-rater variability. Transparent WB assistance as a targeted QC step yields median event-level performance improvements of ~30% over BB assistance, and QC timing further improves count-based outcomes. WB and QC approaches increase scoring time, while start-time assistance is faster and preferred by most participants. Seven of eight participants favored transparency and willingness to adopt with minor or no modifications.

Conclusion: Strategically timed transparent AI assistance can balance accuracy and clinical efficiency, providing a promising pathway toward trustworthy AI integration and user acceptance in clinical workflows.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) systems increasingly match or surpass human
experts in biomedical signal interpretation. However, their effective
integration into clinical practice requires more than high predictive accuracy.
Clinicians must discern \textit{when} and \textit{why} to trust algorithmic
recommendations. This work presents an application-grounded user study with
eight professional sleep medicine practitioners, who score nocturnal arousal
events in polysomnographic data under three conditions: (i) manual scoring,
(ii) black-box (BB) AI assistance, and (iii) transparent white-box (WB) AI
assistance. Assistance is provided either from the \textit{start} of scoring or
as a post-hoc quality-control (\textit{QC}) review. We systematically evaluate
how the type and timing of assistance influence event-level and clinically most
relevant count-based performance, time requirements, and user experience. When
evaluated against the clinical standard used to train the AI, both AI and
human-AI teams significantly outperform unaided experts, with collaboration
also reducing inter-rater variability. Notably, transparent AI assistance
applied as a targeted QC step yields median event-level performance
improvements of approximately 30\% over black-box assistance, and QC timing
further enhances count-based outcomes. While WB and QC approaches increase the
time required for scoring, start-time assistance is faster and preferred by
most participants. Participants overwhelmingly favor transparency, with seven
out of eight expressing willingness to adopt the system with minor or no
modifications. In summary, strategically timed transparent AI assistance
effectively balances accuracy and clinical efficiency, providing a promising
pathway toward trustworthy AI integration and user acceptance in clinical
workflows.

### [198] [Leverage Unlearning to Sanitize LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21322)
*Antoine Boutet,Lucas Magnana*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SANI is an unlearning framework that mitigates memorization of sensitive data in language models by a two-phase process (erasure of last-layer neurons and repair via cautious fine-tuning). It reduces regurgitated sensitive information with few extra training epochs, enabling sanitized models for sharing in sensitive domains such as medicine.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fine-tuned LLMs on domain-specific data can memorize sensitive details. Sanitizing such models without costly retraining is important for privacy and data governance, enabling sharing while preserving utility.

Method: Two-phase unlearning: 1) erasure by resetting certain last-layer neurons to disrupt memorization of fine-grained data; 2) repair via fine-tuning with constraints to avoid memorizing sensitive information. Evaluation on a medical-data-fine-tuned model and a standard pre-trained model, removing direct/indirect identifiers and defined confidential terms.

Result: With only a few unlearning epochs, memorization/regurgitation of sensitive data is drastically reduced; the model is sanitized while preserving utility to a large extent.

Conclusion: SANI offers a practical approach for sanitizing large models in sensitive industries (e.g., hospitals) before sharing, reducing privacy risk with modest compute.

Abstract: Pre-trained large language models (LLMs) are becoming useful for various
tasks. To improve their performance on certain tasks, it is necessary to
fine-tune them on specific data corpora (e.g., medical reports, business data).
These specialized data corpora may contain sensitive data (e.g., personal or
confidential data) that will be memorized by the model and likely to be
regurgitated during its subsequent use. This memorization of sensitive
information by the model poses a significant privacy or confidentiality issue.
To remove this memorization and sanitize the model without requiring costly
additional fine-tuning on a secured data corpus, we propose SANI. SANI is an
unlearning approach to sanitize language models. It relies on both an erasure
and repair phases that 1) reset certain neurons in the last layers of the model
to disrupt the memorization of fine-grained information, and then 2) fine-tune
the model while avoiding memorizing sensitive information. We comprehensively
evaluate SANI to sanitize both a model fine-tuned and specialized with medical
data by removing directly and indirectly identifiers from the memorization of
the model, and a standard pre-trained model by removing specific terms defined
as confidential information from the model. Results show that with only few
additional epochs of unlearning, the model is sanitized and the number of
regurgitations is drastically reduced. This approach can be particularly useful
for hospitals or other industries that have already spent significant resources
training models on large datasets and wish to sanitize them before sharing.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LLMs show non-monotonic, learning-driven representational differentiation modulated by vocabulary interference, aligning with the Non-Monotonic Plasticity hypothesis and highlighting global competition in memory-like changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To test cognitive neuroscience learning theories in scalable AI models and explore how representations reorganize under associative learning, using the Non-Monotonic Plasticity framework and vocabulary interference.

Method: Adapt a cognitive neuroscience associative-learning paradigm to six LLMs; measure representational change across learning; manipulate overlap with a broad vocabulary to quantify interference; leverage LLM controllability to study competition.

Result: Non-monotonic differentiation observed: moderately similar items differentiate after learning; higher vocabulary interference amplifies differentiation; findings align with the Non-Monotonic Plasticity hypothesis and demonstrate LLMs as models of memory-like representational dynamics.

Conclusion: LLMs are useful, general models for studying memory-like representational dynamics and can generate hypotheses about brain memory reorganization; representational change is influenced by item similarity and global lexical competition.

Abstract: Associative learning--forming links between co-occurring items--is
fundamental to human cognition, reshaping internal representations in complex
ways. Testing hypotheses on how representational changes occur in biological
systems is challenging, but large language models (LLMs) offer a scalable
alternative. Building on LLMs' in-context learning, we adapt a cognitive
neuroscience associative learning paradigm and investigate how representations
evolve across six models. Our initial findings reveal a non-monotonic pattern
consistent with the Non-Monotonic Plasticity Hypothesis, with moderately
similar items differentiating after learning. Leveraging the controllability of
LLMs, we further show that this differentiation is modulated by the overlap of
associated items with the broader vocabulary--a factor we term vocabulary
interference, capturing how new associations compete with prior knowledge. We
find that higher vocabulary interference amplifies differentiation, suggesting
that representational change is influenced by both item similarity and global
competition. Our findings position LLMs not only as powerful tools for studying
representational dynamics in human-like learning systems, but also as
accessible and general computational models for generating new hypotheses about
the principles underlying memory reorganization in the brain.

*Vikas Kanaujia,Vipul Arora*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ScoreNF is a score-based normalizing-flow framework with an Independent Metropolis-Hastings sampler for unbiased sampling from unnormalized distributions, effective with small training ensembles, and capable of diagnosing mode-covering vs mode-collapse; validated on 2D MOG distributions and the phi^4 lattice field theory.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Unnormalized distributions are central in modeling complex physical systems. Traditional MCMC methods suffer from slow convergence, critical slowing down, poor mode mixing, and high autocorrelation. Likelihood-based/adversarial models are data-hungry and can exhibit mode-covering or mode-collapse. A scalable, unbiased sampling approach for unnormalized targets is needed.

Method: ScoreNF combines a normalizing-flow architecture with score-based learning and integrates an Independent Metropolis-Hastings (IMH) step to sample from the unnormalized target. It maintains high performance even with small training ensembles and includes a procedure to assess mode-covering and mode-collapse. Evaluation is conducted on synthetic 2D mixtures (MOG-4, MOG-8) and the high-dimensional phi^4 lattice field theory distribution.

Result: ScoreNF achieves high-quality sampling with small training ensembles and demonstrates effectiveness on both synthetic and high-dimensional physics distributions, validating its practical utility for sampling unnormalized targets.

Conclusion: The proposed ScoreNF framework provides efficient, unbiased sampling from unnormalized distributions, reduces dependence on large training datasets, and offers a mechanism to diagnose mode-covering versus mode-collapse, with demonstrated applicability to both low-dimensional and high-dimensional physics-inspired distributions.

Abstract: Unnormalized probability distributions are central to modeling complex
physical systems across various scientific domains. Traditional sampling
methods, such as Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), often suffer from slow
convergence, critical slowing down, poor mode mixing, and high autocorrelation.
In contrast, likelihood-based and adversarial machine learning models, though
effective, are heavily data-driven, requiring large datasets and often
encountering mode covering and mode collapse. In this work, we propose ScoreNF,
a score-based learning framework built on the Normalizing Flow (NF)
architecture, integrated with an Independent Metropolis-Hastings (IMH) module,
enabling efficient and unbiased sampling from unnormalized target
distributions. We show that ScoreNF maintains high performance even with small
training ensembles, thereby reducing reliance on computationally expensive
MCMC-generated training data. We also present a method for assessing
mode-covering and mode-collapse behaviours. We validate our method on synthetic
2D distributions (MOG-4 and MOG-8) and the high-dimensional $\phi^4$ lattice
field theory distribution, demonstrating its effectiveness for sampling tasks.

of Atari100k and DeepMind Control Visual Benchmark tasks, confirming the
original DreamerV3 results and showing that our extensions lead to faster
learning and lower dynamics model loss, particularly in sparse-reward settings.

### [202] [Robust Yield Curve Estimation for Mortgage Bonds Using Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21347)
*Sina Molavipour,Alireza M. Javid,Cassie Ye,Björn Löfdahl,Mikhail Nechaev*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Neural-network based daily yield-curve estimation for small mortgage markets with a smoothness-regularized loss, yielding more robust curves than NSS/KR; supports domain constraints like risk-free alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses instability and overfitting of traditional yield-curve methods (bootstrap, Nelson-Siegel) in sparse, noisy data environments, enabling robust per-day yield-curve estimation for small markets.

Method: A neural network framework that estimates the yield curve independently for each day, introducing a loss function that enforces smoothness and stability and can incorporate domain-specific constraints (e.g., alignment with risk-free benchmarks).

Result: Empirical evaluation on Swedish mortgage bonds shows the proposed method yields more robust and stable yield curves than Nelson-Siegel-Svensson (NSS) and Kernel-Ridge (KR).

Conclusion: The framework improves robustness and stability of yield-curve estimates and offers flexible constraint integration to balance smoothness and accuracy per practitioner needs.

Abstract: Robust yield curve estimation is crucial in fixed-income markets for accurate
instrument pricing, effective risk management, and informed trading strategies.
Traditional approaches, including the bootstrapping method and parametric
Nelson-Siegel models, often struggle with overfitting or instability issues,
especially when underlying bonds are sparse, bond prices are volatile, or
contain hard-to-remove noise. In this paper, we propose a neural networkbased
framework for robust yield curve estimation tailored to small mortgage bond
markets. Our model estimates the yield curve independently for each day and
introduces a new loss function to enforce smoothness and stability, addressing
challenges associated with limited and noisy data. Empirical results on Swedish
mortgage bonds demonstrate that our approach delivers more robust and stable
yield curve estimates compared to existing methods such as
Nelson-Siegel-Svensson (NSS) and Kernel-Ridge (KR). Furthermore, the framework
allows for the integration of domain-specific constraints, such as alignment
with risk-free benchmarks, enabling practitioners to balance the trade-off
between smoothness and accuracy according to their needs.

### [203] [Compositional Monte Carlo Tree Diffusion for Extendable Planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21361)
*Jaesik Yoon,Hyeonseo Cho,Sungjin Ahn*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: C-MCTD extends Monte Carlo Tree Diffusion by planning over full plan compositions rather than single trajectories, via three components: Online Composer (global search), Distributed Composer (parallel exploration), and Preplan Composer (cached plan graphs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MCTD is limited by local planning confined to individual trajectories and fixed training trajectory lengths; there is a need for global context and scalable planning to compose longer, coherent plans.

Method: Three components: Online Composer performs globally-aware planning over entire plan compositions; Distributed Composer enables parallel exploration from multiple starting points to reduce search complexity; Preplan Composer caches plan graphs to accelerate inference.

Result: The abstract does not report empirical results; it proposes a framework and components without presenting experimental findings.

Conclusion: C-MCTD is a proposed framework to enable globally-aware, scalable planning by composing entire plan graphs, with caching to speed inference; needs empirical validation.

Abstract: Monte Carlo Tree Diffusion (MCTD) integrates diffusion models with structured
tree search to enable effective trajectory exploration through stepwise
reasoning. However, MCTD remains fundamentally limited by training trajectory
lengths. While periodic replanning allows plan concatenation for longer plan
generation, the planning process remains locally confined, as MCTD searches
within individual trajectories without access to global context. We propose
Compositional Monte Carlo Tree Diffusion (C-MCTD), a framework that elevates
planning from individual trajectory optimization to reasoning over complete
plan compositions. C-MCTD introduces three complementary components: (1) Online
Composer, which performs globally-aware planning by searching across entire
plan compositions; (2) Distributed Composer, which reduces search complexity
through parallel exploration from multiple starting points; and (3) Preplan
Composer, which accelerates inference by leveraging cached plan graphs.

*Zihao Fu,Ryan Brown,Shun Shao,Kai Rawal,Eoin Delaney,Chris Russell*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Post-hoc prompt-embedding debiasing for diffusion models using Fair PCA to reduce demographic information while preserving semantic content, with noise injection and cross-demographic projection; improves fairness across gender/race with modest image quality trade-offs; model-agnostic and scalable.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models exhibit societal biases along demographic attributes (gender, race). A post-hoc, model-agnostic debiasing method is needed that does not retrain core models and preserves prompt fidelity.

Method: Project CLIP-based prompt embeddings into a debiased subspace using Fair Principal Component Analysis (Fair PCA); apply empirical noise injection to strengthen debiasing; introduce a unified cross-demographic projection to debias multiple attributes simultaneously; designed to be post-hoc and model-agnostic.

Result: Empirical evaluation across gender, race, and intersectional settings shows significant fairness improvements with only moderate losses in image quality and prompt fidelity; outperforms existing post-hoc methods.

Conclusion: FairImagen provides a simple, scalable, and model-agnostic post-hoc debiasing framework for text-to-image generation that reduces demographic biases while maintaining semantic content and reasonable image quality.

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models, such as Stable Diffusion, have demonstrated
remarkable capabilities in generating high-quality and diverse images from
natural language prompts. However, recent studies reveal that these models
often replicate and amplify societal biases, particularly along demographic
attributes like gender and race. In this paper, we introduce FairImagen
(https://github.com/fuzihaofzh/FairImagen), a post-hoc debiasing framework that
operates on prompt embeddings to mitigate such biases without retraining or
modifying the underlying diffusion model. Our method integrates Fair Principal
Component Analysis to project CLIP-based input embeddings into a subspace that
minimizes group-specific information while preserving semantic content. We
further enhance debiasing effectiveness through empirical noise injection and
propose a unified cross-demographic projection method that enables simultaneous
debiasing across multiple demographic attributes. Extensive experiments across
gender, race, and intersectional settings demonstrate that FairImagen
significantly improves fairness with a moderate trade-off in image quality and
prompt fidelity. Our framework outperforms existing post-hoc methods and offers
a simple, scalable, and model-agnostic solution for equitable text-to-image
generation.

### [205] [Randomized Neural Network with Adaptive Forward Regularization for Online Task-free Class Incremental Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21367)
*Junda Wang,Minghui Hu,Ning Li,Abdulaziz Al-Ali,Ponnuthurai Nagaratnam Suganthan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Presents a randomized neural network framework with forward regularization for online task-free class-incremental learning (OTCIL). It introduces edRVFL-kF with one-pass closed-form updates and adaptive learning rates, plus a Bayes-based extension edRVFL-kF-Bayes to self-tune regularization. Empirically validated on 2 image datasets, showing reduced forgetting without replay and improved decision-making.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: OTCIL faces non-i.i.d. batch streams and absence of boundary prompts, causing forgetting and poor adaptability. There is a need for efficient, non-replay-based, incremental learning methods that can handle long task streams.

Method: A general framework using randomized neural networks with forward regularization (-F) embedded in recursive convex optimization. Derives an ensemble deep RVFL (edRVFL) with adjustable forward regularization (-kF) for one-pass incremental updates. Learns with variable learning rates and avoids replay. Extends to plug-and-play edRVFL-kF-Bayes where multiple sub-learners have ks determined adaptively via Bayesian learning.

Result: Empirical evaluation on 2 image datasets using 6 metrics demonstrates dynamic performance gains, ablation evidence, and compatibility tests. The -kF and -kF-Bayes variants outperform the canonical ridge approach in OTCIL and show effective resistance to forgetting without data replay.

Conclusion: The proposed -F framework and its edRVFL-kF(-Bayes) variants offer a practical, forgetting-resistant solution for OTCIL, enabling one-pass incremental updates without replay and self-adaptive regularization. The approach shows promise but may benefit from broader datasets and theoretical guarantees.

Abstract: Class incremental learning (CIL) requires an agent to learn distinct tasks
consecutively with knowledge retention against forgetting. Problems impeding
the practical applications of CIL methods are twofold: (1) non-i.i.d batch
streams and no boundary prompts to update, known as the harsher online
task-free CIL (OTCIL) scenario; (2) CIL methods suffer from memory loss in
learning long task streams, as shown in Fig. 1 (a). To achieve efficient
decision-making and decrease cumulative regrets during the OTCIL process, a
randomized neural network (Randomized NN) with forward regularization (-F) is
proposed to resist forgetting and enhance learning performance. This general
framework integrates unsupervised knowledge into recursive convex optimization,
has no learning dissipation, and can outperform the canonical ridge style (-R)
in OTCIL. Based on this framework, we derive the algorithm of the ensemble deep
random vector functional link network (edRVFL) with adjustable forward
regularization (-kF), where k mediates the intensity of the intervention.
edRVFL-kF generates one-pass closed-form incremental updates and variable
learning rates, effectively avoiding past replay and catastrophic forgetting
while achieving superior performance. Moreover, to curb unstable penalties
caused by non-i.i.d and mitigate intractable tuning of -kF in OTCIL, we improve
it to the plug-and-play edRVFL-kF-Bayes, enabling all hard ks in multiple
sub-learners to be self-adaptively determined based on Bayesian learning.
Experiments were conducted on 2 image datasets including 6 metrics, dynamic
performance, ablation tests, and compatibility, which distinctly validates the
efficacy of our OTCIL frameworks with -kF-Bayes and -kF styles.

### [206] [Disentangled Representation Learning via Modular Compositional Bias](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21402)
*Whie Jung,Dong Hoon Lee,Seunghoon Hong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a compositional DRL framework that uses factor-specific mixing rules to disentangle attributes, objects, or both by remixing latents and enforcing a prior realism loss plus a compositional consistency loss, enabling flexible, architecture-agnostic disentanglement including joint global style–object disentanglement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current DRL methods rely on factor-specific objectives or architectures, causing overhead when new factors of variation do not align with prior assumptions (e.g., independence or exclusivity) or when multiple factors coexist. A modular, general inductive bias decoupled from objectives/architectures can adapt to different factor recombination rules and simplify disentanglement.

Method: Introduce a compositional bias with factor-specific mixing rules that randomly remix latents. Train an encoder with two losses: (i) a prior loss ensuring each remix decodes to a realistic image, and (ii) a compositional consistency loss (as in Wiedemer et al.) aligning the composite image with its composite latent, enabling the encoder to recover the underlying factor structure reflected by the mixing strategy.

Result: The approach achieves competitive disentanglement performance on attributes and objects and uniquely enables joint disentanglement of global style and objects beyond traditional DRL setups.

Conclusion: A general, modular inductive bias decoupled from objectives/architectures; by simply adjusting the mixing strategy it can disentangle attributes, objects, or both, without changing objectives or network architectures.

Abstract: Recent disentangled representation learning (DRL) methods heavily rely on
factor specific strategies-either learning objectives for attributes or model
architectures for objects-to embed inductive biases. Such divergent approaches
result in significant overhead when novel factors of variation do not align
with prior assumptions, such as statistical independence or spatial
exclusivity, or when multiple factors coexist, as practitioners must redesign
architectures or objectives. To address this, we propose a compositional bias,
a modular inductive bias decoupled from both objectives and architectures. Our
key insight is that different factors obey distinct recombination rules in the
data distribution: global attributes are mutually exclusive, e.g., a face has
one nose, while objects share a common support (any subset of objects can
co-exist). We therefore randomly remix latents according to factor-specific
rules, i.e., a mixing strategy, and force the encoder to discover whichever
factor structure the mixing strategy reflects through two complementary
objectives: (i) a prior loss that ensures every remix decodes into a realistic
image, and (ii) the compositional consistency loss introduced by Wiedemer et
al. (arXiv:2310.05327), which aligns each composite image with its
corresponding composite latent. Under this general framework, simply adjusting
the mixing strategy enables disentanglement of attributes, objects, and even
both, without modifying the objectives or architectures. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method shows competitive performance in both attribute and
object disentanglement, and uniquely achieves joint disentanglement of global
style and objects. Code is available at

### [207] [Generative Correlation Manifolds: Generating Synthetic Data with Preserved Higher-Order Correlations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21610)
*Jens E. d'Hondt,Wieger R. Punter,Odysseas Papapetrou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes Generative Correlation Manifolds (GCM) that uses the Cholesky decomposition of a target correlation matrix to generate synthetic data. The method claims to preserve the entire correlation structure—from pairwise to higher-order interactions—via a mathematical proof, offering privacy and robustness benefits, but empirical validation is not shown in the abstract.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address growing needs for data privacy and robust ML by generating synthetic data that faithfully preserves complex correlations. Current methods often capture only simple statistics and fail for multi-variable interactions, limiting usefulness for sophisticated modeling tasks.

Method: Introduces Generative Correlation Manifolds (GCM): a computationally efficient approach that uses the Cholesky decomposition of a target correlation matrix to produce data that preserves the correlation structure of the source dataset. The claim is that this preserves all correlations, including higher-order interactions, through a mathematical construction.

Result: The abstract presents a theoretical contribution with a proof-for-correlation-structure preservation and emphasizes computational efficiency. It argues for applications in privacy-preserving data sharing, robust model training, and simulation, but provides no empirical results.

Conclusion: GCM offers a novel direction in synthetic data generation focused on correlation manifolds, potentially advancing privacy and robust modeling. Validation on real data and scrutiny of the higher-order interaction claim are needed to establish practical effectiveness.

Abstract: The increasing need for data privacy and the demand for robust machine
learning models have fueled the development of synthetic data generation
techniques. However, current methods often succeed in replicating simple
summary statistics but fail to preserve both the pairwise and higher-order
correlation structure of the data that define the complex, multi-variable
interactions inherent in real-world systems. This limitation can lead to
synthetic data that is superficially realistic but fails when used for
sophisticated modeling tasks. In this white paper, we introduce Generative
Correlation Manifolds (GCM), a computationally efficient method for generating
synthetic data. The technique uses Cholesky decomposition of a target
correlation matrix to produce datasets that, by mathematical proof, preserve
the entire correlation structure -- from simple pairwise relationships to
higher-order interactions -- of the source dataset. We argue that this method
provides a new approach to synthetic data generation with potential
applications in privacy-preserving data sharing, robust model training, and
simulation.

*Dong Bok Lee,Aoxuan Silvia Zhang,Byungjoo Kim,Junhyeon Park,Steven Adriaensen,Juho Lee,Sung Ju Hwang,Hae Beom Lee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A utility-guided, cost-sensitive extension of freeze-thaw Bayesian optimization for hyperparameter optimization. It introduces a user-estimated utility over cost vs. performance, with a new acquisition function and stopping rule to stop when expected utility peaks, and uses transfer learning to tailor the surrogate model. Empirically, it outperforms existing freeze-thaw BO and transfer-BO baselines on multi-fidelity HPO benchmarks, with better cost-per-performance trade-offs. Code is released.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable early stopping in cost-sensitive hyperparameter optimization by quantifying user preferences via a utility function, and to improve efficiency with transfer-learning-enhanced surrogates within the freeze-thaw Bayesian optimization framework.

Method: Augment the freeze-thaw BO with a utility function that captures the trade-off between cost and performance, estimated from user preferences. Introduce a novel acquisition function and stopping criterion that favor configurations maximizing expected utility in future iterations and allow automatic stopping near peak utility. Employ transfer learning to build a specialized surrogate model for the cost-sensitive HPO problem to boost sample efficiency. Validate on established multi-fidelity HPO benchmarks and compare against baseline freeze-thaw BO and transfer-BO methods. Publicly release code.

Result: The proposed method achieves a better trade-off between cost and performance and outperforms the referenced baselines on multi-fidelity HPO benchmarks.

Conclusion: Integrating a user-defined utility into freeze-thaw BO with transfer-learned surrogates yields more cost-efficient HPO by prioritizing trajectory improvements that maximize expected utility and enabling automatic stopping around the optimum utility.

Abstract: In this paper, we address the problem of \emph{cost-sensitive} hyperparameter
optimization (HPO) built upon freeze-thaw Bayesian optimization (BO).
Specifically, we assume a scenario where users want to early-stop the HPO
process when the expected performance improvement is not satisfactory with
respect to the additional computational cost. Motivated by this scenario, we
introduce \emph{utility} in the freeze-thaw framework, a function describing
the trade-off between the cost and performance that can be estimated from the
user's preference data. This utility function, combined with our novel
acquisition function and stopping criterion, allows us to dynamically continue
training the configuration that we expect to maximally improve the utility in
the future, and also automatically stop the HPO process around the maximum
utility. Further, we improve the sample efficiency of existing freeze-thaw
methods with transfer learning to develop a specialized surrogate model for the
cost-sensitive HPO problem. We validate our algorithm on established
multi-fidelity HPO benchmarks and show that it outperforms all the previous
freeze-thaw BO and transfer-BO baselines we consider, while achieving a
significantly better trade-off between the cost and performance. Our code is
publicly available at https://github.com/db-Lee/CFBO.

*Faisal Hamman,Pasan Dissanayake,Yanjun Fu,Sanghamitra Dutta*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CoD uses counterfactual explanations to enable few-shot task-aware knowledge distillation, achieving strong results with 8–512 samples by better mapping the teacher's decision boundary.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In task-aware distillation, high data requirements hinder practical deployment. CFEs provide informative probes near the teacher's decision boundary and enable data-efficient learning.

Method: Infuse counterfactual explanations into distillation: generate minimally perturbed inputs that flip the teacher's output; use these CFEs to guide the student to mimic the teacher's boundary. The authors provide statistical and geometric theoretical guarantees.

Result: Empirical results across diverse datasets and LLMs show CoD outperforms standard distillation in few-shot regimes (as low as 8–512 samples), using about half the data of baselines while maintaining or improving accuracy.

Conclusion: Counterfactual explanations serve as effective knowledge probes, enabling data-efficient task-aware distillation. CoD offers a principled, theoretically backed approach with strong empirical gains in low-data scenarios.

Abstract: Knowledge distillation is a promising approach to transfer capabilities from
complex teacher models to smaller, resource-efficient student models that can
be deployed easily, particularly in task-aware scenarios. However, existing
methods of task-aware distillation typically require substantial quantities of
data which may be unavailable or expensive to obtain in many practical
scenarios. In this paper, we address this challenge by introducing a novel
strategy called Counterfactual-explanation-infused Distillation CoD for
few-shot task-aware knowledge distillation by systematically infusing
counterfactual explanations. Counterfactual explanations (CFEs) refer to inputs
that can flip the output prediction of the teacher model with minimum
perturbation. Our strategy CoD leverages these CFEs to precisely map the
teacher's decision boundary with significantly fewer samples. We provide
theoretical guarantees for motivating the role of CFEs in distillation, from
both statistical and geometric perspectives. We mathematically show that CFEs
can improve parameter estimation by providing more informative examples near
the teacher's decision boundary. We also derive geometric insights on how CFEs
effectively act as knowledge probes, helping the students mimic the teacher's
decision boundaries more effectively than standard data. We perform experiments
across various datasets and LLMs to show that CoD outperforms standard
distillation approaches in few-shot regimes (as low as 8-512 samples). Notably,
CoD only uses half of the original samples used by the baselines, paired with
their corresponding CFEs and still improves performance.

*Tala Aljaafari,Varun Kanade,Philip Torr,Christian Schroeder de Witt*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DEEDEE is a lightweight RL out-of-distribution detector using two statistics: episodewise mean and an RBF kernel similarity to a training summary. It matches or surpasses existing detectors while offering huge computational savings (~600x fewer FLOPs/wall-time) and about 5% absolute accuracy gains, suggesting that low-order statistics can capture many anomaly types in RL trajectories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reinforcement learning in safety-critical settings suffers from brittleness under distribution shift. There is a need for effective OOD detection in RL time series that is both accurate and computationally efficient to enable deployment.

Method: DEEDEE employs a two-statistic detector using (1) an episodewise mean and (2) an RBF kernel similarity to a training summary. This lightweight, representation-free approach targets compact, global and local deviations in RL trajectories, avoiding heavy representation learning.

Result: DEEDEE matches or surpasses contemporary RL OOD detectors across standard OOD suites, with a ~600-fold reduction in compute (FLOPs / wall-time) and an average ~5 percentage point absolute accuracy gain over strong baselines.

Conclusion: The results suggest that diverse anomaly types in RL trajectories imprint on a small set of low-order statistics. This points to a compact, practical foundation for OOD detection in complex RL environments, challenging the necessity of heavy representation-heavy pipelines.

Abstract: Deploying reinforcement learning (RL) in safety-critical settings is
constrained by brittleness under distribution shift. We study
out-of-distribution (OOD) detection for RL time series and introduce DEEDEE, a
two-statistic detector that revisits representation-heavy pipelines with a
minimal alternative. DEEDEE uses only an episodewise mean and an RBF kernel
similarity to a training summary, capturing complementary global and local
deviations. Despite its simplicity, DEEDEE matches or surpasses contemporary
detectors across standard RL OOD suites, delivering a 600-fold reduction in
compute (FLOPs / wall-time) and an average 5% absolute accuracy gain over
strong baselines. Conceptually, our results indicate that diverse anomaly types
often imprint on RL trajectories through a small set of low-order statistics,
suggesting a compact foundation for OOD detection in complex environments.

### [211] [Self-diffusion for Solving Inverse Problems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21417)
*Guanxiong Luo,Shoujin Huang,Yanlong Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Self-diffusion is a pretrained-free, diffusion-inspired framework for solving inverse problems that uses an online-trained untrained self-denoiser to iteratively refine solutions without pretrained score models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Eliminate reliance on pretrained generative models for inverse problems, enabling flexible handling of arbitrary forward operators and noisy observations while maintaining competitive performance.

Method: At each iteration, add noise to the current estimate and train a single untrained convolutional network (self-denoiser) via a data-fidelity loss to predict the clean solution from the noisy estimate. No external score functions or denoisers are used. The process leverages the spectral bias of neural networks and a scheduled noise process to progressively refine the solution, making the approach adaptable to various linear forward operators.

Result: Demonstrates competitive or superior performance on a variety of linear inverse problems compared with existing methods.

Conclusion: Provides a self-contained, pretrained-free framework for inverse problems that adapts to arbitrary forward operators and noisy observations, offering a flexible and broadly applicable alternative to pretrained diffusion models.

Abstract: We propose self-diffusion, a novel framework for solving inverse problems
without relying on pretrained generative models. Traditional diffusion-based
approaches require training a model on a clean dataset to learn to reverse the
forward noising process. This model is then used to sample clean solutions --
corresponding to posterior sampling from a Bayesian perspective -- that are
consistent with the observed data under a specific task. In contrast,
self-diffusion introduces a self-contained iterative process that alternates
between noising and denoising steps to progressively refine its estimate of the
solution. At each step of self-diffusion, noise is added to the current
estimate, and a self-denoiser, which is a single untrained convolutional
network randomly initialized from scratch, is continuously trained for certain
iterations via a data fidelity loss to predict the solution from the noisy
estimate. Essentially, self-diffusion exploits the spectral bias of neural
networks and modulates it through a scheduled noise process. Without relying on
pretrained score functions or external denoisers, this approach still remains
adaptive to arbitrary forward operators and noisy observations, making it
highly flexible and broadly applicable. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach on a variety of linear inverse problems, showing that self-diffusion
achieves competitive or superior performance compared to other methods.

### [212] [A Rapid Physics-Informed Machine Learning Framework Based on Extreme Learning Machine for Inverse Stefan Problems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21426)
*Pei-Zhi Zhuang,Ming-Yue Yang,Fei Ren,Hong-Ya Yue,He Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces physics-informed extreme learning machine (PIELM) for inverse Stefan problems, replacing deep networks with an ELM to solve moving-boundary PDEs efficiently; achieves substantial accuracy gains and large training-time reductions versus PINNs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PINNs applied to Stefan problems suffer hyperparameter sensitivity, slow training, and limited accuracy for inverse moving-boundary problems. There is a need for a fast, robust method that can handle physics constraints efficiently.

Method: Replace deep neural nets with a fixed-weight extreme learning machine (ELM). Output-layer weights are learned by solving a least-squares problem that minimizes a loss vector built from initial/boundary conditions and PDE residuals. Inverse Stefan problems are thus reduced to finding the Moore-Penrose generalized inverse.

Result: Case studies report 3–7 orders of magnitude improvement in relative L2 error and over 94% reduction in training time compared with conventional PINNs.

Conclusion: PIELM offers a rapid, accurate physics-informed framework for inverse Stefan problems, addressing PINN drawbacks and delivering substantial speedups and accuracy gains.

Abstract: The inverse Stefan problem, as a typical phase-change problem with moving
boundaries, finds extensive applications in science and engineering. Recent
years have seen the applications of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to
solving Stefan problems, yet they still exhibit shortcomings in hyperparameter
dependency, training efficiency, and prediction accuracy. To address this, this
paper develops a physics-informed extreme learning machine (PIELM), a rapid
physics-informed learning method framework for inverse Stefan problems. PIELM
replaces conventional deep neural networks with an extreme learning machine
network. The input weights are fixed in the PIELM framework, and the output
weights are determined by optimizing a loss vector of physical laws composed by
initial and boundary conditions and governing partial differential equations
(PDEs). Then, solving inverse Stefan problems is transformed into finding the
Moore-Penrose generalized inverse by the least squares method. Case studies
show that the PIELM can increase the prediction accuracy by 3-7 order of
magnitude in terms of the relative L2 error, and meanwhile saving more than 94%
training time, compared to conventional PINNs.

*Hao Liang,Shuqing Shi,Yudi Zhang,Biwei Huang,Yali Du*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GSAC is a scalable, generalizable actor-critic framework that merges causal representation learning with meta-learning. It learns sparse local causal masks to form exponentially tight approximately compact representations (ACRs) of state and domain factors, uses these to bound k-hop value truncation error on graphs, and trains a shared policy across domains conditioned on compact domain factors. At test time, it quickly estimates the new domain factor from few trajectories and adapts. The approach comes with finite-sample guarantees on causal recovery, actor-critic convergence, and adaptation gap, and shows rapid adaptation and superior performance vs learning-from-scratch and standard baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large-scale networked systems (e.g., traffic, power, wireless grids) face both scale and environment shifts, making RL hard due to sample inefficiency and poor generalization. There is a need for representations that are compact, scalable to graphs, and support rapid domain adaptation.

Method: 1) Each agent learns a sparse local causal mask identifying the minimal neighborhood variables influencing its dynamics, yielding exponentially tight approximately compact representations (ACRs) of state and domain factors. 2) The ACRs bound the error from truncating value functions to κ-hop neighborhoods, enabling efficient graph-based learning. 3) A meta actor-critic trains a shared policy across multiple source domains while conditioning on compact domain factors; at test time, a few trajectories estimate the new domain factor to adapt the policy.

Result: The approach provides finite-sample guarantees on causal recovery, actor-critic convergence, and adaptation gap. Empirically, GSAC adapts rapidly and significantly outperforms learning-from-scratch and conventional adaptation baselines on large-scale, graph-structured tasks.

Conclusion: GSAC successfully achieves scalability and domain generalization by coupling causal representation learning with meta-actor-critic learning. It enables efficient learning on graphs through ACRs and facilitates rapid test-time adaptation using few trajectories, backed by theoretical guarantees.

Abstract: Large-scale networked systems, such as traffic, power, and wireless grids,
challenge reinforcement-learning agents with both scale and environment shifts.
To address these challenges, we propose GSAC (Generalizable and Scalable
Actor-Critic), a framework that couples causal representation learning with
meta actor-critic learning to achieve both scalability and domain
generalization. Each agent first learns a sparse local causal mask that
provably identifies the minimal neighborhood variables influencing its
dynamics, yielding exponentially tight approximately compact representations
(ACRs) of state and domain factors. These ACRs bound the error of truncating
value functions to $\kappa$-hop neighborhoods, enabling efficient learning on
graphs. A meta actor-critic then trains a shared policy across multiple source
domains while conditioning on the compact domain factors; at test time, a few
trajectories suffice to estimate the new domain factor and deploy the adapted
policy. We establish finite-sample guarantees on causal recovery, actor-critic
convergence, and adaptation gap, and show that GSAC adapts rapidly and
significantly outperforms learning-from-scratch and conventional adaptation
baselines.

### [214] [Unified token representations for sequential decision models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21448)
*Zhuojing Tian,Yushu Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes Unified Token Representation (UTR) for offline RL transformers by merging return-to-go, state, and action into a single token to reduce sequence length and computational cost; introduces two variants (UDT and UDC) with transformer and gated CNN backbones, achieving comparable or superior performance with lower compute and a theoretical bound on generalization (Rademacher complexity).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address scalability and inefficiency (redundant tokenization and quadratic attention) in existing return-to-go based offline RL methods like Decision Transformer, enabling real-time or resource-constrained deployment and potentially better generalization.

Method: Introduce Unified Token Representation (UTR) that merges return-to-go, state, and action into one token. Provide theoretical analysis showing tighter Rademacher complexity bound. Develop two variants, UDT (transformer backbone) and UDC (gated CNN backbone), and evaluate against state-of-the-art methods on offline RL benchmarks.

Result: UTR reduces sequence length and model complexity. Both UDT and UDC achieve comparable or superior performance to state-of-the-art methods with markedly lower computation. Demonstrates that UTR generalizes across architectures.

Conclusion: UTR offers a scalable, architecture-agnostic token representation that improves efficiency while maintaining or enhancing performance, laying a foundation for scalable control in future large decision models.

Abstract: Transformers have demonstrated strong potential in offline reinforcement
learning (RL) by modeling trajectories as sequences of return-to-go, states,
and actions. However, existing approaches such as the Decision Transformer(DT)
and its variants suffer from redundant tokenization and quadratic attention
complexity, limiting their scalability in real-time or resource-constrained
settings. To address this, we propose a Unified Token Representation (UTR) that
merges return-to-go, state, and action into a single token, substantially
reducing sequence length and model complexity. Theoretical analysis shows that
UTR leads to a tighter Rademacher complexity bound, suggesting improved
generalization. We further develop two variants: UDT and UDC, built upon
transformer and gated CNN backbones, respectively. Both achieve comparable or
superior performance to state-of-the-art methods with markedly lower
computation. These findings demonstrate that UTR generalizes well across
architectures and may provide an efficient foundation for scalable control in
future large decision models.

*Federico Danieli,Pau Rodriguez,Miguel Sarabia,Xavier Suau,Luca Zappella*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ParaRNN enables training nonlinear RNNs with full sequence parallelism by solving nonlinear recurrence as a single system via Newton iterations, achieving huge speedups and enabling 7B-parameter models with competitive perplexity to Transformers; code released.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RNNs are sequential and hard to scale; while SSMs and Transformers provide parallelism but may lack nonlinear expressivity; want to unlock nonlinear RNNs at scale.

Method: Formulate nonlinear RNN recurrence as a single system of equations; solve with Newton's method in parallel; use custom parallel reductions; implement adaptations of LSTM/GRU; train up to 7B params; open-source.

Result: Speedups up to 665x over naive sequential execution; 7B-parameter models with perplexity comparable to similarly-sized Transformers and Mamba2; released open-source ParaRNN framework.

Conclusion: This approach removes the sequence-parallelization barrier for nonlinear RNNs, enabling scalable, expressive sequence models; could accelerate research and practical deployment of nonlinear RNNs; fosters exploration beyond linear recurrence models.

Abstract: Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) laid the foundation for sequence modeling,
but their intrinsic sequential nature restricts parallel computation, creating
a fundamental barrier to scaling. This has led to the dominance of
parallelizable architectures like Transformers and, more recently, State Space
Models (SSMs). While SSMs achieve efficient parallelization through structured
linear recurrences, this linearity constraint limits their expressive power and
precludes modeling complex, nonlinear sequence-wise dependencies. To address
this, we present ParaRNN, a framework that breaks the sequence-parallelization
barrier for nonlinear RNNs. Building on prior work, we cast the sequence of
nonlinear recurrence relationships as a single system of equations, which we
solve in parallel using Newton's iterations combined with custom parallel
reductions. Our implementation achieves speedups of up to 665x over naive
sequential application, allowing training nonlinear RNNs at unprecedented
scales. To showcase this, we apply ParaRNN to adaptations of LSTM and GRU
architectures, successfully training models of 7B parameters that attain
perplexity comparable to similarly-sized Transformers and Mamba2 architectures.
To accelerate research in efficient sequence modeling, we release the ParaRNN
codebase as an open-source framework for automatic training-parallelization of
nonlinear RNNs, enabling researchers and practitioners to explore new nonlinear
RNN models at scale.

### [216] [Towards Explainable Personalized Recommendations by Learning from Users' Photos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21455)
*Jorge Díez,Pablo Pérez-Núñez,Oscar Luaces,Beatriz Remeseiro,Antonio Bahamonde*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: We propose learning personalized explanations by predicting the photo a user would take to justify their opinion about an item, framing it as a user–photo authorship recommendation, demonstrated on TripAdvisor data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Explainability for complex systems like recommender systems. Users naturally justify opinions with images; predicting such photos enables personalized explanations and reveals which aspects of items users highlight.

Method: A formal framework to estimate authorship probability for a given (user, photo) pair. The approach predicts which photos a user would upload as explanations, illustrated with TripAdvisor data of reviews with photos from six cities.

Result: The paper provides a formal framework and an illustrative dataset demonstrating the approach; explicit empirical results are not described in the abstract, but it shows feasibility of modeling user–photo authorship and distributions of attractive images.

Conclusion: Personalized image-based explanations can enhance explainability and trust in recommender systems by aligning explanations with user-generated visual evidence and by revealing product aspects that customers care about.

Abstract: Explaining the output of a complex system, such as a Recommender System (RS),
is becoming of utmost importance for both users and companies. In this paper we
explore the idea that personalized explanations can be learned as
recommendation themselves. There are plenty of online services where users can
upload some photos, in addition to rating items. We assume that users take
these photos to reinforce or justify their opinions about the items. For this
reason we try to predict what photo a user would take of an item, because that
image is the argument that can best convince her of the qualities of the item.
In this sense, an RS can explain its results and, therefore, increase its
reliability. Furthermore, once we have a model to predict attractive images for
users, we can estimate their distribution. Thus, the companies acquire a vivid
knowledge about the aspects that the clients highlight of their products. The
paper includes a formal framework that estimates the authorship probability for
a given pair (user, photo). To illustrate the proposal, we use data gathered
from TripAdvisor containing the reviews (with photos) of restaurants in six
cities of different sizes.

### [217] [Estimating Treatment Effects in Networks using Domain Adversarial Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21457)
*Daan Caljon,Jente Van Belle,Wouter Verbeke*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces HINet, a method combining graph neural networks with domain adversarial training to estimate heterogeneous treatment effects in networks with unknown exposure mappings and network-level covariate shift due to homophily; evaluated on synthetic datasets showing effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Interference in networks and unknown exposure mappings complicate causal effect estimation. Homophily-induced covariate shift can bias estimates. A method that handles unknown exposure and mitigates shift is needed.

Method: HINet integrates graph neural networks with domain adversarial training to learn exposure-agnostic representations and estimate treatment effects under unknown exposure mappings, aiming to reduce network-level covariate shift.

Result: Empirical evaluation on synthetic and semi-synthetic networks demonstrates effectiveness in estimating heterogeneous treatment effects, with robustness to unknown exposure mappings and covariate shift.

Conclusion: HINet provides a practical approach to network causal inference under realistic challenges, validated on synthetic data, with potential for extension to real-world networks and further analysis of identifiability and stability.

Abstract: Estimating heterogeneous treatment effects in network settings is complicated
by interference, meaning that the outcome of an instance can be influenced by
the treatment status of others. Existing causal machine learning approaches
usually assume a known exposure mapping that summarizes how the outcome of a
given instance is influenced by others' treatment, a simplification that is
often unrealistic. Furthermore, the interaction between homophily -- the
tendency of similar instances to connect -- and the treatment assignment
mechanism can induce a network-level covariate shift that may lead to
inaccurate treatment effect estimates, a phenomenon that has not yet been
explicitly studied. To address these challenges, we propose HINet, a novel
method that integrates graph neural networks with domain adversarial training.
This combination allows estimating treatment effects under unknown exposure
mappings while mitigating the impact of (network-level) covariate shift. An
extensive empirical evaluation on synthetic and semi-synthetic network datasets
demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ZEN is a fully linear, parameter-free hypergraph neural network for few-shot node classification that delivers strong accuracy and massive speedups with a fully interpretable decision process, by providing a closed-form weight solution and redundancy-aware propagation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the generalization gap in few-shot hypergraph learning and overcome the overfitting and scalability issues of black-box, non-linear HNNs while leveraging high-order hypergraph structures.

Method: A unified, linearized formulation of HNNs leading to a closed-form solution for the weight matrix and a redundancy-aware propagation scheme that avoids iterative training and removes redundant self-information.

Result: Empirically evaluated on 11 real-world hypergraph benchmarks, ZEN outperforms eight baselines in classification accuracy and achieves up to 696x faster speeds than the fastest competitor.

Conclusion: ZEN demonstrates that a fully linear, parameter-free model can be both expressive and efficient for few-shot hypergraph learning, with fully interpretable decision processes and accessible code/data.

Abstract: Few-shot node classification on hypergraphs requires models that generalize
from scarce labels while capturing high-order structures. Existing hypergraph
neural networks (HNNs) effectively encode such structures but often suffer from
overfitting and scalability issues due to complex, black-box architectures. In
this work, we propose ZEN (Zero-Parameter Hypergraph Neural Network), a fully
linear and parameter-free model that achieves both expressiveness and
efficiency. Built upon a unified formulation of linearized HNNs, ZEN introduces
a tractable closed-form solution for the weight matrix and a redundancy-aware
propagation scheme to avoid iterative training and to eliminate redundant self
information. On 11 real-world hypergraph benchmarks, ZEN consistently
outperforms eight baseline models in classification accuracy while achieving up
to 696x speedups over the fastest competitor. Moreover, the decision process of
ZEN is fully interpretable, providing insights into the characteristic of a
dataset. Our code and datasets are fully available at

### [219] [Benchmarking Catastrophic Forgetting Mitigation Methods in Federated Time Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21491)
*Khaled Hallak,Oudom Kem*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A benchmarking framework for catastrophic forgetting in federated continual time series forecasting, evaluated on air-quality data across multiple clients with several CF mitigation strategies; includes an open-source release.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Catastrophic forgetting in continual learning is challenging, and federated settings with non-i.i.d. time-series data worsen it. Regression forecasting in IoT/edge contexts is underexplored, creating a need for benchmarks and evaluation of forgetting mitigation.

Method: Introduce a new benchmark for CF in federated time-series forecasting; use Beijing Multi-site Air Quality dataset across 12 decentralized clients; systematically evaluate Replay, Elastic Weight Consolidation, Learning without Forgetting, and Synaptic Intelligence; release a reproducible framework.

Result: Provide the benchmark and a comprehensive comparative analysis of CF mitigation methods, plus a reproducible open-source framework for federated time-series forecasting.

Conclusion: The work delivers a first benchmark and practical tools to advance continual learning in federated time-series forecasting for IoT/edge applications.

Abstract: Catastrophic forgetting (CF) poses a persistent challenge in continual
learning (CL), especially within federated learning (FL) environments
characterized by non-i.i.d. time series data. While existing research has
largely focused on classification tasks in vision domains, the regression-based
forecasting setting prevalent in IoT and edge applications remains
underexplored. In this paper, we present the first benchmarking framework
tailored to investigate CF in federated continual time series forecasting.
Using the Beijing Multi-site Air Quality dataset across 12 decentralized
clients, we systematically evaluate several CF mitigation strategies, including
Replay, Elastic Weight Consolidation, Learning without Forgetting, and Synaptic
Intelligence. Key contributions include: (i) introducing a new benchmark for CF
in time series FL, (ii) conducting a comprehensive comparative analysis of
state-of-the-art methods, and (iii) releasing a reproducible open-source
framework. This work provides essential tools and insights for advancing
continual learning in federated time-series forecasting systems.

### [220] [Uniform Convergence Beyond Glivenko-Cantelli](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21506)
*Tanmay Devale,Pramith Devulapalli,Steve Hanneke*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: UME-learnability extends uniform estimation theory from the empirical mean to arbitrary estimators for distributions on {0,1}^N; separability of mean vectors suffices but is not necessary; a non-separable but UME-learnable example exists; countable unions of UME-learnable classes are also UME-learnable, resolving Cohen et al. 2025.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generalize uniform estimation from the empirical mean to estimator-agnostic uniform mean estimation; analyze the geometry of mean vectors; close open questions about necessity of separability and closure under unions in learning theory.

Method: Represent distributions by their mean vectors in coordinate space; prove separability suffices for UME-learnability; construct a non-separable UME-learnable family using techniques beyond separability-based analysis; prove that countable unions of UME-learnable families preserve UME-learnability.

Result: Characterizes conditions for UME-learnability; shows separability is a sufficient but not necessary condition; provides a non-separable UME-learnable example; establishes closure of UME-learnability under countable unions (solving Cohen et al. 2025).

Conclusion: Broadens the uniform estimation framework to estimator-agnostic settings, revealing deeper structure via mean vectors; shows robustness of UME-learnability beyond separability; resolves a conjecture on union-closure and opens new directions in distributional learning.

Abstract: We characterize conditions under which collections of distributions on
$\{0,1\}^\mathbb{N}$ admit uniform estimation of their mean. Prior work from
Vapnik and Chervonenkis (1971) has focused on uniform convergence using the
empirical mean estimator, leading to the principle known as $P-$
Glivenko-Cantelli. We extend this framework by moving beyond the empirical mean
estimator and introducing Uniform Mean Estimability, also called $UME-$
learnability, which captures when a collection permits uniform mean estimation
by any arbitrary estimator. We work on the space created by the mean vectors of
the collection of distributions. For each distribution, the mean vector records
the expected value in each coordinate. We show that separability of the mean
vectors is a sufficient condition for $UME-$ learnability. However, we show
that separability of the mean vectors is not necessary for $UME-$ learnability
by constructing a collection of distributions whose mean vectors are
non-separable yet $UME-$ learnable using techniques fundamentally different
from those used in our separability-based analysis. Finally, we establish that
countable unions of $UME-$ learnable collections are also $UME-$ learnable,
solving a conjecture posed in Cohen et al. (2025).

### [221] [Surrogate-based quantification of policy uncertainty in generative flow networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21523)
*Ramón Nartallo-Kaluarachchi,Robert Manson-Sawko,Shashanka Ubaru,Dongsung Huh,Małgorzata J Zimoń,Lior Horesh,Yoshua Bengio*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A surrogate polynomial chaos expansion, trained on an ensemble of flow networks, quantifies epistemic uncertainty in generative flow networks caused by noisy reward estimates, enabling cheap Monte Carlo estimation of policy uncertainty; demonstrated on grid-worlds, symbolic regression, and Bayesian structure learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Rewards are often estimated from noisy data, leading to epistemic uncertainty in the learned policy. Quantifying this uncertainty helps assess reliability and guide decision making.

Method: Build a surrogate model using a polynomial chaos expansion in a low-dimensional reward-parameter space. Fit it on a small ensemble of trained flow networks. The surrogate maps reward parameters to the action-distribution at each step along flow trajectories. Use the surrogate for inexpensive Monte Carlo sampling to estimate policy uncertainty under uncertain rewards.

Result: The approach is demonstrated on discrete and continuous grid-worlds, symbolic regression, and a Bayesian structure learning task, illustrating effective and efficient uncertainty quantification for the policy under reward uncertainty.

Conclusion: A practical framework to quantify and propagate reward-induced epistemic uncertainty into the policy of generative flow networks, with broad applicability across tasks and reward regimes.

Abstract: Generative flow networks are able to sample, via sequential construction,
high-reward, complex objects according to a reward function. However, such
reward functions are often estimated approximately from noisy data, leading to
epistemic uncertainty in the learnt policy. We present an approach to quantify
this uncertainty by constructing a surrogate model composed of a polynomial
chaos expansion, fit on a small ensemble of trained flow networks. This model
learns the relationship between reward functions, parametrised in a
low-dimensional space, and the probability distributions over actions at each
step along a trajectory of the flow network. The surrogate model can then be
used for inexpensive Monte Carlo sampling to estimate the uncertainty in the
policy given uncertain rewards. We illustrate the performance of our approach
on a discrete and continuous grid-world, symbolic regression, and a Bayesian
structure learning task.

### [222] [A Unified Model for Multi-Task Drone Routing in Post-Disaster Road Assessment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21525)
*Huatian Gong,Jiuh-Biing Sheu,Zheng Wang,Xiaoguang Yang,Ran Yan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A transformer-based unified model (UM) efficiently solves multiple PDRA variants with a single network, reducing training time and parameters, and enabling fast, adaptable drone routing for post-disaster road assessment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PDRA demands rapid, scalable routing across large networks in dynamic disaster scenarios. Traditional optimization is slow and DRL often treats each problem variant separately, hindering adaptability.

Method: Train one neural network across eight PDRA variants using a transformer encoder-decoder architecture. Employ a lightweight adapter for efficient finetuning to unseen attributes without retraining, enabling multi-variant learning and quick adaptation.

Result: UM reduces training time and parameters by ~8× versus separate models, and outperforms single-task DRL (6–14%) and traditional optimization (24–82%) in solution quality. Real-time solutions (1–10 s) on networks up to 1,000 nodes; robust to parameter variations. Finetuning unseen attributes incurs minimal cost with preserved quality.

Conclusion: The UM advances neural combinatorial optimization for time-critical PDRA, delivering a computationally efficient, high-quality, and adaptable solution suitable for dynamic disaster environments.

Abstract: Post-disaster road assessment (PDRA) is essential for emergency response,
enabling rapid evaluation of infrastructure conditions and efficient allocation
of resources. Although drones provide a flexible and effective tool for PDRA,
routing them in large-scale networks remains challenging. Traditional
optimization methods scale poorly and demand domain expertise, while existing
deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approaches adopt a single-task paradigm,
requiring separate models for each problem variant and lacking adaptability to
evolving operational needs. This study proposes a unified model (UM) for drone
routing that simultaneously addresses eight PDRA variants. By training a single
neural network across multiple problem configurations, UM captures shared
structural knowledge while adapting to variant-specific constraints through a
modern transformer encoder-decoder architecture. A lightweight adapter
mechanism further enables efficient finetuning to unseen attributes without
retraining, enhancing deployment flexibility in dynamic disaster scenarios.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that the UM reduces training time and
parameters by a factor of eight compared with training separate models, while
consistently outperforming single-task DRL methods by 6--14\% and traditional
optimization approaches by 24--82\% in terms of solution quality (total
collected information value). The model achieves real-time solutions (1--10
seconds) across networks of up to 1,000 nodes, with robustness confirmed
through sensitivity analyses. Moreover, finetuning experiments show that unseen
attributes can be effectively incorporated with minimal cost while retaining
high solution quality. The proposed UM advances neural combinatorial
optimization for time-critical applications, offering a computationally
efficient, high-quality, and adaptable solution for drone-based PDRA.

### [223] [Probe-based Fine-tuning for Reducing Toxicity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21531)
*Jan Wehner,Mario Fritz*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Training detectors (probes) on model activations can identify misbehavior and serve as training signals, but making probes a training target risks Goodhart’s Law. The paper evaluates two training methods—Supervised Fine-tuning and Direct Preference Optimization—on a toxicity-reduction task, and tests strategies to preserve probe accuracy (ensembles, held-out probes, and retraining). Findings show that probe-based preference optimization preserves detectability better than classifier-based methods, while retraining probes after optimization recovers high accuracy; probe diversity offers little added benefit. Overall, probe-based training can be viable for some alignment methods, with retraining reducing the need for probe ensembles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Probes offer a way to detect undesirable model behavior and to guide training via internal representations, not just outputs. However, when probes become objectives in training, their reliability can degrade (Goodhart’s Law). The goal is to assess whether training against probes can be viable and under what conditions.

Method: Compare two training approaches for probes: (1) Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT) and (2) Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Use a toxicity-reduction testbed to measure how probe accuracy drops when training against probes. Explore mitigation strategies: (a) train against an ensemble of probes, (b) retain held-out probes not used for training, and (c) retrain new probes after training.

Result: Probe-based preference optimization preserves probe detectability better than classifier-based methods. Retraining probes after optimization recovers high detection accuracy. Probe diversity yields minimal practical benefit; ensembles are unnecessary if retraining is feasible.

Conclusion: Training against probes can be viable for some alignment methods. However, maintaining probe reliability generally benefits from retraining probes after optimization rather than maintaining a large ensemble during training. Preference-based objectives may help preserve relevant representations better than classifier-based objectives.

Abstract: Probes trained on model activations can detect undesirable behaviors like
deception or biases that are difficult to identify from outputs alone. This
makes them useful detectors to identify misbehavior. Furthermore, they are also
valuable training signals, since they not only reward outputs, but also good
internal processes for arriving at that output. However, training against
interpretability tools raises a fundamental concern: when a monitor becomes a
training target, it may cease to be reliable (Goodhart's Law). We propose two
methods for training against probes based on Supervised Fine-tuning and Direct
Preference Optimization. We conduct an initial exploration of these methods in
a testbed for reducing toxicity and evaluate the amount by which probe accuracy
drops when training against them. To retain the accuracy of probe-detectors
after training, we attempt (1) to train against an ensemble of probes, (2)
retain held-out probes that aren't used for training, and (3) retrain new
probes after training.
  First, probe-based preference optimization unexpectedly preserves probe
detectability better than classifier-based methods, suggesting the preference
learning objective incentivizes maintaining rather than obfuscating relevant
representations. Second, probe diversity provides minimal practical benefit -
simply retraining probes after optimization recovers high detection accuracy.
Our findings suggest probe-based training can be viable for certain alignment
methods, though probe ensembles are largely unnecessary when retraining is
feasible.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces Spatiotemporal Region Distortion (SRD) for pseudo-anomaly generation to enable robust adversarial training in Weakly Supervised Video Anomaly Detection (WSVAD), achieving large AUROC gains against attacks by combining synthetic anomalies with noisy pseudo-labels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: WSVAD relies on weak supervision (video-level labels) and needs frame-level predictions; standard adversarial defenses are ineffective due to weak perturbations; pseudo-labels are noisy, harming robustness; a method to generate reliable frame-level anomalies could enable effective adversarial training.

Method: Generate synthetic anomalies by applying severe augmentations to localized spatiotemporal regions in normal videos while preserving temporal consistency; integrate these pseudo-annotated synthetic anomalies with the model’s noisy pseudo-labels to guide robust adversarial training and reduce label noise.

Result: Empirical experiments show significant robustness improvements against adversarial attacks, outperforming state-of-the-art methods by an average of 71.0% in AUROC across multiple benchmarks; implementation released at GitHub repository.

Conclusion: SRD-based pseudo-anomaly generation provides an effective defense for WSVAD under weak supervision, enabling robust frame-level detection; the approach yields substantial performance gains and is publicly available.

Abstract: Weakly Supervised Video Anomaly Detection (WSVAD) has achieved notable
advancements, yet existing models remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks,
limiting their reliability. Due to the inherent constraints of weak
supervision, where only video-level labels are provided despite the need for
frame-level predictions, traditional adversarial defense mechanisms, such as
adversarial training, are not effective since video-level adversarial
perturbations are typically weak and inadequate. To address this limitation,
pseudo-labels generated directly from the model can enable frame-level
adversarial training; however, these pseudo-labels are inherently noisy,
significantly degrading performance. We therefore introduce a novel
Pseudo-Anomaly Generation method called Spatiotemporal Region Distortion (SRD),
which creates synthetic anomalies by applying severe augmentations to localized
regions in normal videos while preserving temporal consistency. Integrating
these precisely annotated synthetic anomalies with the noisy pseudo-labels
substantially reduces label noise, enabling effective adversarial training.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly enhances the
robustness of WSVAD models against adversarial attacks, outperforming
state-of-the-art methods by an average of 71.0\% in overall AUROC performance
across multiple benchmarks. The implementation and code are publicly available
at https://github.com/rohban-lab/FrameShield.

### [225] [Excision Score: Evaluating Edits with Surgical Precision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21537)
*Nikolai Gruzinov,Ksenia Sycheva,Earl T. Barr,Alex Bezzubov*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Excision Score (ES) is a static revision-similarity metric that excises content shared between an original document and its revisions (ground truth and predictions) using longest common subsequence, then compares only divergent regions. It improves alignment with human judgments over BLEU and SARI, especially as shared context grows, and handles moved blocks and edit operations effectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard pairwise similarity measures are biased by shared content between an original document and its revisions, causing high scores even when the actual edits are substantial. A measure that focuses on the divergent parts would better align with human judgments of revision quality.

Method: Introduce Excision Score (ES) which uses LCS to identify and remove content shared by the original document with both the ground-truth and predicted revisions, then compares only the remaining divergent regions. Uses a quadratic-time approximation of LCS for efficiency. Evaluated in code-editing tasks (HumanEvalFix), examining invariance to shared context and alignment of edits (e.g., moved blocks, insertions, deletions).

Result: ES surpasses existing measures: on HumanEvalFix-aligned test execution, ES improves Pearson correlation over SARI by 12% and over BLEU by >21%. When shared context is increased, ES–SARI improves by ~20% and ES–BLEU by >30%. ES also correctly aligns moved code blocks and appropriately rewards matching insertions/deletions.

Conclusion: Excision Score provides a robust, context-invariant revision-similarity metric that better matches human judgments, with efficient approximation and clear advantages for code-editing evaluation and potentially other revision tasks.

Abstract: Many tasks revolve around editing a document, whether code or text. We
formulate the revision similarity problem to unify a wide range of machine
learning evaluation problems whose goal is to assess a revision to an existing
document. We observe that revisions usually change only a small portion of an
existing document, so the existing document and its immediate revisions share a
majority of their content. We formulate five adequacy criteria for revision
similarity measures, designed to align them with human judgement. We show that
popular pairwise measures, like BLEU, fail to meet these criteria, because
their scores are dominated by the shared content. They report high similarity
between two revisions when humans would assess them as quite different. This is
a fundamental flaw we address. We propose a novel static measure, Excision
Score (ES), which computes longest common subsequence (LCS) to remove content
shared by an existing document with the ground truth and predicted revisions,
before comparing only the remaining divergent regions. This is analogous to a
surgeon creating a sterile field to focus on the work area. We use
approximation to speed the standard cubic LCS computation to quadratic. In
code-editing evaluation, where static measures are often used as a cheap proxy
for passing tests, we demonstrate that ES surpasses existing measures. When
aligned with test execution on HumanEvalFix, ES improves over its nearest
competitor, SARI, by 12% Pearson correlation and by >21% over standard measures
like BLEU. The key criterion is invariance to shared context; when we perturb
HumanEvalFix with increased shared context, ES' improvement over SARI increases
to 20% and >30% over standard measures. ES also handles other corner cases that
other measures do not, such as correctly aligning moved code blocks, and
appropriately rewarding matching insertions or deletions.

Propose a MADDPG-COCG framework: use MADDPG for continuous temporal decisions and a convex optimization + coalitional game (COCG) to deterministically handle hybrid and varying-dimensional decisions, enhancing MADDPG.

Result: Simulation shows MADDPG-COCG significantly improves user-centric metrics—lower UD cost, reduced task completion delay, and lower UD energy consumption—with a slight UAV energy cost increase; improved convergence stability and scalability compared to benchmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed hierarchical SAGIN-MEC with MADDPG-COCG effectively addresses LAE SAGIN-MEC challenges, delivering better performance and stability, and is scalable to heterogeneous and dynamic environments.

Abstract: Space-air-ground integrated multi-access edge computing (SAGIN-MEC) provides
a promising solution for the rapidly developing low-altitude economy (LAE) to
deliver flexible and wide-area computing services. However, fully realizing the
potential of SAGIN-MEC in the LAE presents significant challenges, including
coordinating decisions across heterogeneous nodes with different roles,
modeling complex factors such as mobility and network variability, and handling
real-time decision-making under partially observable environment with hybrid
variables. To address these challenges, we first present a hierarchical
SAGIN-MEC architecture that enables the coordination between user devices
(UDs), uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs), and satellites. Then, we formulate a UD
cost minimization optimization problem (UCMOP) to minimize the UD cost by
jointly optimizing the task offloading ratio, UAV trajectory planning,
computing resource allocation, and UD association. We show that the UCMOP is an
NP-hard problem. To overcome this challenge, we propose a multi-agent deep
deterministic policy gradient (MADDPG)-convex optimization and coalitional game
(MADDPG-COCG) algorithm. Specifically, we employ the MADDPG algorithm to
optimize the continuous temporal decisions for heterogeneous nodes in the
partially observable SAGIN-MEC system. Moreover, we propose a convex
optimization and coalitional game (COCG) method to enhance the conventional
MADDPG by deterministically handling the hybrid and varying-dimensional
decisions. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed MADDPG-COCG
algorithm significantly enhances the user-centric performances in terms of the
aggregated UD cost, task completion delay, and UD energy consumption, with a
slight increase in UAV energy consumption, compared to the benchmark
algorithms. Moreover, the MADDPG-COCG algorithm shows superior convergence
stability and scalability.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Zero-shot multimodal ECG diagnosis framework ZETA that uses structured positive/negative clinical observations for interpretable, workflow-aligned predictions without disease-specific fine-tuning; demonstrates competitive performance and enhanced interpretability; dataset and code to be released.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need for transparent, generalizable ECG AI that can align with clinical differential diagnosis and avoid opaque decisions. Current systems lack interpretability and fail to generalize to unseen conditions. By grounding predictions in curated clinical observations, ZETA aims to improve trustworthiness and clinical relevance.

Method: ZETA employs a pre-trained multimodal model to align ECG and text embeddings in a shared space. It compares ECG signals against a set of structured positive and negative clinical observations curated via an LLM-assisted, expert-validated process, effectively mimicking differential diagnosis. No disease-specific fine-tuning is performed.

Result: ZETA achieves competitive zero-shot classification performance. It provides qualitative and quantitative evidence of enhanced interpretability, grounding predictions in specific, clinically relevant positive and negative features. The authors plan to release the curated observation dataset and code.

Conclusion: Aligning ECG analysis with structured clinical knowledge can yield more transparent, generalizable, and trustworthy AI diagnostic systems, potentially improving clinical adoption. The approach invites further research and data sharing to validate and extend zero-shot, interpretable ECG AI.

Abstract: Electrocardiogram (ECG) interpretation is essential for cardiovascular
disease diagnosis, but current automated systems often struggle with
transparency and generalization to unseen conditions. To address this, we
introduce ZETA, a zero-shot multimodal framework designed for interpretable ECG
diagnosis aligned with clinical workflows. ZETA uniquely compares ECG signals
against structured positive and negative clinical observations, which are
curated through an LLM-assisted, expert-validated process, thereby mimicking
differential diagnosis. Our approach leverages a pre-trained multimodal model
to align ECG and text embeddings without disease-specific fine-tuning.
Empirical evaluations demonstrate ZETA's competitive zero-shot classification
performance and, importantly, provide qualitative and quantitative evidence of
enhanced interpretability, grounding predictions in specific, clinically
relevant positive and negative diagnostic features. ZETA underscores the
potential of aligning ECG analysis with structured clinical knowledge for
building more transparent, generalizable, and trustworthy AI diagnostic
systems. We will release the curated observation dataset and code to facilitate
future research.

### [228] [Leveraging Classical Algorithms for Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21574)
*Jason Wu,Petar Veličković*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Pretraining Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) on classical algorithms from the CLRS Algorithmic Reasoning Benchmark and freezing certain layers finetunes the models for molecular property prediction, outperforming randomly initialized baselines. Segments Intersect pretraining gives ~6% absolute gains on ogbg-molhiv; Dijkstra pretraining ~3% on ogbg-molclintox.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neural networks excel with unstructured data but struggle to generalise out-of-distribution; classical algorithms offer correctness guarantees and structured priors. The study investigates whether embedding algorithmic priors into GNNs can improve performance on real-world graph tasks.

Method: Pretrain GNNs on 24 classical algorithms from the CLRS Benchmark to initialise and freeze selected layers of a second GNN used for molecular property prediction. Evaluate on ogbg-molhiv ( HIV inhibition ) and ogbg-molclintox (clinical toxicity). Compare against a randomly initialised baseline.

Result: Pretrained models show consistent wins or ties over the baseline. Segments Intersect pretraining yields a 6% absolute gain on ogbg-molhiv; Dijkstra pretraining yields a 3% absolute gain on ogbg-molclintox.

Conclusion: Embedding classical algorithmic priors into GNNs provides useful inductive biases, boosting performance on complex real-world graph data.

Abstract: Neural networks excel at processing unstructured data but often fail to
generalise out-of-distribution, whereas classical algorithms guarantee
correctness but lack flexibility. We explore whether pretraining Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs) on classical algorithms can improve their performance on
molecular property prediction tasks from the Open Graph Benchmark: ogbg-molhiv
(HIV inhibition) and ogbg-molclintox (clinical toxicity). GNNs trained on 24
classical algorithms from the CLRS Algorithmic Reasoning Benchmark are used to
initialise and freeze selected layers of a second GNN for molecular prediction.
Compared to a randomly initialised baseline, the pretrained models achieve
consistent wins or ties, with the Segments Intersect algorithm pretraining
yielding a 6% absolute gain on ogbg-molhiv and Dijkstra pretraining achieving a
3% gain on ogbg-molclintox. These results demonstrate embedding classical
algorithmic priors into GNNs provides useful inductive biases, boosting
performance on complex, real-world graph data.

### [229] [An unsupervised tour through the hidden pathways of deep neural networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21582)
*Diego Doimo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A thesis exploring how deep nets form meaningful representations and generalize; it introduces Gride to estimate intrinsic dimension as a function of scale, analyzes density evolution across hidden layers to link semantic structure with probability density, and shows that wide networks tend to learn redundant representations under regularization with zero training error, challenging simple bias-variance views.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the internal mechanisms by which deep neural networks create meaningful representations and generalize, and to characterize the semantic content of hidden representations using unsupervised tools that exploit the data’s low-dimensional structure.

Method: Chapter 2 presents Gride, a scale-dependent intrinsic-dimension estimator based on nearest-neighbor distances with uncertainty quantification and no data decimation. Chapter 3 analyzes how the distribution of activations evolves across layers in state-of-the-art networks, showing a progression from unimodal densities to hierarchical density peaks that mirror semantic concepts. Chapter 4 investigates generalization in over-parameterized networks, showing that wide networks learn redundant representations, appearing only when the network is regularized and achieves zero training error.

Result: Gride provides an intrinsic dimension estimate as a function of scale with quantified uncertainty and low computational cost. Layerwise density analysis reveals that early layers strip away structure irrelevant to classification, while later layers develop hierarchical density peaks reflecting semantic relationships; the output density landscape encodes category relations. In wide networks, adding parameters that interpolate training data improves generalization by learning redundancy rather than overfitting, with redundancy emerging under regularization and zero training error.

Conclusion: The thesis advances unsupervised methods to reveal low-dimensional structure and semantic organization in deep representations and sheds light on generalization in over-parameterized nets. It demonstrates a link between layer-wise density/topography and semantic relationships, and reframes wide-network generalization as the emergence of redundant representations under certain training conditions.

Abstract: The goal of this thesis is to improve our understanding of the internal
mechanisms by which deep artificial neural networks create meaningful
representations and are able to generalize. We focus on the challenge of
characterizing the semantic content of the hidden representations with
unsupervised learning tools, partially developed by us and described in this
thesis, which allow harnessing the low-dimensional structure of the data.
Chapter 2. introduces Gride, a method that allows estimating the intrinsic
dimension of the data as an explicit function of the scale without performing
any decimation of the data set. Our approach is based on rigorous
distributional results that enable the quantification of uncertainty of the
estimates. Moreover, our method is simple and computationally efficient since
it relies only on the distances among nearest data points. In Chapter 3, we
study the evolution of the probability density across the hidden layers in some
state-of-the-art deep neural networks. We find that the initial layers generate
a unimodal probability density getting rid of any structure irrelevant to
classification. In subsequent layers, density peaks arise in a hierarchical
fashion that mirrors the semantic hierarchy of the concepts. This process
leaves a footprint in the probability density of the output layer, where the
topography of the peaks allows reconstructing the semantic relationships of the
categories. In Chapter 4, we study the problem of generalization in deep neural
networks: adding parameters to a network that interpolates its training data
will typically improve its generalization performance, at odds with the
classical bias-variance trade-off. We show that wide neural networks learn
redundant representations instead of overfitting to spurious correlation and
that redundant neurons appear only if the network is regularized and the
training error is zero.

### [230] [REVE: A Foundation Model for EEG -- Adapting to Any Setup with Large-Scale Pretraining on 25,000 Subjects](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21585)
*Yassine El Ouahidi,Jonathan Lys,Philipp Thölke,Nicolas Farrugia,Bastien Pasdeloup,Vincent Gripon,Karim Jerbi,Giulia Lioi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: REVE is a versatile EEG foundation model with 4D encodings, pretrained on 60k+ hours from 92 datasets, achieving state-of-the-art across 10 EEG tasks and showing strong cross-setup generalization with minimal fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EEG datasets are highly heterogeneous across protocols, devices, and electrode layouts; existing foundation models underperform when generalizing across setups, limiting cross-dataset transfer.

Method: Introduce a 4D positional encoding to handle arbitrary signal length and electrode configurations; use a masked autoencoding objective; pretrain on over 60,000 hours of EEG data from 92 datasets (25,000 subjects).

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art on 10 downstream EEG tasks (motor imagery, seizure detection, sleep staging, cognitive load, emotion recognition); demonstrates strong generalization with little to no fine-tuning and nuanced spatio-temporal modeling.

Conclusion: Release code, pretrained weights, and tutorials to standardize EEG research and accelerate progress in clinical neuroscience.

Abstract: Foundation models have transformed AI by reducing reliance on task-specific
data through large-scale pretraining. While successful in language and vision,
their adoption in EEG has lagged due to the heterogeneity of public datasets,
which are collected under varying protocols, devices, and electrode
configurations. Existing EEG foundation models struggle to generalize across
these variations, often restricting pretraining to a single setup, resulting in
suboptimal performance, in particular under linear probing. We present REVE
(Representation for EEG with Versatile Embeddings), a pretrained model
explicitly designed to generalize across diverse EEG signals. REVE introduces a
novel 4D positional encoding scheme that enables it to process signals of
arbitrary length and electrode arrangement. Using a masked autoencoding
objective, we pretrain REVE on over 60,000 hours of EEG data from 92 datasets
spanning 25,000 subjects, representing the largest EEG pretraining effort to
date. REVE achieves state-of-the-art results on 10 downstream EEG tasks,
including motor imagery classification, seizure detection, sleep staging,
cognitive load estimation, and emotion recognition. With little to no
fine-tuning, it demonstrates strong generalization, and nuanced spatio-temporal
modeling. We release code, pretrained weights, and tutorials to support
standardized EEG research and accelerate progress in clinical neuroscience.

### [231] [Accelerating Data Generation for Nonlinear temporal PDEs via homologous perturbation in solution space](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21592)
*Lei Liu,Zhenxin Huang,Hong Wang,huanshuo dong,Haiyang Xin,Hongwei Zhao,Bin Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HOPSS is a data-generation algorithm that rapidly creates training data for neural operators solving nonlinear temporal PDEs by downsampling base solutions and applying homologous perturbations, reducing data-generation time with preserved accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neural operator models require large numbers of solution/RHS pairs, which are expensive to generate with traditional solvers that involve thousands of time steps. HOPSS aims to reduce data-generation time while maintaining training-appropriate precision.

Method: 1) Start from base solution functions produced by a reliable solver with thousands of time steps. 2) Downsample/temp-align these base solutions to match training time-steps. 3) Generate new data points by homologous perturbation: combine a primary solution with a homologous perturbation term scaled by a small scalar and added random noise. 4) Compute the variation in the original PDE RHS induced by the perturbation to form new solution-RHS pairs.

Result: The approach theoretically and experimentally reduces time complexity for data generation. For the Navier-Stokes equations, it can produce about 10,000 samples in roughly 10% of the time required by traditional methods while maintaining comparable model-training performance.

Conclusion: HOPSS offers faster, dataset-efficient PDE data generation for training neural operators without sacrificing accuracy, thereby alleviating computational and temporal overheads in building data for temporally nonlinear PDEs.

Abstract: Data-driven deep learning methods like neural operators have advanced in
solving nonlinear temporal partial differential equations (PDEs). However,
these methods require large quantities of solution pairs\u2014the solution
functions and right-hand sides (RHS) of the equations. These pairs are
typically generated via traditional numerical methods, which need thousands of
time steps iterations far more than the dozens required for training, creating
heavy computational and temporal overheads. To address these challenges, we
propose a novel data generation algorithm, called HOmologous Perturbation in
Solution Space (HOPSS), which directly generates training datasets with fewer
time steps rather than following the traditional approach of generating large
time steps datasets. This algorithm simultaneously accelerates dataset
generation and preserves the approximate precision required for model training.
Specifically, we first obtain a set of base solution functions from a reliable
solver, usually with thousands of time steps, and then align them in time steps
with training datasets by downsampling. Subsequently, we propose a "homologous
perturbation" approach: by combining two solution functions (one as the primary
function, the other as a homologous perturbation term scaled by a small scalar)
with random noise, we efficiently generate comparable-precision PDE data
points. Finally, using these data points, we compute the variation in the
original equation's RHS to form new solution pairs. Theoretical and
experimental results show HOPSS lowers time complexity. For example, on the
Navier-Stokes equation, it generates 10,000 samples in approximately 10% of
traditional methods' time, with comparable model training performance.

### [232] [SHAP Meets Tensor Networks: Provably Tractable Explanations with Parallelism](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21599)
*Reda Marzouk,Shahaf Bassan,Guy Katz*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Exact SHAP computation for tensor networks (TNs) is tractable under Tensor Train (TT) structure via poly-log parallelism; width drives complexity, not depth, and reductions to binarized nets show efficient SHAP when width is fixed, generalizing to several ML model families.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SHAP explanations areNP-hard for expressive black-box models; TNs offer a broad, expressive representation for neural networks and related models, motivating a study of exact SHAP in this framework to understand tractability and guide practical explanations.

Method: Develop a general framework for provably exact SHAP explanations for general tensor networks (TNs); prove that restricting TNs to Tensor Train (TT) structure yields poly-logarithmic-time SHAP via parallel computation; extend insights to models expressible as TNs (trees, ensembles, linear models, linear RNNs); demonstrate reductions from binarized neural networks to TNs to show tractable SHAP when width is fixed.

Result: For TT-structured TNs, SHAP computation can be performed in poly-logarithmic time with parallelism. This framework generalizes to many other model families through TT expressiveness, tightening existing complexity bounds. Reductions from binarized neural nets to TN representations show SHAP becomes efficiently tractable with fixed width, while constant depth does not remove hardness; width emerges as the primary computational bottleneck.

Conclusion: Width, not depth, is the main determinant of SHAP complexity in these TN-based models. TT-based representations enable provably exact SHAP with favorable poly-log and parallel complexities, and the approach broadens tractability to a wide range of ML models via TN expressiveness.

Abstract: Although Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) can be computed in polynomial
time for simple models like decision trees, they unfortunately become NP-hard
to compute for more expressive black-box models like neural networks - where
generating explanations is often most critical. In this work, we analyze the
problem of computing SHAP explanations for *Tensor Networks (TNs)*, a broader
and more expressive class of models than those for which current exact SHAP
algorithms are known to hold, and which is widely used for neural network
abstraction and compression. First, we introduce a general framework for
computing provably exact SHAP explanations for general TNs with arbitrary
structures. Interestingly, we show that, when TNs are restricted to a *Tensor
Train (TT)* structure, SHAP computation can be performed in *poly-logarithmic*
time using *parallel* computation. Thanks to the expressiveness power of TTs,
this complexity result can be generalized to many other popular ML models such
as decision trees, tree ensembles, linear models, and linear RNNs, therefore
tightening previously reported complexity results for these families of models.
Finally, by leveraging reductions of binarized neural networks to Tensor
Network representations, we demonstrate that SHAP computation can become
*efficiently tractable* when the network's *width* is fixed, while it remains
computationally hard even with constant *depth*. This highlights an important
insight: for this class of models, width - rather than depth - emerges as the
primary computational bottleneck in SHAP computation.

### [233] [Generalised Flow Maps for Few-Step Generative Modelling on Riemannian Manifolds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21608)
*Oscar Davis,Michael S. Albergo,Nicholas M. Boffi,Michael M. Bronstein,Avishek Joey Bose*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes Generalised Flow Maps (GFM) for geometric data on Riemannian manifolds, with three self-distillation variants, unifying Euclidean few-step models, and achieving state-of-the-art results on geometric datasets with fast generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Geometric data on manifolds are widespread, yet current diffusion/flow-based generative models on manifolds are computationally expensive for inference. There is a need for efficient, principled few-step generative models that respect Riemannian geometry.

Method: Extend Flow Map frameworks to arbitrary Riemannian manifolds to create Generalised Flow Maps. Introduce three self-distillation training regimes: Generalised Lagrangian Flow Maps, Generalised Eulerian Flow Maps, and Generalised Progressive Flow Maps. Theoretically connect these to existing Euclidean few-step models (consistency models, shortcut models, meanflows). Evaluate with implicit probability flow for log-likelihoods on geometric datasets (geospatial data, RNA torsion angles, hyperbolic manifolds).

Result: GFMs achieve state-of-the-art sample quality for both single- and few-step generations and offer superior or competitive log-likelihoods across tested geometric domains.

Conclusion: GFMs provide efficient, principled few-step generative modeling on arbitrary Riemannian manifolds, unifying and extending Euclidean methods to the geometric setting with strong empirical performance.

Abstract: Geometric data and purpose-built generative models on them have become
ubiquitous in high-impact deep learning application domains, ranging from
protein backbone generation and computational chemistry to geospatial data.
Current geometric generative models remain computationally expensive at
inference -- requiring many steps of complex numerical simulation -- as they
are derived from dynamical measure transport frameworks such as diffusion and
flow-matching on Riemannian manifolds. In this paper, we propose Generalised
Flow Maps (GFM), a new class of few-step generative models that generalises the
Flow Map framework in Euclidean spaces to arbitrary Riemannian manifolds. We
instantiate GFMs with three self-distillation-based training methods:
Generalised Lagrangian Flow Maps, Generalised Eulerian Flow Maps, and
Generalised Progressive Flow Maps. We theoretically show that GFMs, under
specific design decisions, unify and elevate existing Euclidean few-step
generative models, such as consistency models, shortcut models, and meanflows,
to the Riemannian setting. We benchmark GFMs against other geometric generative
models on a suite of geometric datasets, including geospatial data, RNA torsion
angles, and hyperbolic manifolds, and achieve state-of-the-art sample quality
for single- and few-step evaluations, and superior or competitive
log-likelihoods using the implicit probability flow.

### [234] [Optimal Graph Clustering without Edge Density Signals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21669)
*Maximilien Dreveton,Elaine Siyu Liu,Matthias Grossglauser,Patrick Thiran*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PABM extends SBM/DCBM with separate intra- and inter-cluster popularity, enabling reliable clustering even when edge-density signals vanish; it has a richer spectral structure (rank between k and k^2) requiring embeddings beyond the top-k eigenvectors; empirical results favor k^2-based spectral methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of SBM (uniform degrees) and DCBM (uniform degree corrections within clusters) by introducing distinct popularity parameters for intra- and inter-cluster links, capturing degree heterogeneity that enhances cluster separability.

Method: Theoretically characterize the optimal clustering error rate under PABM; analyze the expected adjacency matrix and show its rank lies between k and k^2; advocate spectral embeddings using the top k^2 eigenvectors; validate with synthetic and real data.

Result: Demonstrates that cluster recovery is possible under PABM even when traditional edge-density signals vanish, provided intra- and inter-cluster popularity coefficients differ; reveals that local connectivity patterns can improve separability; spectral methods using k^2 eigenvectors outperform traditional top-k approaches.

Conclusion: PABM offers a richer modeling framework that captures degree heterogeneity overlooked by DCBM and SBM; standard spectral clustering can fail if it only uses the top-k components, whereas including up to k^2 components yields better performance; motivates new algorithms and theoretical study for clustering under PABM.

Abstract: This paper establishes the theoretical limits of graph clustering under the
Popularity-Adjusted Block Model (PABM), addressing limitations of existing
models. In contrast to the Stochastic Block Model (SBM), which assumes uniform
vertex degrees, and to the Degree-Corrected Block Model (DCBM), which applies
uniform degree corrections across clusters, PABM introduces separate popularity
parameters for intra- and inter-cluster connections. Our main contribution is
the characterization of the optimal error rate for clustering under PABM, which
provides novel insights on clustering hardness: we demonstrate that unlike SBM
and DCBM, cluster recovery remains possible in PABM even when traditional
edge-density signals vanish, provided intra- and inter-cluster popularity
coefficients differ. This highlights a dimension of degree heterogeneity
captured by PABM but overlooked by DCBM: local differences in connectivity
patterns can enhance cluster separability independently of global edge
densities. Finally, because PABM exhibits a richer structure, its expected
adjacency matrix has rank between $k$ and $k^2$, where $k$ is the number of
clusters. As a result, spectral embeddings based on the top $k$ eigenvectors
may fail to capture important structural information. Our numerical experiments
on both synthetic and real datasets confirm that spectral clustering algorithms
incorporating $k^2$ eigenvectors outperform traditional spectral approaches.

### [235] [On Uncertainty Calibration for Equivariant Functions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21691)
*Edward Berman,Jacob Ginesin,Marco Pacini,Robin Walters*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper provides theoretical bounds linking equivariance to uncertainty calibration (ECE/ENCE), shows symmetry mismatch can cause miscalibration in both classification and regression, and supports these findings with experiments on real and simulated data across varying group sizes and uncertainty types.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Data-sparse domains (e.g., robotic manipulation, molecular physics, galaxy morphology) benefit from equivariant networks and uncertainty estimation, but how symmetry relate to model confidence and calibration remains unclear.

Method: Develop a theoretical framework deriving lower and upper bounds on calibration errors (ECE and ENCE) under different equivariance conditions; analyze the impact of symmetry mismatch; perform numerical experiments on real and simulated datasets to study how group size, symmetry mismatch, and aleatoric/epistemic uncertainties affect calibration in both classification and regression.

Result: Established bounds illuminate generalization limits of equivariant models; symmetry mismatch can lead to miscalibration; empirical results reveal trends regarding group size and the balance of aleatoric vs. epistemic uncertainty in calibration.

Conclusion: The work clarifies when equivariant models are well-calibrated and highlights risks of miscalibration due to symmetry mismatch; it links equivariance with uncertainty estimation and provides guidance for designing calibrated, uncertainty-aware equivariant models in data-sparse domains.

Abstract: Data-sparse settings such as robotic manipulation, molecular physics, and
galaxy morphology classification are some of the hardest domains for deep
learning. For these problems, equivariant networks can help improve modeling
across undersampled parts of the input space, and uncertainty estimation can
guard against overconfidence. However, until now, the relationships between
equivariance and model confidence, and more generally equivariance and model
calibration, has yet to be studied. Since traditional classification and
regression error terms show up in the definitions of calibration error, it is
natural to suspect that previous work can be used to help understand the
relationship between equivariance and calibration error. In this work, we
present a theory relating equivariance to uncertainty estimation. By proving
lower and upper bounds on uncertainty calibration errors (ECE and ENCE) under
various equivariance conditions, we elucidate the generalization limits of
equivariant models and illustrate how symmetry mismatch can result in
miscalibration in both classification and regression. We complement our
theoretical framework with numerical experiments that clarify the relationship
between equivariance and uncertainty using a variety of real and simulated
datasets, and we comment on trends with symmetry mismatch, group size, and
aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties.

*Reuben Narad,Leonard Boussioux,Michael Wagner*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A Transformer-based TSP solver's internal representations were probed with sparse autoencoders to reveal interpretable, geometry-aware features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To open the black-box neural TSP solvers by uncovering the geometric heuristics they learn during tour construction, using activation-based interpretability (sparse autoencoders).

Method: Train a pointer network (Transformer-based TSP solver) with reinforcement learning on 100-node TSP instances; fit a sparse autoencoder to the encoder's residual stream to extract an overcomplete dictionary of interpretable features; analyze activations to map features to geometric concepts.

Result: The SAE learned features corresponding to boundary detectors activated by convex-hull nodes, cluster-sensitive features for locally dense regions, and separator features encoding geometric partitions; demonstrates that geometric structure emerges without explicit supervision and provides a model-internal account of computation before node selection.

Conclusion: This work provides the first mechanistic interpretability of neural TSP solvers, showing emergent geometric structure and suggesting pathways to transparent hybrid systems that combine neural efficiency with algorithmic interpretability.

Abstract: Neural networks have advanced combinatorial optimization, with
Transformer-based solvers achieving near-optimal solutions on the Traveling
Salesman Problem (TSP) in milliseconds. However, these models operate as black
boxes, providing no insight into the geometric patterns they learn or the
heuristics they employ during tour construction. We address this opacity by
applying sparse autoencoders (SAEs), a mechanistic interpretability technique,
to a Transformer-based TSP solver, representing the first application of
activation-based interpretability methods to operations research models. We
train a pointer network with reinforcement learning on 100-node instances, then
fit an SAE to the encoder's residual stream to discover an overcomplete
dictionary of interpretable features. Our analysis reveals that the solver
naturally develops features mirroring fundamental TSP concepts: boundary
detectors that activate on convex-hull nodes, cluster-sensitive features
responding to locally dense regions, and separator features encoding geometric
partitions. These findings provide the first model-internal account of what
neural TSP solvers compute before node selection, demonstrate that geometric
structure emerges without explicit supervision, and suggest pathways toward
transparent hybrid systems that combine neural efficiency with algorithmic
interpretability. Interactive feature explorer:

### [237] [Equivariance by Contrast: Identifiable Equivariant Embeddings from Unlabeled Finite Group Actions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21706)
*Tobias Schmidt,Steffen Schneider,Matthias Bethge*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces Equivariance by Contrast (EbC) to learn equivariant latent embeddings from pairwise observations under a finite group action, without group-specific inductive biases, and proves identifiability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To obtain representation spaces where group actions are linear and invertible, using only observation pairs, enabling generalization across diverse groups including non-abelian ones; reduce reliance on handcrafted symmetries.

Method: EbC jointly learns a latent space and a group representation ρ(g) such that observed y and g·y map to latent codes related by invertible linear maps. The model is encoder-only and uses a contrastive objective over observation pairs (y, g·y) to align latent representations via ρ(g); identifiability is proven.

Result: Demonstrates high-fidelity equivariance on infinite dSprites with G = (R_m × Z_n × Z_n) (discrete rotations and periodic translations); validates on non-abelian O(n) and GL(n) in synthetic data; provides a theoretical identifiability proof.

Conclusion: Shows a general-purpose encoder-only framework for equivariant learning from group-action observations across diverse group types, including non-abelian and product groups; points to modeling affine/vision symmetries; notes real-world broad evaluation remains for future work.

Abstract: We propose Equivariance by Contrast (EbC) to learn equivariant embeddings
from observation pairs $(\mathbf{y}, g \cdot \mathbf{y})$, where $g$ is drawn
from a finite group acting on the data. Our method jointly learns a latent
space and a group representation in which group actions correspond to
invertible linear maps -- without relying on group-specific inductive biases.
We validate our approach on the infinite dSprites dataset with structured
transformations defined by the finite group $G:= (R_m \times \mathbb{Z}_n
\times \mathbb{Z}_n)$, combining discrete rotations and periodic translations.
The resulting embeddings exhibit high-fidelity equivariance, with group
operations faithfully reproduced in latent space. On synthetic data, we further
validate the approach on the non-abelian orthogonal group $O(n)$ and the
general linear group $GL(n)$. We also provide a theoretical proof for
identifiability. While broad evaluation across diverse group types on
real-world data remains future work, our results constitute the first
successful demonstration of general-purpose encoder-only equivariant learning
from group action observations alone, including non-trivial non-abelian groups
and a product group motivated by modeling affine equivariances in computer
vision.
